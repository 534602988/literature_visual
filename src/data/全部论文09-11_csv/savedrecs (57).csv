It concludes that the price of gas in most MENA countries is substantially below its economic cost, resulting in wasteful use of gas and electricity, deployment of inefficient technologies, and huge burden on government budgets. The low gas price also causes a bias in favor of gas export projects while at the same time reduces investors' interest in the upstream and downstream gas sector. The implications are most interesting about four countries - Algeria, Qatar, Egypt and Iran - where each country has to revisit its gas allocation policy and where each government is trying to de-link investors' interest from domestic gas prices.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Razavi, H (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",hrazavi@worldbank.org,,,,,,,41,6,6,0,8,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,30.0,3,,,,,1,22,,,,,,22,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,464NN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267511900001,0

A slang term used to describe an individual who manages to do well financially, relative to broader population, during a recession is recession rich, for instance. Someone that is recession rich does not necessarily need to be considered wealthy, but rather has managed to maintain a good standard of living during a time when others worry about their financial stability. The term recessionship is a slang term used to describe an intimate relationship that forms during a recession. People in a recessionship usually meet after losing their jobs or after incurring some sort of financial hardship. Another term is recessionista this means a person who is able to remain stylish during times of economic hardship. A recessionista can shop on a limited budget and still manage to be up to date on the most current fashions. A recessionista does not let a bad economy, inflation, or a strong recession damage his or her wardrobe and opts to search for sales and shop at thrifty discount stores instead.

Therefore the figures in supply and use tables and symmetric input-output tables will be influenced by capital services for non-market producers because the current concept, when net operating surplus of other non-market producers equals zero would be changed.","[Sixta, Jaroslav; Fischer, Jakub] Dept Econ Stat, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",,"Sixta, J (通讯作者)，Dept Econ Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",sixta@vse.cz; fischerj@vse.cz,"Sixta, Jaroslav/J-9828-2014; Fischer, Jakub/J-7874-2012","Fischer, Jakub/0000-0003-4658-1974",,,,,7,0,0,0,2,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA & PRAZE,PRAHA 3,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAHA 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-1600-4,,,,2009,,,,,,,149,157,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD3EF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000359516700012,0

I construct two new measures of imported products subject to the combined use of these TTBs before applying these measures to new data drawn from the World Banks Temporary Trade Barriers Database. I then establish a number of facts regarding trends in historical use to benchmark against policy activity during the global economic crisis of 200809. The 200809 economic shock mostly accentuates patterns and trends already visible in the precrisis data: e.g., while the major users of such policies overall combined to increase the product lines subject to TTBs by 25 per cent during the crisis, this was driven almost entirely by developing economies which increased their product coverage by 40 per cent. Perhaps surprisingly, recession-affected high-income economies increased their stock of product coverage by only 5 per cent during the crisis, a muted policy response consistent with earlier trends in which major developed economies like the United States and EU reduced the stock of imported products they subject to TTBs to 2007 levels that were only 50 per cent as high as their within-period peak. Furthermore, a previously unidentified feature of the data is that a much larger share of Chinas exported products to other developing economies is subject to foreign-imposed antidumping than its exports to developed economies. The evidence confirms this feature is shared by a number of other major developing economy exporters, deepening concern that these discriminatory trade barriers are increasingly a SouthSouth phenomenon. Finally, I also clarify emerging trends in countervailing duty (anti-subsidy) use across countries.","World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Trade & Int Integrat DECTI, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Trade & Int Integrat DECTI, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,"Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857",,,,,38,77,89,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2011,34.0,12,,,SI,,1955,1998,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01388.x,0.0,,,44,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,866AU,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298352800001,0

We find that in the case of Malaysia trade has been liberalised and subjected to structural changes to a very high extent over the last three decades. However, reform has been less effective when it comes to trade-related policies such as investment policies and other national policies that de facto rather than de jure affect competition due to differential treatment of different firms, brands and individuals. This is also mirrored in the faltering levels of investment in Malaysia. An area where Malaysia has been successful is the reorientation towards services. A good example is the tourism industry which is mature and a major export industry in Malaysia today. Nascent service industries such as health, finance, ICT related services and education hold promise to become important export earners in the future. The paper shows that for this new phase of structural change to be truly successful Malaysia must prioritise trade negotiations and integration with her own region and especially ASEAN.","[Jensen, Camilla; Kara, Nasra] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Semenyih, Malaysia",University of Nottingham Malaysia,"Jensen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Semenyih, Malaysia.",,"KARA, NASRA/JGE-2517-2023; Jensen, Camilla/B-5568-2008","Jensen, Camilla/0000-0002-4367-2638",,,,,21,4,5,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2011,34.0,12,,,SI,,2063,2080,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01409.x,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,866AU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298352800005,0

In a first step, we develop a multi-region multi-industry economic geography model under Cournot competition, of which we estimate the parameter values from French data. We then turn to simulations to see whether a core-periphery equilibrium exists, even with strategic interactions among firms. We show that the marginal profits and mark-ups of firms are greater in both core and peripheral regions than in between, due to a subtle interplay between competition and market-access forces. Production is mostly monocentric, however, and profits are higher in the core, which should produce further concentration. We finally show that policy-makers face a difficult trade-off: lowering inter-regional trade costs reduces disparities between regions, but increases intra-regional inequality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The evolution of bilateral service trade in each of these markets indicates that travel and tourism within continents plays an important role in 36 countries. The study first employs the Breusch Pagan LM (Lagrange multiplier) test, the Hausman test and the Hausman Taylor over-identification test to choose the appropriate empirical method. The empirical results reveal that the supply pull effect from parent countries (the economic size of tourist origins) plays an important role in improving the tourism service exports of the various destinations. In addition, the home countries' exports of travel services are inelastic to the appreciation of their own currencies. Moreover, distribution infrastructures and the adjacency and RTA (ASEAN) dummies are found to have significantly positive contributions in terms of enhancing Asian tourism service exports, whereas the European Union (EU) and NAFTA discourage European and North American tourism exports, respectively.","[Chang, Shun-Chiao] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Lai, Fav-Tsoin] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Puli, Taiwan",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology; National Chi Nan University,"Chang, SC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm, 43 Sec 4,Keelung Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",scchang@ba.ntust.edu.tw; ftlai@ncnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,56,4,7,2,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Our study allows us to enhance the studies of Amiel and Cowell (Empir Econ 22:571-588, 1997; The distribution of welfare & household production. International perspectives, 1998) in a variety of directions. We find that the support for Weak Monotonicity crucially depends on whether the poor income rises or falls and the (generally low) agreement with Regressive Transfer is even lower if the recipient is lifted out of poverty as a consequence of the transfer. Further, the support for a certain poverty axiom can significantly differ according to the characteristics of the income distributions to be compared, as is the case for Population Replication and Poverty Growth when, respectively, the society to be replicated and the poor person added to society are very poor ones. Our results also suggest a certain concern for the poorest in society and cast doubts on the desirability of continuity at the poverty line. Finally, notable heterogeneity emerges across relevant subgroups. Poverty perceptions are significantly different for students living in high- and low-income countries: the latter more strongly support Weak Monotonicity and Regressive Transfer, unveiling a more pronounced sensitivity to lower levels of poor incomes. Interesting differences, though less marked, are also found between the views of economics students and those of their colleagues from other disciplines.","[Esposito, Lucio] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Majorano, Francesca] United Nations World Food Program, Kathmandu, Nepal",University of East Anglia,"Esposito, L (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",lucio.esposito@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The paper introduces a 'multilevel causality analysis' and 'multiple causal path analysis' to elucidate the structure and mechanism of the causal relationship between tourism and trade flows.","Seoul Dev Inst, Metropolitan Res Grp, Seoul, South Korea",,"Keum, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Dev Inst, Metropolitan Res Grp, 391 Seocho Dong, Seoul, South Korea.",kykeum@sdi.re.kr,,,,,,,14,11,13,6,41,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Although the bias has been replicated several times, some doubts remain about its economic significance. Our two experiments show that the bias disappears once order effects are excluded, and once salient and dominant incentives are provided. This holds true for both choice and valuation tasks. Also, adding context to the decision problem does not alter this finding. No ratio bias could be found in between-subject tests either, which leads us to the conclusion that the policy relevance of the phenomenon is doubtful at best.","[Vieider, Ferdinand M.; Villeval, Marie Claire] CNRS, GATE, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Lefebvre, Mathieu] Univ Liege, CREPP, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Vieider, Ferdinand M.; Villeval, Marie Claire] Univ Lyon 2, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Vieider, Ferdinand M.] DIW Berlin, Climate Policy Initiat, D-10108 Berlin, Germany; [Villeval, Marie Claire] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Villeval, Marie Claire] CCP, Aarhus, Denmark",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; University of Liege; Universite Lyon 2; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Aarhus University,"Vieider, FM (通讯作者)，CNRS, GATE, Chemin Mouilles, F-69130 Ecully, France.",Mathieu.Lefebvre@ulg.ac.be; vieider@gate.cnrs.fr; villeval@gate.cnrs.fr,"; Villeval, Marie Claire/H-7773-2017","Lefebvre, Mathieu/0000-0002-7536-8323; Villeval, Marie Claire/0000-0001-8578-5449",,,,,51,13,14,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2011,71.0,4,,,,,615,641,,10.1007/s11238-010-9212-9,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,823ZW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295169100010,0

As in Lee and Liu (2006a), we assume that the inner matrices in the quadratic forms have zero diagonal elements to robustify moments against unknown heteroskedasticity. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the GMM estimator based on such conditions.

It does two things: First, it proposes an analysis framework that defines four types of information delivered from a transit map: distortion, restoration, codification, and cognition. It then considers the potential impact of this information on three types of travel decisions: location, mode, and path choices.(1) Second, it conducts an empirical analysis to explore the impact of the famous London tube map on passengers' path choice in the London Underground (LUL). Using data collected by LUL from 1998 to 2005, the paper develops a path choice model and compares the influence between the distorted tube map (map distance) and reality (travel time) on passengers' path choice behavior. Results show that the elasticity of the map distance is twice that of the travel time, which suggests that passengers often trust the tube map more than their own travel experience on deciding the best travel path. This is true even for the most experienced passengers using the system. The codification of transfer connections on the tube map, either as a simple dot or as an extended link, could affect passengers' transfer decisions. The implications to transit operation and planning, such as trip assignments, overcrowding mitigation, and the deployment of Advanced Transit Information System (ATIS), are also discussed.

Since 1994 however, living wage ordinances have emerged as an alternative response to labor market polarization in urban areas. However, these laws raise labor costs for employers and may thus reduce economic growth. This article advances the empirical literature on living wage impacts through the use of a novel data set-the National Establishment Time Series-to track employment and establishment growth at the city level among directly affected employers (e.g., government contractors), as well as other establishments that may be indirectly signaled by a change in the local political environment. Using panel regression models that account for structural differences between living wage and non-living wage cities, this article finds that living wage laws have no significant impact on employment or establishment growth. Additionally, this article finds no evidence that living wage laws signal businesses about a potentially harmful change in the local business climate.","Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Lester, TW (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, 320 New E, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",twlester@unc.edu,,"Lester, T.

The charges are revised every three months and thus induce regular motorists to re-think their travel decisions. ERP traffic data, captured by the system, provides a valuable source of information for studying motorists' travel behaviour. This paper proposes a new modelling methodology for using these data to forecast short-term impacts of rate adjustment on peak period traffic volumes. Separate models are developed for different categories of vehicles which are segmented according to their demand elasticity with respect to road pricing. A method is proposed for estimating the maximum likelihood value of preferred arrival time (PAT) for each vehicle's arrivals at a particular ERP gantry under different charging conditions. Iterative procedures are used in both model calibration and application. The proposed approach was tested using traffic datasets recorded in 2003 at a gantry located on Singapore's Central Expressway (CTE). The model calibration and validation show satisfactory results.

Contrary to this standard result, I find that when the interaction between the asset owner and the encroacher is infinitely repeated and the encroacher has some bargaining power over the size of the transfer from the asset owner to him, then there is a cooperative equilibrium in which the asset owner finds it optimal to overinvest in the asset when property rights are incomplete relative to the first-best level of investment when property rights are complete. Overinvestment is used to induce cooperation. However, this result depends on the encroacher's bargaining power or, more generally, whether the transfer is an increasing function of investment.","[Amegashie, J.

Markets for illiquid assets tend to display certain characteristics: for example, significant time-till-sale and correlation in the rates of return over time. More importantly, as the liquidity of a market cannot be an issue if an investor never needs to liquidate an asset, we focus on how the liquidity of a market interacts with an individual's uncertain need to liquidate. We show that the optimal strategy is state contingent, if possible. We also show that the penalty associated with an illiquid investment depends on the characteristics of other assets being held in the portfolio, on the characteristics of liquidity shocks and on the interaction between time and behavior. We show that borrowing to pay for a liquidity shock cannot overcome all of the costs of owning an illiquid asset. In contrast, borrowing at t = 0 benefits from the complementarity in the assets. In a simpler model, we show that the portfolio perspective makes illiquid assets more valuable to an investor with a longer time horizon.","[Anglin, Paul M.] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Gao, Yanmin] Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Alberta,"Anglin, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",panglin@uoguelph.ca; yanmin.gao@ualberta.ca,,"Gao, Yanmin/0000-0003-4686-1781",,,,,45,17,17,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2011,39.0,2,,,,,277,311,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00291.x,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,768TV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290962200004,0

Social comparisons arise from exchanges of information among individuals. We postulate that the social gap resulting from comparisons is a determinant of comparative happiness (i.e. happiness arising from comparisons), which in turn affects subsequent behavior. We develop a modeling framework based on the Hybrid Choice Model that captures the indirect effect of social comparisons on travel choices through its effect on comparative happiness. We present an empirical analysis of one component of this framework. Specifically, we study how perceived differences between experienced commute attributes and those communicated by others affect comparative happiness and consequently overall commute satisfaction. We find that greater comparative happiness arising from favorable comparisons of one's commute to that of others (e.g. shorter commute time than others, same mode as others for car commuters, and different mode than others for non-motorized commuters) increases overall commute satisfaction or utility. The empirical model develops only the link between social comparisons and happiness in the comparisons-happiness-behavior chain. It is anticipated that the theoretical framework that considers the entire chain will enhance the behavioral realism of black box models that do not account for happiness in the link between comparisons and behavior.

We argue that in the context of predicting excess returns, valid augmenting variables exist and are likely to yield substantial gains in estimation efficiency and, hence, predictive accuracy. The proposed augmenting variables are ex post measures of an unforecastable component of excess returns: ex post errors from macroeconomic survey forecasts, the surprise components of asset price movements around macroeconomic news announcements, or even the weather. These surprises cannot be used directly in forecasting they are not observed at the time that the forecast is made but can nonetheless improve forecasting accuracy by reducing parameter estimation uncertainty. We derive formal results about the benefits and limits of this approach and apply it to standard examples of forecasting excess bond and equity returns. We find substantial improvements in out-of-sample forecast accuracy for standard excess bond return regressions; gains for forecasting excess stock returns are much smaller.","[Faust, Jon; Wright, Jonathan H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Faust, J (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,,,,,,,32,7,8,1,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

During the current financial crisis, some countries such as China and India may have a V-shaped recovery; others such as the UK and the US may have a U-shaped recovery.

However, in this article we demonstrate that by restricting to zero the instantaneous response of expected inflation to an interest rate shock, one can identify a disturbance that economic agents, according to the Fisherian framework, should evaluate as transitory. An important implication of this result is that short-term nominal interest rates cannot be interpreted as predictors, at least not long-run predictors, of inflation.

These farms are not only located in the pen-urban areas surrounding Tunis and the Cap bon and Bizerte regions but also in central and southern (coastline) Tunisia. The development of these activities into new areas with limited forage resources is encouraged by the government through aid programmes, that support and promote the whole chain, and also by new service cooperatives, milk collection centres and milk industries. The main goal is to satisfy the increasing demand for milk and milk-derivatives in the urban and tourist areas. Dairy farms in the new areas have allowed to diversify the farming activities and to ensure a constant source of income for farmers and their families. However, despite satisfactory organisational and financial performances, this sector is still fragile and linked to external sectors (mainly food supply). Its sustainability results from various constraints such as the availability or lack of self-produced forage, the increase of prices and the inconsistent supply of roughages and concentrates in the market.","[Hammami, Mohamed; Soltani, Elmi; Bouraqui, Rachid] Ecole Super Agr Mateur, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage,"Hammami, M (通讯作者)，Ecole Super Agr Mateur, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,3,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2011,10.0,1,,,,,58,64,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,742HB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288930800008,0

It is found that the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle exists in a weaker form. Structural break tests indicated that there was a break in the mid-1970s or in the early 1990s. These break dates seem to capture the effects of the last decade of the Bretton Woods agreement and the early years of the Maastricht agreement. In the post-break periods, this relationship is weaker and the saving retention coefficient has declined, implying that capital mobility has increased between these OECD countries. It is likely that these two agreements may have decreased investor uncertainty and improved capital mobility. However, this conclusion should be interpreted cautiously because alternative explanations for the observed correlation between the saving-investment ratios are possible. For example, Byrne et al. (2009) have argued that the observed correlation between investment-saving ratios could be due to common global factors and therefore may not be useful for testing whether capital mobility has decreased or increased.","[Kumar, Saten] Auckland Univ Technol, Auckland, New Zealand; [Rao, B.

The needed common identity and problem definition was lacking because of two important impediments: each hotel cleaner had to perform her work alone and there were few other opportunities to meet and discuss conditions; and they were divided into ethnic cliques with close to no communication between them.

It estimates both a static and a dynamic relationship and applies estimators for homogeneous and heterogeneous panel data. Thereby, it examines the extent to which conclusions of panel data studies on the determinants of international reserve holdings are robust to the inclusion of dynamics as well as to the consideration of heterogeneity across countries. The results show that the neglect of dynamics and heterogeneity in country behaviour may lead to misleading inferences. Independently of the chosen estimation method, the findings suggest that trade openness and external debt are robust determinants of the level of reserves. Central banks take precautionary measures against the downside of the increasing international economic integration.","Univ Osnabruck, Inst Empir Econ Res, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany",University Osnabruck,"Steiner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Osnabruck, Inst Empir Econ Res, Rolandstr 8, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany.",asteiner@uni-osnabrueck.de,,"Steiner, Andreas/0000-0001-9272-3262",,,,,28,2,2,0,3,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

But, while some of these presidents have acted aggressively towards multinational owners, as a group their policies have not differed greatly from non-leftists facing similar circumstances. To test our hypothesis, we provide a detailed three-variable coding of every Mexican and South American president (for all countries with oil resources), as well as a coding of their policies towards the hydrocarbons industry. The historical review shows that political leaders from all sides of the ideological spectrum have advocated, pursued, or sustained nationalizations, and thus there is no clear relation between these political labels and nationalization policies. An examination of two alternative hypotheses - timing and starting point - finds that while nationalizations and privatizations do come in bunches, the hydrocarbon policy and economic circumstances that presidents inherit are more likely to determine the policy that they pursue.","[Berrios, Ruben] Lock Haven Univ Penn, Dept Econ Hist & Polit Sci, Lock Haven, PA 17745 USA; [Marak, Andrae] Calif Univ Penn, Dept Hist & Polit Sci, California, PA USA; [Morgenstern, Scott] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Polit Sci, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Lock Haven University; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); California University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Berrios, R (通讯作者)，Lock Haven Univ Penn, Dept Econ Hist & Polit Sci, Lock Haven, PA 17745 USA.",,"Morgenstern, Scott/H-7747-2015","Morgenstern, Scott/0000-0001-7258-8657",,,,,30,35,39,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

However, he was perceived as an anti-Keynesian economist by a substantial part of the profession. The present essay discusses why was that so, based on an investigation of the central message of Patinkin's theoretical framework and on unpublished archive material. Frankly, I have never been able to understand why my Money, Interest, and Prices was regarded in some circles as an anti-Keynesian work. I have always regarded it as a work that strengthened the Keynesian view by diverting attention from the pointless semantic issue of whether there could or could not exist a situation of unemployment equilibrium, to the real question of the efficacy of price flexibility in restoring full employment.

The extent of transatlantic convergence depends largely on the role of two domestic actors involved in the merger review process: regulators and firms. This article employs two competing approaches (principal-agent and regulatory capture) to assess the ways in which these actors and domestic institutions shape convergence in transatlantic merger review. Empirically, the article investigates the work of the EU-US Mergers Working Group and explores the extent to which it conforms more closely to the preferences of regulators or merging firms. By increasing procedural convergence over information exchanges, the competition regulators increase the likelihood of convergence in substantive decisions, which reduces the likelihood of intervention by political principals. The findings suggest that regulators have used their discretionary authority to overcome domestic political and legal institutions that obstruct information sharing and have reduced the information asymmetry traditionally enjoyed by merging firms. As a result, it is the regulatory agents who have shaped the convergent process via their discretionary authority and captured the merging firms to serve their regulatory interests.","Univ Edinburgh, Europa Inst, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Damro, C (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Europa Inst, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,,,,,70,4,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Most recently tropical race 4 of Fusarium wilt has destroyed in excess of 20,000 ha of Cavendish bananas in China and it threatens the huge export industry of the Philippines. Resistant cultivars are often touted as the solution to banana disease problems, including the wilts. However, resistant cultivars must be part of an integrated disease management programme to maximise the chances of their deployment being successful in combating banana wilts. Experience has also shown that gaining marketplace acceptance of replacements for susceptible cultivars is far from a simple matter, and that cultivars resistant to wilts will likely have their own set of pest and disease problems.

Targets for banana breeding can be divided into five different groups: productivity characters, abiotic stress resistance, biotic stress resistance, post-harvest characters and those related to markets. Yield is a key characteristic selected by breeders and used by farmers, while biotic and abiotic stresses cause major yield losses and unstable production from year to year. Musa genomics has developed rapidly since 2000, with the Global Musa Genomics Consortium coordinating research on the genomics of banana, aiming to assure the sustainability of banana as a staple food crop by an integrated genetic and genomic understanding. In the 21st century, crop improvement has accelerated by the use of genetic maps and DNA markers to identify useful genes, combine desirable traits or resistance genes and accelerate selection, but the difficulty of working with the sterile, triploid banana crop means these approaches have not been used as extensively as in other crops. Now, knowledge of genomics and understanding of crop design allows superdomestication, involving interactions of breeders and genomic scientists to design the characteristics required from a banana cultivar and consider how to produce this ideal cultivar - how to find and evaluate the genes responsible for particular traits, and how to bring them together in a new cultivar. Superdomestication allows definition of a cultivar with a suite of ideal characters ranging from biotic and abiotic stress resistance, through yield, to post-harvest and nutritional quality - many being quantitative trait loci with changing patterns of expression depending on conditions. Collections of germplasm underpin the search for desirable traits, requiring measuring, finding and conserving biodiversity. The combination of expertise with exploitation of the genepool and use of genomic sciences opens a new range of opportunities for the future, requiring further development of Musa genomics.","Univ Leicester, Dept Biol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Heslop-Harrison, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Biol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",,"Heslop-Harrison, J.S./M-9826-2019; Heslop-Harrison, JS/C-9207-2009","Heslop-Harrison, JS/0000-0002-3105-2167",,,,,33,9,12,0,17,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,55,62,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200004,0

They provide the staple diet for millions people in tropical and subtropical countries. Unfortunately, banana production is threatened by many diseases and pests. Edible banana cultivars are seed-sterile, vegetatively propagated crops, which complicates traditional breeding. Despite the relatively small genome (1C = 550-650 Mbp), the structure and organisation of the banana nuclear genome and genetic diversity of Musa is still largely unknown. In this review, we focus on the repetitive part of the banana genome. Although repeats have been called junk or selfish DNA, at least some of the repeats have well defined functions. Repeats are ubiquitous, can evolve more rapidly than genic sequences in the genome and are frequently used for developing molecular markers. Characterisation of species-specific repeats and the creation of a banana repeat database would be useful for repeat identification and repeat masking during the sequencing project. Moreover, the knowledge of banana repetitive elements, especially satellite DNA and genome-specific repeats, could be useful for identification of individual chromosomes or different genomes in banana interspecific hybrids.","[Hribova, E.; Dolezel, J.] Inst Expt Bot, Lab Mol Cytogenet & Cytometry, Olomouc, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Experimental Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Hribová, E (通讯作者)，Inst Expt Bot, Lab Mol Cytogenet & Cytometry, Olomouc, Czech Republic.",,"hribova, eva/F-7291-2014; Dolezel, Jaroslav/B-7716-2008","Dolezel, Jaroslav/0000-0002-6263-0492; Hribova, Eva/0000-0002-6868-4344",,,,,42,2,2,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,63,68,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200005,0

In order to study in more depth the dynamic attributes of this puzzle, we suggest a quite different framework where the primary goal is to explore the association between their underlying dynamics. Through the use of the Recurrence Quantification Analysis (Webber and Zbilut (1994)), the test for structural breaks of Bai and Perron (1998) and the test for nonlinear causality of Diks and Panchenko (2006), we find evidence in favour of negative nonlinear linkages between the inherent dynamics of inflation and stock returns.

In order to identify putative sources of resistance, a cultivar screening trial comprising 40 Musa genotypes was established in March 2007 at the ISABU Mparambo research station in northwestern Burundi (893 m a.s.l.). Dessert bananas (AAA group), East African highland bananas (AAA, EAHB), plantains (AAB), cooking bananas (ABB), a tetraploid hybrid and wild diploid bananas (Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana) were assessed. Ten plants per genotype were planted in a completely randomised design with border rows consisting of BBTV-infected 'Yangambi Km 5' (AAA) plants. Colonies of Pentalonia nigronervosa collected in BBTV-infected fields were released in the plot to enhance disease spread. Twenty-eight months after trial establishment, 32 genotypes have shown typical banana bunchy top symptoms. The first symptoms appeared 80 days after trial establishment on 'Yangambi Km 5'. Twenty-eight months after trial establishment, only eight genotypes [Musa balbisiana type Tani (BB), 'Kayinja' (ABB), 'FHIA-03' (AABB), 'Prata' (AAB), 'Gisandugu' (ABB), 'Pisang Awak' (ABB), 'Saba' (ABB) and 'Highgate' (AAA, Gros Michel subgroup)] have not manifested typical disease symptoms on any of the ten plants per genotype. Plant samples taken from these visibly healthy cultivars and analysed at a molecular level [at the Faculte Universitaire des Sciences Agronomiques de Gembloux (FUSAGx) in Belgium] indicated the presence of the virus in 'Pisang Awak', 'Saba' and 'Highgate'. These genotypes can be considered as BBTD tolerant. They could potentially act as a reservoir for the virus. Further diagnostic tests will be carried out on the five BBTV-free genotypes to confirm the extent of latent infections. Preliminary results indicate that genotypes with one or two B genomes tend to be more tolerant to BBTD.","[Niyongere, C.] Inst Sci Agron Burundi ISABU, Bujumbura, Burundi",,"Niyongere, C (通讯作者)，Inst Sci Agron Burundi ISABU, POB 795, Bujumbura, Burundi.",,,,,,,,21,12,13,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,439,447,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2011.897.60,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200060,0

Threshold type nonlinearites are introduced by allowing past cyclical unemployment to have a different impact on the natural rate depending on the regime of the economy. The impact of lagged cyclical shocks on the current natural component is the measure of hysteresis. To derive an appropriate p-value for a test for hysteresis two alternative bootstrap algorithms are proposed: the first is valid under homoskedastic errors and the second allows for heteroskedasticity of unknown form. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows the good performance of both bootstrap algorithms. The bootstrap testing procedure is applied to data from Italy, France and the United States.

As an unintended consequence of its institutional setup, the tax regime, which originally only dealt with double tax avoidance, produces harmful tax competition. Despite this negative effect there are only incremental and partial changes of the regime, which are insufficient to curb tax competition. I argue that this development can be explained by considering the properties - and the sequence in which they come up - of the collective action problems inherent in double tax avoidance and tax competition. First, in double tax avoidance, a coordination game with a distributive conflict, governments did not want to endanger the solution they had institutionalized long before tax competition became virulent. Second, governments are unable to resolve the emergent asymmetric prisoner's dilemma of tax competition due to conflicts of interest among big and small country governments and successful lobbying of corporate capital. As a result, the institutional trajectory is characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of stability in the core principles and indirect and incremental changes of the rules in the form of rule stretching and layering.","Social Sci Res Ctr Berlin, Berlin, Germany",,"Rixen, T (通讯作者)，Social Sci Res Ctr Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",,"Rixen, Thomas/I-6074-2016; Rixen, Thomas/AAZ-4571-2020","Rixen, Thomas/0000-0001-8777-5949; Rixen, Thomas/0000-0001-8777-5949",,,,,88,57,64,2,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Use of quality planting material is very important for increasing productivity. Though conventional suckers are still the primary planting material, use of tissue-culture plants has increased because of their advantages, like more uniform bunches with even maturity and increased yield. However, banana viral pathogens, which are economically important in India, can be inadvertently spread through tissue-culture plants. In order to control the spread of the viruses, virus-indexing techniques were developed at the National Research Centre for Banana, Tiruchirapalli for early detection in mother plants and tissue-culture plants used for mass propagation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), non-radioactive probe-based nucleic acid spot hybridisation (NASH) and enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) based techniques were developed and validated for routine testing. PCR and NASH tests are being done for detection of Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) and Banana streak Mysore virus (BSMysV). RT-PCR and ELISA tests are being done for the detection of Banana bract mosaic virus (BBrMV) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Based on the work done at the centre, the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India, has accredited the Molecular Virology lab for testing for banana viruses in the country. In total, 15,850 tissue-culture and mother-plant samples were tested against viruses. The percentage of positive plants for BBTV, BSMysV, CMV and BBrMV were 3.83, 2.85, 17.3 and 0.95% respectively. Indexing was done mostly for the cultivars 'Grande Naine' (AAA, Cavendish subgroup), 'Robusta' (AAA, Cavendish subgroup) and 'Hill Banana' (syn. 'Virupakshi', AAB, Pome subgroup). Around 25 tissue-culture banana commercial laboratories are undertaking the services of virus testing.

We explicitly model pension obligations as being subject to interest and inflation risk to analyze the ability of real estate investments in hedging the fair value of pension liabilities and to quantify its role in an asset liability management (ALM) portfolio. We find that the portfolio composition differs depending on the definition of liability return. When liability returns solely follow actuarial changes, the mean-variance efficient portfolio allocations toward direct real estate and fixed income decrease compared to the asset-only optimization. When accounting for nominal liability obligations, real estate offers hedging benefits against interest rates for short holding periods but not for long-term institutional portfolios. The inclusion of inflation risk renders a limited role for direct real estate in an ALM portfolio, while indirect real estate obtains no allocation. Inflation is at the heart of the discrepancy between reported and predicted pension plan allocations.

We find evidence of momentum in house price growth (relative to growth in rents) away from the underlying fundamentals throughout the 1980-2005 period; however, momentum increased after 1999. We find that the bubble happened mostly after 2003; it was for a relatively short period and was characterized by a series of positive, seemingly random, shocks that were associated with the surge in the subprime market and the decline in short-term interest rates. Before that price changes were reasonably well explained by the fundamentals, particularly the decline in long-term interest rates in the early part of the bubble period. We do not find evidence of a tendency for prices relative to rents to revert to a long-run trend.","[Lai, Rose N.] Univ Macau, Dept Finance & Business Econ, Macao, Peoples R China; [Van Order, Robert A.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Van Order, Robert A.] Univ Aberdeen, Old Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland",University of Macau; George Washington University; University of Aberdeen,"Lai, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Dept Finance & Business Econ, Macao, Peoples R China.",roselai@umac.mo; rvo@gwu.edu,"Lai, Rose Neng/AAM-6930-2020","Lai, Rose Neng/0000-0003-3686-2596",,,,,27,52,64,2,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2010,38.0,4,,,,,753,773,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00282.x,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,682VN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284431200006,0

In particular, we assess whether the Italian regional unemployment rates contain a unit root and are, thus, subject to pure hysteresis, considering as alternative hypotheses both a linear and a non-linear stationary process. For that purpose, we employ three recently developed panel unit-root tests, taking account of structural breaks, cross-section dependence and non-linearities. Contrary to previous studies in the literature, our results reject the pure hysteresis hypothesis and support the characterisation of regional unemployment in Italy as a stationary but non-linear process, subject to multiple equilibria, in line with the 'structuralist hypothesis' advanced by Phelps (1994).","Univ Messina, Dipartimento Econ Stat Matemat & Sociol, I-98122 Messina, Italy",University of Messina,"Lanzafame, M (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, Dipartimento Econ Stat Matemat & Sociol, Via T Cannizzaro 278, I-98122 Messina, Italy.",mlanzafame@unime.it,"Lanzafame, Matteo/T-4799-2019","Lanzafame, Matteo/0000-0003-0737-3005",,,,,58,16,17,0,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

They can impose costs on exporters as it may be necessary to adapt products for specific markets (cost effect). In contrast, standards can reduce exporters' information costs as they convey information on product characteristics (informational effect). Using a new World Bank database of European standards for electronic products, we examine the net impact of internationally harmonised European standards on European Union imports. We find that European Union standards for electronic products that are harmonised to international standards have a significant and a positive net effect on trade. The results suggest that efforts to promote trade in electronic products could be complemented by steps to promote standards harmonisation.

We generalise existing literature on spatial price-quality competition along several dimensions, including utility functions that are non-linear in income and cost functions that are non-separable in output and quality. Our main message is that the scope for a positive relationship between competition and quality is underestimated in the existing literature. If we allow for income effects by assuming that utility is strictly concave in income, we find that lower transportation costs always lead to higher quality. The presence of income effects might also reverse a previously reported negative relationship between the number of firms and equilibrium quality. This reversal result is further strengthened if there are cost substitutabilities between output and quality. Equilibrium quality provision is always less than socially optimal in the presence of income effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We apply additive mixed regression models (AMM) to estimate hedonic price equations for rents in Vienna. Non-linear effects of continuous covariates as well as a smooth time trend are modeled non-parametrically through P-splines. Unobserved district-specific heterogeneity is modeled in two ways: First, by location specific intercepts with the postal code serving as a location variable. Second, in order to permit spatial variation in the nonlinear price gradients, we introduce multiplicative scaling factors for nonlinear covariates. This allows highly nonlinear implicit price functions to vary within a regularized framework, accounting for district-specific spatial heterogeneity, which leads to a considerable improvement of model quality and predictive power. Our findings provide insight into the spatially heterogeneous structure of price gradients in Vienna, showing substantial spatial variation. Accounting for spatial heterogeneity in a very general way, this approach permits higher accuracy in prediction and allows for location-specific nonlinear rent index construction.","[Brunauer, W.

Establishments in metropolitan areas with population above two million use a more skill intensive mix of workers than comparable establishments in metropolitan areas with population below one million. The differences in skill intensity are not the same in all industries; establishments in relatively skill intensive industries are even more skill intensive in large MSAs.

The policy's goal was to foster innovation and regional competitiveness by stimulating cooperation. Using difference-in-difference-in-differences estimates, we find for different innovation measures that the cluster-oriented policy increased the likelihood of becoming an innovator in the target industries by 4.6 to 5.7 percentage points. At the same time, R&D expenditures decreased by 19.4% on average for firms in target industries, while access to external know-how, cooperation with public scientific institutes, and the availability of suitable R&D personnel increased.

Approaching this tension as symptomatic of a deep-rooted contradiction between integration and mobility that is constitutive of modern social formations, this article develops a political sociology of mobility that challenges territorial and culturalist accounts of European citizenship. It does so by exploring the political enactment of European citizenship by marginalized subjects, whose engagement in relations of exchange serves as the ground for acts of European citizenship that 'mobilize mobility'. This is illustrated by an analysis of the 2005 Declaration for the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe.","[Squire, Vicki] Open Univ, POLIS, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",Open University - UK,"Squire, V (通讯作者)，Open Univ, POLIS, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",v.j.squire@open.ac.uk,,"Aradau, Claudia/0000-0003-2010-9006",,,,,56,64,65,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We developed a cycling route planner (http://cyclevancouver.ubc.ca) for Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to facilitate cycling amongst the general public and to facilitate new route location by transportation planners. The geographical information system-based planner incorporates variables that influence choices to travel by bicycle (e.g., distance, elevation gain, safety, route features, air pollution and links to transit) in selecting the preferred routing. Using a familiar and user-friendly Google Maps interface, the planner allows individuals to seek optimized cycling routes throughout the region based on their own preferences. In addition to the incorporation of multiple user preferences in route selection, the planner is unique amongst cycling route planners in its use of topology to minimize data storage redundancy, its reliance on node/vertex index tables to increase efficiency of the route selection process, and the use of web services and asynchronous technologies for quick data delivery. Use of this tool can help promote bicycle travel as a form of active transportation and help lower greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) and air pollutant emissions by reducing car trips.

The subjective measure grasps the DM's behaviour in front of the future, in the spirit of de Finetti's (1930) and of Yaari's (1987) Dual Theory in the case of risk. Decomposition of the criterion into two criteria that represent the DM's preferences on uncertain payoffs and time contingent payoffs are derived from Ghirardato's (1997) results. Conditional Choquet integrals are defined by dynamic consistency (DC) requirements and conditional capacities are derived, under some conditions on information.

It argues that leadership is a dialogical process, and distinguishes between two models of leadership-bureaucratic and democratic-which sit at opposite ends of a spectrum of reciprocity between 'leaders' and 'led'. Although such developments are as yet embryonic, the emergence of a democratic model of union leadership, rooted in the particular forms of collective action adopted by Egyptian workers during the post-2006 strike wave, presents the most significant challenge to the dominance of the bureaucratic model since the creation of the current union federation in the 1950s.","Univ London, SOAS, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Alexander, A (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",aa107@soas.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [PTA-155-27-0014-A] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [PTA-155-27-0014-A] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,58,25,28,1,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Using a unique sample of REITs from 1992 to 2003, we find that, after controlling for firm characteristics, REITs with banking relationships are more likely to obtain long-term debt ratings and subsequently issue public debt. Moreover, REITs with banking relationships tend to use less secured debt and have lower leverage. These findings support the notion that banking relationships facilitate REITs' access to the public debt markets and help explain why REITs shift from traditional mortgage financing to bank debt and public capital market financing. The results also support the proposition that firm leverage should be positively related to the amount of a firm's secured debt.","[Hardin, William G., III] Florida Int Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Wu, Zhonghua] Florida Int Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Hardin, WG (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",Hardinw@fiu.edu; Wuz@fiu.edu,,,,,,,31,39,39,0,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2010,38.0,2,,,,,257,284,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00267.x,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,600HL,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277976000004,0

This paper has sought to disentangle the causal relationship between highway infrastructure and employment, using panel data for the 48 contiguous US states from 1984 to 1997. Of particular emphasis in this analysis is the sectoral differences in the causal and spatial effects of highway capacity expansions for employment growth in alternative sectors of the economy. The results indicate that lane-mile additions of own-state major highways could increase state employment growth in the services sector while reducing growth in manufacturing. However, the causal relationship is also found to work the other way around. That is, both the rapid growth in services employment and the slowdown in manufacturing jobs temporally lead to increases in roadway capacity of non-interstate major roads. Our analysis also shows that highway infrastructure could produce both positive and negative employment spillovers across states. We find that improvements in non-interstate major roads outside the state border are beneficial to the manufacturing sector which generally serves regional and national markets. For the services sector, however, employment gains from interstate highways in the same state may come at the expense of other states as there is clear evidence of negative employment spillovers from interstate lane-mile additions.

How is earnings management affected by financial and governance factors? Discretionary accruals methods are used to measure earnings management. In addition, the difference between actual and calculated FFO is used to capture the potential FFO manipulation. We examine how these manipulation measures change in the five quarters around SEOs. Moreover, we investigate how a REIT's earnings management decision is affected by its financial structure, operating style, external auditor and corporate governance. We find clear evidence of FFO manipulation around SEOs, but the extent of earnings management is relatively weaker. We find that REITs issuing SEOs more often are more aggressive in manipulating FFO than earnings. Moreover, there is a notable difference between these two types of financial results manipulation. A mean-reversion trend is found in discretionary accruals, but not for FFO manipulation. Manipulation in financial results is influenced by various factors. A diminished capability to generate cash flow, high leverage, volatile cash flow, frequent SEOs and slack corporate governance are all the features of REITs more likely to manipulate financial results.","[Zhu, Yuan Wei; Ong, Seow Eng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Yeo, Wee Yong] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Finance & Accounting, Singapore 117548, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Zhu, YW (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",zhuyuanwei@gmail.com,"Ong, Seow Eng/ABB-9098-2020; Yeo, Wee Yong/D-1754-2016",,,,,,23,14,14,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Taking this as a starting point, this paper analyzes the relation between house prices and credit respectively money growth between 1992 and 2006 (West German price data) and from 1997 to 2006 (East German price data). We focus on the German economy which due to the creation of excess capacities in the wake of reunification did not experience a house price bubble in contrast to other euro area economies such as Ireland and Spain. Applying an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach we test for cointegration among the relevant variables. After estimating the long-run coefficients, we derive the optimal specification of the corresponding error-correction models and estimate them. Our results suggest that both monetary and credit policy are responsible for house price development especially in Western Germany. We also check exhaustively for well-behaved estimated residuals and conduct some tests for structural breaks and robustness checks. For instance, we show that tax policies specific depreciation possibilities in the new federal states also have a significant impact on house prices but without dominating the impact of credit and money growth. Our results are also robust to the application of a more traditional cointegration testing procedure in the spirit of Johansen and Juselius.","[Belke, Ansgar] IZA Bonn, DIW Berlin, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [Belke, Ansgar] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fachbereich Wirtschaftswissensch, Lehrstuhl Volkswirtschaftslehre, D-45117 Essen, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Duisburg Essen,"Belke, A (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn, DIW Berlin, Univ Str 12, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",ansgar.belke@uni-due.de,,,,,,,72,2,2,0,21,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

This study uses the job chains approach to measuring economic development impacts devised by Persky, Felsenstein, and Carlson to compare hospitals with three other industries highly concentrated in central cities and examines the practical challenges facing workforce development professionals. The findings suggest that growth in hospital employment has the potential to outstrip the impact of growth in accommodations, legal services, and securities and commodities on the well-being of low- income workers and should prompt economic development practitioners to take the sector more seriously as a locus for attention and investment. To maximize welfare gain and distributional equity, economic development policy makers must accompany investments in health care-based economic development both with strategies to promote skills attainment and credentialing among low-paid health care workers and with formal strategies to facilitate upward movement.","[Nelson, Marla] Univ New Orleans, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA; [Wolf-Powers, Laura] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Louisiana System; University of New Orleans; University of Pennsylvania,"Nelson, M (通讯作者)，Univ New Orleans, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Milneburg Hall 300,2000 Lakeshore Dr, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA.",mnelson@uno.edu,,,,,,,48,22,26,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Respondents completed a questionnaire before and after the trial. Acceptance of the congestion charge was higher after the trial as opposed to its acceptability judgments before the trial. Respondents believed the charge had more positive consequences (viz., decreasing parking problems, congestion, and pollution) and less negative consequences (viz., financial cost increases) after the trial than they had expected beforehand. Furthermore, we examined the relative importance of various beliefs for the acceptability of the congestion charge before and after it was implemented. Results are that before the implementation of the charge acceptability was significantly related to beliefs about the expected consequences for one's own car use and financial costs, whereas acceptance after the trial was related to beliefs about the perceived consequences for one's own car use and parking problems. These results indicate that acceptance of the congestion charge had increased because people experienced positive consequences of the charge. This conclusion is discussed in the broader context in which the Stockholm trial took place. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

After reviewing existing calls to bring ethics and ethical considerations within the mainstream of the discipline several questions are made. Drawing from critical and post-structural thought, it is argued that existing accounts of ethics privilege a problematic separation between ethics and power. Power is depicted as obligation - as power over -while ethics is depicted as an ameliorative other to power. We draw out several limits in this separation - including the reification of market subjectivities of contract, individualism, and a problematic global scale - arguing that ethics should be seen as a constitutive discourse like any other. Power is re-phrased as productive, as the power to. We conclude by articulating a pragmatist research agenda that seeks to foster the kernel 'possibility' in discourses of ethics while retaining sensitivity to the potential constitutive 'violence' of ethics. Given this dilemma, we argue that ongoing practices of 'resistance' - in both practical and scholarly senses - should be a central problematic for engaging with the (political) question of ethics in IPE.","[Brassett, James] Univ Warwick, Ctr Study Globalisat & Regionalisat, Warwick, England; [Holmes, Christopher] Univ Southampton, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Southampton, Hants, England; [Holmes, Christopher] Univ Southampton, Ctr Citizenship Globalizat & Governance, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Warwick; University of Southampton; University of Southampton,"Brassett, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Ctr Study Globalisat & Regionalisat, Warwick, England.",,,"Holmes, Christopher/0000-0002-1248-0983",,,,,78,15,16,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This new index is based on 79 series from the monthly price indices as well as economy indicators and financial variables spanning from 2005 to 2009.

It contributes to the literature on three main fronts. First, we simultaneously introduce both temporally and spatially lagged factors and design a DSFE model with both dynamic and spatial fixed effects. Second, we analyze both observable and unobservable spatial effects by taking the initial value as exogenous, respectively. Third, we derive and prove the asymptotic properties and distributions of the likelihood estimators, and undertake an assessment based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation results show that the likelihood estimators of the model parameters improve as the sample size increases and move closer to their real values. Moreover, the degree to which the estimation results improve depends more on the temporal dimension than on the spatial dimension. Therefore, increasing the temporal dimension can significantly improve the estimation results given a fixed spatial dimension.","[Guo Penghui; Qian Zhengming] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,,gpengfly@163.com,"Guo, Peng/GWC-0572-2022; guo, peng/AAG-4052-2019",,,,,,15,0,0,1,5,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-09-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,614,630,,,,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE74,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298265300105,0

However, there is little work that examines sustainability of the growth, which is more significant for future development of agricultural sector. Moreover, whether trade openness and domestic investment policy which are used to promote the agricultural TFP growth also could play a great role in the sustainability of the agricultural TFP growth is rarely examined. We estimate and decompose China's agricultural TFP using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), finding that technical change is the main source of China's agricultural TFP growth since 1978, favoring that TFP growth is lack of sustainability. In addition, using two-stage estimation procedure, we make an empirical analysis about the impact of trade openness and domestic input on TFP structure. Results show that trade openness and agricultural infrastructure is narrowing the gap between the two sources, while agricultural scientific investment is just the opposite. Therefore an in-depth trade openness and agricultural infrastructure are needed favoring the growth of China's agriculture, while agricultural scientific investment should be conducted after a higher level of trade openness and agricultural infrastructure.

In light of the observation that the national political economies which are the exemplars of the state-led model have undergone a more fundamental change towards the liberal market model than the other non-liberal variant (namely, the coordinated market model), the article asks what systemic (structural-institutional) factors make the state-led model less resilient in the face of pressures for change. Focusing on corporate governance in South Korea as an illustrative case study, the article argues that the absence of the kind of institutional complementarity (that is, mutually reinforcing link) between the key capitalist sub-systems found in the coordinated market model can help to explain the profound, and even path-shifting, change in the state-led model.","Univ Manchester, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Kang, N (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",nahee.kang@manchester.ac.uk,,"Kang, Nahee/0000-0003-3325-2741",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E015891/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/E015891/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,77,22,26,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

He provides a mathematical framework for the analysis of taxation, considered both as the counterpart of the benefits received from the State and of the taxpayer's ability to pay. This article examines Fauveau's contribution to fiscal theory. This consists of modelling his two major ideas: as the first author to apply insurance theory to the calculation of an equitable tax, and expressing in mathematical terms Condorcet's principles of taxation. The novelty of his analysis lies in proving, in both cases, the optimality of progressive or of proportional taxation. To give a complete overview of Fauveau's ideas on fiscal theory we present in an appendix two other contributions on taxation that were published separately.","PHARE, F-75647 Paris 13, France",,"Silvant, C (通讯作者)，PHARE, Maison Sci Econ,106-112 Bd Hosp, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",clairesilvant@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Adjacency and existing firm networks are assumed to influence the investors' profits in a given location by overcoming informational disadvantages when entering the new market. A nested logit model resembles the structure of the location choice process well, since it allows foreign investors to have differing perceptions about the substitutability among East and West German federal states. By using affiliate-level data between 1997 and 2005, the results confirm that firms react positively to local demand, a common border and existing firm networks, while unit labor costs exhibit the expected negative impact. In the sectoral estimations, it is shown that these effects vary in their relevance across manufacturing and service affiliates, and between upstream and downstream activities and that intersectoral linkages play an important role.

The main finding is that Wald tests generally perform well regarding both size and power even in small samples. The GMM-based Wald test is correctly sized even for non-normally distributed disturbances and small samples, and it exhibits a similar power as its MLE-based Counterpart. Hence, for the applied researcher the GMM Wald test can be recommended, because it is easy to implement. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that if the profile of individual beliefs satisfies a condition called 'value restriction', then the output of any quasimajoritarian function is logically consistent; this directly generalizes the recent work of Dietrich and List (Majority voting on restricted domains. Presented at SCW08; see http://personal.lse. ac.uk/LIST/PDF-files/MajorityPaper22November.pdf, 2007b).

In particular, we refer to a major shift in the legal and institutional environment, the reform of the German joint-stock companies act in 1884. We analyze a sample of executive pay for 46 firms for the years 1870-1911. In 1884, a legal reform substantially enhanced corporate control, strengthened the monitoring incentives of shareholders, and reduced the discretionary power of executives in Germany. The pay-performance sensitivity decreased significantly after this reform. While executives received a bonus of about 3-5% in profits before 1884, after the reform this parameter decreased to a profit share of about 2%. At least the profit share that is eliminated by the reform most likely was incentive pay before. This incentive mechanism was replaced by other elements of corporate governance.

The paper argues for a downstream cap accompanied by measures such as a renewable portfolio standard, efficiency standards for vehicles, appliances and buildings, and a low carbon fuel standard. For this argument, it is necessary to address both the theory and the empirical evidence of emission trading. After reviewing the theory, the paper examines the actual experience in the U.S. with emission trading for SO2, to see whether the assumptions used in the theory actually applied in practice. What actually happened deviated in several important respects from what was supposed to happen according to the conventional theorizing. The design of a cap and trade program for GHG is then discussed, first considering the similarities between the past regulation of air pollutants and the challenge posed by GHGs, and then making the case for a downstream cap and complementary policies.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hanemann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 207 Giannini Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",hanemann@are.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,83,8,8,0,14,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,OCT,2009,30.0,,,,2,,79,114,,,,,,36,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,681SB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284336000006,0

Prior analyses, based either on highly aggregated macroeconomic or specific electricity industry models, have been limited in degree of detail or scope. Two types of modeling were combined in the present study: general equilibrium was used to assess the impact on different industries and to explain cross-industry changes, and partial equilibrium to suitably model the complex and crucial electricity system. Combining and interrelating these two models yields the effects on price, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and distributional patterns in Spain of both the current policy and of an alternative in which all industries take part in the EU ETS. Since Spain is a key participant in this scheme, the conclusions and policy implications stemming from this paper are relevant to and useful for post-Kyoto arrangements.","[Labandeira, Xavier; Rodriguez, Miguel] Univ Vigo, Fac CC, FEDEA, E-36310 Vigo, Spain; [Linares, Pedro] Univ Pontificia Comillas, Harvard Kennedy Sch, E-28015 Madrid, Spain; [Linares, Pedro] FEDEA, E-28015 Madrid, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; Comillas Pontifical University,"Rodríguez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Fac CC, FEDEA, Campus As Lagoas, E-36310 Vigo, Spain.",miguel.r@uvigo.es,"Labandeira, Xavier/K-3638-2014; Rodríguez, Miguel/AAG-3435-2020; Linares, Pedro/B-7999-2008","Rodríguez, Miguel/0000-0001-8344-1116; Linares, Pedro/0000-0002-0572-1937",BBVA Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; ERDF [SEJ2006-12939],BBVA Foundation(BBVA Foundation); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); ERDF(European Union (EU)),The authors benefited from comments by two reviewers.

We also document significant differences in liquidity across countries and between property and nonproperty companies. Also striking is the lack of correlation among our three measures of liquidity across property firms and time. This supports the notion that share price liquidity is multifaceted and therefore reliance on any one measure of liquidity in empirical work may produce misleading conclusions.

In contrast to separate accounting, under formula apportionment the corporate tax policy causes a fiscal externality that results from unemployment. This externality is the highest when the apportionment formula contains the payroll factor only. It is minimized for the pure sales (property) formula, if the substitution elasticity is low (high). The unemployment externality tends to compensate other externalities such that tax rates become inefficiently low. The deviation from the efficient tax policy is minimized when the apportionment formula contains the sales factor only. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A loan of $1,000 per capita is accompanied by a 3% to 6% increase in employment-per-capita growth and a 3% to 5% decrease in earnings-per-worker growth over the 2 years after the loan, leaving the effect on total county earnings indeterminate.

In this context policy reforms like an increase of the normal retirement age, higher discounts for early retirement or the introduction of flat or minimum pensions are simulated. While future generations benefit from the first two reforms, they suffer from the latter. There are three central findings: First, higher discounts have a stronger effect on the retirement decision than an increase in normal retirement age. Second, the timing of retirement is significantly affected by an introduction of flat pensions. Third, models with an explicit retirement decision can lead to different policy implications compared to models in which retirement age is exogenous.","Univ Wurzburg, Volkswirtschaftl Inst, Lehrstuhl Finanzwissensch Prof Dr Hans Fehr, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Kallweit, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Volkswirtschaftl Inst, Lehrstuhl Finanzwissensch Prof Dr Hans Fehr, Sandering 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",manuel.kallweit@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Based on a recently proposed method by Elliott, Komunjer and Timmermann (2005) the paper provides evidence of asymmetries in the underlying forecast loss preference of the Commission that tend to vary across Member States. In some cases, our results show that EU forecasts tend to display a rather optimistic picture for main economic variables, e.g. government balance, thus allowing a certain degree or leeway in the fiscal adjustment path towards the medium-term objective of 'close tobalance' or 'in surplus' of the recently revised Stability and Growth Pact. Over the period of our sample, 1970-2004, this apparent asymmetry in the underlying loss preferences tends to deter prudent advice over economic policy. Lastly, we provide an analysis on the trade-off between loss and distribution asymmetries, for which simulation results show that the testing method is robust in the presence of skewness.

At the individual level, respondents have negative views if they have negative views of the state of the economy. More educated respondents are more likely to have negative views of the IEOs. Women are more likely to have positive views of the IEOs than men. National levels of engagement with the IEOs also affect public evaluations of them.

A stochastic network deterministic user equilibrium model (SNDUE) with elastic demand is formulated and used to evaluate the welfare and private impacts of different market penetrations of ATIS, together with road pricing for a simple network. Both marginal first-best road pricing and a second-best fixed road pricing are considered. The incentives of private users to use ATIS are analyzed and the characteristics of optimum tolls as a function of ATIS market penetration are shown. We conclude that ATIS is an efficient and necessary tool to reduce the effects of non-recurrent incidents in a transportation network, especially when non-recurrent congestion causes a significant deterioration of operational conditions of the network. If the impact of non-recurrent incidents on free flow costs is small or is reduced only to congestion effects, the use of road pricing would be more efficient. Social benefits obtained when jointly implementing ATIS and road pricing are practically the same whether first-best or second-best road pricing is used. Considering the private costs perceived by the network users, and the benefits experienced by equipped users, the maximum level of market penetration achieved could be limited because private benefits disappear after certain market penetration is obtained.

Their results support earlier findings; however, the most striking point is that fiscal stress and direct tax burden do not statistically influence the infrastructure surtax innovation.","[Kim, DaeJin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Grad Sch Governance, Seoul, South Korea; [Bae, Sang Seok] Ajou Univ, Publ Adm, Suwon 441749, South Korea; [Eger, Robert J., III] Florida State Univ, Reubin OD Askew Sch Publ Adm & Policy, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Ajou University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Kim, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Grad Sch Governance, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Eger, Robert/L-9744-2019; Eger, Robert J./JBJ-1716-2023","Eger, Robert J./0000-0002-3847-2922",,,,,57,10,17,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

However, home buyers can borrow mortgages from banks so that they can effectively share the forward contract risk with banks. This explains the phenomenon of irregularly high early-stage default and prepayment rates observed in residential mortgage lending in China, where there are few, if any, financial incentives for mortgage borrowers to exercise either put or call options. Mortgages collateralized by forward housing assets are riskier than are those with underlying assets traded on the spot market. However, currently Chinese mortgage banks charge the same rate to all mortgage borrowers. This inefficiency in risk sharing between mortgage borrowers' groups in the forward and spot housing markets leads to mispricing in secondary mortgage sales and mortgage-backed security trading.","[Liu, Peng] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Deng, Yongheng] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",Cornell University; University of Southern California,"Liu, P (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 465 Statler Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ydeng@usc.edu; pl333@cornell.edu,"Deng, Yongheng/A-4272-2010","Deng, Yongheng/0000-0002-4438-5171",,,,,30,31,34,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

However, many potential explanatory variables are observed at the brand level. To explain interpurchase times one has to either construct category-level measures of marketing efforts, or integrate the model with a model for brand choice. In this paper we pursue the latter where we use latent brand preferences to capture the relevance of the marketing mix of an individual brand. We compare our new model with several standard approaches on in-sample and Out-of-sample fit and on the interpretation of the estimates of key parameters.

Prior to the amendment these revenues were not distributed to firms. In this article, we formally test the hypothesis that the Byrd Amendment effectively provides double protection to US firms to the extent that it further restricts US imports, as argued by the EU and 11 other US trading partners. Using a rich panel of 362 US manufacturing industries for the period 1998 to 2003, we find that whether or not the Byrd Amendment restricted US imports depends crucially on the level of competitiveness in the import-competing industry. Specifically, we find that the Byrd Amendment served to restrict imports only in industries where competition is relatively weak, while the amendment is associated with an increase in imports in more competitive industries.","[Gayle, Philip G.] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Puttitanun, Thitima] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",Kansas State University; California State University System; San Diego State University,"Gayle, PG (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,,,,,,,29,3,5,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2009,32.0,4,,,,,629,642,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2008.01146.x,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,421TB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264380100005,0

In particular, they report that the value function iteration produces highly inaccurate solutions when risk aversion is high and the investment horizon long. We argue that the reason for the deterioration of VFI is the high nonlinearity of the value function and illustrate that if one uses a natural and economically-motivated transformation of the value function, namely the certainty equivalent, the VFI approach produces very accurate results.","[Skoulakis, Georgios] Univ Maryland, Dept Finance, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Garlappi, Lorenzo] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Finance, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Garlappi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Finance, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",lorenzo.garlappi@mccombs.utexas.edu; gskoulak@rhsmith.umd.edu,,"Skoulakis, Georgios/0000-0002-5156-1890",,,,,15,14,18,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Particular attention is paid to the organization of the industries and the experiences of employees in those worksites. It is demonstrated that there continues to be a persistent and wilful exclusion of this work from regulation, as well as systematic violations of those regulations which do govern the work, constituting what the authors term 'unregulated work'. It should be noted that the workers paid by the government are not exempt from this finding, but fit very clearly into this larger pattern. This illustrates the problems which arise from the process of transforming domestic spaces, and communities more broadly, into spaces of wage labour in American cities. It further serves as a powerful red assertion of the denial of the value of 'women's work'.","[McGrath, Siobhan] Univ Manchester, Dev Policy & Management Inst, Manchester M13 9OH, Lancs, England; [DeFilippis, James] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2A 2LS, England; [DeFilippis, James] Rutgers State Univ, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",University of Manchester; University of London; King's College London; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"McGrath, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dev Policy & Management Inst, Harold Hankins Bldg,Precinct Ctr,Booth St W, Manchester M13 9OH, Lancs, England.",Siobhane.McGrath@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk; jdefilip@rci.rutgers.edu,"McGrath, Siobhan/AAC-3656-2022; McGrath, Siobhan/M-5212-2017; McGrath, Siobhan/ABB-5146-2021","McGrath, Siobhan/0000-0002-7827-0874; McGrath, Siobhan/0000-0002-7827-0874",,,,,23,20,27,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods include cross-sectional anthropometric measurements and semi-structured interviews gathered in 2007, as well as participant observation and purposive interviews conducted in 2007-2008. The regional quota sample of 53 semi-structured interviews was designed to be representative of the cantones (municipal divisions) of Santiago Atitlan. BMI was positively associated with years of schooling, income and literacy, all measures of SES. A statistical analysis of our data indicates that increased income, increased market visits and being married are significantly positively associated with BMI. Qualitative analysis based on the grounded theory method reveals relevant themes including a preoccupation with hunger and undernutrition rather than obesity, a preference for food quantity over dietary diversity, the economic and social influence of a husband, the effects of market distance and the increasing consumption of food from tiendas. These themes help to explain how SES, socio-behavioral practices and BMI are positively associated and can inform future public health interventions related to obesity and undernutrition.

This combines in a unique way local and global interactions. A fixed number of harvesters are located on a spatial grid. Harvesters choose among three strategies: defection, cooperation, and enforcement. Individual payoffs are affected by both global factors, namely, aggregate harvest and resource stock level, and local factors, such as the imposition of sanctions on neighbors by enforcers. The evolution of strategies in the population is driven by social learning through imitation, based on local interaction or locally available information. Numerous types of equilibria exist in these settings. An important new finding is that clusters of cooperators and enforcers can survive among large groups of defectors. We discuss how the results contrast with the non-spatial, but otherwise similar, game of Sethi and Somanathan (American Economic Review 86(4): 766-789, 1996).","[Noailly, Joelle] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [van den Bergh, Jeroen C.

Based on a resource view of the firm and using the concepts of human resource architecture, it is argued that tourism and hospitality are not just examples of the internal spot-market mode in which acquisition dominates employment strategy, but rather constitute a special case in which the nature of labour productivity intervenes. The authors argue that labour is, in the main, separated from quantitative concepts of productivity and adds value only in qualitative terms. This sets up a dichotomy for human resource strategy between economic imperatives and the desire for quality. The resolution of that dichotomy, it is argued, is aggravated by the way individuals value their human capital, which has the effect of segmenting a general unskilled labour market and creating rigid occupational identities. This is the background against which modern ideas of HRM, such as employment flexibility, have to contend.","[Riley, Michael; Szivas, Edith] Univ Surrey, Sch Management, Fac Management & Law, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,"Riley, M (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Sch Management, Fac Management & Law, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",m.riley@surrey.ac.uk; e.szivas@surrey.ac.uk,,,,,,,55,7,8,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We develop an approach to analyzing simulation results that makes use of nonparametric statistical tests, taking advantage of the large amounts of data generated by simulations, and avoiding the assumption of normality that does not necessarily hold. Our results show that in a quantity game, a simple exploration rule, which we call Probe and Adjust, can find either the Cournot equilibrium or the monopoly solution depending on the measure of success chosen by the firms. These results shed light on how tacit collusion can develop within an oligopoly.","[Kimbrough, Steven O.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Murphy, Frederic H.] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Kimbrough, S (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",kimbrough@wharton.upenn.edu; fmurphy@temple.edu,,,,,,,40,15,17,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

While the conventional estimator, total purchase expenditure, is unbiased for latent total household consumption expenditure, it is not variance minimizing since it is an un-weighted sum. In two stages, this article derives a variance-minimizing, unbiased estimator by first estimating and inverting Engel curves; then combining the estimators from the inverted Engel curves. The employed latent variable method allows for utilization of non-expenditure relations. The suggested method may help improve the accuracy in studies of consumption inequality and tax evasion.","Res Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",,"Larsen, ER (通讯作者)，Res Dept, POB 8131 Dep, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",erling.roed.larsen@ssb.no,,,,,,,21,5,5,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Even when updated by Bayesian learning, uncertain structural parameters induce a critical tail fattening of posterior-predictive distributions. Such fattened tails have strong implications for situations, like climate change, where a catastrophe is theoretically possible because prior knowledge cannot place sufficiently narrow bounds on overall damages. This paper shows that the economic consequences of fat-tailed structural uncertainty (along with unsureness about high-temperature damages) can readily outweigh the effects of discounting in climate-change policy analysis.","Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Weitzman, ML (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,27,821,899,7,175,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Using estimation techniques from the productivity spillover literature, this paper tests for the presence of environmental spillovers from foreign firms. On the basis that foreign-owned firms may encourage firms in their extended supply chain to improve their environment-related management practices, evidence for the existence of environmental spillovers should be easier to find than productivity spillovers where firms naturally attempt to minimise intra-industry knowledge leakage. In this paper we show that, first, foreign-owned firms are more likely to implement environmental management systems (EMS) and, second, that the presence of foreign-owned firms in those sectors that a firm supplies can encourage good environmental practice. This is especially true if a firm is foreign, has high absorptive capacity, and operates in the presence of formal and informal networks.","[Albornoz, Facundo; Cole, Matthew A.; Elliott, Robert J.

Interestingly, the effect of enforcement and punishment of piracy was not always positive: Introducing such mechanism caused elimination of the most successful agents without the positive effects on cooperation and productive economic activity. Hence, the income was lower for low enforcement rate than for the economies without any mechanism supporting cooperation. Similar effects occurred in the simulations of institutional change. In case of a discontinuous change, a radical enforcement mechanism was implemented in one point of time and it caused a sharp fall of wealth.

Moreover, because of globalization, the present day financial crisis widens and complicates this vicious circle. Romania is in a contradictory position because, on one hand, it has an emergent economy, vulnerable to crisis, but, on the other hand, it can absorb the new practices, overtaking the old stages. The investment decisions should be close connected to financing because, even there are good ideas and skilled managers, there can not be imposed and financial sustained huge innovation projects, able to change radically and fast the economy and society.

Design/methodology/approach-A quantitative approach based on a random sampling methodology of 1, 000 SMEs. Construct validity was tested in the qualitative phase of the research. Findings-MEs can be categorized as either prospectors or defenders. This polarization was confirmed in this study. For example, prospectors are more likely to engage in new product development, whereas defenders are five times more likely to modify an existing product than introduce a newly patented product. Prospector-type firms tend to deploy more new process technologies and leading management practices compared with defender type firms, particularly in a turbulent operating environment. Defenders recognize the need to catch up and indicate that they intend to introduce process technologies over the next two years. Firms tend to place a greater emphasis on innovation in turbulent operating environments. Research limitations/implications-The study was restricted to two different sector types: engineering and electronics. Future studies should examine other sectors and their sub sectors, possibly augmented by qualitative in-depth case studies. Practical implications-The practical implications of the study are outlined in the paper. Chief executives are encouraged to align their strategic orientation with their innovation strategy. In addition, defender type firms should consider the greater use of process technologies and management practices.

The most popular rating technique is to estimate the relativities of a number of rating factors in a multiplicative or an additive model. Generally, these relativities are discreet (e.g. sex) or continuous (e.g. age, engine capacity). In recent years the standard practice in insurance companies is to use two types of the estimation methods: minimum bias methods or generalized linear models (GLM). One of the practical problem in using this methods is when you take into consideration discreet rating factors with many levels but without an ordering (e.g. car model, geographic zone). Ohlsson and Johansson call this kind of factors as multi-level factors. Nelder and Verrall show that the multi-level factors can be interpreted as random effects in GLM. In this paper first we analyse the estimation process of the credibility estimator in comparing with classical credibility theory where the multi-level factors are estimated by means of minimum square error (MSE). Then we present the iterative algorithm which is use to predict the random risk parameter associated with the multi-level factor where the GLM technique is applied. Finally the numerical example is shown with different assumption of the loss distributions, e.g. Tweedie, Gamma, Inverse Gaussian.","[Wolny-Dominiak, Alicja] Katowice Univ Econ Poland, Fac Econ, Dept Stat & Math Methods Econ, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,,woali@ae.katowice.pl,,,,,,,4,4,4,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,346,351,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900063,0

The nutritional status of the child population was simulated under the counterfactual scenario that all children who died in the first three years of life were alive at the time of measurement. The simulations demonstrate that the difference in anthropometrics due to selective mortality would be large only if there were very large differences in anthropometrics between the children who died and those who survived. Differences of this size are not substantiated by the research on the degree of association between mortality and malnutrition. The study shows that although mortality risk is higher among malnourished children, selective mortality has only a minor impact on the measured nutritional status of children stratified by gender.

In addition to the effect of current body weight status (body mass index (BMI) or obesity) on wages, this paper examines the indirect effect of body weight status in the late-teenage years on wages operating through education and occupation choice. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 data, for women, we find that a one-unit increase in BMI is directly associated with 1.83% lower hourly wages whereas the indirect BMI wage penalty is not statistically significant. Neither a direct nor an indirect BMI wage penalty is found for men. However, results based on clinical weight classification reveal that the indirect wage penalty occurs to a larger extent at the upper tail of the BMI distribution for both men and women via the pathways of education and occupation outcomes. Late-teen obesity is indirectly associated with 3.5% lower hourly wages for both women and men. These results are important because they imply that the total effect of obesity on wages is significantly larger than has been estimated in previous cross-sectional studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using home purchase and refinance loans data for 2005, we estimate that a sizeable number of borrowers who got subprime loans would have qualified for FHA loans, implying a potential net flow of borrowers from subprime to FHA, especially for refinance loans at a rate of about 30%. Also, consistent with the FHA's modernization proposal to increase its loan limits, we find that increasing the limits on FHA loans could help to attract borrowers, mostly of home purchase loans, who are likely to be constrained by the lower-priced house limits. Our findings are generally in line with the recent increased flow of mortgages to FHA, and suggest that FHA loans could be the answer to the current subprime lending crisis.","[Karikari, John A.] US Govt Accountabil Off GAO, Ctr Econ, Washington, DC 20548 USA; [Voicu, Ioan; Fang, Irene] Off Comptroller Currency OCC, Compliance Risk Anal Div, Washington, DC 20219 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,"Karikari, JA (通讯作者)，US Govt Accountabil Off GAO, Ctr Econ, 441 G St NW,Mailstop 617KE, Washington, DC 20548 USA.",karikarij@gao.gov,,,,,,,25,9,16,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

To this end, the author collected information on 572 hotels and tourist apartments and estimated the effects of their characteristics and market conditions on the probability that each establishment would increase or decrease prices and on price variations. The results obtained enabled an examination of the effect of competition and product differentiation on pricing policy. According to the results, the higher the quality of the service provided, the greater the probability of a price rise, and the greater its magnitude. Moreover, a greater difference between the set price and the average price of competitors does not affect the probability of lowering prices. The results therefore suggest that product differentiation is an important issue in the hotel industry.","Univ Malaga, Dept Appl Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Ropero, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Appl Econ, C El Ejido 6, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",maropero@uma.es,,"Ropero, Miguel Angel/0000-0001-8616-9904",,,,,44,21,24,0,47,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The proposed model is an aggregate model for unobserved Financial Institutions which are assumed to supply credit on competitive markets and competition is due to the interest rates (i.e. prices) with respect to the corresponding contracts' demand. Moreover these Financial Institutions can put contracts on the credit market switching over time on different types of contracts depending on expected profit differentials. Among the main characteristics of this model, the number of clients involved in the two credit markets changes over time. At any time, the density of contracts is assumed to maximize the entropy of the economic system under some constraints concerning aggregate profits where the contract profitability is defined as a function of the spread between the average price of the contracts and a measure of production costs. With reference to some model calibrations, the dynamic behaviours and the reactions of the model are investigated through the study of three shock scenarios. The promising obtained results will address further investigations to apply the proposed model to a real data base of information on Financial Institutions in Italy since 1997 to catch the dynamics of fixed and adjustable interest rate mortgages markets.","[Uberti, M.] Univ Turin, Dept Appl Math & Stat, I-10134 Turin, Italy; [Casellina, S.] Banca Italia, Rome, Italy; [Landini, S.] Piemonte, IRES, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Uberti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Cso Unione Soviet 218 Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy.",simoneenrico.casellina@bancaditalia.it; landini@ires.piemonte.it; uberti@econ.unito.it,"Uberti, Mariacristina/HGB-8734-2022","Uberti, Mariacristina/0000-0002-4556-4630","MIUR (Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca scientifica), Italy","MIUR (Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca scientifica), Italy(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","The views expressed in the article are those of the authors and do not involve the responsibility of the Banca d'Italia.

However this consumption is characterised by a sharp disparity between coastal and continental regions. This disparity is due to several factors such as availability and supply of fish, the difference between consumption patterns and product quality. Fish is a highly perishable product and its quality is an important factor The quality attributes are perceived differently by consumers: the expected quality (Structure, colour of gills, appearance of eyes), the experience quality (taste and smell) or the quality of belief (bone development, fish consumption raises intelligence). This paper examines consumer perception of Tunisian quality fish, taking into account the various attributes. A survey was conducted on a sample of 504 consumers from all regions of Tunisia. The data collected were analysed by a factor analysis. Three dimensions of quality were identified: look and experience, health and security and product safety. These dimensions allowed identifying three types of consumers. These types were characterized by socio-demographic and economic variables and their consumption preferences.","[Dhraief, Mohamed Zied; Khaldi, Raoudha] Inst Natl Rech Agron Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia; [Ameur, Mahrez] Inst Super Ingenieurs Equipement Rural Medjez el, Medjez El Bab, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage; Universite de Jendouba,"Dhraief, MZ (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Rech Agron Tunisie, Rue Hedi Karray 2080, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,20,5,5,0,6,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2011,10.0,3,,,,,49,55,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,859NG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297882500008,0

Defining innovative capability as the probability of creating an innovation, it examines firm strategy in a duopoly market, where firms have to decide whether or not to cooperate to acquire a fixed cost R&D infrastructure that would endow each firm with a firm-specific innovative capability. Furthermore, since emerging industries are often characterized by high technological uncertainty and diverse firm focus that makes the exploitation of spillovers difficult, this article focuses on a zero spillover context. It demonstrates that asymmetry has an impact on alliance choice and social welfare, as a function of ex-post market competition and fixed costs of R&D. With significant asymmetry no alliance may be formed, while with similar firms the cost sharing alliance is dominant. Finally, it ascertains the settings under which the equilibrium outcome is distinct from that maximizing social welfare, thereby highlighting some conditions under which public investment in a technology park can be justified.","[Ramani, Shyama V.] UNU MERIT, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands; [Mukherjee, Vivekananda] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Econ, Kolkata 700032, W Bengal, India; [Ramani, Shyama V.] Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Maastricht University; Jadavpur University; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Ramani, SV (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Keizer Karelpl 19, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands.",mukherjeevivek@hotmail.com; ramani@merit.unu.edu,"Mukherjee, Vivekananda/AAS-6956-2020",,,,,,24,14,17,0,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2011,71.0,3,,,,,373,394,,10.1007/s11238-009-9184-9,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,791HQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292656200005,0

In this case, HR (human resources) practitioners found themselves in a CSR role in a newly constituted HR call centre and this research explores how they then (re-)constructed their role as professionals within this context. Through a longitudinal, ethnographic study, three key constructions are identified through which CSRs made claims for a professional identity: 'our work is complex'; 'our work adds value'; and 'our work is unique'. The analysis highlights that a contemporary concern with re-orienting HR to a strategic role may lead to perceived segregation and the re-negotiation of professional identities vis-a-vis other groups of HR professionals. Overall, this research challenges accepted norms and definitions of both call centre work and professional identity, suggesting that both are contested and localized constructions achieved through identity work.","[Pritchard, Katrina; Symon, Gillian] Univ London, Dept Org Psychol, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London,"Pritchard, K (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Org Psychol, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",k.pritchard@bbk.ac.uk,,"Symon, Gillian/0000-0003-4937-9413",,,,,53,19,22,0,41,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The division within economics is by far the strongest, is consistent with anecdotal evidence about freshwater and saltwater schools of thought and has been stable over time. There is also a significant division within comparative literature, but the hiring patterns among top mathematics departments are consistent with random matching.","[Tervio, Marko] Aalto Univ, Helsinki, Finland",Aalto University,"Terviö, M (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Helsinki, Finland.",,,,,,,,17,17,18,1,24,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

We employ a nationally-representative sample from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) and the Nielsen Company data on spot television advertising of cereals, fast food restaurants and soft drinks to children across the top 55 designated-market areas to estimate the relation between exposure to food advertising on television and children's food consumption and body weight. Our results suggest that soft drink and fast food television advertising is associated with increased consumption of soft drinks and fast food among elementary school children (Grade 5). Exposure to 100 incremental TV ads for sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drinks during 2002-2004 was associated with a 9.4% rise in children's consumption of soft drinks in 2004. The same increase in exposure to fast food advertising was associated with a 1.1% rise in children's consumption of fast food. There was no detectable link between advertising exposure and average body weight, but fast food advertising was significantly associated with body mass index for overweight and obese children (>= 85th BMI percentile), revealing detectable effects for a vulnerable group of children. Exposure to advertising for calorie-dense nutrient-poor foods may increase overall consumption of unhealthy food categories. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To enable a fast and a safe evacuation a basic mixed-integer evacuation model has been developed that provides a reorganization of the traffic routing of a certain area for the case of an evacuation. This basic problem of evacuation minimizes the evacuation-time while prohibiting conflicts within intersections. Our evacuation model is a dynamic network flow problem with additional variables for the number and direction of used lanes and with additional complicating constraints. Because of the size of the time-expanded network, the computational effort required by standard software is already very high for tiny instances.

Olkiluoto 3 is being built by a French/German consortium employing mostly posted migrants via transnational subcontractors from around Europe. Despite the strong Finnish unions, contractors successfully contested the right of Finnish actors to regulate the site, placing labour relations in a deregulated space between national systems. Although the posted migrants eventually self-organized, Finnish unions remained unresponsive, reluctant to act outside the normal Finnish social partnership industrial relations paradigm.

The common factors have high predictive power for both business cycle co-movement and bilateral trade intensity.

The method is applied to an unbalanced panel dataset of firms from the German business-related service sector over the period 1994-2000.

The existing empirical literature has documented a link between these two variables for large developed economies and oil-producing countries, always including the 1970s oil crises in their sample periods. Few authors analyze the case of small open economies dependent on oil imports. Since the acceleration of economic growth in the Dominican Republic during the last decade has greatly increased its degree of external energy dependence, this country's experience presents an ideal case study. We estimate the influence that changes in international gasoline prices have on the real exchange rate between the Dominican peso and the United States dollar. The cointegrated nature of the gasoline price and ER time series are tested and a vector error correction model is developed. Our results indicate that a 10% rise in the price of gas coincides with a 1.2% depreciation of the peso in the long run and that the causality runs from gas prices to the peso.","Illinois Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IL 61702 USA",Illinois Wesleyan University,"Méndez-Carbajo, D (通讯作者)，Illinois Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, POB 2900, Bloomington, IL 61702 USA.",dmendez@iwu.edu,,"Mendez-Carbajo, Diego/0000-0001-8969-8676",,,,,18,14,14,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The actual 'suspension' from the 'no bail-out' restriction (Art. 125 TFEU) and the prohibition of funding national debts (Art. 123 TFEU) transfers risks and financial burdens from deeply indebted states to solvent EU member states. As a result an unauthorized transfer union emerges, whose Central Bank lost its independence to a political leadership and cannot focus on its objective of price stability as contracted any longer. Even without the use of financial and guarantee aids the German economy suffers from a distorted yield structure and crowding-out effects of private investments. From the economic point of view the used measures are neither appropriate nor necessary for achieving financial stability within the European Economic and Monetary Union. Much less these measures are proportionate. Of course, the alternative of accepting a 'controlled' national bankruptcy would not have been without its formidable costs. However, its attribution of arrangements in the line with market requirements and the adherence to EU-contract provisions would have been the more worthwhile regulatory policy option for a more solid budgetary policy in the future.","Univ Bundeswehr Hamburg, Helmut Schmidt Univ, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, Lehrstuhl Ordnungsokon, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany",Helmut Schmidt University,"Meyer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bundeswehr Hamburg, Helmut Schmidt Univ, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, Lehrstuhl Ordnungsokon, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany.",dirk.meyer@hsu-hh.de,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,21,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

This article aims to enhance this decision making process through the application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The signals generated by technical trading tools are optimised for maximum profit through the use of GAs. The optimised signals are fed into a variety of fully connected feed forward ANNs, which combine these signals and output a single set of signals of whether to buy, hold or sell in the current market state. The different solutions produced are compared and contrasted, to determine the best ANN architecture for this type of signal amalgamation problem, and the optimal population size and mutation function for the GA. The result is an autonomous trading system with intelligence. This system, as described in this article, has proven to be profitable based on data presented to it-which spans ten currencies over a five year period. The profit margins are statistically significant when compared to un-optimised trading rules as suggested by literature. Further, the margins are statistically significantly more profitable than other no-risk investment strategies.","[Thinyane, Hannah; Millin, Jonathan] Rhodes Univ, Dept Comp Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Thinyane, H (通讯作者)，Rhodes Univ, Dept Comp Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",h.thinyane@ru.ac.za; jonomillin@gmail.com,"Thinyane, Hannah/B-5660-2011","Thinyane, Hannah/0000-0003-0491-4048",,,,,19,19,20,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

For scheduled services with high reliability and long headways, the value of delays is most commonly assumed to be proportional to the average delay. By exploring how the valuation of train delays depends on delay risk and delay length, using three different stated choice data sets, we find that the average delay approach does not hold: the disutility increases slower than linearly in the delay risk. This means that using the average delay as a performance indicator, a guide for operations planning or for investment appraisal will underestimate the value of small risks of long delays relative to large risks for short delays. It also means that estimated valuations of average delay will depend on the delay risk level: valuations will be higher the lower the risk levels in the study are. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Cross-sectional analysis of adults aged 50 and older in the 2004 Health and Retirement Study (N=14,079) was conducted. Gender and gender-race stratified regression models were used to model the association between adult height and childhood circumstances. The gender-stratified results showed a positive gradient association between mother's education and adult height; those reporting up to grade 8, high school graduate, and greater than high school education for their mother were 4.17 cm (p<0.001), 4.92 cm (p<0.001), and 5.83 cm (p<0.001) taller for men and 2.57 cm (p<0.001), 3.16 cm (p<0.001), and 3.85 cm (p<0.001) taller for women, respectively than those reporting no education for their mother. Childhood health was not statistically significantly associated with adult height, controlling for birth cohort, mother's education, and childhood financial hardship. Those who did not experience childhood financial hardship were slightly taller than those who did experience such hardship. Gender-race stratified results also showed a positive gradient association between mother's education and adult height; however, this association was only significant for white men and white women. The study reiterates the importance of childhood circumstances for adult height and for building health stock. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As a result of the financial crisis, in increasing uncertain times, principals have adopted a survival strategy of their dominant identity rather than following the rationale behaviour of hiring the traditional agent i.e., the cheaper and more flexible part of the labour force: the young, female, non-white workforce.","Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England",University of Bradford,"Charles, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England.",aurelch@gmail.com,,"Charles, Aurelie/0000-0001-5770-615X",,,,,18,7,8,0,10,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Consistent age-related patterns emerge. Across all countries younger firms rely less on bank financing and more on informal financing. There is a clear substitution effect: as firms mature, more firms switch out of informal finance toward bank finance, while the total proportion of firms using external finance remains relatively unchanged. Importantly, these relationships hold for firms of different sizes, firms in different sectors, and firms located in countries with different income levels and on different continents. Thus, these patterns of young firm financing show clear universal tendencies. Given that even small firms increasingly use formal bank financing over time, these results suggest that information asymmetry plays an important role in decreasing a young firm's ability to obtain bank finance.

Currently, the disease is present in all banana production regions of the country. Growing resistant cultivars provides the most efficient control for Fusarium wilt. In this work, seven diploid (AA) and fourteen tetraploid (AAAB) banana hybrids were evaluated in field trials for resistance to Foc in infested soil. The banana cultivars 'Maca' and 'Figue Pome Naine' (AAB, Silk) were used as susceptible controls. All diploid hybrids, namely '011601', '130404', '130406', '131801', '422306', '51A1901' and 'SH3263', showed resistance to the pathogen during both first and second crop cycle.

Results also showed that seven out of ten hybrids obtained from crossings in which 'M53' (AA) was used as male parent showed resistance to Foc, thus suggesting that 'M53' is a promising parent for use in banana breeding programmes aiming at developing Fusarium wilt-resistant cultivars.","[de Matos, A.

We analyze a marketing experiment designed to encourage female uptake of a new microcredit product. A brochure with two different covers was randomly distributed among male and female borrowing groups. One cover featured 5 businesses run by men while the other had identical businesses run by women. We find that both men and women respond to psychological cues. Men who are not themselves business owners, have lower measured ability and whose wives are less educated respond more negatively to the female brochure, as do women business owners with low autonomy within the household. Women with relatively high levels of autonomy shown the male brochure have a similar negative response, while there is no effect on female business owners with autonomy shown the female brochure. Overall, these results suggest that women's response to psychological cues, such as positive role models, may be mediated by their autonomy and that more disadvantaged women may require more intensive interventions.

A crossing strategy was developed to obtain triploid hybrid varieties directly from diploid plant material. Molecular tools have now been developed to support this conventional cross-breeding scheme. Molecular markers have given new insight in Musa genetic diversity, leading to a better understanding of the relationships between modern cultivars and their ancestors, thereby providing critical information for the choice of parent material. The Musa genome structure and genetic maps have been investigated, clarifying the mating behaviour of gametes during meiosis and giving insight in how to manage ploidy and interspecificity. Genes involved in character expression have been identified, and genome sequencing is ongoing as a result of an international effort. The development of these molecular tools provides breeders with important information to increase the efficiency of genetic improvement efforts.

The crop has been cultivated there for more than 2000 years, and in the last two decades, it has become one of the most important fruit crops in the country. With a production of 8,042,702 tonnes on an area of 311,106 ha in 2008, banana comes in fourth place, only after apple, citrus and pear. As the demand for banana in the country is very high, banana produced domestically can only meet 90% of the demand, the other 10% is met by imported banana. Banana is mainly cultivated in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Fujian, Yunnan Province and Taiwan. Guangdong's cultivated area and production quantity rank first in China. The banana industry in China has been evolving fast over the past two decades. Indeed, banana production is a crucial industry in each main producing area; it plays an important role in the local economy and rural development. Many high-yielding and good-quality production techniques have been widely adopted by growers, such as micropropagated plantlets, water-saving irrigation, fertilisation, bunch management techniques, etc. Since 2003, the industrialisation of banana production has been promoted effectively through the implementation of the Banana Industrial Upgrading Plan developed by the Agricultural Ministry. However, Chinese banana production is still facing many challenges such as pests and diseases, adverse weather conditions and level of industrialisation. More than 3,000 ha of banana plantations have been attacked by Fusarium wilt in Guangdong. Production declined by more than 30% due to cold temperature in 1991-1992, 1999-2000 and 2002-2003, and the damage in 2007-2008 was devastating. In order to promote a healthy and persistent development of the banana industry, the National Industry System of Banana was initiated by the National Agricultural Ministry in 2008. Scientists were organised to tackle key issues, including breeding, cultivation technology, postharvest and processing, marketing and trade.","[Li, C. Y.; Wei, Y. R.; Wu, Y. L.; Huang, B. Z.; Yi, G.

The study showed that: (i) Foc race 4 was capable of invading the epidermal cells of banana roots directly; (ii) Invasion sites included epidermal cells of root caps and in the elongation zone. Our results showed that roots of Foc race 4-susceptible banana plants were well colonised with the pathogen and demonstrated that GFP-tagged Foc race 4 isolates present an effective tool to study banana root-fungus interactions.","[Li, C.

The test statistics can be computed using the null model of standard error correction. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistics is based on the standard distribution, and thus the proposed tests do not involve semiparametric treatment for the resolution of inferential difficulty. The alternative distribution of the test statistics is explored under the local drift and the smooth functional form.

The results demonstrate that being a member of a stigmatised immigrant group is associated with a substantial social capital deficit. This deficit arises because immigrant workers are embedded in social networks that constrain their ability to acquire valuable social resources or are excluded from social networks with valuable resources. Another finding is that the average salary earned by members of stigmatised immigrant groups is lower than that earned by native-born workers. The observed wage gap cannot be explained by 'human capital' variables. However, when social capital variables were taken into account, wage gaps noticeably shrank, which indicates that part of the wage disadvantage experienced by immigrants is likely to represent the impact of unequal access to social capital.","[Behtoui, Alireza; Neergaard, Anders] Linkoping Univ, ISV, REMESO, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Behtoui, Alireza] Stockholm Univ, CEIFO, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Linkoping University; Stockholm University,"Behtoui, A (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, ISV, REMESO, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden.",alireza.behtoui@liu.se; anders.neergaard@liu.se,"neergaard, anders/X-1280-2019","neergaard, anders/0000-0002-7098-8611; Behtoui, Alireza/0000-0001-8227-3659",,,,,32,51,57,0,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Here we extend upon a currently available estimation method (Terrell, J Appl Econometr 11:179-194, 1996) for imposing regularity regionally on a connected subset of the regressor space. Our method offers important advantages by imposing theoretical consistency not only locally, at a given evaluation point but also within the whole empirically relevant region of the domain associated with the function being estimated. The method also provides benefits through higher flexibility, which generally leads to a better model fit to the sample data.

To that end, we provide evidence of changes in house prices in the Gilo neighborhood of Jerusalem in the wake of the 2000 Second Palestinian Intifada. During that period, Gilo suffered from sporadic and ongoing gunfire from the neighboring Palestinian village of Beit Jala. Our sample includes 555 housing transactions from the Gilo neighborhood of Jerusalem over the 1997-2008 period. Results of VAR estimation indicate that shooting events result in a lagged 12% reduction in Gilo house values. However, as evidenced in the impulse response functions, those effects are largely reversed within 18 months of the terror event. Difference-in-difference analysis of the micro-data permits further assessment of the neighborhood spatial incidence of terror. Results indicate an average quality-adjusted house price decline of about 10% among frontline relative to non-frontline dwellings in Gilo in the aftermath of the outbreak of hostilities; moreover, much of that effect persisted some five years subsequent to the cessation of violence. Research findings suggest substantial residential property value effects of terrorism as incurred by households living in conflict areas. Those same households-like many others-would be the direct beneficiaries of conflict resolution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The primary purpose of this study is to highlight the extent to which these claims are true. The study divides the contents of all PTAs involving the EC and the US currently notified to the WTO, into 14 'WTO+' and 38 'WTO-X' areas, where WTO+ provisions come under the current mandate of the WTO, and WTO-X provisions deal with issues lying outside the current WTO mandate. As a second step, the legal enforceability of each obligation is evaluated, and judged on the extent to which the text specifies clear obligations. Among the findings are: (i) EC agreements contain almost four times as many instances of WTO-X provisions as do US agreements; (ii) but EC agreements evidence a very significant amount of 'legal inflation' (i.e. non-legally enforceable provisions) in the WTO-X category, and US agreements actually contain more enforceable WTO-X provisions than do the EC agreements; (iii) US agreements tend to emphasise regulatory areas more compared to EC agreements.","[Horn, Henrik] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mavroidis, Petros C.] Univ Neuchatel, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Mavroidis, Petros C.] Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY USA; [Sapir, Andre] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); University of Neuchatel; Columbia University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Horn, H (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,"Sapir, Andre/IAS-0343-2023","Sapir, Andre/0000-0001-6493-0352",,,,,7,232,249,5,64,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2010,33.0,11,,,,,1565,1588,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01273.x,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,685GB,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284616100008,0

We consider a linear freeway with multiple on-ramps and a downstream bottleneck and commuters accessing the freeway via different on-ramps try to arrive at work on time. Rather than charging congestion tolls as widely suggested by economists, we show that the old-fashioned engineering approach - ramp metering - can be a powerful tool to affect travelers' departure time choice and thereby alter the congestion externality distribution among travelers. With carefully designed time-dependent metering plans, travelers from different origins can be channelized and will access the freeway bottleneck in different time periods, resulting in less total cost for the system compared to the no-metering case. The metering strategies are Pareto-improving, with travelers from the on-ramp with the highest priority having the smallest individual costs and travelers from the on-ramp with the lowest priority having their costs equal to those in the nometering scenario. By changing the priority order of the ramps periodically, the benefit of the Pareto-improving metering strategies can be distributed evenly among all travelers. Numerical experiments show that the total user cost can be reduced by up to 40% with the proposed metering strategies. This study offers researchers and policy makers a different angle of looking at congestion externality, and the results provide an overview of the potential long term benefits that dynamic ramp metering strategies can achieve.

Imprecise information is provided in the form of a set of possible probability values, such that it is virtually impossible for the subjects to guess or estimate, which one in the set is true or more likely to be true. We investigate how geometric features of such information pieces affect choices. We find that the subjects care about more features than the pairs of best-case and worst-case, which is a counter-evidence to the well-known models, maximin and alpha-maximin. We find that presence of nonextreme points in the set affects choice, which suggests that attitude toward imprecision is 'nonlinear.' We also obtain an observation, though not significant, that information pieces have a complementarity that may not be explained by the Bayesian view.","[Hayashi, Takashi] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Wada, Ryoko] Keiai Univ, Dept Econ, Chiba, Japan",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Hayashi, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",th925@eco.utexas.edu; YRI02505@nifty.com,,"WADA, RYOKO/0000-0002-2879-1727",,,,,21,34,36,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2010,69.0,3,,,,,355,373,,10.1007/s11238-008-9119-x,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,627WL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280074600002,0

The typical adjustable-rate loan in subprime is a hybrid of fixed and adjustable characteristics in which the first 2 years are fixed and the remaining 28 years adjustable. Hybrid loans terminate at elevated probabilities even before the first adjustment date. Hybrid loan terminations are sensitive to interest rates and teaser rates (payment shocks). Default probabilities increase dramatically when payment shocks are mixed with low or no equity in the home. This is the mixture of events that helped to trigger the 2007/2008 subprime mortgage crisis.,"[Pennington-Cross, Anthony] Marquette Univ, Dept Finance, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Ho, Giang] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Pennington-Cross, A (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Dept Finance, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",anmpc@yahoo.com; giangho@ucla.edu,,,,,,,25,60,72,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2010,38.0,3,,,,,399,426,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00271.x,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,639UL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281000000001,0

I find that most investors prefer an adjustable-rate mortgage and thereby save on the bond risk premium that is contained in fixed-rate mortgage payments. Only older, risk-averse investors hold some fixed-rate mortgage debt. Together with a position in short-term bonds this enables them to hedge against changes in the real interest rate, while the inflation exposure of the debt and bond positions cancel out. Hedging house price changes with bonds only occurs at the end of the life cycle. Early in the life cycle short-sale constraints prevent an effective hedge.","NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Van Hemert, O (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",ovanhemert@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,19,19,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2010,38.0,3,,,,,467,505,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00274.x,0.0,,,39,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,639UL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281000000003,0

In this paper, we empirically assess the impact on Austrian pig producers of the 1995 decision of Austria to join the European Union. Applying a recently developed Hausman-Wu-Type cointegration test, we confirm the existence of a cointegrating relationship between Austrian and EU pig prices series. This relationship is used to forecast the counterfactual time path of prices. Within an expected utility framework, we compute the Austrian producer's willingness to pay to remain under the pre-accession policy. Accounting for the dual income and insurance effects, we found producers to have been under-compensated. Conventional welfare measures which do not include the insurance component would significantly underestimate the total welfare impact.","[Thompson, S.

The analysis illustrates that cross-border mergers raise world welfare over its level in an already open economy with free trade but no foreign investment. In particular, larger countries benefit from the additional investment opportunities, while smaller countries may lose, if the pre-merger production cost differential across firms is negligible and/or a post-merger technology transfer across production sites is infeasible. Furthermore, the analysis provides novel insights into the trade pattern effects of a merger. One important result in this respect is that an adjustment of plant location in space can reverse the direction of (net) trade flows between two countries. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A two-step, limited information maximum likelihood estimator is proposed to fill this gap. The estimator is developed assuming a Poisson distribution, but can be extended to other count distributions. The small sample properties of the estimator are evaluated with Monte Carlo experiments. Simulation results suggest that the spatial lag count estimator achieves gains in terms of bias over the aspatial version as spatial lag autocorrelation and sample size increase. An empirical example deals with the location choice of single-unit start-up firms in the manufacturing industry in the US between 2000 and 2004. The empirical results suggest that in the dynamic process of firm formation, counties dominated by firms exhibiting internal increasing returns to scale are at a relative disadvantage even if localization economies are present.

This study estimates the effects of altitude in South America on the means and quantiles of birth weight and gestational age separately for two large samples born at altitude ranges of 5 to 1,280 m and 1,854 to 3,600 m. The study finds significant negative altitude effects on birth weight and gestational age in the low-altitude sample and on birth weight in the high-altitude sample. Altitude effects are larger for infants with very low fetal health endowments. The study finds differences in the effects of several inputs such as socioeconomic status and maternal fertility history and health between the two altitude samples. The study highlights the importance of adverse altitude effects on infant health when evaluating the costs and returns of policies that change the number of individuals who reside at higher altitude in both low and high altitude ranges.

However many difficulties are encountered when applying a participatory approach, mainly due to the leading role still played by the public administration in designing and implementing development projects and to the population's expectations. The aim of this article is to evaluate the effectiveness of the actions undertaken by ODESYPANO based on the results obtained over the last years.","Inst Natl Agron Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage,"Barhoumi, L (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Agron Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,0,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2010,9.0,2,,,,,17,24,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,636RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280755800004,0

Efforts to reduce emissions to meet Kyoto targets and beyond have raised issues of competitiveness in countries that are implementing these policies, as well as fear of leakage of carbon-intensive industries to non-implementing countries. This has also led to proposals for tariff or border tax adjustments to offset any adverse impact of capping CO(2) emissions. In this paper we examine the implications of climate change policies such as carbon tax and energy efficiency standards on competitiveness across industries, as well as issues related to leakage, if any, of carbon-intensive industries to developing countries. Though competitiveness issues have been much debated in the context of carbon taxation policies, the study finds no evidence that industries' competitiveness is affected by carbon taxes. In fact, the analysis suggests that exports of most energy-intensive industries increase when a carbon tax is imposed by the exporting countries, or by both importing and exporting countries. This finding gives credence to the initial assumption that recycling the taxes back to the energy-intensive industries by means of subsidies and exemptions may be overcompensating for the disadvantage to those industries. There is, however, no conclusive evidence that supports relocation (leakage) of carbon-intensive industries to developing countries due to stringent climate change policies.","[Ma, Hong] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ma, Hong] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Davis; Tsinghua University,,,,,,,,,8,9,9,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2010,33.0,6,,,,,820,829,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01286.x,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,604ZL,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278316900003,0

Although the existing literature accounts for this internal union transformation by referring to macrosocial and institutional factors, this article suggests that the emerging potential of union renewal is linked with the new forms of union activism and worker agency. This assertion is based on an exploratory empirical study using 45 biographical narrative interviews with company-level union representatives in Poland. The analysis reveals the existence of 'transitional' and 'reinvented' patterns of union activism. The article concludes that new unionism in Poland does not resemble an economic unionism or broad social movement unionism as suggested by other authors. On the contrary, it follows a path that combines the reinvented union ethos with market-oriented strategies.","[Mrozowicki, Adam] Univ Wroclaw, Inst Sociol, PL-51149 Wroclaw, Poland; [Pulignano, Valeria; Van Hootegem, Geert] Katholieke Univ Leuven, CESO, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Pulignano, Valeria; Van Hootegem, Geert] Catholic Univ Louvain, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",University of Wroclaw; KU Leuven; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Mrozowicki, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wroclaw, Inst Sociol, Ul Koszarowa 3, PL-51149 Wroclaw, Poland.",adam.mrozowicki@wns.uni.wroc.pl; valeria.pulignano@soc.kuleuven.be; geert.vanhootegem@soc.kuleuven.be,"Mrozowicki, Adam/AAM-7785-2020","Mrozowicki, Adam/0000-0002-5809-5036; Van Hootegem, Geert/0000-0003-4412-8121",,,,,33,19,22,0,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Multi-unit multiple-bid auctions, in which bidders are allowed to submit multiple price-quantity bids, are promising mechanisms for the allocation of a range of resources. The main advantage of such auctions is to avoid the lumpy bid problem which arises when bidders can only compete on the basis of one bid. However, there is great uncertainty about the best auction formats when multi-unit auctions are used. The theory can only supply the expected structural properties of equilibrium strategies and the multiplicity of potential equilibria makes comparisons across auction formats difficult. Empirical studies and experiments have improved our knowledge of multi-unit auctions but they remain scarce and most experiments are restricted to two bidders and two units. Moreover, they demonstrate that bidders have limited rationality and learn through experience. This paper constructs an agent-based computational model of bidders to compare the performance of alternative procurement auction formats under circumstances where bidders submit continuous bid supply functions and learn over time to adjust their bids in order to improve their net incomes. The setting is for independent private values. We show that bidding behaviour displays more interesting patterns than is depicted in the theoretical literature and that bidding patterns depend on the interplay between heterogeneity in the bidder population and the degree of rationing in the auction. Results indicate that the three auction formats have similar performance for most levels of competition but that their performances differ when competition is weak. This ranking is dependent on whether the population of bidders is homogenous or heterogeneous.","[Hailu, Atakelty] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Thoyer, Sophie] ENSAM LAMETA, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France",University of Western Australia; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier,"Hailu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, 35 Stiriling Highway,M089, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",ahailu@are.uwa.edu.au; thoyer@ensam.inra.fr,"Hailu, Atakelty/AAB-7606-2020","Hailu, Atakelty/0000-0002-1024-7520",,,,,28,15,17,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This study compares these two measures In the context of econometric modelling and the forecasting Of tourism demand. The empirical Study focuses on demand for Hong Kong tourism by residents of Australia, the UK and the USA. Using the general-to-specific modelling approach, key determinants Of tourism demand are identified based on different demand measures. In addition, the forecasting accuracy of these demand Measures is examined. It is found that tourist arrivals in Hong Kong are influenced mainly by tourists' income and 'word-of-month'/habit persistence effects, while the tourism price in Hong Kong relative to that of the tourist origin country is the most important determinant Of tourist expenditure in Hong Kong. Moreover, the aggregate tourism demand models Outperform the per capita models, with aggregate expenditure models being the most accurate. The implications of these Findings for tourism decision making are that the choice of demand measure for forecasting models Should depend on whether the objective of the decision maker is to maximize tourist arrivals or expenditure (receipts), and also that the models should be specified in aggregate form.","[Song, Haiyan; Witt, Stephen F.; Fei, Baogang] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Gang] Univ Surrey, Fac Management & Law, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of Surrey,"Song, HY (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",hmsong@polyu.edu.hk,"Li, Gang/AAR-3204-2020; Song, Haiyan/ABE-6463-2020; Song, Haiyan/AAD-3283-2022","Li, Gang/0000-0002-9858-5232; Song, Haiyan/0000-0001-6158-1222",,,,,24,164,178,5,52,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The effects of entrepreneurship may be more subtle than the latter approaches, but business creation can have significant effects across both space and time. This article first sketches the important relationship between innovation, entrepreneurship, and growth and then empirically assesses the relationship between entrepreneurship and job growth across U. S. labor market areas and counties. Three key findings emerge. First, entrepreneurship is systematically related to job growth; furthermore, this relationship increases in intensity over time. Second, entrepreneurship has the greatest impact on the county in which it occurs but also generates positive spillovers for job growth in neighboring counties. Finally, the impact of entrepreneurship is greater in denser, more urbanized settings where such businesses can leverage the advantages of a thick marketplace.","[Henderson, Jason] Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Omaha Branch, Omaha, NE 68102 USA; [Weiler, Stephan] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City; Colorado State University,"Henderson, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Omaha Branch, 2201 Farnam St, Omaha, NE 68102 USA.",jason.henderson@kc.frb.org,,,,,,,48,73,92,1,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

In Russia, heightened state involvement in the resource sectors, including oil and gas pipeline networks, is characterised mainly by political goals, whereas Kazakhstan's resource nationalism is primarily motivated by economic goals. More specifically, Russia leverages its energy sector to achieve geopolitical objectives and domestic political stability.

The model class is motivated by the fact that the common way of incorporating asymmetries into Gaussian MS GARCH models, i.e., regime-dependent means, leads to autocorrelated raw returns, which may not be desirable. The appearance of the SN distribution can be explained by a pre-asymptotic behavior of daily stock returns, and can still be viewed as generic. The dynamic properties of the process are derived, and its in- and out-of-sample performance is compared with that of several competing models in an application to three major European stock markets over a period covering the recent financial turmoil. It turns out that parsimoniously parameterized SN mixture GARCH processes perform best overall. In particular, they outperform both a skewed t GARCH specification as well as normal mixture GARCH models with skewness generated via nonzero component means.","Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Haas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",haas@stat.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,,101,15,15,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Results are compared with a volatility-return benchmark derived from financial markets. This comparison given an indication whether, first, a risk premium exists, and, second, whether or not it sufficiently remunerates extra risk. Although data availability differs for both systems, they could be robustly compared through decomposing ROCE into yield, price and cost components. Main uncertainties, concerning market failure and capital input, are captured with a sensitivity analysis. Simulations mainly confirm current risk perception, but risk premium is sufficiently high to remunerate extra risk. Sensitivity analysis, however, demonstrates the vulnerability for market failures, but also reveals, unexpectedly, no effects from the absolute capital input.

His treatment of the division of labour which reached beyond Adam Smith's evaluation, the emphasis he put on technological advances, and his focus on economies of scale have been appreciated by historians and economists. However, Babbage's contributions to economic theory are not confined to industrial organization. This paper suggests that by pointing out the means of becoming a manufacturer rather than merely a maker, Babbage described a process of national development for Britain. In this process he drew attention to cost and skill-minimizing division of labour; the importance of technological development and human capital in terms of knowledge and skill; the relationship between scientific development and economic development; and finally, Britain's absolute advantage in capital goods production which originates from all of these factors.","Zonguldak Karaelmas Univ, Dept Econ, Zonguldak, Turkey",Bulent Ecevit University,"Ozgur, E (通讯作者)，Zonguldak Karaelmas Univ, Dept Econ, Zonguldak, Turkey.",merdemozgur@yahoo.com,"Özgür, Mustafa Erdem/O-9490-2019",,,,,,57,1,1,0,17,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

This article challenges the strong notion that the recent financial crisis was global in scope. It argues the international financial system is quite differentiated, being made up of domestic-national, supranational regional and international aspects. The system is characterised by contagion, however, and the article goes on to consider the role of this in generating spill-overs into the wider economic mechanism. Given this characterisation of the financial system the implications for how to organise a regulatory response are pursued. Here the argument is that the principle of 'distributed preparedness for resilience' should guide this response not a new set of top-down global rules and norms organised once again by the institutions of global economic governance.","Open Univ, Fac Social Sci, London, England",Open University - UK,"Thompson, GF (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Fac Social Sci, London, England.",g.f.thompson@open.ac.uk,,,,,,,67,23,24,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The size of FDI spillovers is economically important, accounting for about 14% of productivity growth in U. S. firms between 1987 and 1996. FDI spillovers are particularly strong in high-tech sectors, whereas they are largely absent in low-tech sectors. Small firms with low productivity benefit more from FDI spillovers than larger productivity firms with more productivity do.

The capitalization rate is hypothesized to be a function of the classic capital asset pricing model variable and variables intended to capture the expectation that the real market value of the building will change. The results show that the capitalization rate for office buildings incorporates a very low value for beta. A lower capitalization rate was associated with a smaller risk-free rate, a lower borrowing rate, class A buildings, newer buildings, buildings that had been renovated, a reduction in the vacancy rate in the downtown Chicago office market, and an increase in employment in the financial sector of the metropolitan area.","[McDonald, John F.] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Dermisi, Sofia] Roosevelt Univ, Chicago, IL 60605 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Roosevelt University,"McDonald, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",mcdonald@uic.edu; sdermisi@roosevelt.edu,,,,,,,13,16,16,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This case study can be seen a 'horizontal' type of Europeanization, whereby a (perceived successful) policy template adopted in one country is subsequently implicitly endorsed (hence, 'uploaded') at the EU level and then adopted (hence, 'downloaded') in other countries, albeit with considerable national variations. The two main caveats are that the British plan was not particularly innovative - it provided a functional solution to the problem at hand - and the adoption of similar measures across Europe was politically feasible because this did not envisage any substantial EU-level intervention as it proposed parallel national solutions to a common problem.","Univ Sussex, Dept Polit & Contemporary European Studies, Brighton BN1 9RG, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Quaglia, L (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Polit & Contemporary European Studies, Brighton BN1 9RG, E Sussex, England.",L.Quaglia@sussex.ac.uk,,"Quaglia, Lucia/0000-0001-8816-0583",,,,,40,27,28,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In complex voting mechanisms, voters' optimal strategy may vary with the size of the electorate. Therefore, in order to interpret optimal voting as sincere for complex voting mechanisms, we describe the optimal voting strategy when voters not only have no information but also have no pivotal power, i.e., as the size of the electorate tends to infinity.","[Angel Ballester, Miguel; Rey-Biel, Pedro] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Unitat Fonaments Anal Econ, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Ballester, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Unitat Fonaments Anal Econ, Desp B3-158,Edifici B,Campus Bellaterra, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",MiguelAngel.Ballester@uab.es; pedro.rey@uab.es,"Ballester, Miguel Angel Gonzalez/D-1349-2013; Rey-Biel, Pedro/H-6213-2015","Ballester, Miguel Angel Gonzalez/0000-0002-9227-6826; Rey-Biel, Pedro/0000-0002-1606-2631",,,,,25,5,7,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2009,33.0,3,,,,,477,494,,10.1007/s00355-009-0374-8,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,480YR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268773700008,0

While much research has focused on the required preconditions (especially property rights) and efficiency effects of tourism partnerships, a Nash bargaining model allows us to assess the distributive effects of such contracts. In particular, variables such as insecure community land tenure, and the resulting reduced value of land, the remoteness of lodges and the community's impatience and attitude towards risk could explain why rural communities have not so far captured the lion's share from tourism activities in communal lands. Finally, the paper shows that future research will be needed to complete the model in order to provide an account of the contractual problems that limit the efficiency of tourism partnerships in rural areas - transaction costs and underinvestment.","Univ Versailles St Quentin en Yvelines, Ctr Econ & Eth Environm & Dev C3ED, F-78047 Guyancourt, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Lapeyre, R (通讯作者)，Univ Versailles St Quentin en Yvelines, Ctr Econ & Eth Environm & Dev C3ED, 47 Blvd Vauban, F-78047 Guyancourt, France.",Renaud.Lapeyre@c3ed.uvsq.fr,,,,,,,26,7,8,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

A feminist theoretical framework has been used to analyse data from 31 in-depth interviews with women working in both the consulting and contracting parts of the industry. The study highlights cultural issues of visibility and the presenteeism ethos of the sector as well as the material constraints of construction sites. Women are taking up senior management posts but only in very few numbers.

In addition, research hospitals are a key component of the knowledge-based economy supporting an experienced and educated workforce and originating and transferring knowledge and innovation. Despite their importance, hospitals have been understudied from an economic development perspective. The lack of attention is, in part, because of the perception of health care as a nonbasic or locally serving activity that has little impact on driving a metropolitan area's economic development. This article uses patient-origin data from the 2004 American Hospital Directory to determine the magnitude of Medicare exports from 62 hospitals in five slow-growth or lagging metropolitan areas. This research indicates that hospitals are substantial contributors to the economic base of these regions and identifies characteristics of top exporting hospitals.","Univ New Orleans, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA",University of Louisiana System; University of New Orleans,"Nelson, M (通讯作者)，Univ New Orleans, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA.",,,,,,,,40,14,16,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This study represents the first attempt to empirically investigate the extent to which firms' location choices in a large Chinese city are influenced by the tradeoff between greater external economies from adjacent employment density, on the one hand, and the higher wage cost due to longer commuting, on the other hand, as predicted by the endogenous urban structure model of Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg [Lucas, R.E. Jr. and Rossi-Hansberg, E., 2002. On the internal structure of cities. Econometrica 70, 1445-1476.]. Employing a large-scale worker survey and job density data from Beijing, we find that locations with higher adjacent job density tend to require longer commuting, and private-sector firms pay a wage premium in these locations. We also find such wage premium to be more significant for skill-intensive firms. These findings reveal the rise of agglomeration economies in Beijing that shapes its urban form evolution.

Tourism is an activity that is interrelated strongly with the economic system since Portugal as a whole and specific regions in particular rely on the performance of tourism for their economic activity. Moreover, because economic cycles affect tourism development, it is highly vulnerable to economic fluctuations. Most tourists who visit Portugal are from the European Union, especially Western Europe. Statistics are based on the number of overnight stays in hotel accommodation and other similar establishments. In 2005, the main source markets were the UK (30-7%), Germany (16.5%), Spain (11.5%), the Netherlands (6.8%), France (4.7%), Ireland (3.6%) and Italy (3.1%). These values show that the UK has the greatest share of visitors to Algarve. The purpose of this paper is to propose a modelling approach that best fits the tourism flow pattern in order to support forecasting. The paper contributes to our understanding of the relationship between economic cycles and tourism flows to Portugal (Algarve) and explores the potential of applying the diffusion index model proposed by Stock and Watson (1999, 2002) for tourism demand forecasting.","[Andraz, Jorge L.

Wages are still considerably lower, the unemployment rate is about twice of the West German level, and the competitiveness of the East German economy seems to be low. This paper analyzes the process of (relative) wage adjustment in East Germany and the resulting development of competitiveness and unemployment differentials. We present estimates of the wage adjustment in East vs. West Germany based on wage convergence and effects of unemployment on wage growth. The central focus of the paper is the empirical analysis of the interaction of the development of competitiveness and the labor market situation. The results reveal large equilibrium gaps for wages and unemployment which arc based on the wage-setting process, the behavior of competitiveness and the adjustment of unemployment.","[Smolny, Werner] Univ Ulm, Fac Math & Econ, Inst Econ Policy, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Smolny, Werner] Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany",Ulm University; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Smolny, W (通讯作者)，Univ Ulm, Fac Math & Econ, Inst Econ Policy, D-89069 Ulm, Germany.",Werner.Smolny@uni-ulm.de,,,,,,,24,17,19,0,12,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Throughout Europe and the United States, many policy makers see light rail as an interesting option to improve the accessibility Of urban centres. The Dutch national government wanted to support swift light rail realization in a number of promising Situations. Several projects gained support from the national government for implementation. However, the decision-making on a local level was not nearly as swift as expected and not in line with the promise. This paper presents ail analysis of that perceived slowdown and shows that the approach of the national government with a strict focus on light rail and a detachment from the local processes has played an important role in the slowdown. It shows that light rail can very well be a solid option.

In particular, we analyze to what extent these common features result in voting bias. We take as a case study the Eurovision Song Contest for which an extensive amount of historical data is available. In contrast to earlier studies we analyze the impact of common factors on the bias individually for each country, which is necessary to substantiate the publicly debated accusations of regional block voting by certain groups of countries. We establish strong evidence for voting bias in the song contest on the basis of geography, even after correction for culture, language, religion and ethnicity. However, these effects do generally not correspond to the usual accusations. We believe that our findings extend to all instances where groups of jury members or peer voters share certain common factors, which may cause voting bias.

It differs from previous studies in several aspects. First, the model incorporates non-standard features of the Vietnamese economy (e.g. changes in the domestic tax system). Second, the model divides Vietnamese households into 10 groups, allowing for the assessment of household welfare and income distribution. Third, the model has been run employing the most up-to-date database available. The major findings are summarised as follows. First, Vietnam as a whole would benefit from trade liberalisation. Second, the overall gain would be accompanied by a redistribution of income and a moderate increase in inequality between the rich and the poor. Third, concerning sectoral output, export-oriented sectors, sectors with large shares of input in total imports, and those with increased domestic demands are likely to expand, whereas, in contrast, domestic-oriented sectors are likely to contract. Measures to increase labour mobility, target disadvantaged groups and areas, and further liberalise service sectors are recommended as the recipe for effective utilisation of integration, as well as a more equitable pattern of growth.","[Nguyen Khanh Doanh] Thai Nguyen Univ Econ & Business Adm, Thai Nguyen, Vietnam; [Heo, Yoon] Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Thai Nguyen University; Sogang University,"Nguyen, KD (通讯作者)，Thai Nguyen Univ Econ & Business Adm, Thai Nguyen, Vietnam.",,"Doanh, Nguyen/AAJ-7598-2021","Doanh, Nguyen/0000-0002-5052-908X",,,,,24,6,6,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2009,32.0,4,,,,,606,628,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01166.x,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,421TB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264380100004,0

The author therefore conducts a stochastic analysis of the problem of trip scheduling during the slack season. He describes first a general model that accounts for the common features of sightseeing trips to city attractions and to locations such as fjords and lakes. Second, he determines the long-run fraction of time for which the transport-providing firm is unable to satisfy the demand for trips. Third, he ascertains the long-run fraction of demand that is lost to the transport-providing firm. Finally, he generalizes the analysis and considers the case in which a key, exogenously given variable is random and not constant.","Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology,"Batabyal, AA (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, 92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",aabgsh@rit.edu,,"Batabyal, Amitrajeet/0000-0001-7813-1519",,,,,10,10,10,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Microdata suggest that there is heterogeneity across industries. Specifically, incumbent productivity growth and patenting is positively correlated with lagged greenfield foreign firm entry in technologically advanced industries, but not in laggard industries. In this paper we provide evidence that these correlations arise from a causal effect predicted by Schumpeterian growth theory-the threat of technologically advanced entry spurs innovation incentives in sectors close to the technology frontier, where successful innovation allows incumbents to survive the threat, but discourages innovation in laggard sectors, where the threat reduces incumbents' expected rents from innovating. We find that the empirical patterns hold using rich micro panel data for the United Kingdom. We control for the endogeneity of entry by exploiting major European and U. K. policy reforms, and allow for endogeneity of additional factors. We complement the analysis for foreign entry with evidence for domestic entry and entry through imports.","[Aghion, Philippe] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Blundell, Richard; Griffith, Rachel] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Howitt, Peter] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Harvard University; University of London; University College London; Brown University,"Aghion, P (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Griffith, Rachel S/A-2583-2009; Blundell, Richard William/C-1552-2008","Griffith, Rachel S/0000-0002-8616-5820; Blundell, Richard William/0000-0003-1588-2299",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-544-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,47,425,474,18,173,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Decision choice follows probability estimates and errors in choice derive mainly from errors in judgment. In the studies reported here we use the Monty Hall dilemma to illustrate that judgment and choice do not always go together, and that such a dissociation can lead to better decision-making. Specifically, we demonstrate that in certain decision problems, exceeding working memory limitations can actually improve decision choice. We show across four experiments that increasing the number of choice alternatives forces people to collapse choices together, resulting in better decision-making. While choice performance improves, probability judgments do not change, thus demonstrating an important dissociation between choice and probability judgments. We propose the Collapsing Choice Theory (CCT) which explains how working memory capacity, probability estimation, choice alternatives, judgment, and regret all interact and effect decision quality.","[Stibel, Jeffrey M.] Web Com Inc, Ponte Vedra Beach, FL 32082 USA; [Dror, Itiel E.] Univ Southampton, Sch Psychol, Southampton, Hants, England; [Ben-Zeev, Talia] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Psychol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",University of Southampton; California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Stibel, JM (通讯作者)，Web Com Inc, 398 Royal Tern Rd S, Ponte Vedra Beach, FL 32082 USA.",jstibel@yahoo.com; id@ecs.soton.ac.uk,"Stibel, Jeff/AFL-8228-2022; Stibel, Jeff/AAG-8224-2022; Dror, Itiel/V-3195-2019","Stibel, Jeff/0000-0003-0417-6487; Stibel, Jeff/0000-0003-0417-6487; Dror, Itiel/0000-0003-4866-209X",,,,,48,9,17,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2009,66.0,2,,,,,149,179,,10.1007/s11238-007-9094-7,0.0,,,31,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,402BY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262990400002,0

Allocation is inferred from independently pooled cross-sectional data on the height, weight and body mass of 32,584 prisoners from a London House of Correction. As boys and girls moved into adulthood, they made some biological gains consistent with 'catch up' on earlier deprivation. The body masses of women and men then diverged. When families grew, women shrank. When children left home taking their wages with them, when age reduced the earning capacities of herself and her husband, women suffered even more, becoming dangerously underweight in older age.

We find that realized range-based bi-power variation (RBV), which is also immune to jumps, is a better regressor for future volatility prediction, significantly outperforming the AR model.

However, some important non-tradable aspects of their service such as quality of service and network energy losses are often not part of the analysis. Moreover, technical or cost efficiency should not be achieved at the expense of allocative and economic efficiency. Valuation of service quality for regulatory models is particularly difficult. This paper presents an empirical approach to measure and incorporate service quality and energy losses into the analysis of technical and allocative efficiency of the utilities. We apply our method to the case of the distribution networks in the UK between 1990/91 and 2003/04 using the data envelopment analysis technique. We find that the efficiency of the utilities improved during the first and second five-year distribution price control reviews but exhibited a slight decline during the third review period. We find relatively low allocative efficiency - i.e. a mismatch in allocating resources among expenditures, service quality, and network energy losses. The results suggest that currently the utilities may not be correctly incentivised to achieve socially optimal trade-offs between these.","[Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England; [Yu, William; Pollitt, Michael] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Jamasb, T (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Sidgwick Ave,Austin Robinson Bldg, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.",tooraj.jamasb@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,ESRC Electricity Policy Research Group,ESRC Electricity Policy Research Group(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We acknowledge the support of the ESRC Electricity Policy Research Group.

Many resources necessary for agricultural production were required by the war economy and led to shortages and shrinking supplies. Many agricultural laborers were drafted and the blockade imposed by the allies prevented Germany from a great deal of imports. As a consequence, the nutritional situation was devastating, particularly after 1916. and hit all groups of the German society. The period under observation provides one of most drastic natural experiments in the 20th century. This study uses anthropometric data from German soldiers who served in the Second World War to trace living standards between the 1900s and the 1920s. In contrast to other approaches, this paper is able to distinguish between social groups by occupation, religious denominatio\n, regional origin, and city size. The results suggest that although all social strata were hit by famine conditions, the height of farmers, urban citizens. Catholics, and especially individuals born in the highly integrated food-import regions along the coast and the banks of the Rhine declined most. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This paper critically assesses this legislation with respect to its economic and technological underpinnings. First, we argue that the reliance on targets based on per-kilometer emissions not only conceals the true cost of compliance and thereby stifles informed public discourse, but is also less cost-effective than alternative measures such as emissions trading. Second, the emission targets stipulated in this legislation are based on linear-regression methods that we demonstrate to be poorly justified and misleading. Using instead stochastic-frontier analysis, which is argued to more accurately reflect the industry's technological status quo, alternative targets are consequently proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The road transport sector makes up 88% of total transport emissions and the projected emissions increase from 1990 to 2020 is 64%. Achieving prospective emission reduction targets will pose major challenges for the road transport sector. This paper investigates two targets for reducing Australian road transport greenhouse gas emissions, and what they might mean for the sector: emissions in 2020 being 20% below 2000 levels; and emissions in 2050 being 80% below 2000 levels. Six ways in which emissions might be reduced to achieve these targets are considered. The analysis suggests that major behavioural and technological changes will be required to deliver significant emission reductions, with very substantial reductions in vehicle emission intensity being absolutely vital to making major inroads in road transport GHG emissions.

In this paper, this potential is investigated further, and an algorithm is proposed for proactively detecting sites where the collision rate is not sufficiently high to be classified as a high collision concentration location but where a systematic deterioration of safety level is observed. The approach proposed compares the weighted CRP across different years and uses the cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm to detect the sites where changes in collision rate are observed. The CRPs of the detected sites are then compared for reproducibility. When high reproducibility is observed, a growth factor is used for sequential hypothesis testing to determine if the collision profiles are increasing over time. Findings from applying the proposed method using empirical data are documented in the paper together with a detailed description of the method.

This occurs most sharply among countries that experienced the biggest changes in their exchange rate policy. An implication of New Keynesian sticky price theory is that monetary policy has a first-order impact on labor share through the interaction of business cycle uncertainty and the choice of optimal markups.

We build several proxies for a REIT's position within its property segment. Consistent with the competitive equilibrium model of Maksimovic and Zechner (1991), we find that a REIT's volatility of operating performance relative to the median volatility of operating performance of its segment peers is an important determinant of its leverage ratio. We also find that a REIT's leverage ratio depends on the median leverage ratio in its segment. Leverage is also related to a REIT's status as an incumbent and its role as a leader in the property segment.","[Ertugrul, Mine] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Accounting & Finance, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Giambona, Erasmo] Univ Amsterdam, Finance Grp, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University of Amsterdam,"Giambona, E (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Accounting & Finance, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",mine.ertugrul@umb.edu; e.giambona@uva.nl,,,,,,,36,12,13,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The research data are drawn from a large scale survey and in-depth interviews with Indian call centre workers, focusing on their lifestyles and social values. Comparison is made with Indian and international youth cohorts. The research findings demonstrate the extent to which this group has adopted transnational middle class values and lifestyles.

The primary reason for this is that tourism is not designated as an 'industry' in standard economic accounts. This paper therefore demonstrates the relevance and need for applied general equilibrium (AGE) models to be completed and extended through an integration with tourism satellite accounts (TSAs) as a tool for policy makers (especially tourism policy makers) in South Africa. The paper sets out the reasons behind the need for economic models for policy analysis and other purposes, and gives an overview of old and new approaches to tourism policy modelling. The relevance of integrated models to, specifically, tourism policy analysis both internationally and in the South African context is discussed, followed by an illustrative empirical simulation of an exogenous inbound tourism expansion of 10%, against the background of the relationship between tourism and economic development. Furthermore, the indirect effects of an input-output model are also presented for comparison. The results confirm that the integrated approach is a more accurate tool for policy analysis.","[Rossouw, Riaan] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Midrand, South Africa; [Rossouw, Riaan] Eon Consulting, Midrand, South Africa; [Saayman, Melville] North West Univ, Inst Tourism Wildlife Econ & Leisure Studies, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; North West University - South Africa,"Rossouw, R (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom Campus, Midrand, South Africa.",riaan.rossouw@eon.co.za; Melville.Saayman@nwu.ac.za,,"saayman, melville/0000-0001-9991-0140; Rossouw, Riaan/0000-0003-1761-6488",,,,,90,13,17,1,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The assumption was that inequality, when measured as death rates, was on steady decline, possibly even on the brink of disappearing. The question is then, how far back in time can social differences in mortality be traced? Can they be traced back to the agricultural society or are they a result of industrialization? Whether or not these differences are the result of the industrial revolution became a lively debated issue at the time and has continued to be discussed to date. While many scholars have taken a Malthusian view, that mortality in the past was largely determined by economic factors, others argue that mortality was determined by non-economic factors, leaving little room for a social gradient in mortality. Due to lack of coherent data covering long time periods, our knowledge has been based on bits and pieces of evidence from various locations and time periods. The evidence used is not only fragmentary but furthermore only partly comparable as different definitions of social class and mortality have been used. Here we present results from seven new studies of locations in Western and Southern Europe, the US and Canada for which individual-level longitudinal data exists during the industrialization period. Most of these studies cover also the first part of the twentieth century, a period for which such microdata hitherto has largely been lacking. Taken together, they have a wide geographic coverage and a very long time horizon. Based on these studies, we argue that social differences appeared both long before and long after the industrial breakthrough, in both cases implying that these differences are not directly related to industrialization. We also argue that the association between income and mortality observed today most likely is a recent phenomenon. Overall, a causal link between income and mortality is put into question.

As for the decision to participate in obesity prevention therapy, the results show that the price charged for therapy is the key factor. Furthermore, the gender, education, income, the concern that work achievement is affected by obesity, and health condition variables are found to be important and significant determinants of the decision to participate in the therapy. The average willingness to pay for obesity reduction therapy which could reduce weight by 5 kg in 3 months is estimated to be NT$12,531 (US$362) among the sample respondents. The results of the profile analysis suggest that obese females with high education, high income, who think that obesity affects work achievement, and who have tried to control their weight are the most likely to be willing to pay the greatest amount for the weight-reduction therapy.

The dynamic interaction between these variables is examined within a vector error correction model using the Johansen technique of cointegration with structural changes and the multivariate Granger causality test. The authors consider that tourism may affect economic growth through two different channels, the TLG and TKIG mechanisms. Their findings reveal a complex picture of the relationship between these variables. There seems to be no TLG mechanism in Tunisia, while the TKIG mechanism appears as a short-run phenomenon only. In total, tourism exports have contributed significantly towards financing the country's imports of capital goods, but they have not been the principal engine of long-term growth. On the contrary, the results support the hypothesis of a growth-led tourism in this country. They also provide evidence of a strong unidirectional causality from economic growth to imports of capital goods.","[Cortes-Jimenez, Isabel] Univ Barcelona, Reg Quantitat Res Grp AQR IREA, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Nowak, Jean-Jacques] Univ Lille 1, EQUIPPE, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Sahli, Mondher] Univ Savoie, IREGE, Le Bourget Du Lac, France; [Sahli, Mondher] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand",University of Barcelona; Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; Universite Savoie Mont Blanc; Victoria University Wellington,"Cortés-Jiménez, I (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Reg Quantitat Res Grp AQR IREA, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",isabel.cortes.jimenez@gmail.com; Jean-jacques.nowak@univ-lillel.fr; mondher.sahli@vuw.ac.nz,,,,,,,55,64,66,1,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The analysis reveals that liberal policies and labour inadequacy in cotton harvest have led to a decline in the cotton production acreage in Cukurova, Aegean and Antalya regions in the long run. On the other hand, it is suggested that the cotton producers in the Cukurova and Antalya regions have limited cotton-producing areas as they perceive cotton price as risky. Yet, as more agricultural lands in the region are opened up for irrigation, the amount of land devoted to cotton production has been increasing. The price of cotton has led to a rise in the cotton production acreage, while the price of the competitive products in regions other than the Southeast (e.g. maize, tomato) and labour inadequacy during harvest have diminished the area devoted to cotton production. Consequently, it can be said that Turkey may not meet the cotton requirement of the textile industry with its own production and will be dependent on imports in the close future.","[Ozkan, Burhan; Karaman, Suleyman] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,"Ozkan, B (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey.",,"Ozkan, Burhan/C-9583-2016; KARAMAN, Suleyman/C-6000-2016","Ozkan, Burhan/0000-0002-9799-654X; KARAMAN, Suleyman/0000-0003-0042-7912",Scientific Research Projects Administration Unit of Akdeniz University,Scientific Research Projects Administration Unit of Akdeniz University(Akdeniz University),This paper was supported by the Scientific Research Projects Administration Unit of Akdeniz University.,,32,3,4,0,2,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2011,10.0,2,,,,,42,50,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,793WJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292854300006,0

As an upper bound, we estimate that the contribution of modern gains in height and in BMI to the mortality decline of tuberculosis ranges from one-fourth to one-half with the rest explained by the decline in the prevalence of water and airborne diseases, especially diarrhea, dysentery, and typhoid played.

We use data from the Health and Retirement Study that was fielded in February 2008 through February 2009. The effect of the crash is identified from the date of the interview, which is shown to be exogenous to previous stock market expectations. We estimate the effect of the crash on the population average of expected returns, the population average of the uncertainty about returns (subjective standard deviation), and the cross-sectional heterogeneity in expected returns (disagreement). We show estimates from simple reduced-form regressions on probability answers as well as from a more structural model that focuses on the parameters of interest and separates survey noise from relevant heterogeneity. We find a temporary increase in the population average of expectations and uncertainty right after the crash. The effect on cross-sectional heterogeneity is more significant and longer lasting, which implies substantial long-term increase in disagreement. The increase in disagreement is larger among the stockholders, the more informed, and those with higher cognitive capacity, and disagreement co-moves with trading volume and volatility in the market.

Among other approaches to investigate this puzzle, recent research has started to elicit private households' expectations of stock market returns. This paper reports findings from a study that collected data over a 2-year period both on households' stock market expectations (subjective probabilities of gains or losses) and on whether they own stocks. We document substantial heterogeneity in financial market expectations. Expectations are correlated with stock ownership.

We adapt for voter conformism the generalized Wittman-Roemer model of political competition, which views political competition as the one between parties with factions of the opportunists and the militants that Nash-bargain one another, and consider three special cases of the general model: the Hotelling-Downs model, the classical Wittman-Roemer model, and what we call the ideological-party model. We find that the presence of voter conformism significantly affects the nature of political competition, and its effect on political equilibrium is quite different depending on the model one uses. In the Hotelling-Downs model, political parties put forth an identical policy at the equilibrium, regardless of the type of voter conformism, and this is the only equilibrium. In both the ideological-party and classical Wittman-Roemer models, parties propose differentiated policies at the equilibrium, and the extent of policy differentiation depends on the degree of voter conformism.","Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, W (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",woojinlee@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,22,5,5,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2011,36.0,3-4,,,,,423,449,,10.1007/s00355-010-0515-0,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,726TZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287750400004,0

Travel time to CBD measures incorporating the rapid transport network, however, clearly outperform traditional distance to CBD measures in terms of explanatory power. The evolution of the rapid transit network, and the subsequent changes in travel times to the CBD, explain almost three quarter of the overall trend in decentralization.

We consider the case of a coal plant that operates in a deregulated electricity market where natural gas-fired plants are the marginal units. We assume specific stochastic processes for the fundamental uncertainties in our model: coal price, natural gas price, and emission allowance price. The underlying parameters are derived from actual futures markets. They are further used in a three-dimensional binomial lattice to assess the decision to abandon.

In economics, the idea of comparison, aspiration or relative income belongs to this theoretical framework. The first systematic usages of this notion can be found in the works of Keynes and Duesenberry. After these works the concept was relatively ignored by orthodox theorists until its recent re-appearance, mainly in the fields of labour and macroeconomics. To the contrary, however, income comparisons continued to play a role in much of Keynesian inspired and non-mainstream economics literature. In the past few years it has made a strong comeback in the literature of job satisfaction and of the economics of happiness. This paper attempts to trace the development of the concept in the modern history of economic thought. It also discusses the main theoretical implications of adopting income comparisons and possible reasons for its relative disregard by orthodox economics.","Univ Athens, Athens 16121, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Drakopoulos, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Univ Campus 161 21, Athens 16121, Greece.",sdrakop@phs.uoa.gr,"Drakopoulos, Stavros A./H-5089-2019","Drakopoulos, Stavros A./0000-0001-9884-9261",,,,,119,9,9,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

In this way the central bank moves preemptively to reduce the risk of large deviations of the economy from the steady state that would deteriorate the distribution forecasts of the output gap and inflation.

The key purpose of student evaluations on the extent of quality assurance implementation in higher education institutions is to provide feedback that might lead to better cost effectiveness and higher competitiveness in the higher education sector. The literature on quality in higher education showed that there had been some evaluations of perception of quality in higher education, yet few studies have conducted psychometric analyses in order to develop a simple questionnaire for students to assess the quality assurance implementation in the higher education as a whole. This paper addresses the validity of QHEQ using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) conducted on data from a sample of 768 undergraduates from two Malaysian universities. The results revealed that a five-factor model represents the best-fitting model for quality in higher education perceived by the undergraduate students. In addition, Bollen-Stine bootstrap was employed to correct for standard error and fit statistic bias that occurs in structural equation modeling applications due to non-normal data. The QHEQ has substantial evidence for reliability and construct validity. Hence, the instrument is recommended for the measurement student experiences on quality in higher education.","[Tang, Siew-Fun] Taylors Univ, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor Darul, Malaysia",Taylor's University,,siewfun.tang@taylors.edu.my,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,2,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8868-8,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,8.0,,,,,,119,126,,,,,,8,Economics; Information Science & Library Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BZX69,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303218400023,0

This increase in cross-border production-sharing activities in the auto industry led to intra-industry trade (IIT) in auto-parts. In this study, the extent of IIT in the US auto-parts industry is examined by decomposing trade into inter-industry trade, vertical IIT and horizontal IIT. Then the development of vertical IIT is analysed as an indicator of international fragmentation between the US and 29 trading partners. Several country-specific hypotheses suggested by the fragmentation literature are tested for the period 1989-2006. The results indicate that a substantial portion of IIT in the US auto-parts industry is vertical IIT, and the econometric results generally support the hypotheses drawn from the theory. In particular, the findings show that the extent of the US vertical IIT is positively correlated with average market size, differences in market size, differences in factor endowments and outward foreign direct investment, while it is negatively correlated with distance and differences in per capita GDP.","[Tuerkcan, Kemal; Ates, Aysegul] Akdeniz Univ, Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,"Türkcan, K (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, Antalya, Turkey.",,"Türkcan, Kemal/N-3771-2019; Türkcan, Kemal/C-2309-2016; Ates, Aysegul/AAB-8685-2019","Türkcan, Kemal/0000-0001-9055-7280; Türkcan, Kemal/0000-0001-9055-7280;",,,,,44,16,21,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2011,34.0,1,,,,,154,172,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01316.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,708YX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286401300007,0

Data collection using self-report questionnaires in both studies was conducted between 2003 and 2005. Effects of the intervention in terms of fruit and vegetable intake were assessed and epidemiological modeling (conducted in 2008) was used to estimate the number of disability-adjusted life years gained over the lifetime of all 10 years old in the Netherlands. We assumed 30% of the effect on consumption was permanent. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) and net monetary benefits (NMB) were estimated and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. The ICER for the Pro Children intervention in comparison with no intervention was estimated at (sic)5728/DALY and the ICER for the Schoolgruiten intervention in comparison with no intervention at (sic)10,674/DALY. Using the Dutch per capita income as a decision threshold ((sic)19,600) the probability that the Pro Children intervention was cost-effective in comparison with no intervention was 80% and that the Schoolgruiten intervention was cost-effective in comparison with no intervention was 68%. The Pro Children had a 70% chance of being dominant over the Schoolgruiten intervention in terms of cost-effectiveness. The current cost-effectiveness model shows that both the Pro Children intervention and the Schoolgruiten intervention were cost-effective in comparison with no intervention. Extensive sensitivity analyses showed that the conclusions were sensitive to the discount rate and the proportion of effects that remains lifelong. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The occurrence of a new variant in Southeast Asia that overcomes the resistance in Cavendish clones such as 'Grand Naine' (AAA) is a major concern to current banana production worldwide. The threat posed by this new variant, called tropical race 4 (TR4), may be overcome by the introduction of resistant cultivars. However, the identification of new resistant sources or breeding for resistance is a long-term effort. Currently, the only option to control the disease is to avoid or reduce the spread of the pathogen by eradication of infected plants and isolation of infested plantations. This requires sensitive and highly specific diagnostics that enable early detection of the pathogen. A two-locus database of DNA sequences, from over 800 different isolates from multiple formae speciales of F. oxysporum, was used to develop a molecular diagnostic tool that specifically detects isolates from the vegetative compatibility group (VCG) 01213, which encompasses the Foc TR4 genotype. This diagnostic tool was able to detect all Foc TR4 isolates tested, while none of the Foc isolates from 19 VCGs other than 01213 showed any reaction. In addition, the developed diagnostic tool was able to detect Foc TR4 when using DNA samples from different tissues of 'Grand Naine' plants inoculated with TR4 isolates.","[Waalwijk, C.; Dita, M.

Among the sports items, swimming is one that children like every much and it is also very suitable for them. It has been found that swimming is very helpful to strengthen children's physique and improve their health level. The younger the children are, the lower the calcification degree is. The smaller proportion is good to float children's body. In childhood, their muscles are in the very growing period. The ratio of muscle weight to body weight improves quickly. The arm muscle, leg muscle and tissues are strong. Children are very energetic. Their hope to use and control physical strength comes into being. Their understanding of sport and techniques becomes deeper. Furthermore, children's large muscle groups develop early. Thus, childhood is an ideal period for doing exercise caused by the large muscle groups, while when their small muscles become stronger; their movements begin to enter the refined stage. Therefore, learning swimming during the childhood is appropriate. Swimming can bring children both health and happiness. With the development of the swimming in our country, many children will learn swimming by taking part in the fast swimming training class in the summer. However, there are some problems in the traditional swimming teaching process, and as a result learners cannot master the skills effectively. With literature, expert interview and logic deduction, the article makes a study on how to teach children to learn breaststroke. A new teaching method is put forward and has got a good teaching effect. It hopes to offer some help for children's swimming learning and provide some theoretical reference for breaststroke teaching.","[Wang, Jinzhuang] Mianyang Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Hlth Educ, Mianyang, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Mianyang Teachers' College,,wangjinzhuang2011@163.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,7,ETP-ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY PRESS,HONG KONG,"ROOM 2202, PING CHUN HOUSE PING TIN ESTATE, LAM TIN, KOWLOON, HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-988-18242-8-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,58,60,,,,,,3,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BVY48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000293147200018,0

Two markets, a major export centre, Chicago, and a major importer, Liverpool, are analysed. We show that the law of one price equilibrium was an 'attractor equilibrium'. The implication is that prices converged to that equilibrium in a tatonnement process. Because of asymmetrically timed information between markets separated by long distances there were periods of excess demand as well as excess supply, which triggered off the tatonnement process. Over time, adjustments to equilibrium, as measured by the half-life of a shock, became faster and violations of the law of one price become smaller. There were significant gains from improved market efficiency, which took place after the information 'regime' shifted from pre-telegraphic communication to a regime with swift transmission of information in an era that saw the development of a sophisticated commercial press and telegraphic communication. This article is the first attempt to actually measure the gains from improved market efficiency and it demonstrates that improved market efficiency probably stimulated trade more than falling transatlantic transport costs. Deadweight losses decline significantly as markets became more efficient. The conventional view that Harberger triangles are almost always insignificant is challenged.","[Ejrnaes, Mette; Persson, Karl Gunnar] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Ejrnæs, M (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",Mette.Ejrnes@econ.ku.dk,,,,,,,16,25,29,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Because the shocks were unanticipated and large, they are a plausible instrument for identifying the impact of exporting on firm productivity and other outcomes. We find that firms whose export destinations experience greater currency depreciation have slower export growth and that export growth leads to increases in firm productivity and other firm performance measures.

It was first introduced in the economic literature by Arbia and Espa (1996) and then popularized by Marcon and Puech (2003), Quah and Simpson (2003), Duranton and Overman (2005), and Arbia et al. (2008). In particular in Arbia et al. (2008) we used Ripley's K-functions as instruments to study the inter-sectoral co-agglomeration pattern of firms in a single moment of time. All this research has followed a static approach by disregarding the time dimension. Temporal dynamics, on the other hand, play a crucial role in understanding the economic and social phenomena particularly when referring to the analysis of the individual choices leading to the observed clusters of economic activities. With respect to previous contributions to the literature, this paper uncovers the process of firm demography by studying the dynamics of localization through space-time K-functions. The empirical part of the paper will focus on the study of the long run localization of firms in the area of Rome (Italy), by concentrating on the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector data collected by the Italian Industrial Union in the period 1920-2005.

We examine this issue using a unique data set-all private condominium transactions in Singapore during an eleven-year period. We model directly the price discovery process for individual dwellings. Our empirical results clearly reject a random walk in prices, supporting mean reversion in housing prices and diffusion of innovations over space. We find that, when house prices and aggregate returns are computed from models that erroneously assume a random walk and spatial independence, they are strongly autocorrelated. However, when they are calculated from the appropriate model, predictability in prices and in investment returns is completely absent. We show that this is due to the illiquid nature of housing transactions. We also conduct extensive simulations, over different time horizons and with different investment rules, testing whether better information on housing price dynamics leads to superior investment performance.","[Hwang, Min] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC USA; [Quigley, John M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",George Washington University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hwang, M (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Washington, DC USA.",min@gwu.edu; quigley@econ.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,19,12,12,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In this paper, we construct a simple model of commuters using a highway with multiple lanes, in which commuters are heterogeneous in their carpool organization costs. We first look at the HOV lanes and investigate under what conditions introducing HOV lanes is socially beneficial. Then we examine whether converting HOV lanes to HOT lanes improves the efficiency of road use. It is shown that the result depends on functional form and parameter values. We also discuss the effect of alternative policies: simple congestion pricing without lane division; and congestion pricing with HOV lanes. The analysis using specific functional form is presented to explicitly obtain the conditions determining the rankings of HOV, HOT, and other policies based on aggregate social cost.

The results reject exogeneity of initial conditions and show the importance of state dependence. We compare the results to those obtained with a younger sample and find evidence of a sorting process over the life-cycle whereby men's employment transitions are increasingly characterized by state dependence while, for women, unobserved heterogeneity becomes more important.

It now faces two major external challenges. The first is to develop a strategic vision for a potentially tumultuous emerging multi-polar world. The European Council's December 2008 'Report on the Implementation of the European Security Strategy' recognized that, over the last five years, the threats facing the EU had become 'increasingly complex', that 'we must be ready to shape events [by] becoming more strategic in our thinking'. The second challenge is to help nudge the other major actors towards a multilateral global grand bargain. Such a bargain will be the necessary outcome of the transition from a US-dominated post-1945 liberal world order, towards a new 21st-century order accommodating the rising powers and sensitive to the needs of the global south. Without such a comprehensive and co-operative bargain, the emerging multi-polar world will be rife with tensions and highly conflict-prone.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Howorth, J (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, 115 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",jolyon.howorth@yale.edu,,,,,,,94,88,93,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Illiquidity stems from heterogeneity in agent real estate valuations. The variance of agent valuations determines how quickly prices adjust following a shock to fundamentals. We examine the predictions of the model by studying price depreciation in Japanese land values subsequent to the 1990 stock market crash. Commercial land values fell much more quickly than residential land values. As we would posit that the variance of buyer valuations would be greater for residential real estate than for commercial real estate, this model matches the Japanese experience.","[Krainer, John; Spiegel, Mark M.] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA; [Yamori, Nobuyoshi] Nagoya Univ, Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; Nagoya University,"Krainer, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",john.krainer@sf.frb.org; mark.spiegel@sf.frb.org; yamori@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Yamori, Nobuyoshi/JHS-6924-2023","Yamori, Nobuyoshi/0000-0002-4145-0476",,,,,20,5,6,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2010,38.0,2,,,,,171,196,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00264.x,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,600HL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277976000001,0

The expected profit, defined as the profit per unit time (inclusive of both occupied and vacant taxi times), that a taxi driver expects to receive from picking up a customer in a particular zone or location, has great impact on the taxi driver's choice of location in the search for customers. The fare structure directly governs the profitability of taxi rides of different distances originating from different locations. With these explicit considerations, the extended model is intended to look into the market effects of adopting a nonlinear fare structure with declining incremental charges. The proposed nonlinear fare structure could help restore a level-playing field for taxi operators whose businesses have been affected by some taxi drivers who resort to practices such as offering fare discounts or accepting requests for discounted fares from passengers for long-haul trips. Analysis of sensitivity of social welfare and profit gain as well as taxi/customer wait/search times is conducted with respect to the parameters in the nonlinear fare structure for the Hong Kong taxi market, and Pareto-improving nonlinear fare amendments are identified that neither disadvantage any customer nor reduce the taxi operators' profits.

The available data on the profitability of corrodies is limited and little analysed, and the episcopal condemnation of corrodies has been adopted by modern researchers. After recognising the difficulties, this paper applies an annuity pricing model to study corrody pricing. Given various assumptions, contrary to the established view, it is argued that the sale of corrodies was financially profitable for institutions. Finally, some reasons are considered for the negative attitude of contemporary and historical opinion towards the sale of corrodies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In a pure exchange economy, we examine the case where two contestable consumption goods are vital to two agents and initial endowments follow a binary distribution. In line with the existing literature, we examine in a two-stage game how the equilibrium security of claims to property is determined. We find that, depending on the exogenous preference and appropriation-effectiveness parameters, two different regimes emerge in equilibrium: trade and appropriation, and peaceful coexistence, with the latter regime exhibiting efficiency with respect to the goods traded. However, inefficiencies arise due to the investment in defensive activities necessary to deter appropriation. Thus, we have found an endogenously determined measure for the transaction cost underlying a market which replicates the outcome of a Walrasian market.","Univ Magdeburg, Dept Econ, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany",Otto von Guericke University,"Hoffmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Magdeburg, Dept Econ, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany.",magnus.hoffmann@ovgu.de,,,,,,,21,6,6,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2010,34.0,2,,,,,249,263,,10.1007/s00355-009-0395-3,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,551QT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274224800004,0

Employing a variety of propensity score matching methods, we find strong evidence that inflation targeting has significantly different impacts on exchange rate volatility and international reserves in different country groups. It significantly increases real and nominal exchange rate stability and international reserves in developing countries but lowers them in industrial countries. On average, inflation targeting increases (lowers) reserves roughly by the size of 1.3 (1.8) months of imports values in developing (industrial) countries. The treatment effects on targeting countries' current accounts are found to be insignificant in both country groups.","Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Lin, S (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",,"Lin, Shu-Chin/AAG-3608-2019",,,,,,21,47,51,0,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

These models fail to capture two important features of real elections. First, most elections pit a stronger candidate against a weaker one. Second, candidates care not only about holding office, but also about policy outcomes. Ignoring any one of these features means we will fail to capture an important dynamic-strong candidates must balance their desire to change policy with their need to win the election. We provide conditions for the existence of an equilibrium in the spatial model with non-policy factors, when candidates are policy motivated. We provide a characterization of 'regular' equilibria and show that there exists at most one regular equilibrium. We provide conditions that guarantee that all equilibria are regular. We derive comparative statics for the model and show that increasing a candidate's non-policy advantage causes that candidate to move towards his ideal point.","Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Peress, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",mperess@mail.rochester.edu,,,,,,,45,18,23,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2010,34.0,2,,,,,265,294,,10.1007/s00355-009-0396-2,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,551QT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274224800005,0

For example, comovements are important in cross-hedging and cross-speculation; they determine capital allocation both domestically and in international mean-variance portfolios and also, they are useful in investigating the extent of integration among financial markets. In this paper we propose a new methodology for the non-linear modelling of bivariate comovements. Our approach extends the ones presented in the recent literature. In fact, our methodology, outlined in three steps, allows the evaluation and the statistical testing of non-linearly driven comovements between two given random variables. Moreover, when such a bivariate dependence relationship is detected, our approach creates a polynomial approximation. We illustrate our three-step methodology to the time series of energy related asset prices. Finally, we exploit this dependence relationship and its polynomial approximation to obtain analytical approximations of the Greeks for the European call and put options in terms of an asset whose price comoves with the price of the underlying asset.","[Malliaris, A.

Two-level learning, or self-adaptation, incorporates certain strategy parameters into the representation of each individual. In this work, these strategy parameters provide the likelihood of mutation for the individual. These strategy parameters evolve by means of mutation and recombination, just as the object variables do. It is argued that self-adaptation over the parameter governing mutation can replace the election operator proposed by Arifovic (1994) in order to attain convergence to the rational expectations equilibrium. While both adaptive mutation and the election operator are sufficient for convergence, self-adaptation may be more appropriate when being compared with real-world or experimental economic data. Through analysis of a static environment it is shown that this convergence, however, will require a strong selective pressure only attained through a transformation of the baseline fitness function.","Univ Fraser Valley, Abbotsford, BC V2S 7M8, Canada",University of Fraser Valley,"Maschek, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Fraser Valley, 33844 King Rd, Abbotsford, BC V2S 7M8, Canada.",Michael.Maschek@ufv.ca,,,,,,,23,8,8,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The focus is to examine how travelers' value of time (VOT), which is continuously distributed in a population, affects the existence of a pricing-refunding scheme that is both self-financing (i.e. requiring no external subsidy) and Pareto-improving (i.e. reducing system travel time while making nobody worse off). A condition that insures the existence of a self-financing and Pareto-improving (SFPI) toll scheme is derived. Our derivation reveals that the toll authority can select a proper SFPI scheme to distribute the benefits from congestion pricing through a credit-based pricing scheme. Under mild assumptions, we prove that an SFPI toll always exists for concave VOT functions, of which the linear function corresponding to the uniform distribution is a special case. Existence conditions are also established for a class of rational functions. These results can be used to analyze more realistic VOT distributions such as log-normal distribution. A useful implication of our analysis is that the existence of an SFPI scheme is not guaranteed for general functional forms. Thus, external subsidies may be required to ensure Paretoimproving, even if policy-makers are willing to return all toll revenues to road users. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper argues that the debate around altruistic behaviour sparked by Richard Titmuss's analysis of the economics of blood donations in 1970 led to a succession of economic theories of charity, moving altruism from the fringes to the core of the theory. While initially based on the collective provision of public goods, they have now embraced the 'warm-glow' literature, but the full implications of behavioural economics for our understanding of charities have yet to be realised.","Univ Stirling, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4AL, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Rutherford, A (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4AL, Scotland.",ar34@stir.ac.uk,,"Rutherford, Alasdair/0000-0003-2530-1195",,,,,26,5,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Before 1935 a number of states had enacted their own OAA laws. After 1935 the federal government began offering matching grants and thus stimulated the adoption of OAA programs by the states. A new panel data set of 75 cities for each year between 1929 and 1938 combines mortality rates for older age groups with three measures of the OAA programs, spending on non-age-specific relief and a rich set of correlates. The data are analyzed using difference-in-difference-in-difference and instrumental variables methods. Our results suggest that old-age assistance in the 1930s had little impact on the death rate of the elderly. Our sense is that the OAA programs in the 1930s transferred the elderly from general relief programs without necessarily increasing the resources available to them. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The result shows that there's a structural break in the long equilibrium of real estate financial structural development and growth of real estate economy in the period of 2003Q4-2004Q4. It is because a series of economic and financial control measures has been taken since 2002. The negative influence brought by real estate economic growth during the sudden change of real estate financial structure is result of the impact on short equilibrium from reform measures. But in the long run, it won't influence equilibrium of long term. Co-integration error path shows real estate financial structure can't fit in real estate economic growth sometimes, which means it is necessary to make real estate financial reform or optimize financial structure. The current real estate financial structure is still bank dominant. So optimized direction of real estate finance is to free financial policies and to innovate financial instruments.

Although the existing cross-country differences have not been analyzed in depth, they contain important information on health production determinants. In this paper we apply a methodology for conducting standardized cross-country comparisons of body mass index (BMI). We draw on estimations of the marginal density function of BMI for Italy and Spain in 2003, two countries with similar GDP and socio-economic conditions. We produce different counterfactual distribution estimates using covariates (health production inputs) specified in a quantile regression. Our findings suggest that Spain-to-Italy BMI gaps among females are largely explained by cross-country variation in the returns to each covariate, especially for younger women. We find that adverse underlying determinants do not explain the gap observed in particular between younger Spanish females and their Italian counterfactuals; behavioural differences appear to be the key. We tentatively conclude that Spanish policy on obesity should target mainly younger females. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from interwar Japan,EUROPEAN REVIEW OF ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Historical experience is often invoked in the modern debate on competition among reserve currencies, yet little is known about quantitative aspects or institutional features of reserve management. By drawing on newly obtained data on foreign exchange reserves, especially those broken down by currency, this article explores the competition between the British pound sterling and the US dollar for the status of leading reserve currency in Japan during the interwar period. We find that competition between these two currencies remained undecided and that their relative status alternated repeatedly. Historical materials and the results of econometric analysis suggest that the key factors explaining a choice of reserve currencies are trade volumes and the currency denomination of external debt. The latter criteria supported maintaining sterling's status as a reserve currency for the interwar period, reflecting its considerable share in debt service generated through issues that had been launched when London was the sole international market. The stability of potential reserve currencies is shown to be crucial as well. We also find evidence of institutional factors, which include taxation, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on financial activities.",,,,mariko.hatase@boj.or.jp; mari.oonuki@boj.or.jp,,,,,,,36,3,6,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1361-4916,,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The resulting multi-method analyses draw on coded information on incivility, organizational context, and relational and status dynamics from a large population of organizational ethnographies (N=204). Analyses reveal that all forms of incivility except sexual harassment are rooted in organizational chaos. Qualitative rea immersion into these ethnographic accounts provides further insights into how conflicts endemic to paid employment and broader social closure projects surrounding class, race, and gender play a role as well, albeit often in distinct ways.","[Roscigno, Vincent J.; Hodson, Randy; Lopez, Steven H.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Sociol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Roscigno, VJ (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Sociol, Townshend Hall,Room 238,1885 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",roscigno.l@osu.edu; hodson.8@sociology.osu.edu; lopez.137@osu.edu,,,,,,,203,45,62,10,63,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Using unique administrative monthly data from local PES offices during 2004, we exploit the fact that the number of PES workers per job seeker varies substantially between offices and over time. We find additional PES workers to significantly increase outflow rates for short term unemployed (i.e. the first half year of unemployment), whereas no effects are obtained for the outflow rates of long term unemployed. PES workers are also found to reduce the inflow into the schemes and to increase the number of vacancies that are registered by offices. Although the effectiveness of PES workers is limited, we conclude that changes in the number of PES workers per client are cost-effective-that is, the extra costs are compensated for by the resulting reduction in benefit expenses.","[Koning, Pierre] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, Competit & Regulat Dept, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [Koning, Pierre] Delft Univ Technol, Inst Publ Sector Efficiency IPSE Studies, Delft, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Delft University of Technology,"Koning, P (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, Competit & Regulat Dept, Stolkweg 14,POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",pwck@cpb.nl,,"Koning, Pierre/0000-0002-8808-9497",,,,,15,11,11,1,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In addition consumers requite a blend of characteristics inspired by concepts of quality and distinctiveness. These requirements have led to the formation of a whole series of new laws and the consequent establishment of new categories of certified products (organic food, controlled production chains, typical and/or regional specialities, etc.) both in Europe and throughout the world. The Italian agri-food system must now interpret these trends, also in view of the profound changes involving market organization of markets and growing competition. The present paper aims at analysing the principal characteristics of organic trout breeding and its potential in Italy from the aspects both of supply and demand.

While private airports usually pursue profit maximization, publicly owned airports look for maximum social welfare. Thus, the prices charged by private airports may differ from the socially optimal charges and public intervention may be needed. In this paper, we analyze airport charges when an increase in frequency produces positive or negative externalities and carriers have market power. We use the methodology of game theory to show that there may exist a level of capacity for which private and social objectives coincide, so no price regulation is needed. Thus, the usual role of regulators and planners could be modified in order to decide the appropriate capacity investments for which airport regulation is no longer necessary. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison with regional differentiations in commuting distances, modal shares of non-car travel modes and aspects of infrastructure and population densities clarifies some relationships between energy consumption, commuting behaviour and spatial-economic structure in the suburbanised historic-polycentric spatial structure which characterises the northern part of Belgium. It is found that mode choice appears to be of little impact for the energy performance of home-to-work travel on the scale of the Flanders region. At the other hand, proximity between home and work locations is paramount. Residential density plays a part in this, although much depends on the specific situation. This is also the case for the accessibility of the main road and rail network. In some regions these infrastructures induce long-distance commuting, whereas in the economic core areas this effect is much less pronounced. All these are factors that are very much determined by infrastructural and spatial policies of the past. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Attention is directed toward employed parents' trips to collect their child(ren) from the nursery at the end of workday because of parents' strong sensitivity to the possibility of late arrivals there. Analysis of a stated response experiment about parents' coping with unreliable transport networks en route to the nursery provides further evidence for a series of violations of the axioms underlying expected utility theory (EUT) - a deductive-normative model of decision-making under uncertainty that is widely used in transportation studies. The results also show that linkages exist between respondents' everyday life and their responses in the stated response experiment and, by implication, the shape of CPT's value function. It is therefore concluded that analytical frameworks for describing activity-travel behavior in situations of unreliability, variability and uncertainty should be both psychologically and socially realistic.

Its success is related to the chance of being recognised at a national as well as international level and to its role in promoting the local rural development. The goal of the present study is to explore how social cohesion, trust and market relate one to another along the supply chain and to explain the interaction between participatory organic certification and the development of rural communities. The analytical approach, based oil the work of Henry Farrell, considers how the level of formalism among the agents involved in the certification process interacts with the flexibility and scope of the relationship, including the extension of the market area in which the social control can provide guarantees comparable to those a third party certification body can give. We analysed the case of Rede Ecovida, a network of organic and conventional farmers and other stakeholders operating along the production chain, including local NGOs. The data and information collection has been carried out involving an empirical survey analysing the reasons leading to perform organic farming and set up a participatory organic certification, and an evaluation of the participatory organic fanning impact on trade relationships. Collected data have been integrated with the results of another survey on the Rede Ecovida. The survey had an exploratory nature since the estimators are biased, coining form an non random and non representative sample. Results showed the positive effect of the participatory approach on the local economic, social and environmental development, and its still very low chances to have access to the export market. An interesting finding regards the role of the farmers network (Rede Ecovida) in promoting trust in the organic products beyond the boundaries of local communities.","[Zanasi, Cesare; Venturi, Paolo; Setti, Marco; Rota, Cosimo] Univ Bologna, DIPROVAL, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Zanasi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, DIPROVAL, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",,,,,,,,22,24,26,1,26,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2009,8.0,2,,,,,56,64,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,470GF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267962500008,0

A specific application of the framework is in the quality of life contributions that transportation systems may make to Communities as a function of their impacts on natural assets that contribute inputs and absorb the by products of development. The application is illustrated in a case study that uses data from the Atlanta and Chicago Metropolitan Areas to demonstrate how this model may be applied in real life Situations. The implications of this model for transport systems research, policy and practice are discussed. The value of this framework and model lie in introducing both spatial and temporal flexibility that may enable stakeholders with widely different priorities to reach consensus oil interim goals for Sustainable development to ultimately attain sustainability.

The study is motivated by the intention to examine the wider context in which activity-travel decisions are made and to model such decisions under longitudinal time horizons. We assume that social events trigger a series of interrelated activities and corresponding trips. Data about events and related activities are collected using a month-diary and involving a large sample of households in the Eindhoven region, The Netherlands. A learning algorithm is applied to derive a Bayesian-network model from the event diary. The results show that indeed many travel choices are influenced by particular events, that these influences vary by socio-demographic variables and that the learned Bayesian-network model is able to represent these interdependencies among all these variables. We demonstrate how the model can be used to predict event-driven activity-travel sequences in a micro-simulation.

Most studies find that minorities are less likely to own a home than their white counterparts. A logical extension of this line of research is to consider whether home-ownership rates differ based on sexual orientation. We use data on couples from the 2000 Census and find that same-sex couples are less likely to own a home than are married couples. The average value of houses owned by same-sex male couples is statistically similar to the average value of houses owned by married couples, but houses owned by same-sex female and cohabiting couples have lower average values than those owned by married couples. Conditional on owning, same-sex couples are slightly less likely to have a mortgage compared to married couples. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

I find that literacy and health shocks were strong predictors of migration and the stock of health was not. There were differential selection propensities based on slave status-former slaves were less likely to migrate given a specific health shock than free blacks. Counterfactuals suggest that as much as 35% of the difference in the mobility patterns of former slaves and free blacks is explained by differences in their human capital, and more than 20% of that difference is due to health alone. Overall, the selection effect of literacy on migration is reduced by one-tenth to one-third once health is controlled for. The low levels of human capital accumulation and rates of mobility for African-Americans after the Civil War are partly explained by the poor health status of slaves and their immediate descendants.

We operationalise taxes using effective average tax rates on the bilateral level and employ indices derived from principal component analysis as a proxy for the infrastructure endowment. In the empirical analysis we control for a possible interrelation between taxes and infrastructure as determinants of FDI - an issue usually neglected in the literature. Specifically, a favourable infrastructure endowment may compensate for relatively high taxes. Hence, higher taxes may not deter FDI. The results from our panel econometric analysis of bilateral outward FDI flows of seven home countries in eight CEECs for the 1995-2004 period in an augmented gravity model setting show that (i) both taxes and infrastructure play a role in the location decisions made by multinational enterprises; (ii) telecommunication and transport infrastructure are of special significance to FDI; and (iii) the tax-rate sensitivity of FDI indeed decreases with the level of infrastructure endowment.","[Bellak, Christian; Leibrecht, Markus; Damijan, Joze P.] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Damijan, Joze P.] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia",Vienna University of Economics & Business; University of Ljubljana,"Bellak, C (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",,,"Damijan, Joze/0000-0001-9150-1174",,,,,42,62,70,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2009,32.0,2,,,,,267,290,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2008.01144.x,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,408WX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467400004,0

But there is a discrepancy between the intent of the general policy and attempts at its implementation as identified by specific changes in exchange rates. When we assemble the set of specific changes called for by distinct economists operating as advocates for individual countries, these are uniformly in the form of beggar-thy-neighbour advice - i.e. travesties of objectively identifying disequilibria and a menace to international cooperation and peace. This paper traces the unintended travesties to problems of complexity and uncertainty, problems that implicitly are assumed absent in Mundell (1961) rendering the situation so simple that equilibria are transparent. The problems remained essentially unaddressed when economists extended Mundell (1961) via expected utility theory since this theory also ignores the impossibility of maximising and the complexities of central bankers, private firms and others in doing the evaluation stage in reaching decisions. The problems can be overcome by modelling within SKAT, the Stages of Knowledge Ahead Theory. This paper points to experimental evidence in support of the view that under all sorts of disequilibrating shocks, currency unions outperform flexible currencies by eliminating the inefficiencies generated by exchange rate uncertainty.","Univ Bonn, ZEIb, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Pope, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, ZEIb, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",robin.pope@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,94,0,0,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2009,32.0,2,,,,,326,350,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2008.01121.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,408WX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467400006,0

E., 2006. An integrated model of downtown parking and traffic congestion. journal of Urban Economics 60. 418-442] developed an integrated model of curbside parking and traffic congestion in a downtown area. Curbside parking is exogenously priced below its social opportunity cost. and the stock of cars cruising for parking, which contributes to traffic congestion. adjusts to clear the market for curbside parking spaces. Denser downtown areas have garage as well as curbside parking. Because of economies of scale in garage construction, garages are discretely spaced. The friction of space confers market power on parking garages. Spatial competition between parking garages, as modeled in Arnott [Arnott, R., 2006. Spatial competition between downtown parking garages and downtown parking policy. Transport Policy 13, 458-469], determines the equilibrium garage parking fee and spacing between parking garages. Also, the stock of cars cruising for parking adjusts to equalize the full prices of curbside and garage parking. This paper combines the ingredients of these two models, hence presenting an integrated model of curbside parking, garage parking, and traffic congestion, and examines curbside parking policy in this context through a numerical example with parameters representative of a medium-sized US city. The central result is that raising the curbside parking fee appears to be a very attractive policy since it generates efficiency gains that may be several times as large as the increased revenue raised.

This study is based on a national survey with 1601 a interviews made, in Italy, in November 2006. My aim is twofold. Firstly, I wish to assess the consumer's WTP which is the basis for market sustainability of such energy policy goal and, secondly, I evaluate the share of the necessary public support to RES policy which is covered by the aggregate WTP of Italians. This is an implicit assessment of the plausibility/acceptance of the announced target policy. In my survey framework I obtain the consumer's WTP with two different approaches and to this end the sample has been divided in two parts. In the first sub-sample I propose the full price vector with a downward elicitation format while in the second sub-sample I use the same price vector with an upward elicitation format. In this paper I focus on the different uncertainty degree that affects respondent's choices. I take care econometrically of this issue using an individual stochastic valuation approach and a referendum approach. I obtain for most of the estimated models that estimates of WTP are in agreement with other international results.

Success in attracting grants from international donors depends mostly on network effects. NGOs that raise in-kind resources locally tend to be young and managed by someone who is simultaneously employed elsewhere. There is some evidence of crowding out: NGOs that receive grant funding are less likely to obtain resources locally, whether in cash or in kind. But this seems to be primarily the result of selection. Once NGO-fixed effects are controlled for, there is no evidence that NGOs receive less revenue from fees and donation after obtaining a grant. These results suggest that donors regard Ugandan NGOs as subcontractors of their development efforts, not as charitable organizations in their own right.","[Fafchamps, Marcel] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Owens, Trudy] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Owens, Trudy] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Res Econ Dev & Int Trade, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Oxford; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Fafchamps, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",marcel.fafchamps@economics.ox.ac.uk; trudy.owens@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Owens, Trudy/0000-0001-8676-2919",,,,,14,21,29,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Both countries are characterised economically by enormous national resources of gas and oil and low economic diversification as well as politically by strong autocratic presidentialism with neopatrimonial structures. These two factors, combined with further post-Soviet legacies such as a low level of political interest in the respective societies and a basically hierarchical orientation of the population, lead to a specific post-Soviet variety of rentierism. From a political science perspective, this article reveals the impact of resource policies on these comparably new political systems and concludes with a summary of core features of these post-Soviet rentier states.","[Franke, Anja; Gawrich, Andrea; Alakbarov, Gurban] Univ Kiel, Inst Sozialwissensch, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Franke, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Sozialwissensch, Olshaussenstr 4, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",franke@politik.uni-kiel.de; agawrich@politik.uni-kiel.de; alakbarov@politik.uni-kiel.de,,"Gawrich, Andrea/0000-0002-2132-5619",,,,,150,77,87,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2009,61.0,1,,,,,109,140,PII 908473990,10.1080/09668130802532977,0.0,,,32,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,403NS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263089900005,0

Taking the view that political accountability is a key factor linking political and regulatory structures and processes, this article empirically investigates its impact on the performance of regulation in telecommunications in time-series-cross-sectional data sets for 29 developing countries and 23 developed countries during 1985-99. In addition to confirming some well-documented results on the positive role of regulatory governance in infrastructure industries, the article provides empirical evidence on the impact of the quality of political institutions and their modes of functioning on regulatory performance. The analysis finds that the impact of political accountability on the performance of regulation is stronger in developing countries. An important policy implication is that future reforms in these countries should give due attention to the development of politically accountable systems.

However, the speed at which trade and foreign investment in services is growing, along with the fact that the barriers to these activities are quite different from those for trade in goods, prompts us to take a more careful look. The paper begins with a general discussion about the various policies and technological constraints that impact foreign trade and the establishment of foreign commercial presence in intermediate business services. We then discuss which characteristics an accurate modelling approach must capture. Following that, we develop a model that allows for different regimes of trade and/or foreign affiliate production in services using Markusen's knowledge-capital model. Simulations show that the pattern of service firm headquarters and office locations can differ considerably depending on whether it is trade, investment, or both that are either liberalised or become technologically feasible.

In designing these incentives it is apparent that customers' preferences have rarely been obtained for consideration in the regulatory process. As a result, there is relatively limited understanding of customers' willingness to pay for improved quality of electricity supply. Several studies have examined the willingness of households-to pay for improved quality of electricity supply, however, few studies have examined the willingness of businesses to pay for improved quality of supply. In this study we use choice modelling with random parameters logit models to identify the willingness to pay of business for various service related attributes. Furthermore, we examine the values held by both service and manufacturing businesses, from both rural/regional and urban areas, and observe the differences between them. We find several differences in willingness to pay across business types and locations, however overall the value estimates are relatively homogeneous.","[Morrison, Mark] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Mkt & Management, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia; [Morrison, Mark] Charles Sturt Univ, ILWS, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia",Charles Sturt University; Charles Sturt University,"Morrison, M (通讯作者)，Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Mkt & Management, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia.",mmorrison@csu.edu.au,,"Morrison, Mark/0000-0002-8761-0682",,,,,31,17,18,0,12,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,30.0,2,,,,,117,134,,,,,,18,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,426UV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264734400006,0

The crisis of 2001 was particularly far-reaching in terms of its impact, resulting in a major collapse of output and employment. It was also quite distinct in terms of its income distributional consequences in the sense that not only the wage earners, but all sections of society at varying degrees encountered its negative consequences. The crisis also provided an avenue for a new wave of neo-liberal restructuring with a major emphasis on regulatory reforms. Turkey's political economy in the post-2001 era is investigated on the basis of four key inter-related elements: the impact of the IMF and the World Bank; the restructuring of the state's relationship with the domestic financial sector especially through regulatory reforms; the opening up of Turkey to foreign direct investment; and the adoption of a wide range of reforms modelled on the European Union, in line with the goal of entry into the EU. Indeed, the regional context associated with EU conditionality has provided the political focus of the process as a whole. A key hypothesis is that Turkey continues to be vulnerable in spite of the fact that the banking sector is much more tightly regulated in line with international norms during the post-crisis era.","Koc Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Istanbul, Turkey",Koc University,"Önis, Z (通讯作者)，Koc Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Onis, Ziya/K-2445-2018","Onis, Ziya/0000-0002-0129-2944",,,,,37,54,67,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The new political economy of dispossession and inequality in the Americas,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Migration; transnational division of labor; labor mobility; development; inequality; Americas; Caribbean basin,INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; REMITTANCES; LABOR,"In the context of a severe contraction of 'development space' for Latin American and Caribbean economies in the global political economy, we are witnessing a novel and increasingly explicit articulation of migration as a national development strategy by governments in the region. This is particularly pronounced in the Caribbean basin ( defined to include Mexico). In response to the shifting shape of the transnational division of labor, the core development strategy that is being articulated is one of insertion into transnational supply chains on the basis of the provision of labor, in the sense both of populating the new transnational professional workforce and of ensuring a continual supply of cheap, low- or unskilled, often undocumented workers to a huge range of sectors in cities and outside them. This article contends that what is thereby put in place is a new political economy of inequality in the Americas, through which a dominant, transnationalized form of 'accumulation by dispossession' can be reinforced and deepened. This transnationalized form of accumulation by dispossession combines, in highly contingent ways, with the distinctively 'nationalized' governance of migration to constitute a contemporary political economy of migration in the Americas in which the developmental potential of labor mobility is subject to profound constraints.","Univ Manchester, Polit Econ Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Phillips, N (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Polit Econ Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,,"Phillips, Nicola/0000-0001-9588-976X",,,,,76,51,55,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

More specifically, we are interested in situations where the structure is due to some unobserved factors. Detecting the latent structures in data is not trivial. On the other hand, since such structures could obscure the effect of the observed variables, ignoring them ( e. g., using simple linear models) could result in wrong inference. To address this issue, we propose to use Dirichlet process mixtures. In this approach, the mixture identifier (i.e., the latent variable that assigns each component to a data point) acts as a surrogate for possible missing factors and provides insight into possible hidden structure in the data. An illustrative example is provided to show the usefulness of this approach. We also discuss the application of our method for analyzing time series processes that are subject to regime changes where there is no specific economic theory about the structure of the model.","Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Shahbaba, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",babaks@uci.edu,,"Shahbaba, Babak/0000-0002-8102-1609",,,,,31,4,4,0,2,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

This contention is examined in light of overlapping campaigns by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Financial Action Task Force to pressure targeted states to adopt costly financial reforms. In a constructivist vein, blacklisting is held to be a form of speech act that changed the world by damaging states' reputations among investors, and thus produced pressure to comply through actual or anticipated capital flight. To be removed from blacklists, thereby preventing future economic damage, those targeted have had to comply with stringent regulatory standards mandated by these international organizations. Evidence is taken from interviews, press accounts, official documents and quantitative data relating to seven affected tax havens as well as Austria and Switzerland.","Griffith Univ, Ctr Governance & Publ Policy, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Sharman, JC (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Ctr Governance & Publ Policy, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",,,,,,,,35,70,74,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Consequently, environmental targets have been determined and environmental legislations at every level tend to be more demanding. The result at local scale is that land planners have to take more rigorous account of the environmental damage stemming from their infrastructure development plans. Several economic valuation methods can be used to perform a monetary valuation of losses of natural areas. However, existing valuation methods have reached their limits when dealing with land planning in complex natural areas (i.e. unfamiliar goods). We propose to use a method based on the American Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP) to assess the environmental cost of infrastructure development plans. The adapted HEP is an equivalence-based valuation method that bases the valuation of environmental cost on the environmental damage itself rather than willingness to pay. We find that compared to more conventional methods, the adapted HEP gives a higher value to lost environmental assets, which is rather promising. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

First, agriculture produces a wide array of local and national nonmarket goods and services (in addition to market commodities) collectively known as multifunctionality of agriculture. Second. agriculture is intimately associated with global public goods of grave importance to humanity such as climate change, sustainability. and food security (poverty/hunger) in developing countries that require transnational cooperation to minimize free-rider and consequent under-provision problems. Third, embodying the first and second problems, agriculture plays distinctively different roles across countries. Specifically, this article views the global agriculture as consisting of four broad groups of countries with widely divergent needs from agriculture. This article concludes that the above agriculture-related problems are too diverse and complex to be left to free trade. When the global community is too much preoccupied with the illusive mission of agricultural trade liberalization, the great danger is that such preoccupation may distract it from effectively addressing the agriculture-related problems of the 21st century in a timely manner that pose imperative challenges to humanity. The governance for global agriculture should prioritize managing/taming such global problems rather than squandering time for unworkable liberalization of agricultural trade. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This article gives an overview about the historical development of time series methods to investigate such long-term oscillations in historical time series and to proof their regularity. It starts with a brief presentation of the methods used by Kondratieff and shows them in the context of classical business cycle analysis. It continues with ARIMA methodology and spectral analysis, which have been found to be appropriate when long waves are conceived as growth cycles. We then introduce the filter-design approach that was seen as a perfect solution to the hitherto unsolved problem of dividing trend and long waves in the low-frequency domain. A detailed discussion of the stochastic trend hypothesis and its relevance for long-wave analysis follows before outliers and trend breaks within stochastic models and their relevance for long waves are illustrated by means of the GDP per capita of the United Kingdom for 1830-2006.","GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, D-50931 Cologne, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Sozialwissenschaften (GESIS),"Metz, R (通讯作者)，GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Liliencronstr 6, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.",rainer.metz@gesis.org,,,,,,,77,17,19,1,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,OCT,2011,5.0,3,,,,,205,238,,10.1007/s11698-010-0057-9,0.0,,,34,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,811MW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294216300001,0

An artefactual field experiment conducted in Bolivia is used to reproduce the trade-off between individual and social benefits in natural resource use and test the effect of non-monetary and non-regulatory incentives on pro-social behavior for environmental conservation. The results show the presence of a social norm prescribing positive contribution towards environmental protection, and that external incentives have heterogeneous effects on pro-social behavior depending on how they influence reputation and self-image. The experimental results differ from those of analogous experiments conducted in the laboratory, and are instead consistent with those from field experiments on common-pool resource management. This fact suggests caution in generalizing conclusions, reached in the laboratory, to different settings and populations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

GPI incorporates environmental, social, and economic information into a single metric to represent economic well-being. At all three scales, GPI was found to grow at a slower rate than the conventional economic measure of gross domestic product (GDP), while at the US national scale GPI has been relatively flat since 1975. State-level results match an independently calculated Maryland GPI, confirming that GPI methods are robust and reproducible. In addition, the State of Maryland has recently made GPI one of their official State statistics, reported annually. State-level GPI results were also compared with studies for the states of Ohio and Vermont to explore regional differences. We recommend that the GPI research community develop consensus on a standardized measurement approach and seek common ground for advancing the use of improved indicators and accounting systems in official policy settings.

Previous works analyze the relationship between inequality and environmental quality in a static setting. This paper builds a dynamic model more suitable to analyze technological externalities driven by the emergence of a new demand for green products. Under fairly general assumptions on technology and preferences, we show that: 1. the relationship between inequality and environmental innovation is highly non-linear and crucially depends on per-capita income; 2. an excessive inequality harms the development of environmental technologies especially in rich countries. Key to our results is the fact that externalities generated by pioneer consumers of green products benefit the entire population only for relatively low income distances. The empirical analysis robustly confirms our theoretical results, that is: whereas for rich countries inequality negatively affects the diffusion of innovations, per-capita income is paramount in poorer ones.

However, he continues with the Delphic statement (Delphic statements were uttered by the renowned oracle of ancient Greece at Delphi. They were phrased in such a way as to be self-fulfilling because alternative interpretations covered every possibility.) Without externalities the problem of sustainability vanishes. If this statement refers to an impossible economic process that produces no externalities then he is right. However, it might be interpreted as stating that whenever environmental policy internalizes environmental externalities then sustainability will be ensured. In this note, I assert that in the real world where externalities prevail, their internalization or neutralization in the traditional way cannot lead to sustainability. Only if internalization takes a very specific form that results in the inviolable preservation of environmental rights of future generations in pure biological terms can sustainability be ensured. After revised the original commentary I resubmit it. The issues raised by the editor have been carefully considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This is challenged by the twin theories of the 'industrious' revolution and the consumer revolution, positing a longer working year as people earned surplus money to buy novel goods. In this study, we turn the conventional view on its head, fixing consumption rather than labour input. Specifically, we use a basket of basic consumption goods and compute the working year of rural and urban day labourers required to achieve that. By comparing with independent estimates of the actual working year, we find two 'industrious' revolutions among rural workers; both, however, are attributable to economic hardship, and we detect no signs of a consumer revolution. For urban labourers, by contrast, a growing gap between their actual working year and the work required to buy the basket provides great scope for a consumer revolution.","[Allen, R.

From the microeconomic perspective, this has led to the idea that the growth effects on the macroeconomic level should be reflected in greater competitiveness of the firms. Although innovation effort does not always translate into greater competitiveness, it is recognized that innovation is, in an appropriate sense, unique and differs from other inputs like labor or capital. Nonetheless, often this uniqueness is left unspecified. We analyze two arguments rendering innovation special, the first related to partly non-discretionary innovation input levels and the second to the induced increase in the firm's competitiveness on the global market. Methodologically the analysis is based on restriction tests in non-parametric frontier models, where we use and extend tests proposed by Simar and Wilson (Commun Stat Simul Comput 30(1):159-184, 2001; J Prod Anal, forthcoming, 2010). The empirical data is taken from the German Community Innovation Survey 2007 (CIS 2007), where we focus on mechanical engineering firms. Our results are consistent with the explanation of the firms' inability to freely choose the level of innovation inputs. However, we do not find significant evidence that increased innovation activities correspond to an increase in the ability to serve the global market.","[Schubert, Torben] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Competence Ctr Policy & Reg, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Schubert, Torben] Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Innovat Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Simar, Leopold] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Simar, Leopold] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Technical University of Berlin; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Schubert, T (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Competence Ctr Policy & Reg, Karlsruhe, Germany.",torben.schubert@isi.fraunhofer.de; leopold.simar@uclouvain.be,,"Schubert, Torben/0000-0001-9546-880X",,,,,38,8,8,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We study welfare issues associated with the management of a human-nature complex adaptive system with a threshold and a stochastic driver. We exemplify with a specific system where we link changes in the number and diversity of birds to the abundance of a pest (insects) that causes damages to goods and services valuable to human beings. We present a method that simplifies the analysis and helps us discuss different management models that combine direct and indirect controls of the pest. This allows us to show that 1) the choice of control method depends in a highly non-linear way on biodiversity characteristics and 2) the socially optimal outcome may not be reachable using price instruments.

This article asserts that these problems are rooted in neo-classical economics' narrow focus within human nature on self-interest, which causes intense conflicts for scarce resources among people, societies, species and generations. It describes how an emphasis on the totality of human nature in life, with a focus on self-actualization instead of self-interest as the main driving force and wisdom rather than wealth as the ultimate aim, can lead to a steady-state, wisdom economy that can simultaneously ensure high personal welfare and collective sustainability.

This revenue is usually allocated to municipal budget. Improvement of real property taxation system, changes in taxable value or introduction of new real property tax can increase revenue from taxation and encourage municipalities to improve living surrounding and infrastructure. The discussions about changes in real property taxation system recently took place in Lithuania. It showed that new property tax for natural persons and changes of land taxable value can be introduced. The aim of this article is to analyze possible impact of changes in real property taxation. Comparison of mass valuation and real market prices of apartments in Kaunas municipality was accomplished to investigate the accuracy of possible natural persons taxation. Real market price, average market prices and nominal prices of land were compared in the middle region of Lithuania. There is a clear tendency that real market prices of agricultural land are higher than those, estimated by mass appraisal. The difference fluctuates from 20 to almost 60 percents and is 35 percents on average. The proposals for law on land do not strictly regulate the land tax rate, therefore it is impossible to conclude the possible impact of changes for agricultural land owners and for the State budget. Analysis of apartments average market price by mass appraisal and real market price in Kaunas city showed, that difference of values fluctuates from 7% to 98%. In all cases average market value was lower than real market value, so if the new real property tax was introduced, owners would not feel unjust because of wrong evaluation of their property.","[Aleknavicius, Audrius] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Water & Land Management Fac, Land Management Dept, LT-53361 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Baumane, Vivita] Latvia Univ Agr, Dept Land Management & Geodesy, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia",Vytautas Magnus University; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Aleknavicius, A (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Water & Land Management Fac, Land Management Dept, LT-53361 Kaunas, Lithuania.",audrius.aleknavicius@asu.lt; vivita.baumane@llu.lv,"Aleknavicius, Audrius/HOC-4516-2023",,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,378,384,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500067,0

Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted with collaborators in each country who supervised volunteers to personally invite 16,777 students to take part. The sample was composed of 3,433 students from 103 universities in 11 Eurasian countries. ANOVA was used to compare the responses. All analyses were conducted using the statistical packages Minitab 15 and SPSS 15. Findings - A total of 47 per cent of university students avoided some meat products, 4 per cent were vegetarians and 0.4 per cent vegans. Students avoiding some meat did so principally for environmental and health reasons, and beef and lamb were the meats most likely to be avoided. Vegetarians avoided meat mainly for health reasons. Vegans had greater concern about humans using animals than vegetarians, who in turn had greater concerns than those avoiding some meat. Social implications - Avoidance of animal products was related to an increased level of concern for animal rights, animal experimentation and wildlife, with vegans demonstrating the greatest concern. This implied that students' attitudes to animal welfare and rights can affect animal product-eating behaviours. Originality/value - This study conflicts with previous studies by demonstrating that health rather than environment was a major reason for vegetarianism. The study highlights the importance of environmental, health and welfare concerns but not religion in avoidance of animal products.","[Izmirli, Serdar; Phillips, Clive J.

Yet, these models are not used in Lithuania. The aim of this study was to introduce single tree level modelling approach, to do critical qualitative assessment of single tree level models and their core elements id., competition, tree diameter, height increment and mortality modules. The main criteria for evaluation were set as follows: logic and biological realism of the model, data availability required for the model, evaluation of independent parameters used in the model, modelling simplicity, applicability to local conditions.

Therefore any effort done without creative learning to keep competitive advantages and knowledge development would be in vain. First we describe OL and KM and then by the aid of knowledge learning model, the necessity of combining them in order to accomplish the set goals is described.

Using a choice experiment approach, we investigated Ethiopian farmers' crop variety preferences, estimated the mean willingness to pay for each crop variety attribute, and identified household-specific and institutional factors that governed the preferences. We found that environmental adaptability and yield stability are important attributes for farmers' choice of crop varieties. Farmers are willing to forego some extra income or yield to obtain a more stable and environmentally adaptable crop variety. Among other things, household resource endowments (particularly land holdings and livestock ownership), years of farming experience, and contact with extension services are the major factors causing household heterogeneity of crop variety preferences. Based on our experimental results, we derived important policy implications for on-farm conservation, breeding priority setting, and improved variety adoption in Ethiopia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The economic characteristics of the ecosystem service being provided, such as rivalry and excludability, along with the spatial scale at which benefits accrue can help determine the appropriate policy approach. In this paper we provide a brief introduction to ecosystem services and discuss the policy tools available for providing them along with the dimensions, political feasibility and appropriateness of each tool. Throughout the paper we focus primarily on payments as a mechanism for ecosystem service provision. We present a framework for determining the characteristics of an ecosystem service and when payments are a viable policy tool option based on the characteristics. Additionally, we provide examples of when payments do not provide a socially desirable level of ecosystem benefits. We conclude with a summary of policy recommendations, specifically desirable property rights and payment types based on the particular classification of an ecosystem service. We also discuss the advantages of creating monopsony power to reduce transaction costs, delineating and bundling ecosystem services and utilizing existing intermediaries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, the model proposed in this paper examines the connection between the willingness to sacrifice monetary well-being to support the environment and stated environmental concern, psychological predispositions, socio-economic and demographic characteristics, and pecuniary incentives. Empirical tests show that certain facets of stated environmental concern (such as New Environmental Paradigm, environmental-economic tradeoff, and participation in outdoor activities), psychological traits of trust and empathy, socio-demographic characteristics of gender and residence, as well as pecuniary incentives, including monetary benefits and opportunity costs, are good predictors of actual behavior in the revealed environmental concern experiment. The results support general external validity of environmental concern constructs. They also add to the discussion of what psychological factors drive individuals' actions benefiting the environment, which is of particular interest to environmental agencies and organizations. In addition, we find evidence of a common understanding of how much ought to be donated, as donations are less sensitive to external factors compared to actions based on monetary incentives. The results also demonstrate that an increase in the opportunity costs of donations leads to a very modest decrease in donations, which is good news for environmental agencies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It develops a competitive WQT model wherein wetland services are explicitly considered. To participate in a WQT program, an agricultural producer could employ wetlands as his nutrient management practice. Unlike most other management practices, wetlands not only remove nutrients from agricultural runoff but also provide ancillary benefits like wildlife habitat and flood control that do not exclusively accrue to the farmer. Thus, when appropriate, a WQT program should be coupled with additional incentives for wetland creation and restoration, such as using a wetland subsidy. Despite the water quality enhancement properties of wetlands, the model reveals that implementing a wetland subsidy will not necessarily translate into water quality improvements. While wetland creation is externally incentivized, the farm's opportunity cost of fertilizer usage in the WQT market is also reduced. In this sense, a wetland subsidy acts like a fertilizer subsidy. Conditions under which a wetland subsidy will help expand WQT include some degree of farmland area fixity, which is resembled in some, but not all, watersheds, and high efficiency of the wetland abatement technology.

The results show rapidly decreasing prices in the industry producing electric motors in the 1920s.

While in theory PES is seen as a market solution to environmental problems as an alternative to state (hierarchical) and community governance a review of a large amount of case studies shows that PES in practice depends rather fundamentally on state and/or community engagement. Hence PES are foremost a reconfiguration of the roles of public bodies and communities becoming core intermediaries or 'buyers'. First, to establish PES, rights to the land that delivers the environmental service must be clarified. This demands public action. Second, transacting over environmental amenities is very costly. Creating 'markets' for environmental services depends therefore crucially on state and community facilitation. Hence 'buyers' are often public agencies. High transaction costs also influence price setting. Payments do not follow the market format as intermediaries frequently are setting the price, with users often being unaware even of the fact that they pay. Finally, the distinction between payments as incentives and as fair compensations is emphasized. While payments may strengthen community relations and simplify action for environmental care, they may also introduce a purely instrumental logic and in some cases worsen the environmental status by crowding out environmental virtues. For the future, greater awareness of these dynamics is warranted.

We adjust and transform these measures into per-hectare, valuation-ready units and monetize them with prices from emerging ecosystem markets and the environmental economics literature. By valuing three of the many ecosystem services produced, we generate lower bound estimates for the total ecosystem value of the wetlands restoration Social welfare value is found to be between $1435 and $1486/ha/year, with GHG mitigation valued in the range of $171 to $222, nitrogen mitigation at $1248. and waterfowl recreation at $16 Limited to existing markets, the estimate for annual market value is merely $70/ha, but when fully accounting for potential markets, this estimate rises to $1035/ha The estimated social value surpasses the public expenditure or social cost of wetlands restoration in only 1 year. indicating that the return on public investment is very attractive for the WRP Moreover, the potential market value is substantially greater than landowner opportunity costs, showing that payments to private landowners to restore wetlands could also be profitable for individual landowners.

Portuguese tax sources have been employed to estimate top income and wealth shares (TIS and TWS) from 1936 onwards. The new series shows that the Second World War had a negative and non-permanent effect on the evolution of TIS, but not on TWS, which increased until the mid 1950s. From the mid 1950s to the early 1980s, there was a sharp decline in TIS and TWS. Finally, during the 1990s, TIS increased again.

We use a simple dynamic growth model and the concept of a social accounting matrix (SAM) to illustrate how the addition of income flows and net changes of various natural and cultural resources can be incorporated into a broader measure of welfare. The Swedish reindeer industry, managed by the indigenous Sami people, is used as an example since it is generally regarded to have significant cultural heritage value, beyond its contribution to conventional national accounts. We discuss a theoretically correct compensation to a cultural sector for preserving and maintaining a cultural heritage. Furthermore, we attempt to estimate the cultural value of the Sami Reindeer sector in Sweden using a CVM survey. The results suggest that the willingness to pay (per year) to maintain cultural heritage at least at the current level may be quite substantive, estimates showing it can be several times the industry's turnover per year.

Light pollution commonly refers to excessive or obtrusive artificial light caused by bad lighting design. Light pollution generates significant costs including negative impacts on wildlife, health, astronomy, and wasted energy-which in the U.S. amounts to nearly 7 billion dollars annually. Current scientific models of light pollution are purely population based. The current paper utilizes unique remote sensing data and economic data from the World Bank to quantify the economic causes of light pollution globally. Fractional logit models show that, similar to other types of pollution, both population and GDP are significant explanatory variables. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These households are spread across the well-developed Gomtinagar area of Lucknow city. Simple statistical analysis such as descriptive statistical analysis, frequency distribution, cross tabulation, analysis of variance, and factor analysis to assess the consumers' preferences for food and grocery products and market attributes were carried Out. Findings - The preferences of the consumers clearly indicate their priority for cleanliness/freshness of food products followed by price, quality, variety, packaging, and non-seasonal availability The consumers' preference of marketplace largely depends on the convenience in purchasing at the marketplace along with the availability of additional services, attraction for children, basic amenities and affordability Results suggest that most of the food and grocery items are purchased in loose form from the nearby outlets Fruits and vegetables are mostly purchased daily or twice a week due to their perishable nature, whereas grocery items are less frequently purchased Research limitations/implications - This paper analyses the buying behaviour of the consumers under survey with respect to food and grocery items These consumers are in a relatively advantageous position in terms of purchasing power and awareness of health and nutrition Practical implications - The results may help the food processors and outlet owners to understand a diversified set of preferences for products and market attributes, so that they can make better decisions in the emerging organized food and grocery retail environment.

Extant literature has discussed the divergence of the two incomes since late 1990s. However, the cause for the difference is not known. Researchers argued that in tax planning strategies, managers of firms opportunistically take advantage of the difference rules between Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and tax laws to report higher financial accounting income to shareholders and lower taxable income to tax authorities. Hence, this study uses the firm-level financial data to measure corporate tax planning strategies of 212 public listed firms (636 firm-years) from 2002 to 2004. Five accounting variables are used to examine the tax planning strategies used by firms as follows: exempt income, disallowable expenses, tax incentives, business losses and deferred tax expense.

Additionally, persons may be more concerned about basic needs, such as public safety, compared to environmental issues. In this study, respondents were 600 adults during a recently documented recession. Participants indicated the most urgent environmental issue as water concerns. Due to the distress of water availability in the American southwest, the personally relevant environmental issue was conceptualized as water conservation. In order to maintain standardization of environmental issues across relevancy; another water related issue was chosen as the personally irrelevant environmental variable. Flood control, while vitally important due to urbanization, is not personally relevant. The other predictive variable, public safety; was measured as the importance of maintaining low crime rates. The prediction of the economic vitality variable was constructed as the importance of improving job opportunities, with higher importance of improvement indicating a poorer semblance of vitality. Data was analyzed using standard multiple regression and the results support the hypothesis. Specifically, in times of economic adversity, more importance is given toward public safety and personally relevant environmental issues, while less importance is focused on environmental issues that are personally irrelevant.

The trajectory was not smooth. but aboveground HANPP fluctuated with changes in factors affecting agricultural production conditions. Both aboveground net primary production (aNPP) of the prevailing vegetation and harvested aNPP increased during the socialist regime, dropped when the system collapsed and has shown considerable fluctuations since. We discuss the development of aboveground HANPP and the Hungarian land use system in the context of socioeconomic changes during three distinct phases: (1) industrialisation of agriculture (1961-1989). (2) regime collapse (1989-1993) and (3) restructuring of a new economy (1993-2005). Within these periods, different driving factors influenced aboveground HANPP and its constituents. in the phase of industrialisation, mechanisation and agrochemical inputs reduced aHANPP while harvested amounts of biomass increased progressively. In the second phase, political and economic circumstances devastated production conditions resulting in a decline of productivity of actual vegetation and a temporary rise in aboveground HANPP. During the last twelve years, industrialisation patterns of agricultural production recovered. The restructuring of inefficient agricultural production systems raised harvest at moderate levels of agricultural inputs, while climatic conditions intimidated high yield and harvest security. The paper discusses the effect of different economic and political regimes and of major socioeconomic restructuring on the development of the land use system, biomass production and aboveground HANPP.

This paper advances an original model of amenities that work through household production instead of directly through utility. Area characteristics (amenities) affect household production, causing certain kinds of human capital investments to be rewarded more than others. Area heterogeneity thus makes such investments location-specific. This specificity-along with a period of exogenous location-increases the opportunity costs of moving, diminishes migration flows between dissimilar locations and increases valuation of amenities that were present in the originating area. These theoretical results emphasize people's sorting across areas and thus differ from the results of the standard model of compensating differentials. Empirical tests of the model's predictions using NLSY79 data show that childhood investments affect migration flows in the way proposed by the model.","IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Krupka, DJ (通讯作者)，IZA, Schaumburg Lippe St 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",dkrupka@iza.org,,,,,,,45,26,30,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

This article argues that no sharp distinction between qualitative and quantitative concepts can be drawn, as almost any concept used to describe a past society is implicitly quantitative. Many recent advances in understanding have been achieved by deriving quantitative evidence from qualitative evidence, using the two dialectically, and indexing them against other quantitative findings from the same population. We show that this triangulation method can be extended to many apparently qualitative sources. Despite its successes, the potential of turning qualitative into quantitative evidence has only just begun to be exploited.","[Carus, A.

To this end, it first develops a framework for the systematic analysis and assessment of interplay management as a means for achieving 'strong' EPI, distinguishing four levels and two principal modes of management. On this basis, the article assesses the current contribution of International Environmental Governance to advancing EPI as regards three categories of institutional interaction. The analysis demonstrates the need to fit interplay management to the particular governance conditions of varying interaction situations and highlights the lack of systematic and consistent support for EPI among international institutions. Options to improve this situation include in particular promoting inter-institutional learning and assistance for the benefit of environmental institutions as well as ensuring consideration of and respect for environmental requirements. Adapting the statutes and mandates of individual institutions and developing suitable guidance under general international (environmental) law have the highest potential for implementing these options. In contrast, joint management initiatives and a strengthened international environmental organisation have a much more limited, supplementary potential.","Vrije Univ Brussel, Inst European Studies, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Oberthür, S (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Inst European Studies, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",Sebastian.oberthuer@vub.ac.be,,"Oberthur, Sebastian/0000-0001-8626-5082",,,,,57,102,106,1,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

It is therefore important to understand why some countries attract more investments by multinationals than others. We expand the set of common determinants of FDI with urban agglomerations and ask the question whether the accessibility of market potential and the number of potential investment locations, in the shape of urban concentrations, matters, since the importance of urban agglomeration economies for FDI has not been investigated before. We show that countries with several medium-sized cities attract more foreign investment, especially if they are close to main agglomerations, but too much concentration (primacy) reduces the inflow of FDI. Moreover, we unbundle spatially lagged FDI by including spatial lags of the determinants of FDI. It is important to disentangle such third-country effects in order to understand how FDI flows depend on the complex ways in which multinationals fragment sales and production across countries. Using a panel of U.S. affiliates' sales in foreign countries between 1984 and 1998, we find evidence that cities are important drivers of FDI. Furthermore, third-country effects suggest that horizontal and complex forms of FDI coexist.","[Poelhekke, Steven] Nederlandsche Bank, Res Dept, NL-1017 ZN Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, CEPR & CESifo, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; University of Oxford; University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Poelhekke, S (通讯作者)，Nederlandsche Bank, Res Dept, Westeinde 1, NL-1017 ZN Amsterdam, Netherlands.",steven.poelhekke@dnb.nl; rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Poelhekke, Steven/0000-0001-9256-7853",,,,,48,31,32,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

While the nutrients contained in the wastewater is considered as beneficial to agriculture, the contaminants present in it pose environmental and health risks. This paper examines the morbidity status, its determinants as well as the cost of illness for households living in the areas irrigated with wastewater in comparison with those using normal quality water. Primary data collected from six villages irrigated with wastewater along Musi River which is fed with wastewater and one control village where normal quality water is used for irrigation has been used for the analysis. It is seen that higher rates of morbidity exist in the wastewater irrigated villages when compared to the control village. Specifically, adult and female morbidity rates are significantly higher than child and male morbidity rates. From the logit analysis it is seen that exposure to wastewater and engagement in activities based on it places the households in higher risk groups to report morbidity. Small and marginal farmers incur higher economic cost of illness. However, it has been difficult to ascertain the cause and effect relationship as most of the households have reported more common illnesses like fever, head ache, skin itching, stomach ailments, etc. The study points out the need for a comprehensive risk assessment and adoption of risk management measures including setting standards for treatment and discharge of wastewater and regulations on the type of uses etc. to prevent unplanned use of untreated or partially treated wastewater while taking into account local conditions.

Using a range of legal, medical, and statistical evidence, this article explores the history of stillbirth registration in Scotland from a social history perspective. It outlines the problems associated with lack of stillbirth registration, the processes that eventually led to registration of the stillborn child, and the wider significance of that registration.","Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Davis, G (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,Wellcome Trust Funding Source: Medline,Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust),,,75,21,21,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Using the European Community Household Panel dataset for 102 regions over the period 1995-2000, it analyses how microeconomic changes in human capital distribution affect income inequality for the population as a whole and for normally working people. The different static and dynamic panel data analyses conducted reveal that the relationship between income per capita and income inequality, as well as between a good human capital endowment and income inequality is positive. High levels of inequality in educational attainment are also associated with higher income inequality. The above results are robust to changes in the definition of income distribution and may be interpreted as a sign of the responsiveness of the EU labor market to differences in qualifications and skills. Other results indicate that population ageing, female participation in the labor force, urbanization, agriculture, and industry are negatively associated to income inequality, while unemployment and the presence of a strong financial sector positively affect inequality. Finally, income inequality is lower in social-democratic welfare states, in Protestant areas, and in regions with Nordic family structures.","[Rodriguez-Pose, Andres; Tselios, Vassilis] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres; Tselios, Vassilis] London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk; v.tselios@lse.ac.uk,"Tselios, Vassilis/ISB-5776-2023; Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Tselios, Vassilis/0000-0001-6330-7278; Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",ESRC [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,70,135,146,3,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

The Basque Country, the region with the highest ethnic homogeneity in Europe, serves as an example to illustrate how important this issue can be in the environmental valuation of natural resources. The rationale for this influence may be found in the deep roots of the Basque culture, a culture where amalurra (Mother Earth), i.e. the natural environment, has a central role, as studies from diverse disciplines such as anthropology, psychology and political science have shown. A simulated full distribution of the WTP to protect a Basque natural area using a random parameter logit model reveals that mean marginal WTP to protect its environmental attributes is approximately 43-50% higher if the respondent has children or if she is a climber and 28-33% higher if the cultural identity of the respondent is Basque.

In our study, we develop an empirical proxy for the concept of soft budget constraint (SBC, Kornai, Kyklos 39:3-30, 1986) as an alternative financial measure of a hospital's overall financial health and offer an initial estimate of the effect of SBCs on hospital access and quality. An organization has a SBC if it can expect to be bailed out rather than shut down. Our conceptual model predicts that hospitals facing softer budget constraints will be associated with less aggressive cost control, and their quality may be better or worse, depending on the scope for damage to quality from noncontractible aspects of cost control. We find that hospitals with softer budget constraints are less likely to shut down safety net services. In addition, hospitals with softer budget constraints appear to have better mortality outcomes for elderly heart attack patients.","[Shen, Yu-Chu] USN, Postgrad Sch, Monterey, CA USA; [Shen, Yu-Chu] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Eggleston, Karen] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School; National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University,"Shen, YC (通讯作者)，USN, Postgrad Sch, Monterey, CA USA.",yshen@nps.edu,,,,,,,28,15,16,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Consequently, there are both horizontal and vertical asymmetric information, and each firm can strategically manipulate both, the competitor's and the regulator's priors. In this context, we find that each firm wishes to be perceived as a technologically clean firm in period 2 whenever the regulator's ecological conscience is sufficiently high. We also show that taxes under symmetric information are always positive, but under asymmetric information and signaling they may be negative (subsidies) and lower or greater than in the symmetric information case, depending on the ecological conscience of the regulator and the probability of firms being dirty. Finally, taxes are below environmental marginal damage, both under symmetric and asymmetric information, and signaling reinforces such under-taxation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper clarifies the theoretical conditions under which such effects would occur and explores their likely significance using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Scottish economy. We find that for Scotland a general improvement in energy efficiency in the production sectors of the economy initially produces rebound effects that eventually grow into backfire. Energy use ultimately increases in response to an efficiency gain and the ratio of GDP to CO2 emissions falls. The economic factors underpinning rebound effects are straightforward: energy efficiency improvements result in an effective cut in energy prices, which produces output, substitution, competitiveness and income effects that stimulate energy demands. However, the presence of strong rebound or even backfire does not mean that efficiency-enhancing policies are irrelevant: rather it suggests that such policies operating alone are insufficient to generate environmental improvements. The implication is that a co-ordinated portfolio of energy policies is required. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[McGregor, Peter G.; Swales, J.

Since firms retain ISO 14001 once they have adopted it, a firm's decision to adopt ISO 14001 is considered from the period that they initially acquire the certification. Therefore, we assert that we have to focus on the determinants of initial ISO 14001 adoption. We analyzed: 1) the determinants of initial ISO 14001 adoptions respective to 1996, 1999, and 2004; and 2) the determinants of initial ISO 14001 adoptions during the period 1996-2004. The estimation results support the view that stakeholders' environmental preferences/pressures and firms' financial flexibility influenced their decision to adopt ISO 14001 in both analyses. Particularly, it is remarkable that we found that: 1) the determinants of the initial ISO 14001 adoption differed among the years of adoption; and 2) there is a positive relationship between economic performance and initial ISO 14001 adoption.

This article evaluates the existing freshwater concerns of Shkodra/Skadar Lake ecosystem as well as the environmental security concern of the local population living in both sides. In fact, there are untreated sewage waters, untreated industrial pollutions and pesticides that are provoking low security of the environment and the water quality of the Lake watershed. This paper offers a model of cooperation in the cross-border context, recommendations for future treating measures toward water quality which can provide environmental security and improving the bio-life quality for Shkodra/Skadar lake ecosystem. Through this paper we argue that ecosystem-oriented principles are essential to shape effective freshwater using priorities as they involve along a continuum from dialogue and partnership, to sharing of information, to more defined frameworks of cooperation at a trans-boundary level, to binding legal norms. The process we experienced provides also the instruments and mechanisms established at the trans-boundary level and the implementation process mainly focused on the best practices to mitigate environmental problems, institutional strengthening and capacity building running throughout the programme Promoting Environmental Protection toward Management of Shared Natural Resources between Albania and Montenegro.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of Cynodon dactylon and Pennisetum americanum as cover crops on weed management in pineapple orchards under integrated production system in comparison with the conventional production system. The cover crop management consisted of spraying post-emergence herbicide at blooming stage and chopping the cover crops, allowing their residues to remain on the soil as mulch, and making direct planting of the cover crops as many times as possible, depending on environmental conditions. Weed control in the conventional production system was performed by six manual interventions and four pre-emergence herbicide sprays. On the other hand, no conventional weed control was performed in the pineapple orchards where C. dactylon and P. americanum were used as cover crops. The nutritional status of the pineapple plants was evaluated based on 'D' leaf analyses prior to the flowering induction treatment. Nutrient levels were higher in plants of the cover crop treatments, showing no competition of either C. dactylon or P. americanum with the cash crop. Pineapple plants grown in association with those cover crops produced higher percentages of fruits weighing above 1,500 g than those from the treatment with conventional weed control. In addition, the treatment with P. americanum as cover crop resulted in the production of a higher number of large fruits, weighing above 1,800 g, in comparison with C. dactylon as cover crop and the conventional weed management.",,,,apmatos@cnpmf.embrapa.br,"Teixeira, Fabio/JHV-1347-2023","Teixeira, Fabio/0000-0003-0497-995X",,,,,11,3,3,1,9,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-310-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,822.0,,,,,,155,160,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.822.18,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Plant Sciences; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,BAU01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305508900018,0

DRIS norms and CLN were established from a data bank of leaf nutrient concentration (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) and fruit yield with 104 samples. The data bank comprises information from four fertilization experiments with 'Smooth Cayenne' conducted on a sandy and low fertility Alfisol located in the municipality of Agudos (22 degrees 30'S, 49 degrees 03'W), which is typical for this important pineapple production region in Brazil. The data were divided into high-yielding (>65 t/ha) and low-yielding (<65 t/ha) sub-populations and norms were computed using standard DRIS procedures. These norms were developed with data from only one cropping region, so they should be considered as preliminary, probably requiring some modification as more data become available. The regression between nutrient balance index and fruit yield was significant (R-2=0.44; p<0.0001; n=104). The CLNs were derived using multiple linear regression relating the foliar nutrient concentration with DRIS indices of all nutrients. The CLNs for N, P, K, Ca, and Mg were 12.0, 0.92, 21.4, 4.0, and 2.8 g/kg, respectively. These values were similar to those presented in the literature, except for Ca whose value is lower for local conditions.","[Teixeira, L. A. J.; Quaggio, J. A.; Zambrosi, F. C.

The distributional effects arise from the new environmental taxes, any tax reductions made as part of the ETR, the wider macroeconomic impacts from the ETR, any special provisions in the ETR, and the environmental benefits from the ETR. The paper's literature review makes clear that while the impacts from taxes on the household use of energy are very often regressive, transport taxes tend not to be, although the impacts differ between urban and rural households. Moreover, the net distributional impact is often less regressive, or not at all, once the wider distributional effects are taken into account. Residual regressive effects can in principle be removed by further adjustments in the tax or benefits system. The modelling results suggest that an ETR in Europe will actually increase real incomes across the EU as a whole, and will not be generally regressive, although the results differ by country and for different socio-economic groups. The political acceptability of ETR may depend on the worst effects on these groups being mitigated in some way. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Disclosure-based policies improve the information the public has about targeted actors' behaviors while education-based policies improve the information targeted actors have about their own behaviors, whether that is information about consequences, alternatives, or social norms. Various social and political forces shape whether and what type of transparency policies are adopted. Disclosure-based and education-based transparency policies are effective under different conditions and operate through different mechanisms. Both often operate through mechanisms that reflect an instrumental logic of consequences but also can and do operate through mechanisms that reflect a normative logic of appropriateness, by increasing the legitimacy accorded to global environmental norms and the social accountability targeted actors feel regarding their behaviors. Understanding the differences in the mechanisms by which disclosure-based and education-based transparency policies operate suggests that both scholars and practitioners should use caution in understanding why, and predicting when, such policies will work.

We argue that the problem of redefining 'common yet differentiated responsibilities' in a way which allows developing countries room to pursue their individual development goals while still achieving the necessary level of carbon mitigation is central to the debate. The choice of negotiating instruments, effective technology transfer and financial support, and other related issues have been raised principally by China and India, and may also be raised by several other countries. Kyoto non-compliance by Annex 1 countries will also greatly impact the negotiating power of China and India and other developing countries. We conclude that, once basic principles are clearly defined, the greatest incentive for China and India to participate in climate change negotiations is the prospect of future negotiating rounds that can be linked to a large number of climate change related issues, such as intellectual property, the potential for financial transfers and trade/market access.","[Walsh, Sean; Tian, Huifang; Whalley, John; Agarwal, Manmohan] Ctr Int Governance Innovat CIGI, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada; [Tian, Huifang] Chinese Acad Social Sci CASS, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China; [Tian, Huifang; Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Walsh, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Governance Innovat CIGI, 57 Erb St E, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada.",swalsh@cigionline.org; tianvicki@gmail.com; jwhalley@uwo.ca; magarwal@cigionline.org,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,22,24,25,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This assessment is based on MAC reduced forms, the generic specification of which enables simple parameterization and numerical computations. Such MAC curves are parameterized for each Member State using the outputs of a detailed model of the European agricultural supply. They are then used to compute total and marginal abatement costs involved by the BSA targets, as well as the cost-effective effort sharing, the corresponding emission price and abatement costs. The main findings are: (i) flexibility mechanisms such as a cap-and-trade system for agricultural emissions could reduce the total costs of meeting the 10% EU abatement target by a factor two to three relative to the strict implementation of each country's target, (ii) the corresponding equilibrium emission price is found to be 32-42 (sic)/tCO(2)eq depending on the assumption regarding business-as-usual emissions, and (iii) a cap-and-trade system with allowances based on the BSA targets would involve substantial transfers from EU-15 countries to New Member States, an important share of which being made of 'hot air'.

While unpersuasive to many, support for the SMS has been advocated by some economists for settings involving irreversibility and a high degree of uncertainty. The objective of this paper is to explore decision-making involving species preservation versus development within an experimental laboratory setting, and involving uncertainty. The experimental design implements a number of prior game-theoretic investigations of the SMS (Bishop, 1978; Ready and Bishop, 1991: Palmini, 1999), involving insurance, and lottery or combined games against nature. The choices are between species preservation, which possibly provides a cure for a disease, or developing habitat, leading to irreversible depletion. Econometric results from a random parameters logit model, using responses from 117 participants (across both U.S. and Mexican university student samples) and 9 treatment choices, indicate that support for the SMS varies across the type of game, the imposed maximum regret condition concerning the relative magnitude of the costs of disease and net benefits of development, a constructed measure of respondents' risk aversion, and other factors. There is also strong evidence of unobservable heterogeneous preferences for preservation within our sample. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

More interestingly, the contribution of the barriers to the profile of the tariff equivalent, as well as the assignment of an active role to the peseta exchange rate as a barrier, illustrates the existence of a protectionist backlash against the sustained decline in transport costs in the period 1870-1913.","[Sabate, Marcela; Fillat, Carmen; Belen Gracia, Ana] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac Ciencias Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Sabaté, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac Ciencias Econ, GranVia 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",msabate@unizar.es; cfillat@unizar.es; abgracia@unizar.es,"Gracia, Ana Belen/H-2702-2015; Sabate Sort, Marcela/H-2206-2015","Sabate Sort, Marcela/0000-0002-9047-4853",,,,,57,6,6,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

We then uncovered inconsistency between net migration and utility differential in the presence of distance-related migration costs. Based on the stylized facts and the inconsistency problem, we formulated an operational model and estimated interregional utility differentials. We showed that the interregional utility differentials converged until the late 1970s. We also showed that the utility estimates are highly correlated with the per capita real income.

The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania notes that the preservation of agricultural land is a public interest protected by the Constitution. However, having analysed the state of the use of land resources it was defined that the area of agricultural land in Lithuania had decreased by 21.7 per cent during the period of 1990-2010. The formation of the stable land holdings isn't over yet - farms growing agricultural production have to acquire on the rights of ownership or to lease for a long time about 1.6-2.0 million ha of private or state-owned land. Land management projects necessary for the works of the management of the landscape of agrarian territories are not prepared. The objective of the investigations is to analyse the changes of our country's main agricultural land areas and submit proposals concerning the regulation of the rational use of the land used for agricultural purposes by legal and organizational measures. The authors of the article suggest correcting the Law on Land and other legal acts when foreseeing stricter conditions for the transfer of agricultural land for other purposes or the conversion of them into non-agricultural land. In order to increase the area of the used agricultural land it is suggested to carry out the inventory of abandoned lands when locally determining the further use possibilities of these plots as well as to apply state measures stimulating the start of the use of abandoned areas. All rural subdistricts are suggested to prepare integrated agricultural and rural development projects. The data of the land information systems first of all should be prepared and rendered to farms and organizations connected with agriculture - for the use of agricultural production and the planning of the land improvement works.","[Aleknavicius, Pranas; Aleknavicius, Audrius] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Water & Land Management, Dept Land Management, LT-53361 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Jankava, Anda] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Rural Engn, Dept Land Management & Geodesy, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia",Vytautas Magnus University; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Aleknavicius, P (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Water & Land Management, Dept Land Management, LT-53361 Kaunas, Lithuania.",pranas.aleknavicius@asu.lt; audrius.aleknavicius@asu.lt; anda.jankava@llu.lv,"Aleknavicius, Audrius/HOC-4516-2023",,,,,,13,1,2,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,391,399,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500069,0

The present paper aims to validate the 40-item PVQ typology, using a nationally representative sample of 997 consumers. The main objective of the survey was to investigate whether higher-than-average regular purchasing of quality food products (i.e. organic and PDO labelled products) coincides with stronger identification with specific PVQ values. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was distributed nationwide. Data were collected through personal interviews with 997 consumers. Confirmatory factor analysis and cluster analysis were the main analytical techniques used. Findings - At the value-based segmentation level of the analysis, identification with the PVQ value domains decreased per cluster progressively and jointly for almost all value domains, a trend that led to the identification of five distinctive national consumer segments. The trend of stronger identification with security, universalism and benevolence that appeared at the sample level re-emerged for the urban upper class, the countryside class I and the countryside class II, which accounted for two-thirds of the overall sample and were the clusters with the most dynamic quality food purchasing profile. Research limitations/implications - Despite the emergence of a clear relation between consumers' self-transcendence and security value similarity and higher-than-average frequency of quality food purchasing, quality food consumers did not form a separate and clearly diversified cluster if the PVQ inventory functions as a basis for segmentation. Future models should incorporate values together with intermediate-level constructs (e.g. beliefs and/or attitudes) when attempting to predict consumer behaviour towards quality food products. Originality/value - The paper shows that while values can be used to meaningfully segment quality food consumers, there is still much to learn regarding the direct and indirect determinants of quality food purchase behaviour.","[Krystallis, Athanasios] Aarhus Univ, Dept Mkt & Stat, Aarhus Sch Business, Aarhus, Denmark; [Fotopoulos, Christos] Univ Ioannina, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, Agrinion, Greece; [Anastasios, Pagiaslis] Univ Ioannina, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, Patras, Greece",Aarhus University; University of Ioannina; University of Ioannina,"Krystallis, A (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Mkt & Stat, Aarhus Sch Business, Aarhus, Denmark.",atkr@asb.dk,"PAGIASLIS, ANASTASIOS/F-1534-2015","PAGIASLIS, ANASTASIOS/0000-0003-3999-2337",,,,,101,23,27,2,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

They have risen to prominence in countries such as the UK and USA where they comprise a powerful commercial force and their influence is apparent in certain of the more economically advanced parts of East Asia, demonstrated by developments in Singapore. The trend can be seen as an example of globalisation, although securing the growth and sustainability of celebrity chef enterprises at home and abroad is a demanding task. Practical implications - Commercial opportunities are explored as well as some of the problems to be resolved by stakeholders in the celebrity chef industry.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors first perform a blind taste test of the product using three brands (two manufacturer brands and one store brand) in two categories with differentiated characteristics (cola drinks and olives stuffed with anchovies). They then use conjoint analysis to analyze the influence of the intrinsic cue (taste) and the extrinsic cues (price and brand-packaging) on consumers' preference for manufacturer and store brands. Finally, after telling the consumers which taste belongs to each brand, the authors study the influence of the extrinsic cues on the consumers' quality evaluations of the real stimuli. Findings - The results show that not knowing the brand to which the taste tested belongs, leads consumers in general to order their preferences fundamentally by taste. However, the results differ by product category and consumer segment analyzed. Consumers who evaluate the taste of store brands as better change their preferences more when they know which brand belongs to which taste. Further, the change in preference when consumers know the brand-taste correspondence is clearly greater in the most differentiated category. Research limitations/implications - The main limitations of this research derive from the factors conditioning the information. A greater number of categories and attributes would enrich the information. In addition, it would be useful to analyze more than one store brand. Practical implications - The results obtained have interesting implications for manufacturers and retailers concerning management of the brands in their product portfolio and management of their relationships in the distribution channel. Originality/value - The main contribution of this paper lies in the work methodology used. The paper offers a comprehensive analysis of how the relative importance of brand-packaging, price and taste affect brand preference for manufacturer and store brands. The study also contributes evidence on how the consumer's knowledge of the correspondence between brand and taste can change his or her brand preferences, an issue of great interest for manufacturers and distributors in managing their product portfolios.","[Luis Mendez, Jose; Oubina, Javier; Rubio, Natalia] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Finance & Mkt Res, Business Studies Fac, Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Rubio, N (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Finance & Mkt Res, Business Studies Fac, Madrid, Spain.",natalia.rubio@uam.es,"Rubio, Natalia/A-5166-2013; Oubiña, Javier/L-3022-2013","Rubio, Natalia/0000-0002-6665-8521; OUBINA BARBOLLA, FRANCISCO JAVIER/0000-0002-8168-0284",Ministry of Education and Science [ECO2008-00488/ECON]; Madrid Regional Ministry of Education [S2007/HUM-0413],"Ministry of Education and Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Madrid Regional Ministry of Education",The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of Ministry of Education and Science (research project ref.: ECO2008-00488/ECON) and Madrid Regional Ministry of Education (research project ref.: S2007/HUM-0413).

Globalization has been defined in many ways but very few included the common sense meaning of it. The paper aims to analyze the status quo of the economic systems and models, to reveal the defining characteristics of the dominant models and to highlight several ways of understanding the true sense of globalization. The comparative analysis of the economic models and systems provides a compelling framework for observing how the pre-global era in which we currently live, is distinctive to the global one. Globalization is the process through which societies accept the similarities between people and overlook their discrepancies. The phenomena is mostly perceived and understood today as being based on the adversity principle, which suggests that the systems have a top-down structure. In this study, it is scrutinized the multidimensional system, with an emphasis on the economic one. However, in other to fully perceive the essence of the suggested paradigm shift additional elements are introduced to complete the image. The system concept implies the order notion as the elements function through links and they communicate based on certain rules. Systems have a particular structure, an interconnectivity of the parts that determines the ways in which it acts and reacts to external shocks. Systems are the integrated layout of the component entities. The paper seeks answers to the following questions: does the world needs a paradigm shift and is it truly necessary? What are the rational arguments for such a turn? The analysis is decomposed on four distinct layers: the system, the process, the model and the structure.","[Oprescu, Raluca] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,raluk.or.raluca@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-07-1015-6,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,24.0,,,,,,73,77,,,,,,5,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BEW94,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000318458900015,0

Cultivated grassland as the target of the investigation has been taken. The data have been collected in a real time using digital sensors of the humidity, pressure, gas concentration, solar intensity, wind speed and temperature. All the dependencies of the various physical data were valuated according to the plant growth. Data were obtained in cultural grasslands with different fertilizer application and in crop fields of different geographical location. The experimental data confirm that the average meteorological data obtained from the State Meteorology Stations are quite preliminary and cannot be unambiguously considered as the environmental factors on the wide area of vegetation with different soil. The gathered data set should be used when analyzing ecological drivers on the fluctuation of the climate. Measurement of properties that affect fluid storage and transport, such as macro porosity, provided soil quality indices that helped in recommending suitable soil management systems (Harpal et al., 2004).","[Uzupis, Arnoldas; Nemciauskas, Kestutis; Balezentiene, Ligita; Klimas, Evaldas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Phys, LT-4324 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Uzupis, A (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Phys, LT-4324 Kaunas, Lithuania.",Arnoldas.Uzupis@asu.lt; Kestutis.Nemciauskas@asu.lt; Ligita.Balezentiene@asu.lt; Evaldas.Klimas@asu.lt,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,457,461,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000074,0

This argument, which is still popular, neglects the fact that the restriction of the German military to 115,000 men relieved the German central budget considerably. In a counterfactual analysis we assess the savings in additional military costs and compare them to the reparation payments. Depending on the character of the foreign policy pursued by an unrestricted Germany, we find that the net effect of the Treaty's stipulations on the German central budgets was either much lower than hitherto thought or even positive. This finding gives support to the argument that Germany suffered from home-made political failure even in the relatively stable period from 1924 to 1929.","[Hantke, Max] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany; German Hist Inst, Paris, France",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Hantke, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.",,,,,,,,53,7,7,1,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This has led to policy initiatives that impose extra costs on groundwater users. By investigating the effects of the conditions of aquifers, production efficiency and other factors on decisions of Taiwanese aquacultural producers to exit the industry, this paper lays an important foundation for an understanding of the effects of these policy initiatives. Using data from a nationwide survey, this exit decision is examined using an innovative empirical strategy that combines Data Envelopment Analysis with a discrete choice econometric model. Results indicate that less efficient firms and those located in areas where land subsidence is severe are more likely to exit. These relationships may in part reflect the effectiveness of the recent policy changes to reduce land subsidence attributable to aquaculture production. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Lake water quality valuation studies were conducted in two countries in transition Poland and the Czech Republic. They reflected two earlier studies carried out in Norway. We examine how income elasticity of WTP varies with the levels of income and find support for applying the income elasticity of 1 to adjust transferred welfare estimates in case of high differences in income between countries. In addition, we show that using site-specific measures of income outperforms transfers based on GPD per capita. The accuracy of benefit transfer is compared using equivalence testing following the TOSC (two one-sided convolutions) test. A new, more informative way of reporting equivalence is proposed, based on computing minimum tolerance level rather than specifying it a priori. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We conduct econometric tests for structural breaks in the time series of the government bonds for Chile and Peru between 1876 and 1890 in order to examine the effects of the changes in resource endowments on the investors' perceptions of the risk premia of Chilean and Peruvian securities. Our results reveal that investors were extremely pessimistic about the prospects of Chilean, and especially Peruvian debt prior to the war. Early Chilean victories that anticipated the transfer of the richly endowed provinces to Chile caused significant increases in the price of Chilean securities. But such was the low regard with which investors viewed the Peruvian government that the fall of Lima caused an increase in the price of Peruvian bonds on the hope that Chile would assume some of the responsibility for them.

We study the implication of ecolabeling a supposedly green good for a consumer's allocation of income between a dirty and the supposedly green good. In the model, the role of the ecolabel is to help product differentiation, to give reliable information and to reduce informational asymmetries. We show that a conscious consumer (someone with a stronger green attitude or quality concerns) demands more ecolabeled goods; price-oriented consumers demand fewer ecolabeled goods; a subsidy (resp. tax) on the price of the ecolabeled (resp. dirty) good leads to a larger consumption of the ecolabeled (resp. dirty) good whereas it may increase or decrease the demand for the dirty (resp. ecolabeled) good, depending on whether the consumer views both goods as gross substitutes or complements. We then use a cross-individual dataset of 22,568 consumers and show that the demand for ecolabeled goods increases strongly with the consciousness of the consumer but decreases for price-oriented consumers. Ecolabel-oriented consumers feel more informed; more conscious consumers prefer a subsidy on green goods and a tax on dirty goods: price-oriented consumers do not care about the green subsidy but would vote against a tax on the dirty goods.

We find that income distribution was relatively high on the eve of the first globalization boom. Thus, inequality is not only the result of globalization, but also a structural feature. Inequality increased between 1870 and 1920, both within individual countries and between countries. Globalization forces do not result in obvious outcomes. Rather, the effect of globalization on inequality depends on the expansion of the frontier and institutional persistence and change in old and new areas. Inequality was clearly high in the wake of the globalization process. This was a particular kind of inequality, which was part of a set of institutions closely linked to the exports of primary goods, sluggish technological change and limited human capital formation.","[Willebald, Henry] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,,lbertola@fcs.edu.uy; ccastelnovo@fcs.edu.uy; jerweber@fcs.edu.uy; hwilleba@clio.uc3m.es,,,,,,,57,24,25,1,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

This concern is foremost a matter of distributive justice, the definition of which determines the relevance of the appropriate scale and efficient allocation criteria. Yet it would appear that the discipline lacks a shared, internally consistent set of ethical premises by which this concern might be legitimized. Various authors have embraced a Rawlsian conception of liberal justice as the appropriate banner for ecological economics in place of the consequentialist-libertarian foundations of neoclassical economics (including environmental economics). It is argued here that this is insufficient in so far as it is premised on a vision of a discrete, self-sufficient economic actor. Instead, it is posited that an ecological economic ethic must proceed from an understanding of the economic actor as community member a recognition implicit in recent ecological economic contributions focused on discourse ethics and deliberative democracy. An ecological communitarian conception of distributive justice, which views the well-being of the individual as inseparable from the integrity of its implicate, mutually constituting human and non-human natural communities, is advanced as the appropriate basis for the ecological economic world-view. In this light, the thermodynamic foundations of ecological economics are seen to provide the necessary departure point for normative decision-making oriented towards ensuring sustainability in economic organization.

This process has increased final and intermediate imports, but also the distance that goods travel in different stages until they reach the final consumer, as well as the requirements of transport per unit of output and the volume of CO2 emissions generated in transporting them. Nowadays, there is no generally accepted criterion for international transport pollution allocation. No single country has the responsibility for emissions of international bunkers provided by IPCC. In this paper we propose a new methodology for quantifying by sector the impact of international freight transport on total pollution and assigning responsibility to consumers. This methodology considers the distance and the means of transport as key elements and uses input-output methodology. We apply this to the Spanish economy combining data from input-output tables, import data, and CO2 emission data. The results show that the proportion of total CO2 emissions accounted for by emissions from international freight transportation, allocated via the consumer criterion, increase up to 4.16% between 1995 and 2000. As expected, the industries where this offshoring process is more intense show the greatest increases in carbon emissions related to international transport. These emissions are significantly higher than emissions embodied in domestic inputs in some of those industries where international fragmentation of production is relevant and increasing.

One of the major constraints to sustainable management of wetlands in the region is that wetland users and decision-makers have insufficient understanding of the consequences of alternative management and policy regimes on wetland functioning, ecosystem services and human well-being. This study developed an ecological-economic model based on the system dynamics framework to simulate the impacts of alternative policy regimes on wetland functioning and economic well-being. Results showed that wetland services (crop production and natural resource harvesting) are inter-linked with trade-offs involved through their competition for labour, land and water resources. Policy scenario simulation results showed that diversifying livelihoods out of agriculture simultaneously improves economic well-being and enhances wetland conservation. Pure conservation strategies impose significant losses in the economic welfare of local population unless supported with diversification of livelihood sources. Government policies that support livelihood diversification into off-farm livelihood opportunities for the rural poor are critical for sustainable wetland management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A key determinant of acceptability is the perceived fairness of the distribution of the costs and benefits of the intervention. We examined the opportunities and challenges posed by benefit distribution in community-based Payment for Environmental Services (PES) interventions through a case study from Menabe, Madagascar. The intervention appears to be an overall success, with individuals reporting high levels of perceived fairness of payment distribution and a high proportion of individuals expressing overall net benefit. Nevertheless, a lack of adequate benefits accruing to those individuals facing high agricultural opportunity costs and evidence of sub-groups in the community reaping excessive benefits was noted across communities, and instances of poor governance were observed as a barrier to success in some communities. We present solutions to address these key challenges in the design and implementation of community-based PES interventions. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The links between materials use and economic development are central to the challenge of decoupling of materials use and economic growth (dematerialization) This article presents a new global material flow dataset compiled for the year 2000. covering 175 countries, including both extraction and trade flows, and comprising four major material categories biomass, construction minerals, fossil energy carriers and ores/industrial minerals. First, we quantify the variability and distributional inequality (Gull coefficients) in international material consumption. We then measure the influence of the drivers population, GDP. land area and climate This analysis yields international income elasticities of material use. Finally, we examine the coupling between material flows, and between income and material productivity, measured in economic production per tonne material consumed Material productivity is strongly coupled to Income, and may thus not be suitable as an international indicator of environmental progress a finding which we relate to the economic inelasticity of material consumption The results demonstrate striking differences between the material groups Biomass is the most equitably distributed resource, economically the most inelastic, and is not correlated to any of the mineral materials. The three mineral material groups are closely coupled to each other and economic activity, indicating that the challenge of dematerializing industrial economies may require fundamental structural transformation Our analysis provides a first systematic investigation of international differences in material use and their drivers, and thus serves as the basis for more detailed future work (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved","[Steinberger, Julia K.; Krausmann, Fridolin; Eisenmenger, Nina] Univ Klagenfurt, IFF, Inst Social Ecol Vienna, A-1070 Vienna, Austria",University of Klagenfurt,"Steinberger, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Klagenfurt, IFF, Inst Social Ecol Vienna, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria.",,"Eisenmenger, Nina/AAB-7805-2020; Krausmann, Fridolin/N-1918-2015; Steinberger, Julia/B-3288-2011","Eisenmenger, Nina/0000-0002-8833-3883; Krausmann, Fridolin/0000-0002-9995-2372; Steinberger, Julia/0000-0002-5925-9602",Austrian Science Fund [P-21012-G11]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 21012] Funding Source: researchfish,Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"We would like to thank Christoph Plutzar at the Institute of Social Ecology in Vienna for the computation of the GIS centroid latitudes we used as a proxy for climate We are especially grateful to Thomas Dietz of Michigan State University and Eugene Rosa of Washington State University for discussions of the STIRPAT method and related statistics.

Yet, what explains comparative institutional evolution? We investigate this issue by studying the coffee exporting economies of Latin America. Although homogeneous in many ways, they experienced radically different paths of economic (and political) development, which is conventionally traced to the differential organization of the coffee industry. We show that the different forms that the coffee economy took in the 19(th) century was critically determined by the legal environment determining access to land, and that different laws resulted from differences in the nature of political competition and the backgrounds of political elites. Our analysis suggests that explanations of institutional differences that stress economic fundamentals can only be part of the story. At least in the economies that we study, while geography, factor endowments and technology are clearly important, their implications for the institutional structure and thus development are conditional on the form that political competition takes in society. For interesting variations in economic outcomes, endowments are not fate.","[Nugent, Jeffrey B.] Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Robinson, James A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Robinson, James A.] Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Southern California; Harvard University; Harvard University,"Nugent, JB (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Univ Pk Campus, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",nugent@rcf.usc.edu; jrobinson@gov.harvard.edu,,,,,,,88,36,39,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Recently, the rapid progress in the service sector has attracted many scholars to study the development, progress and behaviour of service firms. Therefore, this paper is a preliminarily investigation of the pattern of, and motives for, business strategy and choice of entry mode made by Malaysian service firms. Being among the fast growing economies in the Asia Pacific region, which mainly relies on the service sector for economic development, many nascent Malaysian service firms are now seeking to expand beyond their national territory. This research proposes to utilize a case study approach through in-depth interviews with key managers/executives in selected Malaysian service firms to explain the internationalization behaviour of these firms.

The Rs flux of agro-forestry model was 8.55% less than the plantation abandoned land and 2.13% more than wheat land. The relationship of Rs and the factors is not significant except the surface CO2 concentration in winter. The correlativity of surface CO2 concentration and Rs is negative and the coefficient of determination is 0.86. The main factors of Rs are different in different dates. The Rs of different land-use types showed the obvious spatial heterogeneity, the relationship of Rs and vegetation cover is not significant.","[Gao Dong; Lu Shaowei; Rao Liangyi] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Soil & Water Conservat, Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Desertificat Com, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University,"Gao, D (通讯作者)，Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Soil & Water Conservat, Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Desertificat Com, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",gaodong_xianshannxi@126.com,"Rao, Liangyi/GZG-5832-2022",,,,,,14,0,0,0,7,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-17-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,228,235,,,,,,8,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BYF00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298334500035,0

The secondary aim is to rank safety attributes relative to other quality characteristics that consumers associate with pork. Design/methodology/approach - Consumers' preferences for safety as a quality characteristic in pork are investigated using choice experiments. An internet-based survey was carried out with 1,322 Danish consumers. Findings - There is a clear ranking of characteristics: domestic produce and low fat are valued as the most important attributes associated with minced pork, followed by reduced Salmonella risks, reduced use of antimicrobial agents, and increased animal welfare. In addition, it is found that consumers stated a clear willingness-to-pay for all the assessed product attributes including the safety attributes. Practical implications - The positive price premiums for safer food suggest that demand-driven market-based solutions might indeed be used to increase the supply of safer food provided that adequate labelling allows consumers to distinguish between products that differ from each other only with respect to non-visible safety characteristics. However, it is not suggested that food safety can be left entirely to be determined by market forces due to market failures, consumer preferences and large uncertainties. Originality/value - Earlier studies have not identified a unique ranking of the importance of safety relative to other quality characteristics in meat products. The main concern is that the value of food safety may be overestimated when it is not valued relative to a full set or as close to a full set as possible of other quality characteristics, which has been attempted in the present survey.","[Morkbak, Morten Raun; Christensen, Tove] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Fac Life Sci, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Univ So Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] DSI Danish Inst Hlth Serv Res, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Southern Denmark,"Morkbak, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Fac Life Sci, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",mm@foi.dk,"Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/A-3161-2011; Christensen, Tove/E-6774-2015","Christensen, Tove/0000-0003-1741-8190; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/0000-0003-1137-2304",,,,,40,26,29,0,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) is one of the perfect methods used to estimate BOD. Using DALY, the study aims to develop a method for evaluating BOD and to provide useful information for health planning for the residents in Shilin Yi Nationality Autonomous County (Shilin county). Methods: Methods developed for Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study by the World Bank and World Health Organization (WHO) were adapted and applied to Shilin county population health data. DALYs rate per 1,000 were calculated from medical death certificates in 2003 in Shilin county. The geographic coordinates of towns or townships were determined using the geocode function of the R2.3.1 geographical information system (GIS) software. Results: Respiratory diseases is by far the largest cause of years of life lost (YLL) in both males and females. The four other leading causes of YLL in descending order: unintentional injuries, cardiovascular diseases, intentional injuries, malignant neoplasms. But The five leading causes of years of lived with disability (YLD) in descending order: neuro-psychiatric conditions, intentional injuries, respiratory diseases, unintentional injuries, cardiovascular diseases. The leading causes of total disease burden (DALY) were neuro-psychiatric conditions. Townships of Muzhuqing and Xijiekou and Weize were serious disease burden areas in Shilin County. Conclusions: The prevention and treatment of neuro-psychiatric conditions and respiratory diseases for both female and male should be enhanced in Shilin county, and so as to decrease the injury.

The depicted aHANPP trajectory and the historical development of its components are discussed in view of a continuously increasing population and the transition process from an agrarian to an industrial socioecological regime. During the 19th century, aHANPP shows a steady decline from its level of 71% in 1800. While even higher levels were reached during the mid 20th century, the trend during the last forty years of the period under investigation again shows a reduction of aHANPP, which lies at 68% in the year 2000. The high values of aHANPP in the United Kingdom are primarily attributable to the limited amount of forest in comparison to large agricultural areas. At the beginning of the studied period, the relative stabilisation or even decrease in aHANPP in comparison to population development was made possible through the area expansion of and productivity increases on cropland and permanent pastures. Later this was made possible through the outsourcing of biomass harvest, by satisfying local nutritional demands by means of overseas imports, and as from the mid 20th century through huge amounts of fossil fuel based inputs into agriculture (e.g. increased amounts of fertilizers and motorized traction) which allowed increases in biomass harvest to be decoupled from HANPP.

The paper argues that expansion in terms of enrolment and attainment levels was quite impressive. A comparative analysis of the grade enrolment distribution demonstrates, however, that the rapid expansion of primary school enrolment did not correspond with an equally impressive improvement in educational quality. The persistently large tertiary education bias in public education spending suggests that part of the poor quality performance is related to a lack of fiscal support for primary education and that the political economy explanation for educational underdevelopment, as advanced by Engerman, Mariscal and Sokoloff for the 19(th) century, still applied to Latin America during most of the 20(th) century.","Univ Utrecht, Fac Humanities, NL-3512 BS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Frankema, E (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Humanities, Drift 10, NL-3512 BS Utrecht, Netherlands.",e.frankema@uu.nl,"frankema, ewout/B-4186-2015",,,,,,59,28,33,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

With new and better agricultural machinery, more farms than ever before made the leap to thousand acre enterprises, But did they abandon mixed husbandry in the process? This article explores the origins of the modem relationship between scale and diversity using a new sample of Kansas farms. In 25 townships across the state, between 1875 and 1940, the evidence demonstrates that relatively few plains farms were agents of early monoculture. Rather than a process driven by single-crop farming, settlement was shaped by farms that grew more diverse with each generation.","[Sylvester, Kenneth M.] Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Inter Univ Consortium Polit & Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA; [Sylvester, Kenneth M.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Populat Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Sylvester, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Inter Univ Consortium Polit & Social Res, 330 Packard St, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA.",kenms@umich.edu,,"Sylvester, Kenneth/0000-0003-3390-6637",,,,,69,3,5,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

Analysis of these series shows that machinery imports diverged across countries from 1890 through 1913.

Considerable progress has been made in lowering aggregate emissions and this paper seeks to disaggregate average industry improvements to study how much of it is due to innovations by first movers, and how much is achieved by adoption and diffusion of technology. We find both factors very important. Innovation has been rapid: the best firms have cut emissions on the order of 70%. In spite of this, reductions have actually been even more rapid for the majority of firms so that the median firms have caught up with best practice.

This paper begins by examining the ability of workers to provide for their old age. A data set is constructed, consisting of all English Poor Law Unions in 1891-2, and regression equations are estimated in order to explain variations across unions in pauperism rates. This is followed by the testing of several conjectures made by contemporaries, and repeated by historians, regarding the deterrent effect of workhouse relief, the effects of wages and of the industrial character of Poor Law Unions on pauperism rates, and regional differences in workers' reliance on the poor law. The paper then examines the implications of these results for the debate over national old age pensions in the decades before the adoption of the Old Age Pension Act.","[Boyer, George R.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Boyer, GR (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,,63,19,21,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

First, did being born in a city, with its associated disamenities, lead to stunting? Second, did being born near a city, whose markets sucked away foodstuffs, lead to stunting? Third, did child labour lead to stunting? We find that only those born in very large cities suffered a level of stunting that contemporaries could have observed. Being born near a city, which gave parents opportunities to trade away family calories, and perhaps increased exposure to disease, did not cause stunting. Britain was a well-integrated market; all families, whatever their locations, had options to trade and faced similar disease environments. Finally, although adults who had gone to sea young were shorter than those who did not enlist until fully grown, going to sea did not stunt. Instead, plentiful food at sea attracted stunted adolescents, who reversed most of their stunting as a result. But child labour at sea was different from other forms of children's work because wages were largely hypothecated to the child as food and shelter onboard. In contrast, where wages were paid to the child or his parents in cash, they became submerged in the household economy and their benefits were shared with other family members.","[Humphries, Jane] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Humphries, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,"Humphries, Jane/GQA-8830-2022",,,,,,39,13,14,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This paper presents a correction of the RAS method (CRAS) that uses cell variation distributions calculated from multiple matrices of different periods or different regions. After the solution of the regular RAS, an additional optimization problem is solved that produces the most likely cell-corrections to the regular RAS solution. To test the behavior of CRAS, several simulations with a time series of input-output tables for The Netherlands for 1968-1986 are made. They show that-in situations of structural change-applying CRAS improves the regular RAS estimate.

This paper argues that extended national accounts should not attempt measuring economic welfare. Rather, they could and should assess the environmental sustainability of economic activity as the cost of natural capital consumption. The global application of SEEA concepts and methods demonstrates the feasibility of international green accounting. For the world economy, sustainability costs run to about 3 trillion US$ or 6% of world GDP. Large variations at national and regional levels suggest that conventional economic indicators may significantly overstate economic progress in some parts of the world. Data gaps and lack of data comparability affect these first estimates. National and international statistical services should be more aggressive in greening the national accounts. More prudent and more sustainable economic policies might be the result. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper discusses a quantitative methodology to assess the relative performance of different climate policy scenarios when accounting for their long-term economic, social and environmental impacts. The proposed procedure is based on Data Envelopment Analysis, here employed in evaluating the relative efficiency of eleven global climate policy scenarios. The methodology provides a promising comparison framework; it can be seen as a way of setting some basic guidelines to frame further debates and negotiations and can be flexibly adopted and modified by decision makers to obtain relevant information for policy design. Three major findings emerge from this analysis: (i) stringent climate policies can outperform less ambitious proposals if all sustainability dimensions are taken into account; (ii) a carefully chosen burden-sharing rule is able to bring together climate stabilisation and equity considerations; and (iii) the most inefficient strategy results from the failure to negotiate a post-2012 global climate agreement.

Three different phases can be identified throughout the historical development. The initial phase lasting from the beginning of the 1920s to the early 1970s contains numerous characteristics of diverse well-established definitions and concepts of transdisciplinarity and represents a successful transdisciplinary process, which has not been perceived as such in the past and present scientific discussion. The second and third phases show an increasing segregation of thought collectives, caused by internal changes such as the establishment of specialised research institutions and external processes like agriculture policy and market development. These developments led to a decreasing degree of transdisciplinarity. We observe an ambiguous trend: the continuously growing and today well-established positive societal recognition of an initially rather little accepted newcomer movement is associated with the gradual loss of its very valuable forms of knowledge co-production and the related philosophical background. In order to maintain the various forms of transdisciplinary co-production of knowledge, one has to reflect not only their results or outcome but also the whole cooperation process, which has led to these results. The understanding of the historical development and characteristic features of knowledge co-production as presented in this study will help to reinforce transdisciplinary research in organic agriculture and research on transdisciplinarity in general.

To bring the perspectives of diverse disciplines together in a meaningful way, we describe a novel methodology for sustainability assessment of a particular social-ecological system, or country. Starting point is that a sustainability assessment should investigate the ability to continue and develop a desirable way of living vis-A-vis later generations and life elsewhere on the planet. Evidently, people hold different values and beliefs about the way societies sustain quality of life for their members. The first step, therefore, is to analyze people's value orientations and the way in which they interpret sustainability problems i.e. their beliefs. The next step is to translate the resulting worldviews into model-based narratives, i.e. scenarios. The qualitative and quantitative outcomes are then investigated in terms of associated risks and opportunities and robustness of policy options. The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) has followed this methodology, using extensive surveys among the Dutch population. In its First Sustainability Outlook (2004), the resulting archetypical worldviews became the basis for four different scenarios for policy analysis, with emphases on the domains of transport, energy and food. The goal of the agency's Sustainability Outlooks is to show that choices are inevitable in policy making for sustainable development, to indicate which positive and negative impacts one can expect of these choices (trade-offs), and to identify options that may be robust under several worldviews. The conceptualization proposed here is both clear and applicable in practical sustainability assessments for policy making. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[de Vries, Bert J.

As the Spanish cotton industry adopted the most modern technology available and experienced the transition to the factory system, cotton spinning and weaving mills became increasingly vertically integrated. Asset specificity, more than other factors, explains this tendency towards vertical integration. The probability of a firm being vertically integrated was higher among firms located in districts with high concentration ratios, and rose with size and the use of modern machinery. At the same time, subcontracting predominated in other phases of production and distribution, where transaction costs appear to be less important.","Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Rosés, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",,"Roses, Joan/K-5475-2013","Roses, Joan/0000-0003-0661-3134",,,,,69,1,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Understanding this link is critical for a wide-range of decision-making contexts. While there have been several attempts to come up with a classification scheme for ecosystem services, there has not been an agreed upon, meaningful and consistent definition for ecosystem services. In this paper we offer a definition of ecosystem services that is likely to be operational for ecosystem service research and several classification schemes. We argue that any attempt at classifying ecosystem services should be based on both the characteristics of the ecosystems of interest and a decision context for which the concept of ecosystem services is being mobilized. Because of this there is not one classification scheme that will be adequate for the many contexts in which ecosystem service research may be utilized. We discuss several examples of how classification schemes will be a function of both ecosystem and ecosystem service characteristics and the decision-making context. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This macro-allocation requires social choice, so to see whether it is likely to be competent the effectiveness of democratic politics is investigated. Dysfunction is predicted because democratic institutions produce elements of irresponsibility and ignorance. These permit inflation of want by supply (IWS), a positive feedback in which wants are increased by their supply, provoking more supply, hence more want. Four IWS systems combine under common conditions to indefinitely escalate the scarcity of natural capital, a crucial failure of macro-allocation. This 'scarcity multiplier' causes apparently rational attempts to satisfy a few wants to exacerbate many, increasing dissatisfaction. Institutions for deliberative public participation may enable democracies to recognize and control IWS. Unless this is done the scarcity multiplier may make cost-benefit analysis misleading: it may make the costs of development projects exceed their benefits in proportion to their financial success.

However different models and determinants are used in the literature. This paper aims to provide an overview, within a framework linking Schwartz' values theory and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Also it seeks to focus on the importance of affective attitude, emotions, personal norm, involvement and uncertainty related to organic food consumption. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on secondary data sources, namely the literature concerning personal determinants of organic food consumption. Findings - Both the values theory and the theory of planned behaviour have been referred to as relevant theories for better understanding consumers' choice for organic food. Organic food consumption decisions can be explained by relating attributes of organic food with more abstract values such as security, hedonism, universalism, benevolence, stimulation, self-direction and conformity. Appealing to these values can positively influence attitudes towards organic food consumption. Besides attitude, subjective and personal norm and (perceived) behavioural control influence consumption of organic food. Research limitations/implications - More research related to the role of uncertainty (reduction) during the process of buying organic food is recommended. Practical implications - Relatively little research has examined the affective component of attitude and emotions in relation to organic food consumption, while these may play an important role as drivers of involvement and thus help to jolt food purchasers out of their routine of buying conventional food and set a first step to adopt organic food. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper providing a comprehensive overview and linking the literature on organic food consumption to the values theory and the theory of planned behaviour, including the role of personal norm and focusing on emotions. The proposed integration of mental processing in an organic food consumption model leads to interesting hypotheses and recommendations for policy makers, researchers and stakeholders involved in the organic food market.","[Aertsens, Joris; Verbeke, Wim; Mondelaers, Koen; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Aertsens, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Joris.Aertsens@UGent.be,"Van Huylenbroeck, Guido/L-9251-2017; Verbeke, Wim/F-8373-2010","Verbeke, Wim/0000-0002-9967-7104",,,,,170,595,643,5,436,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Traditionally that disease is controlled by preventive fungicide applications during inflorescence development. The objective of this work was to evaluate integrated management practices to control fusariosis in pineapple fields under integrated production system. Monitoring of fusariosis was performed every month, starting three months after planting and continuing up to the treatment to induce flowering. Sampling for fusariosis incidence depended on field size; in fields of up to five hectares, five hundred plants were evaluated while in fields larger than five hectares evaluations were performed in one thousand plants. Fusariosis infected pineapple plants were eradicated during monitoring. Chemical control was recommended in fields where fusariosis incidence was 1% or higher. No fungicide applications were recommended when inflorescence development occurred under unfavorable conditions for fusariosis incidence. During the vegetative cycle, the number of fusariosis infected plants increased progressively up to the eighth evaluation and then with tendency for stabilization. The lowest percentage of infected plants at the first evaluation was 0.4% and the highest 2.0%. Evaluations performed immediately before flowering forcing treatment showed percentages of fusariosis infected plants varying from 1.2% to 16.6%. Fusariosis incidence in fruits varied according to the harvest season. In most pineapple fields, the proposed integrated management practices to control fusariosis enabled complete control of that disease on fruits. In pineapple fields where fruit development occurred under environmental conditions not favorable to fusariosis development no yield losses were observed due to that disease, even without spraying fungicide and despite of high percentages of infected plants prior to the flowering forcing treatment. On the other hand, when fruit development and harvest occurred under favorable conditions for fusariosis in two pineapple fields, the number of infected fruits ranged from zero to 46.5%.","[de Matos, A.

This paper aims to find out what factors constitute the main drivers and barriers to innovation and to explore how far the food processing industry can rely on the principles of innovation management developed in high-tech industries to improve its innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on the investigation of nine multinational food processing companies with their headquarters and/or major operations in The Netherlands. For this study a research questionnaire was developed, based on theoretical insights derived from the industrial organization theory and the resource-based view. In each company the research director, CTO, or CEO completed the questionnaire and was interviewed about different aspects of innovation management. Findings - The food processing industry can indeed rely on the principles of innovation management. However, there is clear room for improvement. Especially the potential of open innovation with suppliers and buyers to leverage innovation resources and capabilities is underutilized. Interestingly, the uneven power distribution in the chain, especially the high pressure of buyers, acts as a strong driver for innovation. Seen in this light it is noteworthy that in most companies the communication from R&D to marketing needs further improvement to enhance customer orientation, one of the main drivers of innovation success. Originality/value - This study is the first to investigate innovation management concepts related to success in the food processing industry.","[Fortuin, Frances T. J.

Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual framework was developed by examining the relationship between pork processors and their customers. A stratified random sample of 229 pork processors in eastern China provided data for empirical testing with partial least squares analysis. Findings - Results revealed that integrated IT and integrated logistics management improved the quality management practices of the pork processors. The application of IT also facilitated integrated logistics management. While quality management practices had significant impact on firm performance, the findings indicated neither integrated IT nor integrated logistics management was significantly related to firm performance. However, integrated IT had an indirect impact on firm performance through quality management practices. Practical implications - This study sheds light on the critical role of integrated information and logistics management in pork quality management For business managers, a high level of firm performance greatly depends on quality management practices. The issue of improving IT and logistics management remains a challenging task for managers in the pork processing sector in mainland China. Originality/value - Quantitative empirical study of the effects of integrated IT and logistics management on firm performance of the agrifood supply chain in China fills an important gap in research.","[Han, Jiqin] Nanjing Agr Univ, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Han, Jiqin] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Management Studies Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Trienekens, Jacques H.; Omta, S.

Based on internationally available concentration data of organic and conventional vegetables (carrots, tomatoes, lettuce and spinach) and potatoes, the paper aims to investigate the scientific validity of nutrition claims as no vegetable/potato has higher amounts of nutrient X than organic vegetables/potatoes and no vegetable/potato has lower amounts of contaminant Y than organic vegetables/potatoes. Design/methodology/approach - Detailed nutrient and contaminant databases were developed for organic and conventional vegetables separately. Non-parametric (Mann-Whitney test) methods were used to detect significant differences between both types of vegetables. A chi-square test was used to compare the incidence of pesticide residues in organic and conventional vegetables. Findings - From a nutritional and toxicological point of view, organic vegetables and potato in general are not significantly better than conventional vegetables and potatoes. For some nutrients and contaminants organic vegetables and potatoes score significantly better but for others they score significantly worse. Therefore, it becomes difficult to justify general claims indicating a surplus value of organic over conventional vegetables and potatoes. More data from controlled paired studies are needed to reconsider the use of claims for these organic plant foods in the future. Research limitations/implications - Only a limited number of studies comparing the nutrient and/or contaminant concentration of organic and conventional vegetables are available (paired studies). Additionally, the majority of the studies are of moderate or poor quality. The implication is that more of those paired studies are heavily needed. Another limitation of the study is the fact that most pesticide residue data originated from the USA, the EU and Australia. Originality/value - So far only few studies compared both nutrient and contaminant contents between organic and conventional plant foods. This paper covers therefore an important, not well-explored research sub area.","[Hoefkens, Christine; Vandekinderen, Isabelle; De Meulenaer, Bruno; Devlieghere, Frank; Baert, Katleen; Sioen, Isabelle; De Henauw, Stefaan; Verbeke, Wim; Van Camp, John] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Hoefkens, C (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Christine.Hoefkens@UGent.be,"Verbeke, Wim/F-8373-2010","Verbeke, Wim/0000-0002-9967-7104",Ministry of the Flemish Community,Ministry of the Flemish Community,The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Ministry of the Flemish Community (Department of Sustainable Agricultural Development - ADLO).

The main commercial cultivars grown in Brazil, 'Perola' and 'Smooth Cayenne', are both susceptible to fusariosis. Control of this disease is based on the integration of cultural practices and spraying fungicides from the early stages of inflorescence development until the closure of the last flower. Growing resistant varieties is certainly the most economic, efficient and environmentally safe control measure. In this work, crosses between the pineapple cv. Primavera (PRI), as female parental, and the cv. Smooth Cayenne (SC), as the male parental, enabled the creation of hundreds of hybrids by the Brazilian pineapple breeding program coordinated by Embrapa Cassava & Tropical Fruits. After preliminary evaluations under controlled conditions, some promising hybrids were introduced to the Experimental Farms of Incaper, where a Recurrent Clonal Selection of the hybrid PRI x SC-08 was carried out during the past 10 years, originating the Incaper access EC-099, that gave rise to the cv. Vitoria, released to growers at the Sooretama Experimental Farm of Incaper, Sooretama-ES, in November 2006. Based on evaluations carried out in several regions of Espirito Santo State (Marataizes, Joao Neiva, Cachoeiro do Itapemirim and Sooretama), the new cultivar confirmed its resistance to fusariosis, showed better quality fruits and agronomic characteristics similar to the reference cultivars 'Perola' and 'Smooth Cayenne'. 'Vitoria' has spineless leaves, a characteristic that makes it easier to carry out manual cultural practices. Its fruit presents a cylindrical shape, a yellow skin when ripe, a weight of about 1.5 kg and firm pulp with a high sugar content (15,8 degrees Brix), intermediate acidity and excellent flavor as shown by sensorial analyses. It is suitable for both fresh consumption and processing. The resistance to fusariosis avoids several fungicide applications reducing production costs and risks of negative environmental impact. This new cultivar has been multiplied by production of in vitro plants and released mainly to farmers in the State of Espirito Santo. Based upon crop management similar to that used by small growers for 'Perola' and 'Smooth Cayenne' crops in that State it is estimated that pineapple yield may increase from about 21 t/ha to more than 42 t/ha.","[Ventura, J.

The Austrian economy during World War I, when numerous raw materials had to be substituted by secondary sources, is analyzed as an example. The relative abundance of iron in the anthroposphere allowed a 40% increase in annual iron production in 1916 compared to peacetime, made possible by regulation. Almost half of the observed increase resulted from enhanced scrap utilization, covering up to 25% of total demand. By contrast, in peacetime, only 15% of iron consumption was covered by scrap. This sharp increase (from 330,000 to almost 600,000 tons/year) was accomplished by establishing authorities and regulations to guarantee sufficient metal supplies to industry and the military. Regulation was limited to pricing and inventories of scrap stocks. Purchase or confiscation of iron goods under civilian possession by the authorities proved unnecessary, while this was not the case for other metals. Although in-use iron stocks were not exploited, a severe shortage of civilian iron goods occurred since almost all iron produced was designated for military use. The historical data illustrate the short-term effectiveness and limits to extensive regulatory measures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The investigation considers three specific forest management regimes including a regime under complete state control, traditional community regime and a co-management regime known as Joint Forest Management. Communities with higher incidence of land poverty have lower forest access rates for grazing and fodder extraction, whereas communities with a higher incidence of land-rich households have higher forest access rates for fodder extraction. Forest access rates for fuelwood collection are lower under traditional and co-management regimes.

This paper seeks to examine the nature of the relationship between poverty and forests in Malawi. We try to answer three sets of questions: a) what is the extent of biomass available for meeting the energy needs of the poor in Malawi and how is this distributed? b) To what extent does fuelwood scarcity affect the welfare of the poor? And c) do households spend more time in fuelwood collection in response to scarcity? We answer these questions by matching household surveys with remote-sensing data. Our analyses suggest that biomass scarcity is associated with small but significantly lower household welfare, particularly for the rural poor. At current high levels of scarcity, 80% of rural poor households are likely to benefit from an increase in biomass in the community. Rural women spend more time on fuelwood collection where biomass is scarce. The small decrease in welfare associated with biomass scarcity suggests that households cope with scarcity in a variety of ways. Any effort to reduce degradation and deforestation in Malawi has to build on a clear understanding of household adaptation to fuelwood scarcity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

While they purport to measure spatial clustering, these statistics are confined to calculations within individual areal units. They are insensitive to the proximity of regions or to neighboring effects. Clearly, since spillovers do not recognize areal units, economic clusters may cross regional boundaries. Yet with current measures, any industrial agglomeration that traverses boundaries will be chopped into two or more pieces. Activity in adjacent spatial units is treated in exactly the same way as activity in far-flung, nonadjacent areas. This paper shows how popular measures of spatial concentration relying on areal data can be modified to account for neighboring effects. With a U. S. application, we also demonstrate that the new instruments we propose are easy to implement and can be valuable in regional analysis.","[Guimaraes, Paulo; Figueiredo, Octavio] Univ Porto, CEF UP, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Guimaraes, Paulo; Woodward, Douglas] Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Div Res, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",Universidade do Porto; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Guimaraes, P (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, CEF UP, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",guimaraes@moore.sc.edu; octavio@fep.up.pt; woodward@moore.sc.edu,"Figueiredo, Octávio/B-6025-2009; Guimaraes, Paulo D/A-7085-2008","Guimaraes, Paulo D/0000-0002-2992-1028; Figueiredo, Octavio/0000-0002-2930-1793",,,,,24,24,26,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

This article explores the basis for the growth of the aircraft industry during this time by focusing on Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Company's No. 5 Works. It was revealed that during the war, the supply of basic inputs increased substantially: labour force, equipment, and 'machinery parts' were in sufficient supply and none of these was a binding constraint on production. The binding constraint existed in the supply of 'special parts'. In other words, aircraft production expanded as the supply of special parts increased. This increase in the supply of special parts and still faster growth in the supply of machinery parts came about through the expansion of the supplier network in terms of both the number of suppliers and the geographical area in which they were located. These findings imply that outsourcing played a key role in the growth of aircraft production in wartime Japan.","Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Okazaki, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan.",,,,,,,,29,6,6,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Using a novel firm-level dataset from a DEFRA survey, we estimate a Tobit model, which provides empirical evidence showing that these eco-innovations are motivated by different external policy tools and internal firm specific factors. Our findings indicate that End of Pipeline Technologies and Integrated Cleaner Production Technologies are mainly driven by equipment upgrade motives with a view of improving efficiency while environmental regulations are effective in stimulating the End-of-Pipeline technologies and Environmental R&D. Interestingly, alongside government induced regulations, we find that market factors, mainly motivated by cost savings, are effective in driving Environmental R&D. Finally, ISO14001 certification is effective in strengthening the positive impact of environmental management systems on both End-of-Pipeline technologies and Environmental R&D while CSR policies have no significant impact on motivating any of the eco-innovations.

Using a macro perspective, it presents a review of the literature on current and future impacts of the nutritional transition that has made animals the chief source of protein in many countries. Protein-related environmental pressure is put into the perspective of a number of vital Earth-system processes whose boundaries have already been overstepped or are under threat of transgression. To inform policy-makers about these linkages a long-term global food security frame is proposed. Using a micro perspective, survey data on consumers reveal that their frames and habits are strongly adapted to the current meat system. Although this system has induced some pickiness about meat as well as uneasiness about meat's animal origin, there is a large psychological distance between consumers and experts in their view of protein sources. It is suggested that a global food security frame may help to bridge this distance by creating overlapping frames, capturing both altruistic aspects and a reasonable measure of self-interest. This may enable a novel protein transition, featuring a greater share of plant-based protein. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For other species, economists have attempted to measure human WTP for changes in the numbers of individuals for different types of wildlife, and to preserve biodiversity. When it comes to humans' WTP for improvements in the quality-of-life for other species, however, the evidence is limited. Morbidity and quality-of-life considerations may be particularly important to the task of valuing non-fatal harm to wildlife in the wake of an environmental disaster. We argue that the other species morbidity-reduction component of WTP should be calculated net of any outrage component associated with the cause of the harm. This net WTP is likely to be correlated with the premium that people are willing to pay for chicken products from birds for which the quality-of-life has been enhanced by improved animal welfare measures. This paper uses a conjoint choice stated preference survey to reveal the nature of systematic heterogeneity in preferences for humanely raised versus conventionally raised chicken. We also use latent class analysis to distinguish between two classes of people those who are willing to pay a premium for humanely raised chicken, and those who are not. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper aims at testing the robustness of such framing effects in the context of Provision Point Mechanisms (PPM). Our approach is original in that it combines both framing and provision point dimensions by comparing maintaining (taking from the public good) and creating (giving to the public good) contexts using Provision Point experiments. Consistent with previous findings, we find that individuals tend to be less cooperative in the maintaining frame than in the creating frame. Our results also show that the framing effects are stronger under a PPM than under a VCM and increase with the provision point level. These results may have important consequences for the management of environmental resources. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Kallis, G",,,,"Kallis, Giorgos",,,In defence of degrowth,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sustainable degrowth; Economic crisis; Environmental taxes; Working hours; Politics; Sustainability,GROWTH; LIMITS,"This article defends the proposal of sustainable degrowth. A starting premise is that resource and CO2 limits render further growth of the economy unsustainable. If degrowth is inevitable, the question is how it can become socially sustainable, i.e. a prosperous and stable, rather than a catastrophic, descent. Pricing mechanisms alone are unlikely to secure smooth adaptation; a full ensemble of environmental and redistributive policies is required, including - among others - policies for a basic income, reduction of working hours, environmental and consumption taxes and controls on advertising. Policies like these, that threaten to harm the economy, are less and less likely to be implemented within existing market economies, whose basic institutions (financial, property, political, and redistributive) depend on and mandate continuous economic growth. An intertwined cultural and political change is needed that will embrace degrowth as a positive social development and reform those institutions that make growth an imperative. Sustainable degrowth is therefore not just a structuring concept; it is a radical political project that offers a new story and a rallying slogan for a social coalition built around the aspiration to construct a society that lives better with less.

Every period, each contesting group allocates its capabilities, or power, between resource extraction and fighting over the extracted amount. The probability of victory rises with fighting effort, but a weaker group can still win an encounter. The victorious group wins all of the extracted resources and converts them to power, and the game repeats. In one model, groups openly access the resource. In a variant of the model, the stronger group can access a larger part of the resource than its rival, while in a second variant of the model the advantage of the dominant group is made more decisive than in the first two models. Our models generate outcomes that mimic several aspects of real-world conflict, including full military mobilization, defeats in one or repeated battles, victories following defeats, changes in relative dominance, and surrender. We examine comparative dynamics with respect to changes in the resource attributes, resource extraction, initial power allocation, fighting capabilities, and power accumulation. The policy implications are evaluated, and future research avenues are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we identify a mechanism through which knowledge spillovers occur among plants in the Chilean manufacturing industry. A plant-level production function is estimated with the absorptive-capacity hypothesis, that is, employment of skilled workers is a key channel through which knowledge is transmitted across plants. Results show that a plant's productivity from spillovers increases with its skill intensity, which is measured by the share of skilled workers in total employment. We also find that plants in a region with a large knowledge stock increase their skill intensity to benefit more from spillovers. Our results suggest that an increase in regional knowledge stock is the most effective policy to improve a plant's productivity. However, policies that encourage a plant to employ high skill-intensive production also enhance its productivity.","[Saito, Hisamitsu] Obihiro Univ Agr & Vet Med, Obihiro, Hokkaido 0808555, Japan; [Gopinath, Munisamy] Oregon State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Obihiro University of Agriculture & Veterinary Medicine; Oregon State University,"Saito, H (通讯作者)，Obihiro Univ Agr & Vet Med, Inada Cho Nishi 2 Sen 11, Obihiro, Hokkaido 0808555, Japan.",saitoh@obihiro.ac.jp; m.gopinath@oregonstate.edu,"Saito, Hisamitsu/E-5761-2014","Saito, Hisamitsu/0000-0002-8090-3538; Munisamy, Gopi/0000-0002-6249-7548",,,,,43,15,18,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.
