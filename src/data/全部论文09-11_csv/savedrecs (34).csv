The federal algorithm used to compute financial aid does not take into consideration assets accumulated in retirement accounts or as home equity, and households can reduce their implicit marginal financial aid tax rates by moving funds into retirement accounts or by increasing their home equity. Our results show that households who have higher marginal financial aid tax rates have a larger fraction of their portfolios invested in retirement assets and home equity, relative to taxable assets.","[Babiarz, Patryk] Univ Alabama, Dept Consumer Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Yilmazer, Tansel] Univ Missouri, Dept Personal Financial Planning, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Babiarz, P (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Consumer Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",,"Yilmazer, Tansel/HNS-8728-2023","Yilmazer, Tansel/0000-0002-8143-3427; Babiarz, Patryk/0000-0003-2506-381X",,,,,26,1,5,0,15,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

We estimate a demand system defined over alcohol, leisure, and other goods, using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey and other sources. Our results suggest that alcohol is a relative complement for leisure over a range of specifications. This implies that the optimal alcohol tax may substantially exceed the Pigouvian tax, reinforcing the efficiency case for higher taxation.

In contrast to macroeconomic convention. this paper argues that the share of nontraded goods is endogenous, a time-varying product of macroeconomic shocks and trade costs that are heterogeneous across goods. A simple open economy model demonstrates that trade cost heterogeneity and a time-varying margin of tradedness dramatically reduces the volatility of nontraded prices.

J,"Olsson, J",,,,"Olsson, Jerry",,,Improved road accessibility and indirect development effects: evidence from rural Philippines,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Road investment; Accessibility; Indirect development effect; Economic opportunity,INFRASTRUCTURE; TRANSPORT,"This paper develops earlier conceptual frameworks and methods for analyzing the indirect development effects of improved road accessibility. The creation of economic opportunity and response to economic opportunity are the two concepts used in the theoretical framework, while time-series data, a road accessibility inventory, and a multi-criteria analysis were the methods used to analyse the indirect effects among households and household firms. A weakness of many impact studies is that they merely chart aggregate economic development. The method employed here includes access to resources by various groups and therefore enables the focus to shift from mere aggregate economic development to also encompass equitable and sustainable social development. The study focused on a rural Philippine fishing community, previously characterized by poor transport conditions and poor accessibility to major markets. It found that the benefits of the road improvement were considerable and benefited a great majority of the population in the fishing community. In addition to the extensive direct effects of the improved road, a number of complementary factors led to substantial indirect effects. These included: abundance of harvested resource in the community; a potential for technical innovations that increased production and productivity; available investment to support this increased production; abundant demand for this increased production in the market region (the market widened in spatial terms and prices were maintained).

To address this question, a model of endogenous growth through selection and imitation is developed. it is consistent with recent evidence on firm dynamics and on the importance of reallocation for productivity growth. In the model, growth is driven by selection among heterogeneous incumbent firms and is sustained as entrants imitate the best incumbents. In this framework, firing costs not only induce misallocation of labor, but also affect growth by affecting firms' exit decisions. Importantly, charging firing costs only to continuing firms raises growth by promoting selection. Also charging them to exiting firms is akin to an exit tax, hampers selection, and reduces growth-by 0.1 percentage points in a calibrated version of the model. With job turnover very similar in the two settings, this implies that the treatment of exiting firms matters for growth. in addition, the impact on growth rates is larger in sectors where firms face larger idiosyncratic shocks, as in services. This fits evidence that recent EU-U.S. growth rate differences are largest in these sectors and implies that firing costs can play a role here. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A conservative central banker with stronger preference for price stability eliminates the commitment problem, thereby reduces output and price volatility and gives rise to a policy-induced 'Great Moderation'. Increased focus on price stability facilitates firms' information processing and aligns their expectations better with policy decisions. This 'coordination effect' reduces aggregate real and nominal volatility. Consistent with empirical evidence, the moderation manifests itself through reduced residual variance in vector autoregressions (VARs) involving macroeconomic variables. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, this paper shows that if consumers are impatient and are subject to transitory as well as permanent shocks, the optimal marginal propensity to consume out of permanent shocks (the MPCP) is strictly less than one, because buffer-stock savers have a target wealth-to-permanent-income ratio: a positive shock to permanent income moves the ratio below its target, temporarily boosting saving.

In our data, incompatibility makes the relationship between deposit account pricing and own ATM's more positive, and makes the relationship between deposit account pricing and competitors ATM's more negative.

Consistent estimation of mean WTP in parametric models requires the correct specification of the probability distribution of WTP. However, it is not possible to foresee the probability distribution, and thus in practical applications there is always a danger of specification error, making it impossible to guarantee that mean WTP will be consistently estimated. This paper applies linear projection to develop an estimation model that enables consistent estimation of mean WTP without specification of the probability distribution. This linear projection model enables us to estimate mean WTP only by calculating a weighted mean of the indicator function defined as 1 (or 0) when a respondent says yes (or no) for a certain improvement in environmental quality. Moreover, when bids follow the uniform distribution, calculation is possible by multiplying maximum bid and the rate of answering yes. Therefore, a distinguishing feature of this model is that estimation can be accomplished very easily.","[Watanabe, Masahide] Osaka Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, Osaka 5338533, Japan; [Asano, Kota] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Kyoto University,"Watanabe, M (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, 2-2-8 Osumi, Osaka 5338533, Japan.",wmasa@osaka-ue.ac.jp; asano@z05.mbox.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Watanabe, Masahide/0000-0003-2504-7238","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18078007, 18078004] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,9,6,7,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The model has better out-of-sample forecasting properties than a number of alternative models, and it contradicts the puzzling evidence that during the Great Moderation in inflation subsequent to the mid-1980s, the forecasting ability of structural models deteriorated with respect to atheoretic statistical models.","Univ Verona, SAFE Ctr, Dept Econ, I-37129 Verona, Italy",University of Verona,"Berardi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, SAFE Ctr, Dept Econ, Via Giardino Giusti 2, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",andrea.berardi@univr.it,,"Berardi, Andrea/0000-0001-5864-0033",,,,,51,10,12,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

In contrast, most economists opposed labor market interventions and regarded them as both, inefficient and unfair.

We argue that liberalization has created innovative market opportunities for private business aviation and illustrate how the sector's operating models are facilitating new, as yet largely undocumented, forms of aerial mobility. The paper examines: the advantages of private business aviation over scheduled services; business strategies in the sector, especially the idea of fractional jets; the impact of new technologies, particularly the Very Light jet (VLJ): and, finally, employs Europe as an example of the spatialities of private business aviation.

We examine the effects of four policy reform strategies oil a country's share of internet bandwidth, internet hosts, internet users, personal computers, and mobile phones. We argue that the best policy environment for the telecommunications sector is one maintained by all independent regulator that is not above representing the public interest or entering into public private partnerships to develop national information infirastructure. Holding other factors constant, privatizing the national telecommunications operator only has a few demonstrable effects, and the effects are mixed. Liberalizing the market for consumer communications services and separating the telecommunications regulator from direct control by the executive branch of government are, for the most part, constructive policies for encouraging technology adoption. Yet over time, too little public policy oversight usually has a negative impact on technology adoption. Regulatory independence mitigates against the digital divide, but regulatory withdrawal exacerbates it.

This paper examines the robustness of the Theorem to demand and capacity uncertainty in the context of highway travel. Three main results are derived. (1) The Theorem holds in expected values when users are perfectly informed about the state and the toll is set optimally as a function of the state. (2) The Theorem also holds in expected values when users are imperfectly informed about the state, the toll is set optimally given the information that users have, and the price elasticity of demand is the same in all states. (3) The Theorem does not hold if the toll is set using less information than users have. Whether an expected surplus or deficit results depends on the sign of the correlation across states between the Pigouvian toll and the ratio of the price elasticity of demand to the price. Examples show that the correlation can be positive or negative depending on the functional form of the demand and cost curves and the way the curves shift between states. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Warm glow also means that utility is decreasing in the giving of others, ceteris paribus, and the willingness to pay for altruism is smaller (at the margin) if altruistic households have a positive willingness to pay for warm glow. Consequently, a marginal redistribution of income that passes the Pareto test may fail the test if altruistic households receive warm glow. Numerical evaluation shows that passing the Pareto test is very sensitive to cross-price elasticities between charity and labor supply, the elasticity of charity with respect to warm glow, the tax rate of the rich, and the fraction of the population that is rich.","Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Allgood, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",,,,,,,,28,4,5,0,20,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Policymakers are currently considering moves such as enforcing more careful underwriting to provide additional discipline to mortgage markets. This research explores the possibility of another approach to supplement or replace some of these efforts, namely the use of policy to create incentives for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (together, the GSEs) to help check behavior in non-prime markets. The hypothesis is that the GSE Act affordable housing goals have increased GSE focus on targeted loan purchases, which in turn has led prime market lenders to compete more aggressively for borrowers on the margin between prime and subprime credit quality. As a consequence, these marginal borrowers will be more inclined to take prime mortgages rather than higher-cost subprime loans. We test this hypothesis and find empirical support for it. We observe a negative relationship between the growth in GSE market share and the growth in subprime market share over time, and find that the impact of the GSEs on subprime lending tends to be stronger in high-minority neighborhoods, where subprime lending has been concentrated and growing the fastest. Simulations show that a 10 percent increase in GSE market share (for example, from 20 to 22 percent) can cause 45,000 borrowers using prime instead of subprime loans a cost savings of about $1.7 billion. These results suggest that the GSEs, regardless of their post-conservatorship form, should continue to devote attention to serving underserved populations and suggest that significant welfare benefits will accrue.

Implied volatility is a market determined forecast, in contrast to model-based forecasts that employ some degree of smoothing of past volatility to generate forecasts. Implied volatility has the potential to reflect information that a model-based forecast could not. This paper considers two issues relating to the informational content of the S&P 500 VIX implied volatility index. First, whether it subsumes information on how historical jump activity contributed to the price volatility, followed by whether the VIX reflects any incremental information pertaining to future jump activity relative to model-based forecasts. It is found that the VIX index both subsumes information relating to past jump contributions to total volatility and reflects incremental information pertaining to future jump activity. This issue has not been examined previously and expands our understanding of how option markets form their volatility forecasts. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We focus our analysis on the impact of the euro for the determinants of trade in bonds, equity and banking assets. With the help of a theoretical model, we disentangle the different effects that the euro may have on cross-border asset holdings for both euro zone countries and countries outside of the euro zone. We find evidence that the euro implies 1) a unilateral financial liberalization which makes it cheaper for all countries to buy euro zone assets. For bonds and equity holdings, this translates into approximately 14% and 17% lower transaction costs; 2) a preferential financial liberalization which on top of the previous effect lowers transaction costs inside the euro zone by approximately 17% and 10% for bonds and equity respectively; 3) a diversion effect due to the fact that lower transaction costs inside the euro zone entail euro countries to purchase less equity from outside the euro zone. Our empirical analysis also suggests that the elasticity of substitution between bonds inside the euro zone is three times higher than between bonds denominated in different currencies. J.

If anything, the increase in earnings growth during the mid-to-late 1990s for single mothers who were particularly affected by the EITC expansion was higher than it was for other similar women.

The theoretical literature is divided into four strands: liquidity provision; asymmetric information; legal restrictions; and a medium of exchange. We assume that it is not zero cost to make a promise to redeem a liability at par value on demand. If so, then the conditions in the theories that result in par redemption are possible explanations why banks promise to pay par on demand. If the explanation based on customers' demand for liquidity is correct, payment of deposits at par will be promised when banks hold assets that are illiquid in the short run. If the asymmetric-information explanation based on the difficulty of valuing assets is correct, the marketability of banks' assets determines whether banks promise to pay par. If the legal restrictions explanation of par redemption is correct, banks will not promise to pay par if they are not required to do so. If the transaction explanation is correct, banks will promise to pay par if the deposits are used in transactions. We examine the history of banking in several countries in different eras: fourth century Athens. medieval Italy, Tokugawa Japan, and free banking and money market mutual funds in the United States. Each of the theories explains some of the observed banking arrangements and none explains all of them. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This study uses a new panel dataset for 124 developed and developing countries, available for the period 2003-04, to assess the impact of trade facilitation and other trade-related institutional constraints on manufacturing export performance with particular reference to Africa. We estimate a standard gravity model augmented with trade facilitation, regulatory quality, and infrastructure indicators. Our results show that trade facilitation reforms could contribute to improve export performance in Africa, but other reforms including the quality of the regulatory environment and the quality of the basic transport and communications infrastructure, are also needed. Furthermore, improvements in on-the-border and behind-the-border policies yield a higher return in terms of increasing manufacturing export performance in African Countries than in the rest of the world.

This paper emphasizes the importance of that approach for economic psychology and its connections with T. Schelling's project of the reorientation of the game theory. The implication of revisiting Simon from the conventionalist viewpoint is that not only may such an approach provide a solution to coordination problems, which is psychologically reliable, but it also leads to a decision paradigm, according to which understanding problems of coordination is impossible without taking into consideration individual cognitive limits and social representations of reality.

All over the world there has been an increasing interest in quality assurance (QA) in higher education, reflecting both the growing importance of higher education services and their valuable contribution to societies. As higher education services moves beyond national borders, the need for international cooperation in QA have increased in the last decades. Moreover, there is an internationalization of QA in higher education and the Asia-Pacific region is a good example. The paper examines the current academic literature surrounding QA in higher education in Asia-Pacific region, emphasizing the case of Japan. Based both on literature review and the experience of a Japanese visiting professor the paper deals with the emergence and development of QA systems in higher education in Asia-Pacific region and focuses on the case of the Japanese higher education system (JHES). The paper shows that the need for international arrangements and approaches to QA in higher education is clearly demonstrated by the case of Asia-Pacific region. It also shows that, facing the challenges of a highly competitive knowledge driven global economy, the region has begun to establish and implement an agreed set of QA principles in higher education. Commitment to quality by all higher education providers from the region has proved to be essential. The importance of quality provision in cross-border higher education made the JHES to implement a new approach in QA.","[Toma, Sorin-George; Naruo, Shinji] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest,"Toma, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",tomagsorin62@yahoo.com; shinjinaruo@yahoo.co.jp,"Toma, Sorin-George/AFC-5952-2022","Toma, Sorin-George/0000-0001-9116-7751",,,,,19,2,2,0,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2009,11.0,26,,,,,574,584,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,462KQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267351800035,0

Our findings suggest that acquirers with low levels of family ownership earn lower abnormal returns than do those with high levels of ownership. In addition, families with low ownership in their firm are more likely to use cash as the medium of exchange, thus avoiding dilution and maintaining their control. Further, acquisitions of targets with low levels of family ownership are associated with greater value creation. Our results are consistent with the entrenchment of families at low levels of ownership and a better alignment of their interests with those of minority shareholders at high levels of ownership. Finally, we find that dilution of the family's ownership, due to the use of stock as the medium of exchange, alters the family's incentives and thus influences firm value. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

They identify these shocks by restricting the short-run responses of output and the pride level. On the demand side, they disentangle a monetary and nonmonetary shock by restricting the response of the interest rate. The responses of labor market variables are similar across shocks: Expansionary shocks increase job creation, the job-finding rate, vacancies, and hours; and they decrease job destruction and the separation rate. Supply shocks have more persistent effects than demand shocks. Demand and supply shocks are equally important in driving business cycle fluctuations of labor market variables. The authors' findings for demand shocks are robust to alternative identification schemes involving the response of labor productivity at different horizons.

Secondly, contrary to expectations, inflation uncertainty in most cases does not harm the output growth performance of an economy. Thirdly, inflation and output uncertainty have a mixed effect on inflation. Consistent results are found using the VAR-GARCH-M approach to investigate the dynamic relationship between inflation and output growth using impulse response functions.

International borders create political, cultural and economic barriers which reduce the demand for international transport, partly offset by some opportunities which increase transport demand. An expert opinion approach is used to help identify and evaluate the effect of these barriers on transport demand. The research explores why initial traffic levels predicted for the Oresund fixed link between Copenhagen in Denmark and Malmo in Sweden were not achieved. It uses the Danish Great Belt fixed link as a control case in assessing the scale of these barriers to interaction. Subsequent trans-Oresund traffic growth is attributed mainly to a tax agreement between the Danish and Swedish governments to assist cross-border commuters, to discounted tolls and to complementary labour and housing market opportunities.

As two leading examples, secondary currencies were widespread during both the Great Depression in the United States and the 2002 recession in Argentina. What are the determinants of multiple currency usage and what is the effect on economic activity? Both issues are empirically addressed using inclividual-level surveys collected by the authors in Argentina during 2002 and 2003. The evidence supports the theoretically predicted determinants of secondary currency acceptability put forth in monetary theory. In particular, findings show that the acceptability of the secondary currency increases when the supply of national currency is low, the relative transaction cost of the secondary Currency is low, and the individual trading technologies are less effective. Moreover the acceptability of the secondary currency has real effects on economic activity. Among those who use the secondary currency the monthly income gain is more than 15% of the average Argentine's monthly income.

The 'new agriculture for development' replaces smallholder knowledge with corporate inputs to channel food through 'value chains' to markets comprised of those with purchasing power. This essay questions the Bank's new vision, arguing that 'new wine in old bottles' will continue to supply affluence rather than 'feed the world' and sustain its agricultures, especially at a time when land is being commandeered for luxury foods (e.g. the livestock complex, all-season vegetables and fruits) and biofuels, neither of which feed the poor.

Therefore Turkey has a monopoly power on the production and export of hazelnut. Among the agricultural export commodities, compared with its share in Turkey's total export volume, hazelnut has the highest share in total export revenue of Turkey. By using its monopoly power on hazelnut, Turkey aims to maximize hazelnut export revenue. To accomplish this aim and also to increase hazelnut producers' revenue, Turkey has adopted a high price subsidy policy. This policy had positive results in the short term but in the long run it had created a negative pressure on the domestic and export price levels. Government tries to reduce the pressure by subsidy purchases. As a result of this policy, production and stocks of hazelnut have increased. These increases affect the export quantity and price in the long run. The aim of this study is to determine the mechanism how the market equilibrium is reached under the aforementioned market conditions. For this purpose, hazelnut export quantity and export price functions are estimated simultaneously with the data running from 1980 to 2007.","Osmangazi Univ, IIBF, Iktisat Bolumu, Eskisehir, Turkey",Eskisehir Osmangazi University,"Parlaktuna, I (通讯作者)，Osmangazi Univ, IIBF, Iktisat Bolumu, Eskisehir, Turkey.",incip@ogu.edu.tr,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,ANKARA,"KUSKONDU SOKAK KILIM APT 14-8, A AYRANCI, ANKARA, 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

A microeconomic study of the Park of La Villette's audience,REVUE D ECONOMIE POLITIQUE,,,French,Article,,,,,,loyalty; consumer; decision; information costs; cultural goods,,"In the economic literature or in marketing research, works on cultural demand generally suggest market segmentation according to the kind or the frequency of consumers' practices. We support the idea that a consumer is characterized by his level of loyalty. The consumer faces an information problem: given that each cultural good is unique, he's uncertain as to its quality until he attends it. More generally, cultural goods are search goods: consumers lack information about their existence, their price, their availability and their characteristics. This results in information costs and in a risk of being disappointed. Since he's unable to consider every substitute before he fixes his choice on a cultural product, the consumer adopts a loyal behaviour to reduce costs and risks. I shall illustrate these ideas with an econometric study of attendance at the Park of la Villette in Paris.","[Guillon, Olivia] ENS Cachan, Dept Econ Gest, F-94235 Cachan, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Guillon, O (通讯作者)，ENS Cachan, Dept Econ Gest, 61 Ave President Wilson, F-94235 Cachan, France.",olivia.guuillon@ens-cachan.fr,,,,,,,32,1,2,0,5,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Our findings suggest that social factors work alongside informational considerations to make geography important to corporate decisions. We show that (i) geographically dispersed firms are less employee friendly; (ii) dismissals of divisional employees are less common in divisions located closer to corporate headquarters; and (iii) firms appear to adopt a pecking order and divest out-of-state entities before those in-state. To explain these findings, we consider both information and social factors. We find that firms are more likely to protect proximate employees in soft information industries (i.e., when information is difficult to transfer over long distances). However, employee protection holds only when the headquarters is located in a less populated county, suggesting a role for social factors. Additionally, stock markets respond favorably to divestitures of in-state divisions.","[Wulf, Julie] Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Landier, Augustin] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Nair, Vinay B.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Harvard University; New York University; University of Pennsylvania,"Wulf, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Soldiers Field Rd, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",jwulf@hbs.edu,"landier, augustin/AAX-1984-2020","landier, augustin/0000-0001-7928-295X",,,,,27,132,151,6,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

It distinguishes between two types of health effect: environmentally and medically induced. The first effect comes from better environmental quality and increases welfare, while the second comes from changes in medical consumption and produces welfare losses. However, a generalized model shows that welfare gains produced by the presence of tax deductions can offset the medically induced health effect when the initial medical consumption level is sufficiently high. Therefore, this paper explains that identifying budgetary characteristics of medical services may lead to the nonenvironmental dividend.","Univ Paris 01, EUREQua, F-75647 Paris 13, France",,"Yamagami, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, EUREQua, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",hiroaki.yamagami@malix.univ-paris1.fr,"Yamagami, Hiroaki/AER-7802-2022",,,,,,19,0,0,0,13,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2009,65.0,1,,,,,105,121,,10.1628/001522109X444170,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,457BA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266898600007,0

To shed some light on this puzzle, we develop a model of imperfect information in which cheaper goods experience higher price growth after the changeover. Retailers, aware of consumers' difficulties in adopting the new currency, use currency changeovers to increase profits by increasing prices. The lower the price transparency after the changeover, the higher the euro-related inflation. Using data on inflation (Eurostat) and price levels (Economist Intelligence Unit), we show that although the euro changeover did not significantly increase inflation, it nevertheless had a distortionary effect on prices. After the changeover, cheaper goods had higher inflation, and this effect was stronger in countries in which people found dealing with the new currency problematic.","[Dziuda, Wioletta] JL Kellogg Grad Sch Management, MEDS, Evanston, IL USA; [Mastrobuoni, Giovanni] Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy",Northwestern University; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Dziuda, W (通讯作者)，JL Kellogg Grad Sch Management, MEDS, Evanston, IL USA.",wdziuda@kellogg.northwestern.edu; giovanni.mastrobuoni@carloalberto.org,"Mastrobuoni, Giovanni/AAE-3941-2019","Mastrobuoni, Giovanni/0000-0002-7597-6855",,,,,19,25,26,0,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We find that the value of the firm decreases with the magnitude of abnormal accruals and increases with the level of derivative use. Moreover, the accrual discount is more pronounced in firms with weak investor protection and the hedging premium is greater for poorly governed firms. These results suggest that although managers can engage in real smoothing to improve the informativeness of firms' earnings and thus reduce agency costs, they might use artificial techniques to cosmetically improve the income stream in order to expropriate minority shareholders. In further support of agency theories, we report that poor corporate governance motivates the use of abnormal accruals and discourages derivative use.

The Czech Republic wants to help increase exports by means of state institutions which are Export Guarantee and Insurance Corporation, Inc. (thereinafter EGAP) and Czech Export Bank, Inc.

As most economies face downturn as well as does the international trade, credit insurance is used intensively, mainly the state supported part. To overcome the current problems of the financial crisis, the state increased basic capital of CEB and increased insurance capacity of EGAP, as well temporarily increased the insurance coverage and increased the proportion of state participation in the insurance of export risks. One of the impacts of global crisis on the activity EGAP was also offered cheaper products, introduction of new products and modifications to some existing insurance products. The system of state support of export and the link between EGAP and CEB result from the principles that collectively included in the OECD Consensus.

A theoretical model is set up to test the agent problem between the independent directors and the shareholders, which shows that through controlling the election of the independent directors, the large shareholder tends to keep the independent director's reputation incentive in a low level to maximize their own interest. The result of the empirical study shows that the large shareholders specially choose their own independent directors, so the independent directors are lack of reputation incentives to supervise and the labor market is basically lack of efficiency.

The sample consists of children attending Chicago Public Schools during years 1991 and 2004 between grade levels kindergarten and eighth grade. These children have mothers who either enter Illinois state prison or Cook county jail during an eight and an half year sampling period. The effect of maternal imprisonment is identified using a difference-in-difference strategy on a sample of children matched by different algorithms. I find that children whose mothers enter prison are less likely to experience grade retention than their matched counterparts at least in the immediate years following the mother's prison entry. These results are robust to different matching schemes as well as to different levels of maternal contact prior to the mother's incarceration. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, rule-based systems can rarely be water-tight. There may be gaps in the rules and places where the rules are vague or even incomplete. Of equal, if not greater significance is the fact that regulatees may develop schemes which fulfill the letter of the rules, but undermine their spirit. Regulators may find themselves constantly lagging behind the avoidance activities of the regulatees (McBarnet, 1988). In such circumstances, effective regulation breaks down. For the past ten years, the financial instruments issued by companies have become more and more complex. While it is impossible to predict the future, there are some trends and indicators which offer a window through which a glimpse of the possibilities can be seen. The non-stop tries of some companies to trick the state by arranging their financial statements has forced the FASB, SEC and other government authorities to improve and change some GAAP regulations. In the last 12 to 24 months, there has been a tremendous change in the financial reporting infrastructure within the European Union and in Romania as well so she can get accepted in the European Union, as evidenced by the many interesting and important developments that have occurred. On the regulatory side, the European Commission (EC) issued a draft regulation that will require the use of IAS by 2005, or 2007, for 7,000 companies. That draft regulation was endorsed by the European Parliament less than 2 months ago. The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, or EFRAG, was established to coordinate the development of input to the IASB; and securities regulators in Europe have come together to agree on a more unified structure via the Committee of European Securities Regulators, otherwise known as CESR. For the standard-setters, in April 2001, the IASC, the predecessor to the IASB, was reorganized into a full-time, independent standard-setter; and the IASB agreed on its initial agenda, which included an improvements project, a project on the first-time application of IAS and a project on the Preface of the standards that dealt with the so-call black/gray lettering issue.

Only the remarkable development of tourism in recent years, linked with the rising standard of living in advanced countries, has drawn attention to the necessity to solve questions of its permanent sustainability. A significant part of income for the state and local budgets is formed by the tourist industry revenues. Another benefit of the tourist industry to the development of territory is also the generation of new working positions. Last but not least, tourism contributes to the exploring of new designations, natural and cultural heritage of other nations, helps to better understand their mentality, customs and traditions and thereby. it can develop the idea of a peaceful coexistence. On the other hand, due to a huge uncoordinated development of tourism, certain locations can be affected by environmental damage and excessive exploitation of natural resources (especially non-renewable), and because of different customs and manners there is a rising threat of conflicts between the natives and the visitors. Mentioned facts suggest that it is necessary to deal with problems of sustainable development in the field of tourism. The sustainable development of the tourist industry helps the expansion of territories, considering gentle exploitation of natural and cultural values.

Although Chinese government started to pilot some crop insurance programs for major crops including corn, wheat, rice, cotton, oil crops in selected areas, farmers' Participating interests are rather low. In this paper, we try to explore the factors that are influence farmers' understanding of risks and insurance, and in turn influence their willingness to participate. Northeast plains has been the major production food and feed grain area in China. The majority farmers in Liaoning, one of the three provinces on the plain, are cultivating wheat, rice and corn as their primary crops. A farmers' survey with questions on agricultural production risks and insurances was conducted in winter vacation of 2008 in villages from several counties in Liaoning Province. The survey includes two components, farmers' general information including household characteristics, employment and income situation, and demographics. and farmers' specific information on agricultural risk and insurance including risk exposure, comprehension of insurance, insurance Participating interests, and other measurements of, risk management. Variables selected for the analysis include willingness to participate in agricultural insurance, gender, age, education, the percentage of agricultural income in household gross income, land acreage, poverty level, extent of disaster losses from agriculture, and whether to participate in other insurance programs (medical, property, pesion, transport and other insurance), farmers' comprehension about insurance. Descriptive statistics show that less than half of the survey respondents are willing to pay for insurance although the program is subsidized by the government. About 20% of respondents are women, and about half of the respondents have middle school education, Half of them fall into the age category between 45 and 55, and very few young people stay in the farming business. Using the willingness to participate variable as the dependent variable, a Logit model is used. The result shows that females are more reluctant to participate in agricultural insurance. Educational level contributes to insurance interests positively. There is an income Influence, the poorer farmers are less interested in buying insurance. Farmers memory of the extent of the past disaster loss also influences the willingness to participate in insurance positively. This indicates those with larger loss which means higher risks don't tend to buy, which may eventually cause adverse selection problem if the coverage and premium are not carefully designed. The results imply that there is a role for government to play in helping farmers managing risks through premium subsidy to support the poor farmers and through risk education to let them understand the probability of disaster and influence of it once occurs.","Liaoning Univ, Shenyang 110036, Peoples R China",Liaoning University,"Nie, R (通讯作者)，Liaoning Univ, Shenyang 110036, Peoples R China.",nierongqin@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,,,,,2009,,,,,,,328,332,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BME64,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272028800023,0

Consequently, few entrepreneurs have been able to develop their business, although some interesting exceptions do arise. The financial data of 1 000 logging enterprises operating in 2007 were analysed for the period 2001-2007. Two thirds of enterprises were small, operating one or two machines, but they produced only one third of the total turnover. The ratio analysis focusing on the profitability, liquidity and solvency reveal economic problems in a quarter of the enterprises. High debts, and to some extent high levels of investments, have negative effects on profitability. Reserves needed to develop operations are very small in general and nil on the smallest enterprises.

Often a product of rentier politics, Dutch Disease undermines long-term economic performance in resource dependent economies resulting in a 'resource curse'. The conventional wisdom argues that institutions and state development at the time of a resource boom lock countries into divergent developmental trajectories. I argue that political coalitions lay the foundation for development of state and other institutions, and that changes in coalitions drive changes in policy responses to resource booms. Botswana's experience illustrates the argument. Botswana has not entirely avoided symptoms of Dutch Disease, but has kept them largely in check despite the fragility of state institutions when diamonds were discovered. A broad and stable political coalition during the first decades of independence encouraged adoption of pro-growth policies and institutions. Rather than lock the country into a persistent development trajectory, these institutions left room for changes in political coalitions. As political coalitions change, economic policies and performance are also likely to change.","Concordia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Poteete, AR (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",apoteete@alcor.concordia.ca,,"Poteete, Amy/0000-0002-7017-8731",,,,,125,58,68,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This means that the impact of changes in the observed variables is analyzed, i.e. how they influence the standard of living and level of development in countries of the world. The main hypothesis is that investing in people, i.e. in primary, secondary and tertiary education will bring long-term positive effects on social growth and development, thus contributing to the level of development and overall standard of living. Another hypothesis is that, depending on the development level, human capital and education will exert different influence on GDP per capita, which indicates that a number of economic variables play a major role on the effects of education.","[Pozega, Zeljko; Crnkovic, Boris] Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,,bcrnko@efos.hr; zpozega@efos.hr,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-061-2,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,207,214,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMP23,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273265800019,0

This phenomenon is known as the endowment effect. From a behavioral finance point of view, the effect is interesting because the asymmetry between people's willingness to pay to acquire the object versus to part with it seems to be triggered by mere ownership of the object. In this paper, we propose that the endowment effect is due to discrepancies in the affective equilibria between owners and potential buyers of an endowment. We define an affective equilibrium as the price or range of prices for which traders forecast equal post-trade happiness for themselves and for their trading partners. In three studies, we obtain empirical findings that are consistent with this explanation and that also demonstrate erroneous affective forecasting in endowment owners and potential buyers. We discuss these findings in relation to the endowment effect literature. We also suggest that transaction-related emotions should be studied alongside people's risk perceptions to provide a better understanding of financial behaviors.","[Sevdalis, Nick; Harvey, Nigel] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Sevdalis, N (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biosurg & Surg Technol, St Marys Hosp, QEQM, 10th Floor,S Wharf Rd, London W2 1NY, England.",n.sevdalis@imperial.ac.uk,"SEVDALIS, NICK/A-8310-2008; Sevdalis, Nick/AAJ-6280-2020","SEVDALIS, NICK/0000-0001-7560-8924; Sevdalis, Nick/0000-0001-7560-8924",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-538-28-1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,14,7,7,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

In reality, however, the obscurity rooted in rural practices calls for research on the causality and implication of the unconstitutional perception by farmers. Our field study reveals that most of the sampled farmers deem that the rural land belongs to the national government;a reasonable response given the farmer's level of education. Nevertheless, our further investigation shows that this is not a plausible explanation because most of the sampled farmers know who should be the owners of rural land according to the law, and their controversial answers in our questionnaire reflects their rational behavior. In fact, it is the vague definition of ownership of rural land in laws and practice that led to the farmers' dubious answers. Therefore, one inference is that practice is much more important than the written laws on issues pertaining to farmers. A law system will not be recognized and able to help eliminate the frequent confrontations resulted from disputes on ownership of rural land if it does not put the ownership of rural land into practice. In contrast, the delicate relationship between farmers and local governments will certainly deteriorate in the midst of urbanization and industrialization if the gap is not filled.","[Shi, Qinghua; Yu, Ning] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Shi, QH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China.",shq@sjtu.edu.cn; nyu@sjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,,,,,2009,,,,,,,204,216,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BME64,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272028800014,0

However, human resource management (HRM) has largely been overlooked. Using data obtained from central personnel agencies and nine sub-national governments, this article examines the major elements of HRM at sub-national level: recruitment and selection; promotion and advancement; training and development; remuneration; and performance management. The structure and operation of these elements are compared with those advocated in Strategic HRM, the dominant paradigm of contemporary HRM. The findings are that a centralised, bureaucratised system of HRM remains in place in Indonesia, with many practices retained from the pre-decentralisation period. The HRM system is only minimally linked to strategic concerns and organisational goal achievement. Reforms are essential, but an incremental approach is recommended, keeping the basic framework centralised but creating incentives for reform by making local governments more accountable for personnel costs and performance.","[Turner, Mark; Sutiyono, Wahyu] Univ Canberra, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Imbaruddin, Amir] STIA LAN Natl Inst Publ Adm, Makassar, Indonesia",University of Canberra,"Turner, M (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",,"Sutiyono, Wahyu/J-2675-2014","Sutiyono, Wahyu/0000-0002-7292-2691",,,,,37,16,18,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Taking Leshan power market as an example, in this paper, we first analyze the market structure of Leshan electric power industry, putting forward that for state-owned company, conflict between economic and social benefits has been a prominent issue in Leshan where large number of population are scatted in the mountainous regions, leading it too expensive to build grid. Second, by listing the ownership changes of Leshan Electric Power Co. Ltd (LEP) from 1993-2008, a local public corporate, we find that from 2006, state-owned company began to invest in LEP, further became the largest shareholder in 2008. We suggest that this turnover in shareholder indicates the end of competition rivalry between state-owned and local companies and more important, the beginning of cooperation in Leshan power market, which will significantly influence the efficiency of social responsibility implementation. Through the local power company, like LEP, state-owned corporate can fulfill its corresponding social duty with lower cost and pursue its economic benefit at the same time. Our findings suggest that Leshan mode may provide some implications on how to balance the economic and social benefit for nature monopoly market.","[Wei Xiaotian; He Zheng] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,,hezh@uestc.edu.cn,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,820,825,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000100,0

We show that the value of the abandonment option is a decreasing function of the Finn's operating leverage. Upon the introduction of the abandonment option, the firm as such optimally lowers its operating leverage. We further show that there are direct and indirect effects of the abandonment option on the firm's optimal investment trigger, which act against each other. First, the ability to shut down production offers downside protection to the firm, thereby making the firm more eager to exercise the investment option. This is the negative direct effect that pushes down the investment trigger. Second, introducing the abandonment option to the firm induces the firm to lower its operating leverage, thereby making the firm more reluctant to exercise the investment option. This is the positive indirect effect that lifts LIP the investment trigger. We numerically verify that the overall effect of the abandonment option on the firm's optimal investment trigger is negative. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A Look Beneath the Surface,REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,REGRESSION-DISCONTINUITY DESIGN; INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS; PRODUCT MARKET; COMPENSATION; INVESTMENT; COMMERCIALIZATION; PERFORMANCE; REPUTATION; CONTRACTS; STRATEGY,"We use the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which covers the entire universe of private and public U.S. manufacturing firms, to study several related questions regarding the efficiency gains generated by venture capital (VC) investment in private firms. First, do VCs indeed improve the efficiency (total factor productivity, TFP) of private firms, and if so, are certain kinds of VCs (high reputation vs. low reputation) better at generating such efficiency gains than others? Second, do VCs invest in more efficient firms to begin with (screening), or do they improve efficiency after investment (monitoring)? Third, do efficiency improvements due to VC backing arise from increases in sales or reductions in costs? Fourth, do VC backing and the associated efficiency gains affect the probability of a successful exit (IPO or acquisition)? Our analysis shows that the overall efficiency of VC-backed firms is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms at every point in time. This efficiency advantage of VC-backed firms arises from both screening and monitoring: The efficiency of VC-backed firms prior to receiving financing is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms, and further, the growth in efficiency subsequent to VC financing is greater for such firms. The above increases in efficiency of VC-backed firms are spread over the first two rounds of VC financing after which the TFP of such firms remains constant until exit. Additionally, we show that while the TFP of firms prior to receiving financing is lower for high-reputation VC-backed firms, the increase in TFP subsequent to financing is significantly greater for these firms, consistent with high-reputation VCs having greater monitoring ability. We disentangle the screening and monitoring effects of VC backing using three different methodologies: switching regression with endogenous switching, regression discontinuity analysis, and propensity score matching. We show that while overall efficiency gains generated by VC backing arise primarily from improvements in sales, the efficiency gains of high-reputation VC-backed firms arise also from lower increases in production costs. Finally, we show that VC backing and the associated efficiency gains positively affect the probability of a successful exit.","[Chemmanur, Thomas J.] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Dept Finance, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Krishnan, Karthik] Northeastern Univ, Coll Business Adm, Boston, MA USA; [Nandy, Debarshi K.] Brandeis Univ, Int Business Sch, Waltham, MA 02254 USA",Boston College; Northeastern University; Brandeis University,"Chemmanur, TJ (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Dept Finance, Fulton Hall 440, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",chemmanu@bc.edu,,"Nandy, Debarshi/0000-0002-9435-0129",,,,,56,218,255,10,185,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

However, evidence shows that current behaviour depends on past experiences. In this paper, we design an experiment to control for the initial experience in decisions from experience by providing decision makers with an exogenous history (successful vs. unsuccessful) prior to initiating the decision task. Moreover, varying the initial endowment level for fixed histories we investigate the income effect. We are also interested in analysing the duration of both effects (history and income). We find significant treatment effects in the sense that more risk taking behaviour is associated with good histories and with low income levels. According to previous literature, our results confirm the transitory nature of both effects, although the duration of the income effect doubles the duration of the history effect. In the long run, risky choice behaviour converges across different treatments.","[Jimenez, Francisca] Univ Jaen, Dept Econ, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Fatas, Enrique] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Morales, Antonio J.] Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Jaen; University of East Anglia; Universidad de Malaga,"Jiménez, F (通讯作者)，Univ Jaen, Dept Econ, Campus Las Lagunillas S-N, Jaen 23071, Spain.",jimenezf@ujaen.es,"Jiménez, Francisca Jiménez/P-7720-2015; Morales, Antonio J/A-4426-2013; Fatas, Enrique/ITV-7431-2023","Jiménez, Francisca Jiménez/0000-0002-4129-0556; Morales, Antonio J/0000-0002-2843-8245; Fatas, Enrique/0000-0002-0603-2156",,,,,30,1,1,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

Use of computers and the Internet as general-purpose technologies has spread rapidly across all sectors of the economy, transforming business organization, increasing competition, and fostering innovation. Understanding the influence of ICT on the dynamics of the workplace requires information on both demand and supply sides of the labor market, but it is only recently that the study of both sides of the market has become feasible using linked employer-employee data. In this article, we investigate the effects of new technology on firm productivity using the rich Canadian Workplace and Employee Survey for the period 1999-2003. We apply a mixed regression model which includes both firm and employee characteristics as well as their interactions with computer use. Our model allows us to control for unobserved heterogeneity at higher levels along many dimensions. Our findings indicate that computer use by employees has a positive and significant effect on the productivity of firms that the effect has not lost its momentum, and that spillover effects are not significant. Moreover, human capital enhances the effect of computer use on productivity, but organizational changes do not interact with computer use in our sample period.","[Moshiri, Saeed] Univ Saskatchewan, STM Coll, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W6, Canada; [Simpson, Wayne] Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; University of Manitoba,"Moshiri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, STM Coll, 1437 Coll Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W6, Canada.",moshiri.s@usask.ca; simpson@cc.umanitoba.ca,,,,,,,67,25,27,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

To verify the model's prediction, we use a combined artefactual field experiment and household survey data in Vietnam to investigate whether involvement is risky and has long-run targeted benefits, thereby causing fishermen to exhibit different risk and time preferences than workers in other occupations. Using a structural model approach, we integrate prospect theory and hyperbolic time discounting into a single framework, to simultaneously estimate and correlate the parameters of both risk and time preferences with other demographic variables. The key finding that fishermen are found to be less risk-averse and more patient than others asserts the theoretical prediction about the influence of the working environment on preferences.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Dept Econ, Singapore 637332, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Nguyen, Q (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Dept Econ, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",dqnguyen@ntu.edu.sg,"Lott, Corey/B-9795-2012",,,,,,48,33,36,2,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

The designated successor may become too successful politically and threaten the autocrat's rule, or if not successful in achieving recognition, the designated successor may fail to remain in office after the ruler dies, and the ruler's legacy will not be sustained. The dilemma is also that of the successor in choosing self-promotion that threatens the still-living ruler. I examine the solution to the successor's dilemma in the single-party system China. Uniquely for an autocracy. China has term limits and also age limits on political office. I describe how term limits and dual-generation designation of successors on the basis of checks-and-balances were the consequence of a rational choice of Deng Xiaoping, as a paramount leader, to resolve the successor's dilemma so as to extend his own power to sustain his legacies.

Second, previous studies emphasize wage determination solely at the conditional mean rather than resort to wage determination across the entire earnings distribution. We remedy these weaknesses and add a new layer of research previously unexamined. Particularly, we consider wage changes during periods of wide GDP fluctuations from 1977 to 1986, 1986 to 1999, and 1999 to 2005 and explore if prices of measured human capital skills moved in tandem with changes in the dispersion of unmeasured human capital skills as is postulated by human capital theory. Our results support human capital theory: we find higher wages and higher residual wage dispersion during periods of rising GDP (1999-2005) but find lower wages and lower residual wage dispersion during periods of falling GDP (1977-86 and 1986-99).","[Dabalen, Andrew] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Agesa, Richard U.; Agesa, Jacqueline] Marshall Univ, Div Finance & Econ, Huntington, WV 25755 USA",The World Bank; Marshall University,"Dabalen, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",agesa@marshall.edu; agesaj@marshall.edu; adabalen@worldbank.org,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Estimation results based on this measure of fiscal policy changes suggest that a 1 percent of GDP fiscal consolidation raises the current account balance-to-GDP ratio by about 0.6 percentage point, supporting the twin deficits hypothesis. This effect is substantially larger than that obtained using standard measures of the fiscal policy stance, such as the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance.","[Bluedorn, John; Leigh, Daniel] IMFs Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",,"Bluedorn, J (通讯作者)，IMFs Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,"Bluedorn, John/0000-0002-1200-8427",,,,,26,53,62,0,18,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

The emergence of an increasing number of new donors may further complicate the coordination of international aid efforts. At the same time, it is open to question whether new donors (many of which were aid recipients until recently) are more altruistic and provide better targeted aid according to need and merit. Project-level data on aid by new donors, as collected by the AidData initiative, allow for empirical analyses comparing the allocation behavior of new versus old donors. We employ Probit and Tobit models and test for significant differences in the distribution of aid by new and old donors across recipient countries. We find that, on average, new donors care less for recipient need than old donors. New and old donors behave similarly in several respects, however. They disregard merit by not taking the level of corruption in recipient countries into account. Concerns that commercial self-interest distorts the allocation of aid seem to be overblown for both groups. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis was based on a series of information obtained through a field research carried out between January and June 2011 among the Romanian immigrants in Andalusia (306 respondents). The analysis' results revealed the fact that after migration, the Romanian immigrants who took part in the study felt a series of changes in their food consumption habits, mainly resulting in consuming a higher proportion of the food products specific to the host country, compared to the food products specific to their country of origin. The analysed factors that may influence the relationship between migration and food consumption habits were encountered in the specific scientific literature, namely the length of residence and immigrants' age. The analysis revealed the fact that among different groups of respondents by length of residence and age, there are statistically significant differences in what concerns their perception regarding the changes in their food consumption habits after migration. The length of residence is positively correlated with the changes in food consumption after migration, while age is negatively correlated.","[Saseanu, Andreea Simona; Petrescu, Raluca Mariana] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Petrescu, RM (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",raluca.petrescu@com.ase.ro,"Saseanu, Andreea/AAL-1437-2021; Grosu, Raluca Mariana/I-5331-2017","Grosu, Raluca Mariana/0000-0003-4246-2433; Saseanu, Andreea Simona/0000-0002-8553-6191",,,,,26,8,9,0,22,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2011,13.0,,,,5,,790,802,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,860DR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297929300013,0

Gains in financial institution stocks may come from projected increases in efficiency, increases in the bargaining power of financial institutions, or greater access to the federal safety net. For customers seeking improved access to capital markets, gains in efficiency should result in increased benefits, but increases in bank bargaining power could increase funding costs and/or decrease capital market access. Customers may also lose as taxpayers who support the federal safety net. This paper finds evidence of potential taxpayer losses and increased bank bargaining power, especially vis-a-vis credit-constrained customers for whom safety-net subsidies are unlikely to be shifted forward.

Both demand and supply have played a relevant role, in the whole sample period and during the crisis. A counterfactual exercise shows that the effect of supply factors on the growth of lending was strongest after the Lehman collapse. On average, over the crisis period the negative effect on the annualized quarter-on-quarter growth rate of the panel banks' lending to enterprises can be estimated in a range of 2.3-3.1 percentage points, depending on the specification. About one fourth of the total supply effect can be attributed to costs related to the banks' balance sheet position, the rest to their perception of credit risk. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The minimum level of capital is set by banking regulators as a function of the banks' own estimates of their risk exposures. As a result, a great challenge for both banks and regulators is to validate internal risk models. We show that a large fraction of US and international banks uses contaminated data when testing their models. In particular, most banks validate their market risk model using profit-and-loss (P/L) data that include fees and commissions and intraday trading revenues. This practice is inconsistent with the definition of the employed market risk measure. Using both bank data and simulations, we find that data contamination has dramatic implications for model validation and can lead to the acceptance of misspecified risk models. Moreover, our estimates suggest that the use of contaminated data can significantly reduce (market-risk induced) regulatory capital. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Allowing for nonlinearities, this paper tests competing hypotheses on the possible relationship between volatility and trading volume using data for three major currency futures contracts denominated in US dollars, namely the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen. We find that trading volumes and return volatility are negatively correlated, implying a lack of support for the mixture of distributions hypothesis (MOH). Using linear and nonlinear Granger causality tests, we document significant lead-lag relations between trading volumes and return volatility consistent with the sequential arrival of information (SAI) hypothesis. These findings are robust and nor sample-dependent or due to heterogeneity of beliefs as proxied by open interest. Furthermore, our results are insensitive to the modeling approach used to recover volatility measures. Overall, our findings support the contention that short- to medium-term currency relationships may be dominated by trading dynamics and not by fundamentals. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines how the 2010 microfinance crisis in Andhra Pradesh reveals significant fault lines that underlie this narrative. It argues that the crisis of microfinance in Andhra Pradesh needs to be placed within the context of severe agrarian dislocations stemming from the impact of trade liberalization, drought cycles and a transformation of rural social relations. The contradictions are most strikingly represented in increasing rural differentiation and a generalized crisis of social reproduction among land-poor farmers and landless labourers. A massive influx of microfinance - driven by both state-operated programmes and private-sector institutions leveraged with cross-border financial flows found a ready clientele among various agrarian classes seeking to bolster consumption and roll over debt in conditions of significant uncertainty and distress. Yet in banking on this vulnerability, microfinance institutions socialized the contradictions of rural Andhra Pradesh and have ultimately been thrown into limbo through the unleashing of political and social forces unforeseen in neoliberal narratives of agrarian change.","Queens Univ, Dept Global Dev Studies, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Taylor, M (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Global Dev Studies, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",marcus.taylor@queensu.ca,"de Groot, M/A-2025-2012","Taylor, Marcus/0000-0003-0944-601X",,,,,79,105,121,0,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We develop an economic framework which articulates the impact that the quality of protection offered to shareholders and debt holders has on the supply of debt and equity financing and the incentives of the founders to recruit partners or opt for sole ownership. The theoretical analysis predicts that a positive relationship is likely to exist between the quality of the legal system and the ownership concentration of start-ups. This prediction is in contrast to the findings on relationships in large publicly traded firms.

As insurance companies hold over one-third of investment-grade corporate bonds, the collective need to divest downgraded issues may be limited by a scarcity of counterparties. Using insurance company transaction data, we find that insurance companies that are relatively more constrained by regulation are more likely to sell downgraded bonds. Bonds subject to a high probability of regulatory-induced selling exhibit price declines and subsequent reversals.

Analysis of the Received 29 January 2010 Japanese industrial production data We explore what causes business cycles by analyzing the Japanese industrial production data. The methods used are spectral analysis and factor analysis. Using the random matrix theory, we show that two largest eigenvalues are significant. Taking advantage of the information revealed by disaggregated data, we identify the first dominant factor as the aggregate demand, and the second factor as inventory adjustment. They cannot be reasonably interpreted as technological shocks. We also demonstrate that in terms of two dominant factors, shipments lead production by four months. Furthermore, out-of-sample test demonstrates that the model holds up even under the 2008-2009 recession. Because a fall of output during 2008-2009 was caused by an exogenous drop in exports, it provides another justification for identifying the first dominant factor as the aggregate demand. All the findings suggest that the major cause of business cycles is real demand shocks.. Japanese Int. Economies xxx (xx) (2011) xxx-xxx.

Specifically, we propose the volatility of consumption-based stochastic discount factors (SDFs) as a predictor of future economic and stock market cycles. We employ both contemporaneous and ultimate consumption risk specifications with durable and non-durable consumption. Alternative empirical tests show that this volatility has significant forecasting ability from 1985 to 2006. The degree of predictability tends to dominate that shown by standard predictor variables. We argue that the significant predictability of the volatility of consumption-based SDFs reported in this paper relies mainly on the joint effect of their components. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The outcome hypothesis posits that transparent disclosure environments lead to higher dividend payouts because shareholders can more accurately measure (and therefore demand) excess cash flows. In contrast, the substitute hypothesis argues that opaque disclosure environments lead to higher payouts because managers have stronger incentives to establish their reputation for fair treatment. Our empirical results confirm both hypotheses and contribute to the literature in two primary ways. First, we confirm that the lifecycle theory of dividends explains dividend payout patterns around the world. Second, and more important, we show that the firm's disclosure environment plays a significant role in dividend payouts through its effect on agency costs; that is, we confirm an agency cost-inclusive lifecycle theory of dividends.

Measured liabilities affect the asset-liability ratio of pension funds and, thereby, their policies. Our framework for analysis is an applied many-generation OLG model describing a small open economy with heterogeneous agents and a two-pillar pension system (with pay-as-you-go and funded tiers) calibrated to that in the Netherlands. We compare mark-to-market discounting against various alternatives, such as discounting against a moving average of past market curves or a curve that is constant over time. The pension buffer is stabilized by adjusting indexation and contribution rates in response to demographic, economic and financial shocks in the economy. Mark-to-market valuation of liabilities produces substantially higher volatility in the pension buffers, but it also generates slightly higher aggregate welfare.","[Bucciol, Alessandro] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Bucciol, Alessandro; Beetsma, Roel M.

The model is developed based on the panel data of air cargo services on scheduled routes at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport during the years 2004-2007. The results indicate that population, air freight rate and three dummy variables, including the regional economic bloc of the Chinese Circle(an informal partnership between Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and mainland China), the Open Sky Agreements and long established colonial links, are key determinants of international air cargo flows from/to Taiwan.

In addition, parsimonious models generally outperform richly parameterized ones.

The effect of this federal legislation on the distribution of student achievement is a highly controversial but centrally important question. This study presents evidence on whether NCLB has influenced student achievement based on an analysis of state-level panel data on student test scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The impact of NCLB is identified using a comparative interrupted time series analysis that relies on comparisons of the test-score changes across states that already had school accountability policies in place prior to NCLB and those that did not. Our results indicate that NCLB generated statistically significant increases in the average math performance of fourth graders (effect size = 0.23 by 2007) as well as improvements at the lower and top percentiles. There is also evidence of improvements in eighth-grade math achievement, particularly among traditionally low-achieving groups and at the lower percentiles. However, we find no evidence that NCLB increased fourth-grade reading achievement.

This paper examines some competing views on currency regime choice by applying the dynamic multi-state Markov (MSM) model to the regime transitions of 166 countries from 1980 to 1999. The findings suggest that the bipolar view is valid only in the long run and for a reason quite different from what the proponents had imagined, namely, economic development rather than crisis-driven exits. The estimated steady-state probabilities even predict that a unipolar fixed exchange rate system could emerge in the long run. Despite some divergence, both de jure and de facto regime data corroborate the key findings. J. Japanese Int. Economies xxx (xx) (2011) xxx-xxx.

A standard utility model where the marginal utility of health is higher at a lower level of health predicts that this overly pessimist view raises the incentive for healthy behavior. But this is at odds with empirical research that indicates that people with more negative aging stereotypes tend to adopt less healthy practices, transforming this negative view into a self-fulfilling prophecy. The aim of this note is to show that this fatalistic behavior can be explained through prospect theory by modelling this overly pessimistic view of old age as a failure to predict the change in the reference point due to hedonic adaptation. Given the diminishing sensitivity in the loss domain, people undervalue the future marginal value of health investment and may therefore underinvest in health as long as loss aversion is not too strong.

This is the first financial study of an indigenous art market, and hedonic, repeat sales and hybrid regression analyses find it shares price determinants with traditional art markets (with price premia attached to artist name, death, painting size, leading auction house, and winter sale). However, Aboriginal art's unique features significantly affect prices, particularly works that use traditional Aboriginal media and those with reputation-affirming traits. An Aboriginal Art Index provides 6.6% annual return (standard deviation 17.9%), which is comparable to traditional asset classes and superior on a risk-adjusted basis. Returns to Aboriginal art are negatively correlated with returns from other assets, and so it adds value to a diversified investment portfolio. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The evaluation of the educational programme is a complex matter, as the question arises - what are we measuring, what indicators should be used and how should they be measured. The current study is an attempt to develop a new approach in the evaluation of entrepreneurship education programme in university - the assessment of entrepreneurship training results through changes in metacognitive awareness of participants. Students were asked to complete, both at the beginning and at the end of the training course, a cognitive adaptability questionnaire (by Haynie). The extent to which students reflect, think strategically, plan, recognize useful knowledge-skills and analyse/control themselves was uncovered based on the results. For analysing the changes in metacognitive awareness of respondents, both the Likert Scale and Bayesian Dependency Modelling techniques are used. A Comparison of average assessments at the beginning and at the end of the course shows a small rise. Moreover, considering the strengths of the dependencies between the most important statements of thinking process, participants present a trend of growing stronger after the training course.","[Venesaar, Urve; Ling, Hannes; Voolaid, Karen] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn Sch Econ & Business Adm, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Venesaar, U (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn Sch Econ & Business Adm, Tallinn, Estonia.",Urve.Venesaar@tseba.ttu.ee,,,,,,,36,14,16,0,52,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2011,13.0,30,,,,,377,391,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,860DP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297929000004,0

Foreign institutions and institutions from countries with strong shareholder protection play a role in promoting governance improvements outside of the U.S. Institutional investors affect not only which corporate governance mechanisms are in place, but also outcomes.

We especially ask what role fixed cost plays. Two approaches are examined: the Nash bargaining solution, involving two countries, and the coalition formation framework, involving numerous countries and emphasizing self-enforcing agreements. In the former, in terms of welfare, strictly identical countries may wish to reduce their emissions in a non-uniform way under the differentiated agreement. For this result to hold, the fixed cost of investment in abatement technology must be sufficiently high. The nature of the threat point of negotiations, however, also plays a crucial role. As concerns global abatement, the two countries abate more under the uniform agreement than under the differentiated one. In terms of coalition formation when numerous countries are involved, a grand coalition could emerge under a differentiated agreement.","[Bayramoglu, Basak] AgroParisTech, INRA, UMR Econ Publ, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Jacques, Jean-Francois] Univ Paris 09, LEDa, F-75016 Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; INRAE; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa,"Bayramoglu, B (通讯作者)，AgroParisTech, INRA, UMR Econ Publ, Ave Lucien Bretignieres, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",Basak.Bayramoglu@grignon.inra.fr; jacques@dauphine.fr,"Bayramoglu, Basak/X-1281-2019","Bayramoglu, Basak/0000-0002-0847-5858",,,,,23,2,2,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The empirical analysis is done for the pre-and post-Euro subperiods. In general, the results revealed different sensitivities in the way stock prices reacted to changes in the fundamentals suggesting that stock markets appeared to move independently of them in the long run, especially in the post-Euro period. For example, stock prices were not influenced much by industrial production or interest rates and the impacts of retail trade and crude oil prices on stock prices were smaller in the post-than in the pre-Euro period. An exception is the US's stock market, which showed more sensitivity to crude oil shocks. Finally, when investigating the impact of consumer expectations on stock prices it was revealed that European consumers were more concerned with the general economic and their personal financial situations than with inflationary pressures (except perhaps in Germany) in both subperiods.

When implementing EAMs it is usual to first specify the model in state-space form (SSF) and then to estimate it using the Kalman filter. To specify the SSF, a structure of the measurement error must be provided which is not specified in the EAM itself. Different specifications of the measurement errors will result in different SSFs, leading to different parameter estimates. In this paper we investigate the influence of the measurement error specification on the parameter estimates. Using market data for both fixed income and commodities we provide evidence that measurement errors are cross-sectionally and serially correlated, which is not consistent with the independent identically distributed (iid) assumptions commonly adopted in the literature. Using simulated data we show that measurement error assumptions affect parameter estimates, especially in the presence of serial correlation. We provide a new specification, the augmented state-space form (ASSF), as a solution to these biases and show that the ASSF gives much better estimates than the basic SSF. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we look at this era as economic historians, trying to set events in a longer-term perspective. In some ways, China's economic model in the decade 1998-2007 was similar to the one adopted by West Germany and Japan after World War II. Trade surpluses with the United States played a major role in propelling growth. But there were two key differences. First, the scale of Chinese currency intervention was without precedent, as were the resulting distortions of the world economy. Second, the Chinese have so far resisted the kind of currency appreciation to which West Germany and Japan consented. We conclude that Chimerica cannot persist for much longer in its present form. As in the 1970s, sizeable changes in exchange rates are needed to rebalance the world economy. The token adjustment proposed recently by Beijing is unlikely to suffice.","[Schularick, Moritz] Free Univ Berlin, John F Kennedy Inst, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Ferguson, Niall] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Free University of Berlin; Harvard University,"Schularick, M (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, John F Kennedy Inst, Lansstr 7-9, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",moritz.schularick@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,46,24,26,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,,,INT FINANC,Int.

We find a negative relation between price informativeness and board independence. This finding is robust to the inclusion of many firm-level controls, including firm fixed effects, and to the choice of the measure of price informativeness. Consistent with the hypothesis that price informativeness and board monitoring are substitutes, this relation is particularly strong for firms more exposed to both external and internal governance mechanisms and for firms in which firm-specific knowledge is relatively unimportant. Our results suggest that firms, with more informative stock prices have less demanding board structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, information problems such as the cost of conducting comprehensive searches and cognitive load have been shown to limit decision-making. In the context of residential decision-making, information problems are likely to influence which locations get chosen. This study examines whether providing people seeking a rental home with map-based information about the transit and pedestrian accessibility of the available units might influence their residential location choices. More specifically, would some people make use of this information to select more accessible residences than they would have otherwise chosen? This proposition was tested through an experimental research design in a laboratory setting. Graduate student participants were asked to select their top choices of where to live after reviewing a database of residential properties custom-designed for this study. In order to assess the influence of accessibility information, we divided participants randomly into control and experimental groups, with the former receiving baseline information currently available and the latter receiving map-based supplemental property information on multi-modal accessibility to desirable destinations. The study results suggest that providing multi-modal accessibility information to people who are relocating will enhance the attractiveness of locations that support multiple travel modes. If this is true for broader populations, then planners and policy makers may be able to increase use of non-auto modes by providing multi-modal transportation information to people at the time when they are looking for a new residence.

The corporate website of each company was analysed and subsequently codified on multiple variables. The results outline the fact that firms engage in CSR activities to a relatively high extent (49% of the companies). They adopt a vision of corporate social responsibility exclusively centred on the firm and the competitive advantages that derive from CSR activity. The wider community is represented as the primary stakeholder and beneficiary, whilst those stakeholders thought to influence the profit-making goals to a lesser extent are more often than not overlooked. Finally, companies prefer inexpensive intervention instruments and prove weak coordination with others social and political actors.","[Stancu, Alin] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Baleanu, Tamara Eugenia] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Chelcea, Liviu] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Bucharest,"Stancu, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",alinstancu@mk.ase.ro,"Stancu, Alin/C-5729-2012; Stancu, Alin/HLX-7418-2023","Stancu, Alin/0000-0002-8380-7445",,,,,32,36,36,0,20,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2011,13.0,29,,,,,235,248,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,710QA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286525100017,0

First, the majority of the models with fundamentals are able to beat the RW model in forecasting the UK/US exchange rate. Second, the most accurate forecasts of the UK/US exchange rate are obtained with a nonlinear model. Third, taking into account structural breaks reveals that the Divisia aggregate performs better than its Simple Sum counterpart.

In addition, it is difficult to draw the fine line between mere compliance with the law, and those initiatives that exceed the legal requirements, giving social partners a guarantee that companies have actually internalized their social and environmental responsibilities. This article aims to restructure this vast field, following two axes: the facilities granted to employees, on one hand, and consumer protection, on the other hand. In terms of methodology, a sample of the largest 13 listed European companies was selected from as many sectors. The content of annual and sustainability reports issued in 2009, was screened for narrative aspects related to social responsibility, and the material was organized according to the matters voluntarily described by companies. In the area of employment rights, several issues were identified: employee representation on the boards of directors, equal opportunities, professional development, and ethical issues. On the topic of consumer rights, suggestive examples were given on several aspects: healthy products, counseling, after-sales service and customer identity protection. The importance of this research goes beyond these case studies; its originality lies in providing a coherent picture of an area that is perceived as very unstructured. As can be seen from the examples included in this paper, most of the socially responsible initiatives that firms exhibit do not have a negative impact on a firm's profitability, while actually being integrated into products and services as efficiency improvements. Instead, responsible actions can have a major positive impact whenever employees and consumers perceive the company as a fair and generous player who derives profits from the sale of products and services, not in violation of the social partners' rights.","[Dragomir, Voicu-Dan; Anghel, Elena Roxana] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dragomir, VD (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",voicu.dragomir@gmail.com,"Dragomir, Voicu D./B-6745-2012","Dragomir, Voicu D./0000-0003-3704-6996",,,,,33,8,8,0,24,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2011,13.0,29,,,,,86,103,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,710QA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286525100007,0

A model based on the theory of similitude is thus made use of, born from the very essence of physics, and having an economic and social destination and a complex impact. The physical models intended for economic systems are expressed as systems of partial differential equations, and the result becomes a new vision of reality. This paper details an original model based on physical similitude for SME amalgamation under the name of multinational corporations. After an introduction to the physical theory of similitude, the first section describes the physics model because of the reunion of similar SMEs. The real birth of some corporations in Serbia forms the content of the second section; the economic and social phenomena relating to the generation of such corporations, and the corporate social responsibility are emphasized. The idea of social complexity and its impact as the fifth dimension of a modern multinational corporation conclude the paper.","[Savoiu, Gheorghe; Manea, Constantin; Iorga-Siman, Victor; Enescu, Florentina Magda] Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania; [Cudanov, Mladen; Jasko, Ondrej; Jasko, Ana] Univ Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti; University of Belgrade,"Savoiu, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania.",gsavoiu@yahoo.com,"Victor, Iorga-Siman/D-2556-2015; florentina, enescu/AAY-1777-2020; Cudanov, Mladen/G-8715-2018; Săvoiu, Gheorghe/C-3569-2013","Cudanov, Mladen/0000-0001-6895-6525; Săvoiu, Gheorghe/0000-0002-9596-793X; Jasko, Ondrej/0000-0003-4877-0592; Iorga-Siman, Victor/0000-0002-2692-0433",,,,,32,8,8,0,35,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2011,13.0,29,,,,,10,27,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,710QA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286525100002,0

We test whether mandated disclosure changes lenders' ability to price discriminate using within-household interactions between payment/interest bias and policy-induced variation in the strength of Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) enforcement across lenders and time. Weak TILA enforcement substantially widens the gap between rates paid by more-biased and less-biased borrowers.

Beyond the assessment of the normality limits of this phenomenon, there are times when wage differences are due to certain forms of discrimination through which are created difficulties in obtaining jobs by certain groups of people, provided that they have the necessary skills and training (Sanders, 2007). Research on the contribution of discrimination to support the income inequality between individuals was initiated by Becker (1968) and Arrow (1973) starting from the black minority situation in the United States. Afterwards, research was extended to women, long-term unemployed persons, in general to all groups likely to create a negative image to the employers. The origin of discrimination is given by the prejudices of the employers, or as appropriate by the customer and employee's preferences. According to the European Commission Report (2009, Equality between women and men) high level of education of women is not directly reflected by the positions they occupy in the labour market. Women work mainly in feminized sectors and occupations and remain in low-class jobs, with fewer opportunities to access leadership positions.

It is shown that the growth effect of the golden rule depends on what kind of expenditure is adjusted to meet debt obligations. A transition from a balanced budget to a golden rule is performed to study welfare. The results indicate that a budget rule with detrimental growth effects can still have positive welfare implications, and vice versa, if the composition of government expenditures and transitional dynamics are taken into account.","Univ Cologne, Ctr Macroecon Res, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Groneck, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Ctr Macroecon Res, Cologne, Germany.",groneck@wiso.uni-koeln.de,,,,,,,24,8,8,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Is our conception of economic systems part of the problem or part of the solution? Consideration of economic systems as the outcome of socio-evolutionary processes strongly suggests that we are misconceiving their underlying natures. Markets in goods and services might be reasonably consistent with our micro-economic theory about comparative advantage and the gains from trade. But the obsession with consumption strongly suggests that markets are incomplete (at the least) as ways of managing with the limits of our planet. More importantly, there is no substantial consistency between capitalism, finance markets, and (hence) the all-important capital markets and an evolutionary stable (sustainable) strategy (ESS) for the planet. Since evolution happens by processes of trial and error, and is effectively blind about possible futures, we rather urgently need to re-consider our theoretical understandings of how these systems work and how we might better manage with them. Otherwise, we are in substantial danger of running out of room and time to make more mistakes.","Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Harvey, D (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",david.harvey@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,36,0,0,1,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,39,60,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100005,0

It is widely accepted that both the private sector and governments can benefit from identification of the most important determinants and implications of a good corporate governance system. Both sides of corporate governance systems have a common goal the protection of investors' rights and transparency of the system in which transactions take place. However, it is also well recognized that systems of corporate governance in attempt to gain necessary level of harmonization and consistency rely heavily on contextual factors of specific economies. Comparative approach used in the paper uncovers differences in major corporate governance issues which currently occur in selected transition countries. Specifically, the research covers corporate governance in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. Although selected countries to some extend share history of their economic development, the results of the research indicate that today there are very different issues in consequent systems of corporate governance.","[Hruska, Domagoj; Omazic, Mislav Ante] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,,dhruska@efzg.hr; momazic@efzg.hr; fuzzull@gmail.com,"Hruška, Domagoj/GQH-6456-2022; Omazic, Mislav Ante/H-9222-2018","Omazic, Mislav Ante/0000-0001-5704-0108",,,,,53,0,0,0,2,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

The two categories of managers (line and staff) are considered as independent variables and the barriers associated with self-confidence and risk taking, the application of conceptual and abstract issues, systematic analysis, professional success and physical environment are selected as dependent variables. The statistical population studied in this research is line and staff managers in Bank Saderat of East Azerbaijan Province. For the sampling purposes the simple sampling was used for the staff managers who are generally employed in Tabriz and in view of the fact that the line managers are scattered throughout the province, the multi-stage cluster sampling was used. Besides, the Cochran Formula was used to determine the sample size. The main data collection tool in this study is questionnaire. Accordingly, the returned questionnaires are scored by the researcher and then the necessary measures are carried out in the form of tables to perform statistical tests and data analysis using statistical software. The studies have indicated that the mode of educational level of line and staff managers is Bachelors degree and the mode of management experience is less than 5 years for line managers and 6-10 years for staff managers. Besides, in view of the relevance of the field of study, it can be observed that the field of study of 100% of staff managers is relevant, while the field of study of 79% of line managers is relevant.

This author agrees with both of these contentions, but at the same time strongly believe that the SCM Model is based on the solid underlying theory of valued-added methodology and if applied properly it would yield substantial benefits to all parties involved in the SCM from Suppliers of the raw materials to the manufactures to the Users of the End Products. A careful examination of the traditional SCM leads to the conclusion that there should be separate models for tangible and intangible product. In addition the current SCM is too complex difficult to understand and apply in practice. For this reason, it is suggested that the SCM model should be broken down into small user friendly modules so that each module is a value-added proposition.","[Kalia, Tejendra] Worcester State Coll, Worcester, MA 01602 USA",Massachusetts System of Public Higher Education; Worcester State University,"Kalia, T (通讯作者)，Worcester State Coll, Worcester, MA 01602 USA.",tkalia@worcester.edu,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9173-2,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,12.0,,,,,,157,159,,,,,,3,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392895700028,0

Further, our data imply that age does not substantially condition the influence of military service on earnings after discharge. Past research has conceptualized the military experience in various ways vis-a-vis income: negatively, as a tax or disruption, or positively, as an enhancement of social capital, serving as a bridging environment, or as a screening device to signal employability.

But why so many companies make wrong predictions? The answer must be sought in the signals on which these predictions are based and on which decisions are made. When the interest rate and the prices network no longer provides correct information about the consumers' time preference, about the real relation between savings and investments, entrepreneurs hazard in fanciful projects which, in the absence of real resources on the market, are doomed to failure.

This is important since one does not come across many studies related to the PSUs. Moreover in the post disinvestment phase, the PSUs in India have become more market oriented in terms of raising funds. The gradual reduction in the budgetary resources for the PSUs is also one of the reasons. The PSUs have got to depend more on extra-budgetary resources (EBRs) for their needs. PSUs are also different in several ways than their counterparts in the private sector. For this study a sample of 48 profit making manufacturing PSUs is considered for the time period 200603 to 201003. Multiple regression has been used to find out the factors affecting capital structure. The independent variables have been considered keeping in view Agency Theory, Pecking Order Hypothesis and other established capital structure models. The results suggest that the capital structure (Total Borrowing to Total Assets) of the profit making PSUs is affected by Asset Structure (Net Fixed Assets to Total Assets, NFATA), Profitability (Return on Assets, ROA) and Tax. Unlike suggestion of pecking order hypothesis, growth (defined as growth in total assets) is positively related to leverage. As predicted by theory NFATA and ROA are respectively positively and negatively related to leverage. In contradiction to theory tax and leverage are negatively related. Firms with less effective tax rate have gone for more debt. None of the other variables like non-debt tax shield (NDTS), Volatility, Size were found to be significant.","[Mishra, Chandra Sekhar] IIT Kharagpur, Vinod Gupta Sch Management, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Mishra, CS (通讯作者)，IIT Kharagpur, Vinod Gupta Sch Management, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India.",,"Mishra, Chandra/R-3488-2019; Mishra, Chandra Sekhar/AAN-6219-2020",,,,,,23,6,7,0,2,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9084-1,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,11.0,,,,,,247,252,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392766500048,0

The results of the study shows that the consumers are more positively inclined towards Ready-To-Eat Food Products and this is mainly due to the convenience factor and changes in the lifestyle of the people.","[Sarathy, T.; Gopal, Shilpa] Periyar Univ, Periyar Inst Management Studies, Salem, Tamil Nadu, India",Periyar University,"Sarathy, T (通讯作者)，Periyar Univ, Periyar Inst Management Studies, Salem, Tamil Nadu, India.",shilpago@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-07-1016-3,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,25.0,,,,,,186,190,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392893100037,0

Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity among firms and correcting for potential self-selection and endogeneity bias, the estimation shows that the intensity of training has a significant and positive impact on productivity in small and medium enterprises.

The world is endangered by the rising prices and diminishing supplies of food commodities which might create a new world food crisis. Until recently, the world cereal stocks were at a much higher level than during the stock crisis in 2007 and 2008. The rapid economic growth and the fears of higher prices, however, have led to their rapid depletion. There is also a considerable speculative influence; given the fact that the commodity prices started rising rapidly, they have attracted short-term investors, what in turn still more supported the prices further growth. The expensive commodities are then driving up the inflation. In December 2010, the Eurozone inflation rose to 2.2 percent, while the target is 2.0 percent. Due to the lack of agricultural commodities and also to their increased trade exchange among countries, there is also endangered the food safety and quality. As an example of this on the agricultural commodity market, there could be mentioned the problem of German supply of eggs into the Czech market as this commodity is from 80% controlled by two competing duopolies of the Czech Eggs CZ and the Golden Eggs, Inc. The imported products may not always meet the criteria for safe consumption, as it was evidenced by the dioxin affair in agricultural production which broke out in Germany at the turn of the year. Previous inspections have not identified, however, any increased incidence of food containing cancer-causing dioxins on the Czech market. Consumers should pay more interest to the origin of food in the stores and they should prefer domestic products. The result of the examination is to identify the relation between the stock of food commodities, their prices and food safety.","[Severova, Lucie; Svoboda, Roman] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Theories, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Severová, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Theories, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",severova@pef.czu.cz; svobodar@pef.czu.cz,"Severová, Lucie/J-2548-2017; Svoboda, Roman/G-3320-2017",,,,,,11,3,3,0,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,139,147,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100014,0

Using trade data from the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), our results indicate that buyer initiated trades increase the ask price more than the bid price, and seller initiated trades decrease the bid price more than the ask price. The transaction duration is modeled in a Box-Cox ACD framework. The unexpected portion of the duration is found to play a more significant role in causing price impact in both purchases and sales than the expected duration. A trade shortly after the previous trade results in higher price impact than one after a long period. We found evidence that increased trading activity is associated with larger price impact, therefore implying a higher degree of information-based trading.

As pension funds generally choose to run a mismatch risk, future surpluses and deficits will occur. Surpluses are divided between beneficiaries and sponsor through contingent indexation of the benefits and refunding. Covering a deficit at the pension fund level is a function of the sponsor's financial ability to do so. This article suggests that this system creates an asymmetric allocation of the residual risk between sponsor and beneficiaries. The optimal investment policy for the pension fund in this context can be found by reverse engineering option valuation formulas. The main conclusion is that sponsor default risk negatively impacts the optimum risk profile and thereby the market value of contingent pension liabilities.","DNB, Supervis Policy Div, Strategy Dept, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Broeders, D (通讯作者)，DNB, Supervis Policy Div, Strategy Dept, POB 98, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",d.w.g.a.broeders@dnb.nl,,,,,,,35,15,15,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Among the complexities considered are the schedular nature of income tax systems and the role of central and regional governments, along with the existence of a range of intricate tax credits and eligible expenditures and deductions. Empirical estimates are obtained for the case of Spain using a cross-sectional data set, which enables a number of important ancillary elasticities (relating to allowances and tax credits, and different income sources) to be estimated. It is found that there is considerable variation among tax units in the revenue elasticity, with highly positively skewed distributions. The nature of the distributions varies among regions of Spain, and the aggregate elasticities for each region were found to display some variation associated with income distribution differences.

Although internationally and nationally managed by quota allocations and regulations, the current exploitation pattern implies that essentially the wrong fish are targeted. Catching older and heavier fish could double the fishery's Net-Present-Value. This increases harvested biomass while it reduces the number of fish removed from the ocean, highlighting the importance of age-and gear-specific modeling.

Using firm-level data for Thailand we show that the number of goods produced causes a larger variation in exports volumes than production volumes. Whilst the number of products and the total volume of exports are positively correlated we find, in contrast to US studies, a negative correlation between the number of products produced and the volume of production per product. We then investigate the characteristics associated with multi-product firms and find a distinction between foreign-owned and domestic firms. The presence of foreign firms producing single products solely for the domestic market as well as those producing many products for export demonstrates the diversity of behaviour of foreign-owned firms in developing countries.","[Elliott, Robert J.

Considerable discussion has taken place during the last decade regarding the role of economic growth in determining environmental quality. Using data from 30 OECD countries for the period 1960-2003 and the nonparametric method of generalized additive models, which enables us to use flexible functional forms, this paper examines the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for carbon dioxide (CO(2)).

There are three main findings. First, the option return volatility, defined as the option price elasticity times the stock return volatility, has a much higher power in explaining the spread variations than the commonly considered liquidity determinants such as the stock return volatility and option trading volume. Second, after controlling for all the liquidity determinants, we find a maturity-substitution effect due to expiration cycles. When medium-term options (60-90 days maturity) are not available, traders use short-term options as substitutes whose higher volume leads to a smaller bid-ask spread or better liquidity. Third, we also find a moneyness-substitution effect induced by the stock return volatility. When the stock return volatility goes up, trading shifts from in-the-money options to out-of-the-money options, causing the latter's spread to narrow. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We show that firms have increasingly taken on risks in their transactions in spite of weak formal institutions. Risk-taking by firms can be explained by the use of informal institutions such as relational contracts and networks along with recourse to emerging formal institutions such as written contracts. Our results suggest that informal institutions remain important as mechanisms of risk management even as the economy matures and new formal institutions gradually develop. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Using comprehensive firm data, we estimate the relation between pre-privatization firm characteristics - the information known to politicians at the time of decision-making - and the effect of privatization on employment, efficiency, and wages. With the estimated coefficients we simulate the effect of privatization on non-privatizable and privatizable firms. We find that politicians expected privatization to increase employment in the privatizable group by 7%-10%, while to decrease it in the non-privatizable group by 10%-30%, depending on the first-stage estimation method, ordinary least squares with or without matching. We do not find such discrepancies in the expected change in firm efficiency; the simulated efficiency effect of privatization is large and positive for both groups of firms, and it is 52%-65% for non-privatizable and 41%-43% for privatizable firms. The analysis does not support the hypothesis that wages played an important role in privatization decisions. Our study suggests that employment concerns played the key role in selecting firms for privatization, even if efficiency gains had to be sacrificed.","[Telegdy, Almos] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Cent European Univ, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Szentpeteri, Adam] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Cent European Univ, H-1364 Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Central European University; Central European University; Eotvos Lorand University,"Telegdy, A (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Cent European Univ, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary.",telegdya@ceu.hu,"Telegdy, Almos/HNI-1309-2023",,,,,,37,6,6,0,13,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Just 5 years earlier, the tire industry experienced a surge in entry that led to a rise of over 80% in the number of producers. We propose an explanation for this episode based on the idea of industry submarkets, which we incorporate in a model of shakeouts. We test this theory and alternative explanations for the surge in entry and exit and the shakeout using a novel data set on patenting in tires and production in the early 1920s of the cord tire, a key innovation we feature in our theory. Our analysis suggests that the development of a new submarket can open up opportunities for entry but also stimulate innovation and, in the process, reinforce the advantages of the leading incumbents, accentuating the shakeout of producers.","[Buenstorf, Guido] Univ Kassel, Inst Econ, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [Klepper, Steven] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Universitat Kassel; Carnegie Mellon University,"Buenstorf, G (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Inst Econ, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.",buenstorf@uni-kassel.de; sk3f@andrew.cmu.edu,,"Buenstorf, Guido/0000-0002-2957-5532",,,,,29,24,26,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

It tended to raise harvests in countries with weaker governance but to reduce harvests in countries with stronger governance. This nonmonotonic impact occurred for both an index of governmental integrity (corruption, bureaucracy quality, law and order) and an index of governmental stability.

Book values of debt may be a more downward biased proxy of the market value of debt for diversified firms, relative to undiversified firms, as diversification leads to lower firm risk. Thus, measures of firm value based on book values of debt undervalue diversified firms relative to focused firms. Our paper complements recent literature which uses market values to test the risk reduction hypothesis for a subsample of firms for which debt is traded. Alternatively, we employ market value of debt estimates for the whole firm universe. Consistent with the above hypothesis, we show that the use of book values of debt underestimates the value of diversified firms. There is no discount for mainly equity financed firms and lower distress risk and equity volatility for diversified firms. More concentrated ownership increases firm valuation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Intertemporal choices are thus quite literally strategic interactions between multiple agents. Previous neuroscientific studies have found evidence that systems involved with theory of mind (i.e. mentalizing about other agents) are similar to those involved with prospection (imagining oneself in the future). We provide a conceptual framework for this work and suggest that, instead of prospection, a more analogous future task occurs with intertemporal choice and time preferences, since these involve implicit prediction of future actions. Recent functional imaging studies appear to confirm such a link. Additional studies - behavioral, clinical, and neuroimaging - are proposed in order to confirm the specific nature of the correspondence and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Finally, given that society may have a vested interest in promoting the welfare of future selves, we discuss possible policy implications of departing from the standard framework in which individuals act in their own best interests as defined over the entire lifetime.

However, despite its prevalence, it is unclear why celebrities are more persuasive than (equally attractive) non-famous endorsers. The present study investigates which processes underlie the effect of fame on product memory and purchase intention by the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging methods. We find an increase in activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) underlying the processing of celebrity-product pairings. This finding suggests that the effectiveness of celebrities stems from a transfer of positive affect from celebrity to product. Additional neuroimaging results indicate that this positive affect is elicited by the spontaneous retrieval of explicit memories associated with the celebrity endorser. Also, we demonstrate that neither the activation of implicit memories of earlier exposures nor an increase in attentional processing is essential for a celebrity advertisement to be effective. By explaining the neural mechanism of fame, our results illustrate how neuroscience may contribute to a better understanding of consumer behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Because mark-up shocks cannot be neutralized by monetary policy, providing firms with more information about these shocks exacerbates their reaction and creates a larger distortion. Recognizing the signaling role of its instrument, the central bank distorts its policy response in order to optimally shape firms' beliefs. While providing firms with more information is always detrimental to the output gap, it has a more subtle effect on price dispersion depending on whether information is provided through the transparency channel or through the signaling channel. Although more transparency is always detrimental to welfare, the information that is conveyed by the monetary instrument improves welfare when firms' coordination is highly valuable.

The model shows that tying induces more consumers to multi-home and makes platform-specific exclusive content available to more consumers, which is beneficial to content providers. As a result, tying can be welfare-enhancing if multi-homing is allowed, even in cases where its welfare impacts are negative in the absence of multi-homing. The analysis thus can have important implications for recent antitrust cases in industries where multi-homing is prevalent.","[Choi, Jay Pil] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Choi, Jay Pil] Yonsei Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",University of New South Wales Sydney; Yonsei University,"Choi, JP (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",choijay@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,113,117,5,111,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-1821,,,J IND ECON,J.

Countries whose students declare the highest working time, also those where religiosity is the highest, have the lowest scores. However, part of these observations may be due to a desirability bias in students' declarations, of which the exact importance is hard to determine. Among students of a same country, working time vary more or less according to the country, and more or less in relation with their performance and their social background. In some, working time is about the same for all students, in others, more work is requested from high performing students or from high SES students.

Relative to Canadian born individuals, immigrants in the ROC have been consistently, and increasingly, faring better in terms of wages than immigrants in Quebec. We cannot conclude that this is a consequence of Quebec having different immigration policies than the ROC, as the wage gap would be even larger if Quebec attracted the same immigrants as the ROC, nor can we conclude that immigrants are more discriminated against in Quebec. We find that the increased differential in the Quebec-ROC immigrant wage gap mostly reflects changes in the premium earned by immigrants who become citizens over those who remain landed immigrants; this premium virtually disappeared in Quebec while remaining stable in the ROC over the period.","[Nadeau, Serge] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Seckin, Aylin] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",University of Ottawa; Istanbul Bilgi University,"Nadeau, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",,,"SECKIN, ZENNUBE AYLIN/0000-0003-4139-2728",,,,,24,17,19,0,8,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

This tremendous growth in the industry is mainly driven by the following: petroleum prices, the reliability of traditional crude oil exporters along with political motives, adverse pollution effects and more specifically, emission gases from fossil fuels. Together with this growth, various researchers locally and globally have focused on ethanol production, but little work has been done on the economic impact that ethanol production will have on the animal feed industry. In order to simulate the results, the two main scenarios were analysed using two different models - namely, the BFAP model and the APR model. By applying the BFAP model to these scenarios, the equilibrium prices of animal feed raw materials were simulated for the year 2015. The APR model was then applied to these prices in order to evaluate the impact of ethanol production on the animal feed industry. Two main scenarios are constructed with four combinations; the main variables in the scenarios are the oil price and the blending ratios of biofuel. The results revealed that there is no significant effect on the animal feed industry. Various raw materials are affected, but only by small percentages. The only raw material that shows any significant change is lucerne, with a 20 per cent decrease in consumption. The greatest effect is the replacement of imported protein raw materials by DDGS (dried distillers grains with solubles). In terms of the animal feed costs, there was only a 2 per cent decrease with the introduction of ethanol production. Under a scenario of high blending ratios and oil prices, the yellow maize price increases by R169/ton and the soya oilcake price decreases by R347/ton.","[Strydom, D. B.; Taljaard, P.

We look to reconcile these findings by concentrating on a particular aspect of industrializing UK where inefficiencies in finance could have had bite: the finance of physical infrastructures. We document the historical record and develop the importance of spatial disaggregation and spillovers in both technological and financial development. We develop a simple model that captures the nature of infrastructure finance within a theory of endogenous growth where financial costs are endogenous. We argue that the conception of the finance-growth nexus as a largely static, aggregative phenomenon misses out a good deal of complexity and we relate that complexity to a number of implications for regulation of both financial systems and the emergence of infrastructures.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Trew, A (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland.",awt2@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Trew, Alex/0000-0001-8689-9480",,,,,53,12,12,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

In the face of the rise of the Chinese economy, there were concerns that ASEAN economies may be adversely affected with the loss of competitiveness in the international market. One of the concerns is that the world export markets of labor-intensive goods will be threatened if China turns into the world low-cost manufacturing factory. Meanwhile, trade between China and ASEAN countries increased dramatically during the past decades. Not surprisingly, China's accession to the WTO and the future establishment of a free trade area (FTA) between ASEAN and China will further change the trade relations in the region. The paper first analyzes the past trade patterns between China and ASEAN countries and assesses the impact of the rising Chinese economy on ASEAN countries, in particular, the impacts on specific industries in each individual ASEAN country. Second, the paper examines the ever-increasing role of foreign direct investment between the two regions and, finally, it analyzes and assess the policy responses of the ASEAN countries thus far and their possible consequences.","[Ng, Beoy Kui] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Econ, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Ng, BK (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Econ, Nanyang Ave,S3-B2B-51, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",ayuliu@ntu.edu.sg; abkng@ntu.edu.sg,,,,,,,14,2,3,1,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This study uses contingent ranking to analyse the willingness to pay (WTP) of smallholder irrigators for changes in the water rights system. The results indicate that smallholders are prepared to pay considerably higher water prices if these are connected to improvements in the water rights system. By segmenting the population it was also shown that the importance attached to water rights dimensions varies in each segment. While lower institutional trust and lower income levels lead to a lower WTP for transferability, experiencing water shortage increases this WTP.

We find that returns and dividend growth rates are predictable with R-2 values ranging from 8.2% to 8.9% for returns and 13.9% to 31.6% for dividend growth rates. Both expected returns and expected dividend growth rates have a persistent component, but expected returns are more persistent than expected dividend growth rates.","[van Binsbergen, Jules H.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Koijen, Ralph S.

Both the quantity and quality of information increase during periods of economic expansion and decrease during periods of contraction. Based on this insight, we hypothesize and confirm that time-varying information production drives the comovement patterns observed in stock returns. We examine stock return comovement in 36 countries from 1980 to 2007 and show that, consistent with the theory, comovement patterns are countercyclical; that is, when information production is high (low), comovement is low (high). We also find that the relation between comovement and the business cycle is stronger in countries that experience large intertemporal swings in information production. Finally, we show that the relation between business cycle and comovement is stronger in poor countries, countries with less developed financial markets, and countries with weaker accounting and transparency standards. These results suggest that financial development and transparency are conducive to a steady flow of financial information over the business cycle. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The level of subprime lending in a census tract is found to be a significant predictor of the default and prepayment probability of the community reinvestment loans in the same neighborhoods. The results suggest that the concentration of subprime lending and the resulting clusters of foreclosed properties reduce neighborhood property values and increase price volatility. The lowered property values and the increased volatility increase the default probability of borrowers holding any loan product, including community reinvestment mortgages.

Three groups of companies that constitute the casuistry of long-term financial supports to companies (guarantees, guarantees and preferential funding, or just preferential funding), as well as another two control groups are studied. The results suggest that public support is relevant at economic, financial and business efficiency levels. The advantages can be observed mainly in the weakest companies, where the capacity to tackle projects is facilitated, although they do not manage to reduce their financial costs until they reach relative levels similar to those reached by companies not accessing the guarantee system.","[Garcia-Tabuenca, Antonio; Luis Crespo-Espert, Jose] Univ Alcala de Henares, Inst Analisis Econ & Social, Alcala De Henares, Spain",Universidad de Alcala; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Garcia-Tabuenca, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala de Henares, Inst Analisis Econ & Social, Alcala De Henares, Spain.",antonio.gtabuenca@uah.es; joseluis.crespo@uah.es,"Crespo-Espert, José Luis/AAA-6488-2019; Tabuenca, Antonio García/AAB-2475-2019","Crespo-Espert, José Luis/0000-0002-3669-5620;",,,,,26,26,27,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Our results remain unchanged even after controlling for the non-performing loan ratio, capital adequacy ratio, bank ownership, size, and GDP growth rate.

For the better part of six centuries, the relation between world capitalism and agriculture has been a remarkable one. Every great wave of capitalist development has been paved with 'cheap' food. Beginning in the long sixteenth century, capitalist agencies pioneered successive agricultural revolutions, yielding a series of extraordinary expansions of the food surplus. This paper engages the crisis of neoliberalism today, and asks: Is another agricultural revolution, comparable to those we have known in the history of capitalism, possible? Does the present conjuncture represent a developmental crisis of capitalism that can be resolved by establishing new agro-ecological conditions for another long wave of accumulation, or are we now witnessing an epochal crisis of capitalism? These divergent possibilities are explored from a perspective that views capitalism as 'world-ecology', joining together the accumulation of capital and the production of nature in dialectical unity.","Umea Univ, Dept Hist Studies, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Moore, JW (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Hist Studies, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",jasonwsmoore@gmail.com,,"Moore, Jason W./0000-0002-7237-9895",,,,,123,128,156,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

While numerous studies have considered the effects of such policies on motor vehicle fatalities for the overall population, for teens, and for the elderly, their effects on fatalities among children in particular have not previously been studied. We use state-level cross-sectional time series data for 1982-2002. The dependent variable of interest is fatalities among child motor vehicle occupants (CMVO). Separate models are estimated for 0- to 4-yr-olds, 5- to 9-yr-olds, and 10- to 15-yr-olds, as well as for fatalities occurring during the day versus the night. We find that number of fatalities among CMVO is strongly correlated to alcohol use measured at the state level and that administrative license revocation policies and higher beer tax rates appear to consistently reduce such fatalities. For two of the three age groups, beer tax rates appear to reduce fatalities during the night rather than the day. However, zero tolerance and blood alcohol concentration limit laws do not seem to have any statistically significant effects on fatalities.

A large longitudinal dataset, free of survivorship bias, to cover financing events of high-growth businesses for up to 8 years is analyzed. The empirical evidence shows that profitable businesses prefer to finance investments with retained earnings, even if they have unused debt capacity. External equity is particularly important for unprofitable businesses with high debt levels, limited cash flows, high risk of failure or significant investments in intangible assets. These findings are consistent with the extended pecking order theory controlling for constraints imposed by debt capacity. It suggests that new equity issues are particularly important to allow high-growth businesses to grow beyond their debt capacity.","[Vanacker, Tom R.] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Manigart, Sophie] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Manigart, Sophie] Vlerick Leuven Gent Management Sch, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University; Vlerick Business School,"Vanacker, TR (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",TomR.Vanacker@UGent.be; Sophie.Manigart@Vlerick.be,"Manigart, Sophie/F-9747-2012; de Lima, Andréia/G-8040-2014; Vanacker, Tom R/C-9747-2012","Vanacker, Tom/0000-0001-5608-1944; Manigart, Sophie/0000-0002-3406-9386",,,,,59,105,116,3,78,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

It is also highly unstable, with intractable biophysical problems created in the substitution of labour, skill and knowledge with technology, and overridden with unsustainable 'technological fixes' and masked by a host of externalized costs. Relatively cheap oil is central to this, effectively subsidizing the low-priced industrial grains and oilseeds on which global food security has come to hinge. However, the chronic biophysical contradictions of industrial capitalist agriculture are accelerating, at the same time as the surge in biofuels has augmented the still-rising demand of livestock feed to embolden industrial producers. A period of acute and ominously regressive food price volatility looms in the short term, with more ruinous outcomes ahead. But this might also widen openings for rebuilding biodiverse food systems and remaking and valorizing agricultural work, which will involve rethinking agriculture's place in conceptions of development and modernity.","Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Weis, T (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",aweis@uwo.ca,,,,,,,74,205,239,3,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

System-specific ratios are first developed to extract bilateral payment obligations from aggregate payments data in the Australian RTGS system. This synthetic data is then used to generate a deferred net settlement (DNS) system of similar dimensions to those the Australian system would have had, had RTGS not been introduced. Standard default simulation methodology is then applied to test the levels of systemic risk in both this system and the corresponding RTGS system to ascertain the degree to which the introduction of RTGS is likely to have reduced the level of risk. We find that while the level of systemic risk is likely to have been reduced in the Australian case, the size of the effect is small, a finding consistent with the results of payments system studies in other countries.

The preparation of the annual federal budget therefore privileges tax subsidies over outlays, even though each can substitute for the other As a consequence, tax expenditures have become the preferred vehicle for delivering new spending programs. Moreover the low salience of tar expenditures clouds understanding of the government's allocative interventions among not only the public but also many policymakers. This paper considers how tax expenditures might be brought more directly into the federal budget-setting process. The analysis considers three types of tax subsidies - fixed-dollar allocations, subsidies that are open-ended but offered for a fixed term, and subsidies that are both open-ended and indefinite in term. Just as the federal budget today follows different processes for discretionary spending (appropriations) and direct expenditures (entitlements), so too it is necessary to develop different framework rules for fixed-dollar and uncapped tar subsidies.","Univ So Calif, Gould Sch Law, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Kleinbard, ED (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Gould Sch Law, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",ekleinbard@law.usc.edu,,,,,,,37,15,17,0,6,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

How do a firm's ex ante product market characteristics relate to its going-public decision? Further, what are the implications of a firm going public on its post-IPO operating and product market performance? In this article, we answer the above questions by conducting the first large sample study of the going-public decisions of U.S. firms in the literature. We use the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which covers the entire universe of private and public U.S. manufacturing firms. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, a private firm's product market characteristics (total factor productivity [TFP], size, sales growth, market share, industry competitiveness, capital intensity, and cash flow riskiness) significantly affect its likelihood of going public after controlling for its access to private financing (venture capital or bank loans). Second, private firms facing less information asymmetry and those with projects that are cheaper for outsiders to evaluate are more likely to go public. Third, as more firms in an industry go public, the concentration of that industry increases in subsequent years. The above results are robust to controlling for the interactions between various product market and firm-specific variables. Fourth, IPOs of firms occur at the peak of their productivity cycle: the dynamics of TFP and sales growth exhibit an inverted U-shaped pattern, both in our univariate analysis and in our multivariate analysis using firms that remained private throughout as a benchmark. Finally, sales, capital expenditures, and other performance variables exhibit a consistently increasing pattern over the years before and after the IPO. The last two findings are consistent with the view that the widely documented post-IPO operating underperformance of firms is due to the real investment effects of going public rather than being due to earnings management immediately prior to the IPO.","[Chemmanur, Thomas J.] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [He, Shan] Louisiana State Univ, EJ Ourso Coll Business, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Nandy, Debarshi K.] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",Boston College; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; York University - Canada,"Chemmanur, TJ (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Fulton Hall 330, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",chemmanu@bc.edu,"he, shan/JUV-4092-2023","Nandy, Debarshi/0000-0002-9435-0129",,,,,40,134,160,0,77,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Results of 53 bimonthly federal oil and gas lease auctions in Wyoming between February 1998 and October 2006 are examined.

The median real value of compensation was remarkably flat from the late 1940s to the 1970s, revealing a weak relationship between pay and aggregate firm growth. By contrast, this correlation was much stronger in the past thirty years. This historical perspective also suggests that compensation arrangements have often helped to align managerial incentives with those of shareholders because executive wealth was sensitive to firm performance for most of our sample. These new facts pose a challenge to several common explanations for the rise in executive pay since the 1980s.","[Frydman, Carola] MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Frydman, Carola] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Frydman, C (通讯作者)，MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, NE25-729,5 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",frydman@mit.edu,,"Molloy, Raven/0000-0002-5041-803X",,,,,88,212,271,5,86,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The empirical results demonstrate that a lack of insurance against large, negative wealth shocks is positively correlated with lower participation rates and higher saving rates.

An understanding of transport activity has long involved the use of spatial frameworks, seen in the idea of a gateway city (with its surrounding hinterland) and in the identification of hubs or nodes. The particular framework used here is the global city region, a build-out from the much researched global city, and acknowledged as the most prominent feature of spatial development in the global economy. As these areas can accommodate important sea and airport infrastructure, the global city region can be expected to play a significant role in global logistics. Whether that significance extends just from the physical realm, as reflected in the infrastructure, or whether it is embedded in the scale and complexity of the advanced business services sector within the global city, is the issue that lies at the heart of the research. The research has set out to answer the question: How important are these regions in logistics activity?. The question has relevance in the context of transport geography as it provides an urban structure perspective on what is commonly seen as separate port or airport activity. Its relevance is enhanced as its answer relies upon a simultaneous analysis of both sea and air freight activity. Results show these regions counted for a substantial and growing share of sea and air freight between 1996 and 2006. In accounting for that outcome the research explores the particular effect of infrastructure (showing that global city regions with multiple seaport and airports play a special role) and also isolates the links with global city functions. The paper concludes with some insight on the special challenge these places create for strategic urban planning policy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to the literature, countries and regions are not required to be symmetric. We find that the aforementioned inequalities are closely related to the country size, region size, the degree of globalization (e.g., capital mobility and trade costs) and the level of local infrastructure. In particular, international trade behaves as a dispersion force when capital is internationally mobile for small countries such that reducing domestic transport costs lowers its interregional inequality, but the opposite can be true for large countries or when capital is internationally immobile.

Our data covers three different major events: the Olympic Games, the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship.

Thus, the Great Depression did likely trigger increases ill government spending and regulatory involvement, but historical factors produced the conditions that tended to lend permanence to the growth of government that occurred during the Great Depression.

This paper describes the New York City Center for Economic Opportunity's implementation of the National Academy of Sciences' recommendations for measuring poverty. The center's decision to use the Census Bureau's American Community Survey as its principal data source created the project's central challenge; many of the items needed to construct the academy's measure of resources are not included in the survey and needed to be estimated through a variety of methods. The resultant measure creates a higher poverty rate and a demographic profile of the poor that is quite different from that generated by the official measure. The paper concludes with observations about these differences and how this new picture of poverty has begun to influence policymaking in New York City.

The ability of minimise unit costs of producing milk, while not curtailing output levels, is often a determining factor of the long-term survival of dairy farms in South Africa. In this study, average cost curves showing the variation of unit cost with output are estimated for dairy production in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands of South Africa, using a panel of 37 farms for the period 1999 to 2007. The results show that economies of size exist, with larger farms able to produce any given level of output at lower costs compared to their smaller counterparts. The study found that the long-run average cost curve (LAC) for the sample of dairy farms is L-shaped rather than U-shaped.

In particular, we examine dynamic portfolio strategies with and without transaction costs in order to compare the forecasting power of discrete-time optimal allocations obtained under different stable Paretian distributional assumptions. We also consider a conditional extension of the stable Paretian approach and compare the model with others that consider different distributional assumptions.

Nevertheless, it may fail to provide a socially efficient decision as the majority can outvote any minority, even if the majority's gain does not compensate the loss suffered by the minority. In this paper, we propose and study a voting mechanism that allows voters to reveal more information about their preferences than the plurality voting system. In the standardized bids mechanism voters report a bid for all available projects that are standardized before being aggregated to choose the winning project. The standardization of bids ensures the existence of an equilibrium, and delivers incentives to overcome the problem of positive and negative exaggeration. Our experimental results show that the standardized bids mechanism performs well in the laboratory as it chooses the efficient project in almost 70% of the cases, and induces truthful reports of project rankings in approximately 90% of the cases. It also reduces the tension between the majority and the minority. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we examine the effect of aviation disasters on stock prices. We find evidence of a significant negative event effect with an average market loss of more than $60 billion per aviation disaster, whereas the estimated actual loss is no more than $1 billion. In two days a price reversal occurs. We find the effect to be greater in small and riskier stocks and in firms belonging to less stable industries. This event effect is also accompanied by an increase in the perceived risk: implied volatility increases after aviation disasters without an increase in actual volatility. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We find abnormal levels of short-selling in the three days before downgrades are publicly announced. Further, we show that this pre-announcement abnormal short-selling is significantly related to the subsequent share price reaction to the downgrade, and especially so for downgrades that prompt the most substantial price declines. Our findings are robust to various controls that might also affect short-selling such as pre-announcement momentum, three-day pre-announcement returns, and announcement-day share price. In addition, the results are independent of scheduled earnings announcements, analyst herding, and non-routine events near downgrades. Further evidence suggests that tipping is more consistent with the data than the prediction explanation which posits that short sellers successfully predict downgrades on the basis of public information about firms' financial health. Finally, we present evidence that downgraded stocks with high abnormal short-selling perform poorly over the subsequent six months by comparison with those with low abnormal short-selling. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that short sellers are informed traders and exploit profitable opportunities provided by downgrade announcements. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The paper intends to emphasize the importance of an adequate internal control structure that needs to be developed for investment companies and delivers arguments for reconciliation of national and European regulations to Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the matter of assessing and reporting upon the quality of internal control over financial communicating process.","[Danescu, Tatiana; Spatacean, Ovidiu; Bolos, Bradut] Petru Maior Univ, Fac Econ Jurid & Adm Sci, Targu Mures 540088, Romania","George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures",,tatiana_danescu@yahoo.com; spatacean_ioanovidiu@yahoo.com; bolos_bradut@yahoo.com,"Bolos, Bradut Vasile V.G./B-3467-2012; Danescu, Tatiana/I-5356-2014",,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",2223-5779,,978-960-474-184-7,WOR MULTIC APP ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,86,91,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300068000020,0

Our analysis provides a conventional OLS approach and an exploration of spatial dependence. We find some evidence of spatial lag and spatial autocorrelation in our dataset but the results are similar to the OLS approach. The results indicate that high occupancy is a statistically significant factor only for Class B properties, suggesting that a low occupancy rate is a negative sign for these buildings of lower quality. Class A property receives a 44% price/sq. ft. boost due to the premium classification. This increase becomes more pronounced (90%) for floor plate efficient, neoclassical/revival facade and/or famous Class A properties built before 1972 when the comparison is with Class B properties of the same age.","[Dermisi, Sofia V.; McDonald, John F.] Roosevelt Univ, Chicago, IL 60605 USA",Roosevelt University,"Dermisi, SV (通讯作者)，Roosevelt Univ, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",sdermis@roosevelt.edu; mcdonald@roosevelt.edu,,,,,,,31,18,20,0,4,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

Socially sustainable community members are able to; enjoy a sense of belonging; be assured of mutual social support from their community; enjoy freedom from discrimination and fear. Applying the concept of sustainable development to Korean communities begins with unprecedented and simultaneous emphasis on multiplying and increasing social inclusion, mobilizing residents and participation in governance. There is evidence that housing tenure is an important dimension of people's lives and that there may be an association between housing development and creating sustainable and inclusive communities. Two major questions being posed are: ( 1) How to create inclusive communities through social ( tenure) mix? (2) What are the implications of housing tenure differences in creating inclusive communities in line with housing (estate) development? The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast elements of inclusive communities across different housing tenures in the two cities (Seoul and Gangneung). Using the results of 336 questionnaires, we assess a commonly recognized element of inclusive community which is social mix and social capital. We found that the perception on social mix and social capital differed significantly between housing tenures. We argue that there are four hypothetic community types from a theoretical standpoint. Our study areas do not belong to the ideal type of community.","[Ha, Seong-Kyu; Choi, Eun-Jin] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Chung Ang University,,skha47@hanmail.net; ejchoi85@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,6,CHINA ARCHITECTURE & BUILDING PRESS,BEIJING,"BAIWANZHUANG XICHENGGU, BEIJING, 10037, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-112-12328-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,432,447,,,,,,16,Economics; Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,BRM62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283112400031,0

Private Education in Northern India,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Efforts to promote literacy and other forms of educational achievement in India have in recent years entailed policy reforms aimed at de-regulating the provision of primary and secondary education, especially in rural areas. In many States, deregulation has entailed the active promotion of privately-funded education, raising concerns about the motivations and qualifications of private schools and teachers, about social streaming and about the impact that privately-funded schools will have on the government system. Drawing upon a case study of private education in the Indian State of Madhya Pradesh, the following paper explores the ways in which the establishment of four privately-funded schools affected the socio-economic composition of students, the quality of teaching, the involvement of parents and caregivers and the performance and accountability of private school teachers and administrators. As we might expect, enrolment was biased strongly in favour of boys from forward castes, especially after Grade 5. However, the evidence also reveals that the private schools provided important opportunities for girls and children from lower caste families. Moreover, and on the basis of surveys and interviews we conducted with teachers, administrators and parents, the combination of temporary contracts and private payments appears to have created a situation in which teachers and administrators were explicitly concerned about the perceptions and expectations of parents, and parents were involved - or at least interested in - the education of their children. Whether such findings reflect the miracle of 'market-based approaches' - as opposed to the values and aspirations of higher income families - the findings provide ample justification for further empirical study.","[Johnson, Craig] Univ Guelph, Dept Polit Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W9, Canada; [Bowles, Michael T.] MSDSP, Dushanbe, Tajikistan",University of Guelph,"Johnson, C (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Polit Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W9, Canada.",cjohns06@uoguelph.ca,"Johnson, Craig/HLG-6356-2023",,,,,,32,6,7,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

Results show a significant preference for strong taste. The relative importance of price is lower than taste but majority are also adverse to higher prices. However, 15% of the sample population does not care about price but does care about taste, indicating the possibility of a high-end niche market segment.

The aim of the paper is a complex evaluation of the influence of subsidy on production, costs, profit and technical efficiency of organic farms. The partial aim is to evaluate different methods of subsidy rate calculation. The main methodological tool for achieving mentioned aims is an analysis using a production and a stochastic frontier production function. This approach has not been used in the Czech Republic yet. The previous. studies, analyzed subsidy of organic farming, were based on a comparison of especially family farm income, profit or costs of organic and conventional farming. The analysis was conducted on the basis of unbalanced panel data from 143 organic and 388 conventional enterprises - legal entities, obtained over the time period 2004 - 2008. The sample of organic farms represents 58% of the entire population of organic legal entities. Results of the analysis indicate negative impact of subsidies on production, profit and technical efficiency of organic farmers and refer to the reality that actual level of subsidy discourages organic farmers from rational behavior and implicates their dependence on state support.","[Kroupova, Zdenka; Maly, Michel] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, CZ-16521 Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Kroupová, Z (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, CZ-16521 Prague, Czech Republic.",kroupovaz@pef.czu.cz; maly@pef.czu.cz,"Malý, Michal/H-6171-2018; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021","Malý, Michal/0000-0001-7382-1895; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338",,,,,18,5,5,1,42,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Among the benefits of applying is the decrease in the cost implied for the equity capital. Our study makes a journey through the literature in order to find a suitable model, capable to estimate the cost of equity for Romanian companies. If such a model exists, and can be applied, it should give us the answer to the question: does IFRS reduce the cost of capital equity in Romania?

Most research suggests that there is a significant negative effect of oil price disruptions on economic activities; however reports about a positive or non-linear correlation between oil prices and aggregate measures of output or employment also exist.

We use the observed survival time on the market for hybrids sold during 1997-2009 to conduct a survival analysis. Our empirical results show that the expected lifetimes for corn hybrids with single biotech traits are 5-15% longer than for hybrids with multiple (stacked) traits, and the expected lifetimes for conventional corn are 13-17% longer than stacked hybrids. Also, the product life cycles for all types of hybrids have decreased over the past twelve years (especially after 2004), but the rate of decline is roughly similar across hybrid types. Based on this evidence, we conclude that the shorter product life cycles are closely linked to the accelerated levels of biotech product innovation in the US seed corn industry over the period of analysis.","[Magnier, Alexandre; Kalaitzandonakes, Nicholas] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Miller, Douglas J.] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Kalaitzandonakes, N (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 125 A Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",amwk4@mizzou.edu; KalaitzandonakesN@missouri.edu; MillerDou@missouri.edu,,,,,,,25,21,25,0,7,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The representatives are more likely to concern cross-cultural issues if they are expecting a foreign delegation than when they prepare their stay abroad. The research has also pointed out the different approach to nations that lay to the west and to the east from the CR, and the warm or cold relationships that arise from common historic experience. The paper also touches the willingness to keep local rules of the social game, the advantages and disadvantages of using the services of an interpreter, formal addressing, and the stereotyped image of other nations concerning above all the neighboring countries. Further the paper provides examples of results of cooperation of twin towns, both common that are practiced by almost every researched twin town, such as the exchange of students or culture and sports events, as well as the unique examples of towns that maintain above average relationship with their twin towns. Such an extraordinary cooperation has to be built on solid foundation, for example common history or geographical location; it has to be long lasting, and as many social interest groups as possible should be involved. The paper also suggests few other possible ways to extend the cooperation that have already been implemented in the Czech environment and proved to work, such as promoting culture by open-air happenings or by entertainment in courses of dancing or cooking. However, the most controversial issue is the discussion on greater independency of regional governments on central state authorities.","[Simonova, Klara; Kolman, Ludek] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Psychol, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Simonová, K (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Psychol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",simonova@pef.czu.cz,"Kolman, Luděk/AAG-8401-2020",,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,249,255,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600028,0

Racial diversity in public accommodations, including schools, has been an issue of continuous public policy debate at least since the U.S. Supreme Court's Plessy versus Ferguson decision (1896). This study applies theory from the literature on social capital to an examination of the role of racial segregation in the public schools of blacks during childhood on their adult likelihood to become self-employed and their level of occupational status. The model results indicate that, after controlling for a number of individual, household and metropolitan-area factors, lower rates of segregation during public schooling results in higher likelihood of wage-salary employment and self-employment among a cohort of black Americans that attended public schools during the 1960s.","Univ Virginia, Darden Grad Sch Business Adm, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA",University of Virginia,"Fairchild, G (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Darden Grad Sch Business Adm, FOB 185,POB 6550, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA.",fairchildg@darden.virginia.edu,,,,,,,76,7,12,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

However, traditional full-service brokers that bundle execution with services remain a force and their commissions are still considerably higher than the marginal cost of trade execution. We hypothesize that commissions constitute a convenient way of charging a prearranged fixed fee for long-term access to a broker's premium services. We derive testable predictions based on this hypothesis and test them on a large sample of institutional trades from 1999 to 2003. We find that institutions negotiate commissions infrequently, and thus commissions vary little with trade characteristics. Institutions also concentrate their order flow with a relatively small set of brokers, with smaller institutions concentrating their trading more than large institutions and paying higher per-share commissions. These results are stable over time, are consistent with our predictions, and cannot be explained by cost-minimization alone. Finally, we discuss the evolution of the institutional brokerage market within the proposed framework and make informal predictions about future developments in the industry.","[Goldstein, Michael A.] Babson Coll, Babson Pk, MA 02157 USA; [Irvine, Paul] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Kandel, Eugene; Wiener, Zvi] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Babson College; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Irvine, P (通讯作者)，Terry Coll Business, 444 Brooks Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",pirvine@uga.edu,"Wiener, Zvi/AAE-9750-2019; Goldstein, Michael/T-2914-2019","Wiener, Zvi/0000-0002-5169-4642; Goldstein, Michael/0000-0001-9044-9431",,,,,55,106,124,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Our findings indicate that market leaders maintain their leadership positions for, on average, 20 years from 1975 in Japanese manufacturing industries. We provide evidence that market leadership tends to persist in capital-intensive and legally cartelized industries, whereas it is less likely to persist in demand-volatile, R&D-intensive, and import-intensive industries.","[Kato, Masatoshi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo 1868603, Japan; [Honjo, Yuji] Chuo Univ, Fac Commerce, Tokyo 1920393, Japan",Hitotsubashi University; Chuo University,"Kato, M (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, 2-1 Naka, Tokyo 1868603, Japan.",masatoshi.kato@gmail.com; yhonjo@tamacc.chuo-u.ac.jp,,"Kato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-6087-5253",,,,,65,7,7,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Noting that many of the world's hungry are smallholder farmers, it is clear that food insecurity is closely linked to the livelihood strategies of these farm households. As previous studies have shown, food insecurity is linked to livelihood assets, strong institutional support and a favourable external environment. In particular, the paper finds that food security depends on cereal output, budgetary support to agriculture, agricultural value added and poverty - all variables strongly linked to the sustainable livelihoods framework. Since most poor rural households rely on agricultural production for a significant share of their household income, increasing agricultural productivity is critical to increase food security and reduce rural poverty.",,,,imatshe@hsrc.ac.za,,,,,,,50,16,18,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,DEC,2009,48.0,4,,,,,483,511,,10.1080/03031853.2009.9523837,0.0,,,29,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,586UM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276939000007,0

Using data originally collected for Namibia's forest resource accounts and insights from a non-separable household model, this paper estimates household fuelwood demand. Specifically, the factors underlying the substitution between fuelwood collected from open access forest resources, cow dung, and fuelwood purchased from the market are analysed. Heckman two-step estimates show that households respond to economic scarcity, as measured by the opportunity costs of collecting fuelwood, by reducing energy consumption slightly more than by increasing labour input to collection. There is limited evidence for substitution from fuelwood to other energy sources, particularly with declining availability of forest stocks. Market participants may be more sensitive to price changes than non-participants. All estimated elasticities are low, similar to those observed in previous studies.","[Palmer, Charles] ETH, Chair Environm Policy & Econ, Inst Environm Decis, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Macgregor, James] IIED, Sustainable Markets Grp, Environm Econ Programme, London, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Palmer, C (通讯作者)，ETH, Chair Environm Policy & Econ, Inst Environm Decis, Univ Str 22,CHN K 76-2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",charles.palmer@env.ethz.ch,,,,,,,36,25,33,1,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We focus on German double taxation agreements (DTAs) and show for up to 45 tax treaties that the bargaining outcomes depend on investment asymmetries between the countries. A transition from a purely symmetrical country pair to a situation where foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in only one direction would increase on average the negotiated withholding tax rate by roughly 5 percentage points. We also show that bargaining over DTAs is not only about withholding tax rates, but also about the definition of a permanent establishment (PE).

A small portfolio improves entrepreneurial incentives because it allows the VC to concentrate the limited human capital on a smaller number of startups, adding more value. A large and focused portfolio is beneficial because it allows the VC to reallocate the limited resources and human capital in the case of startup failure and allows the VC to extract greater rents from the entrepreneurs. We show that the VC finds it optimal to limit portfolio size when startups have higher payoff potential-that is, when providing strong entrepreneurial incentives is most valuable. The VC expands portfolio size only when startup fundamentals are more moderate and when he can form a sufficiently focused portfolio. Finally, we show that the VC may find it optimal to engage in portfolio management by divesting some of the startups early since this strategy allows him to extract a greater surplus.

Empirical evidence indicates that the stronger the investor protection the lower the fraction of equity that is owned by insiders. Results show that higher insider equity ownership is linked to larger risk premiums and higher costs of capital.

This subject is also important for Turkey. In this study, we aim to determine the sectoral and regional variables that affect the SMEs policies. The results of a survey, conducted with 1,200 SMEs operated in ten sectors of twenty five organized industrial zones in twelve cities, are interpreted. Variance analysis (ANOVA) is conducted to see whether these SMEs' firm policies are significantly across regions and sectors. The variables are the change in the demand for skilled and unskilled labour, investment strategies, investment sources that used in innovative activities and desired results of investments. Results indicate that the firm policies are affected by regions and sectors that SMEs belong to.","[Erbas, Bahar Celikkol] TOBB Ekon & Teknol Univ, IIBF, Iktisat Bolumu, Ankara, Turkey; [Fikirkoca, Ali; Tuzcu, Arcan] Ankara Univ, Siyasal Bilgiler Fak, Isletme Bolumu, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University; Ankara University,"Tuzcu, A (通讯作者)，Ankara Univ, Siyasal Bilgiler Fak, Oda Z-11, Cebeci Ankara, Turkey.",afikir@politics.ankara.edu.tr; tuzcu@politics.ankara.edu.tr; bcelikkol@etu.edu.tr,"Erbas, Bahar/AAB-2996-2019","Erbas, Bahar/0000-0001-6126-2125",,,,,51,0,0,0,13,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

This expanded authority has changed who can provide health-care services and has weakened the control physicians have traditionally held over the provision of medical services. These changes in regulation have varied by occupation, state, and year and provide variation that can be exploited to empirically measure the individual and collective impacts of changes in NP authority and PA authority on practitioner incomes. It is found that changes in NP and PA regulatory authority do impact the labor markets of all three practitioner categories. NPs having greater practice authority brings physician incomes down, has differential impacts on PA incomes, and improves their own earnings, other factors held constant. PAs having increased authority has a downward effect on NP earnings, a positive impact on physician income, and little impact on their own incomes.

It is possible that public sector pension plans may have acted imprudently by chasing returns, once they encountered underfunding. We identify four indicators for DB plans' imprudent investment behavior: no portfolio rebalancing, employer conflicts of interest, trustee conflicts of interest, and failure to implement best investment practices. To see if public sector pension plans rebalance their portfolios, we use data from the Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds, dating from 1952 to 2007. To test for the remaining three hypotheses, we use data froth the Census' State and Local Government Employee Retirement Systems data base, where consistent data for state and local government plans are available from 1993 to 2005. Our results suggest that there is no evidence that public sector plans systematically engaged in imprudent investment behavior and that this did not systematically differ after 2000 from the earlier period.","[Weller, Christian E.] Univ Massachusetts Boston, McCormack Grad Sch, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Affairs, Boston, MA USA; [Wenger, Jeffrey B.] Univ Georgia, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Dept Publ Adm & Policy, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Weller, CE (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts Boston, McCormack Grad Sch, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Affairs, Boston, MA USA.",jwenger@uga.edu,,,,,,,42,10,13,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

A crucial part of these treaties is the certainty provision, which deals with the nature of Aboriginal rights and title once a treaty is signed. Up until 1986, the Crown insisted on one certainty formula for all treaties. After 1986, however, Aboriginal groups were able to negotiate alternatives to the original certainty provision. This paper seeks to explain why alternatives to the original certainty provision emerged after 1986. It suggests that government perceptions of policy failure, generated by Aboriginal opposition to the extinguishment clause, resulted in the Crown engaging in instrumental learning.","Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Alcantara, C (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",,"Alcantara, Christopher/U-7852-2019","Alcantara, Christopher/0000-0001-6089-1114",,,,,81,11,12,0,4,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

For CRRA preferences, stylized real-world policies (notably safe debt and safe pensions) are found inefficient in the direction of imposing not enough productivity risk on retirees and too much on future generations. Safe transfers can be rationalized as efficient if preferences display age-increasing risk aversion, such as habit formation. The ubiquity of safe transfers suggests that governments treat the young as more risk tolerant than older cohorts. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is based on an adaptive nonparametric modelling approach which allows for the data-driven estimation of the nonlinear dynamic relationship between portfolio credit risk premia and their hypothetical components. Our main finding is that the empirical weights of the systematic factors display sudden jumps during market crises and a less intense time-dependent behaviour during normal market conditions. In addition, we find that during market crises the directions of the empirical relationships are often inconsistent with ordinary economic intuition, as they are influenced by the specific circumstances of financial markets distress.

Second, it is difficult to achieve technology neutrality with subsidies. Third, many subsidies are inframarginal. Finally, subsidies often suffer from unintended interactions with other policies.

The answer to this question has important implications for public policy. If shocks reduce investments in children, they may have a long-lasting impact on poverty and its intergenerational transmission. The authors develop a simple framework to analyze the effects of aggregate economic shocks on child schooling and health. They show that the expected effects are theoretically ambiguous because of a tension between income and substitution effects. They then review the recent empirical literature on the subject. In richer countries, like the United States, child health and education outcomes are counter-cyclical: they improve during recessions. In poorer countries, mostly in Africa and low-income Asia, the outcomes are procyclical: infant mortality rises and school enrollment and nutrition fall during recessions. In the middle-income countries of Latin America, the picture is more nuanced: health outcomes are generally procyclical and education outcomes counter-cyclical. Each of these findings is consistent with the simple conceptual framework.

Using age as a proxy for managers' investment experience, we find that around the peak of the technology bubble, mutual funds run by younger managers are more heavily invested in technology stocks, relative to their style benchmarks, than their older colleagues. Furthermore, young managers, but not old managers, exhibit trend-chasing behavior in their technology stock investments. As a result, young managers increase their technology holdings during the run-up, and decrease them during the downturn. Both results are in line with the behavior of inexperienced investors in experimental asset markets.

Prior to ratification, treaty participants agreed to launch country-based pilot projects, referred to collectively as Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ), to test novel aspects of the project-related provisions. Relying on a ten-year history of projects, we investigate the determinants of AIJ investment. Our findings suggest that review-agency preferences related to national political objectives and possibly deeper cultural ties influenced project selection and limited the number of AIJ projects. Bilateral ties also appear to have affected investment decisions directly, possibly because of related transaction costs. The results suggest an investment process different from the assumptions that underlie well-known estimates of cost-savings related to the Protocol's flexibility mechanisms. We conclude that if approaches developed under the AIJ programs to approve projects are retained, the scale of investment under Kyoto's flexibility provisions and their cost-savings will be less than what is generally anticipated and the pattern of investment less driven by abatement costs.","[Larson, Donald F.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Breustedt, Gunnar] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Kiel, Germany",The World Bank; University of Kiel,"Larson, DF (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",Dlarson@worldbank.org; GBreustedt@agric-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Larson, Donald/L-3918-2016","Larson, Donald/0000-0002-1318-3243",,,,,69,13,13,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Three forms of property rights risks are introduced to basic land-use forms. Illegal logging risk is associated with forest plantations, a land expropriation risk affects land in agriculture and plantation forestry, and illegal logging risks threaten native forest land. Public and private landowners can reduce these risks by employing costly enforcement effort. We show how that migration, expropriation, and illegal logging risks lead to deforestation by promoting agricultural expansion, and illegal logging. Higher public enforcement reduces illegal logging, but higher private enforcement may or may not reduce deforestation depending on migration pressures. Higher timber prices have an ambiguous effect on deforestation, but an increasing value of non-timber benefits decreases or leaves deforestation unchanged depending on the incentive structures of illegal loggers.","[Amacher, Gregory S.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Coll Nat Resources, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA; [Koskela, Erkki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Ollikainen, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Amacher, GS (通讯作者)，Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Coll Nat Resources, Dept Forestry, 304D Cheatham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA.",gamacher@vt.edu,,"Ollikainen, Markku/0000-0003-3333-4683",,,,,36,37,45,1,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The level of cooperation we observe in the 'treatment' community is considerably higher than that in the 'control' community. The two neighbourhoods, however, although similar in many dimensions, turn out to be significantly different in other observable variables. The result we obtain in terms of cooperation, however, is robust to controls for these observable differences.

We empirically examine the implications of our model using New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq securities. We find that the return patterns of stocks that switch markets become more similar to the return patterns of securities listed on the new market prior to the switch. Stocks that are eligible to switch but stay put are more similar to securities listed on their market than to securities listed on the other market.

In part, this nonprofit advantage is due to different input choices made by nonprofit centers-lower child-staff ratios, better-educated staff and directors, higher rates of professional development for staff Nonprofit centers may have an additional productivity advantage, due to unmeasured staff motivation and abilities or to better management of the production of good-quality child care. However, where nonprofit and for-profit child care firms compete in the same local markets, we speculate that this extra advantage should only appear where demand is sufficiently thick to permit a quality differentiation strategy to be financially viable for nonprofits. We estimate the effect of nonprofit status on quality, controlling for differences in financial resources available to the center, differences in the clientele served, and differences in staff and center inputs. In this conventional examination, nonprofit status has a moderately positive impact on quality However, when we account for the unobserved heterogeneity and separate markets into thick and thin, a particularly strong nonprofit advantage is found in thick markets, but no productivity advantage for nonprofits is found in thin markets. This finding suggests a clear role for nonprofit organizations in improving the cost-quality trade-off faced by parents, but also identifies the market conditions that affect the ability of nonprofit managers to employ this advantage.

Recent attempts to move to a more dynamic analysis include using panel data sets and survival analysis. In this study, we use a discrete choice dynamic model of land-use where the agent's choices are regarded as the solution to a dynamic optimization problem. The irreversibility of some decisions, expectations about future prices, and forward-looking behavior of the land operator can all be accounted for. Our results show that a model specification that incorporates some of the complexities of the decision process improves upon results found in the existing literature. First, prediction accuracy of land use change is superior to any of the existing models. Second, we demonstrate that models that do not account for transactions costs tend to overestimate the effects of changes in transportation costs.","[De Pinto, Alessandro] Univ Redlands, Dept Econ, Redlands, CA 92373 USA; [Nelson, Gerald C.] IFPRI, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"De Pinto, A (通讯作者)，Univ Redlands, Dept Econ, Duke Hall,1200 E Colton Ave,POB 3080, Redlands, CA 92373 USA.",alex_depinto@redlands.edu,"Nelson, Gerald/L-5903-2019","De Pinto, Alex/0000-0003-0327-494X; Nelson, Gerald/0000-0003-3626-1221",,,,,30,18,21,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Our contribution is twofold. We employ a larger set of macroeconomic data releases than used in previous studies and also use intraday data, an excess impact approach, and foreign news to provide more reliable inferences. Composite stock returns are computed based on 5-min intervals (ticks) and macroeconomic news are measured based on the deviations of the actual announcement values from their expectations. Overall, we find that all three new EU stock markets are subject to significant spillovers directly via the composite index returns from the EU, the U.S. and neighboring markets; Budapest exhibits the strongest spillover effect, followed by Warsaw and Prague. The Czech and Hungarian markets are also subject to spillovers indirectly through the transmission of macroeconomic news. The impact of EU-wide announcements is evidenced more in the case of Hungary. while the Czech market is more impacted by U.S. news. The Polish market is marginally affected by EU news. In addition, after decomposing pooled announcements, we show that the impact of multiple announcements is stronger than that of single news. Our results suggest that the impact of foreign macroeconomic announcements goes beyond the impact of the foreign stock markets on Central and Eastern European indices. We also discuss the implications of the findings for financial stability in the three emerging European markets. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that coalition governments can be held accountable in the presence of an electoral alternative. Accountability becomes problematic if it is certain that at least one of the coalition parties stays in power after the elections. Such a coalition (sometimes called a 'unity government') can not be given appropriate collective incentives. To incentivate government performance, voters make one coalition party responsible for the outcome. This, however, makes the other coalition party interested in sabotage.

Specifically, we show that corporate cash holdings are negatively related with unionization. We also find that this relation is stronger for firms that are likely to place a higher value on gaining a bargaining advantage over unions and weaker for those firms in which lower cash holdings provide less credible evidence that a firm is unable to concede to union demands. Additionally, we show that for unionized firms increases in cash holdings raise the probability of a strike. Finally, we show that unionization decreases the market value of a dollar of cash holdings.

This paper, using a simple application of a general common agency game, sheds light on which conditions the politicians prefer when implementing an unified sector supervision outside the central bank. From a theoretical point of view the quality of public sector governance plays a crucial role in determining the supervision unification. Focusing on the behaviour of the good policymaker (helping hand type), it will prefer a unified financial authority that is different from the central bank if the correspondent welfare gains-linked to at least one of the three effects: moral hazard, conflict of interest, bureaucracy-are considered higher respect to the information losses. The bad policymaker (grabbing hand type) will choose the single financial authority if the financial industry likes it, and the central bank is not a captured one. On the other hand, the paper tests the model, confirming the robustness of the institutional position of the central bank in explaining the recent trend in supervision consolidation, with an empirical analysis performed with ordered functions on an updated dataset.

Most IMF programs include quantitative performance criteria for key macroeconomic variables, which borrowers must meet to obtain Fund resources. Standard open economy models predict that if policymakers are able to credibly commit to reducing inflation, rational economic agents will lower their expectations of inflation and, therefore, the trade-off between inflation and output will fall. The present study tests whether IMF programs, by lending credibility to a country's adjustment program, influence the inflation-output trade-off. The results from the study suggest that IMF programs do not significantly influence the inflation-output trade-off.

While there is little doubt about the significance of technology competence for generating successful innovations, in-house R&D activities may be a particular challenge for SMEs due to high risk exposure, high fixed costs, high minimum investment and severe financial constraints. SMEs may thus opt for refraining from R&D and relying more on innovation management tools in order to achieve innovation success. We analyse whether such a strategy can pay off. Based on data from the German CIS, we find that R&D activities are a main driver for innovation success if combined with external R&D, using external innovation sources or by entering into co-operation agreements. SMEs without in-house R&D can yield a similar innovation success if they effectively apply human resource management tools or team work to facilitate innovation processes.","[Rammer, Christian; Czarnitzki, Dirk; Spielkamp, Alfred] ZEW, Ctr European Econ Res, Dept Ind Econ & Int Management, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Czarnitzki, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Spielkamp, Alfred] Univ Appl Sci Gelsenkirchen, Dept Entrepreneurship & Innovat, D-45877 Gelsenkirchen, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); KU Leuven,"Rammer, C (通讯作者)，ZEW, Ctr European Econ Res, Dept Ind Econ & Int Management, L 7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",rammer@zew.de; dirk.czarnitzki@econ.kuleuven.be; alfred.spielkamp@fh-gelsenkirchen.de,"Czarnitzki, Dirk/AAV-4124-2021; Rammer, Christian/ABA-8789-2021","Rammer, Christian/0000-0002-1173-9471",,,,,74,225,238,5,108,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Since the risks of prepayment and default are reasonably expounded in our model, our formulae are more appropriate than traditional mortgage formulae. We also analyze the effects of the prepayment penalty and partial prepayment on the yield, duration and convexity of a mortgage, and provide lenders with an upper-bound for the mortgage default insurance rate. Our model provides portfolio managers a useful framework to more appropriately appraise the mortgage and more effectively hedge their mortgage holdings. From the results of sensitivity analyses, we find that higher interest-rate, prepayment and default risks will increase the mortgage yield and reduce the duration and convexity of the mortgage.

Link closures may have different economic and societal consequences depending on in which regions they occur (regional importance), and users may be affected differently depending on where they travel (regional exposure). In this paper we investigate in what way these geographical disparities depend on the road network structure and travel patterns. We propose aggregate supply-side (link redundancy, network scale, road density, population density) and demand-side (user travel time, traffic load) indicators and combine them in statistical regression models. Using the Swedish road network as a case study, we find that regional importance is largely determined by the network structure and the average traffic load in the region, whereas regional exposure is largely determined by the network structure and the average user travel time. Our findings show that the long-term vulnerability disparities stem from fundamental properties of the transport system and the population densities. Quantitatively, they show how vulnerability depends on different variables, which is of interest for robust network design. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We test for differences between individual and household WTP in a novel, web-administered, split-sample CV survey asking WTP for preserving biodiversity in old-growth forests in Norway. Two samples are asked both types of questions, but in reverse order, followed by a question with an item battery trying to reveal why WTP may differ. We find in a test between samples that the WTP respondents state on behalf of their households is not significantly different from their individual WTP. However, within the same sample, household WTP is significantly higher than individual WTP; in particular if respondents are asked to state individual before household WTP. Our results suggest that using individual WTP as the response unit may overestimate aggregate WTP. Thus, the choice of response format needs to be explicitly and carefully addressed in CV questionnaire design and further research in order to avoid the risk of unprofitable projects passing the benefit-cost test.","[Lindhjem, Henrik; Navrud, Stale] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway; [Lindhjem, Henrik] Econ Poyry, N-0051 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Lindhjem, H (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",henrik.lindhjem@umb.no,"Lindhjem, Henrik/A-7828-2010","Navrud, Stale/0000-0002-6627-4595",,,,,40,36,39,3,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

First, it considers the design of intergovernmental transfers. While FGFF emphasizes correcting vertical and horizontal equity, SGFF emphasizes the importance of fiscal incentives for producing local economic prosperity. SGFF extends FGFF approaches by showing how non-linear transfer systems can produce both equalization and high marginal fiscal incentives to produce local economic growth. Second, the paper raises the fiscal incentive approach, showing how different tax systems produce different fiscal incentives for political officials to choose policies.

In particular, it examines a subprime household who borrows at a premium, but hopes to refinance at prime rates if their house appreciates, We show how these optimal default decisions can be used to calculate probabilities of default - an important input for risk management and pricing purposes. Numerical examples are provided, calibrated to US data. In a low interest rate environment, the credit-upgrade potential may discourage subprime borrowers from defaulting. However, default probabilities are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and house prices. This provides a rational explanation for the prevalence of adjustable rate mortgages among subprime borrowers, and the subsequent large numbers of defaults, when interest rates rose and house prices declined.

Acquiring and attending to information increases the psychological impact of information (an impact effect), increases the speed of adjustment for a utility reference-point (a reference-point updating effect), and affects the degree of risk aversion towards randomness in news (a risk aversion effect). Given plausible parameter values, the model predicts asymmetric preferences for the timing of resolution of uncertainty: Individuals should monitor and attend to information more actively given preliminary good news but put their heads in the sand by avoiding additional information given adverse prior news. We test for such an ostrich effect in a finance context, examining the account monitoring behavior of Scandinavian and American investors in two datasets. In both datasets, investors monitor their portfolios more frequently in rising markets than when markets are flat or falling.","[Karlsson, Niklas] AstraZeneca, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, SE-43183 Molndal, Sweden; [Loewenstein, George] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Seppi, Duane] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",AstraZeneca; Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Loewenstein, G (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",Niklas.x.Karlsson@astrazeneca.com; gl20@andrew.cmu.edu; ds64@andrew.cmu.edu,"Loewenstein, George/G-7616-2014",,,,,,66,293,340,5,80,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

It suggests that around 75 per cent of the VAT reduction will be passed on to consumers and that consumers will react by maintaining their expenditure levels and therefore increasing their demand for consumption goods. The uncertainty caused by the downturn makes this a more muted impact than we might have hoped, especially on the demand for durable goods. Nevertheless, it is a substantive impact. In general, the uncertainty caused by the recession will tend to reduce the impact of any stimulus package. It is also argued that synchronising the subsequent rise with the economic upturn is critical.","[Blundell, Richard] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,,r.blundell@ucl.ac.uk,"Blundell, Richard William/C-1552-2008","Blundell, Richard William/0000-0003-1588-2299",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-544-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,26,27,29,2,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Mile the use of price risk management instruments is an incomplete solution, it has sufficient merits on its own and will make the overall burden of risk more bearable.

Responding to the concern, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York auctioned Y2K options to primary dealers. The options gave the dealers the right to borrow from the Fed at a predetermined interest rate. Using the implied volatilities of Y2K options and the on/off-the-run spread, we demonstrate that the Fed's action eased the fears of bond dealers, contributing to a drop in the liquidity premium of Treasury securities. Our analysis shows the link between the microstructure of government debt markets and the central bank's provision of liquidity. We argue that Y2K options and their effects on liquidity premium broadly conform to the economic theory on public provision of private liquidity.","[Sundaresan, Suresh] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wang, Zhenyu] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Sundaresan, S (通讯作者)，Uris Hall,Room 811,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ms122@columbia.edu,,,Columbia Business School; J.

Exporters sell goods of different qualities to consumers who have heterogeneous preferences for quality. Production is subject to decreasing returns to scale and, therefore, supply and the toughness of competition react to cost changes brought about by exchange rate fluctuations. First, we predict that exchange rate shocks are imperfectly passed through into prices. Second, prices of low-quality goods are more sensitive to exchange rate shocks than prices of high-quality goods. Third, in response to an exchange rate appreciation, the composition of exports shifts toward higher quality and more expensive goods. We test these predictions using highly disaggregated price and quantity U.S. import data and find only weak empirical evidence in support of our theory.","[Chaney, Thomas] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Chaney, Thomas] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,,raphael.auer@snb.ch; tchaney@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,29,39,42,2,20,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

One weakness of such tests, however, is that they fail to inform the researcher as to which cross-section units are stationary. As a consequence, a reservation for PPP analyses based on such tests is that a small number of real exchange rates in a given panel may drive the results. In this paper we examine the PPP hypothesis focusing on the stationarity of the real exchange rates in up to 25 OECD countries. We introduce a methodology that when applied to a set of established panel unit-root tests, allows the identification of the real exchange rates that are stationary. Our results reveal evidence of mean-reversion that is significantly stronger as compared to that obtained by the existing literature, strengthening the case for PPP. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

After a short summary of more important topics and research findings in the recent literature on sales management, authors enumerate the main changes affecting the business environment which ask for reconsideration of the role, ways and means of salesmen. Authors emphasize the changes related to the seller-buyer relationship, including attenuation of the information asymmetry and of the negotiation power gap. Finally, the main distinctive traits of a sales-entrepreneur are uncovered in an attempt of systematization of choices that an entrepreneurial mindset will do among selling strategies and techniques.

Globalization does, however, have the potential to be stabilizing for individual economies and has been a key factor in promoting economic growth. The paper then examines four questions about the impact of globalization on the monetary transmission mechanism and arrives at the following answers: (i) Has globalization led to a decline in the sensitivity of inflation to domestic output gaps and thus to domestic monetary policy ? No. (ii) Are foreign output gaps playing a more prominent role in the domestic inflation process, so that domestic monetary policy has more difficulty stabilizing inflation ? No. (iii) Can domestic monetary policy still control domestic interest rates and so stabilize both inflation and output ? Yes. (iv) Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy ? Yes.","[Mishkin, Frederic S.] Columbia Univ, Banking & Financial Inst, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Mishkin, Frederic S.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Mishkin, FS (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Banking & Financial Inst, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA.",fsm3@columbia.edu,,,,,,,22,42,50,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

This situation is in contrast with the situation in the EU15(2), where foreign ownership is limited. One explanation of the great interest manifested by the foreign banks towards the NMS is the fact that they exploited the growth potential of the NMS banking sector and the liberalization and privatization process. Follow the client motivation, economical, historical and cultural ties between home and host countries are also determinants of the foreign banks' participation in the NMS. Moreover it should be noted that a main driver for international expansion of EU banks was the limited growth potential in their home countries. Out of foreign banks which invested in the NMS banking sector foreign banks having an EU parent are very important. Another difference between the NMS banking sector and the EU15 banking sector is the investment modality chosen by foreign banks.

Statistical data for the Republic of Croatia indicate that this is one of the roads with the heaviest traffic load in the country. In an experimental study conducted using traffic, operational and statistical methods of measurement, the problem of Poisson queuing model with a single waiting point was recognized. High frequency of vehicles exceeds the expected and assumed number of clients in a queue, which increases the average waiting time in the queuing model. For this reason, stationary traffic counting is undertaken in order to establish the traffic load. These results, as well as those for waiting times, confirm it is necessary to propose a new traffic organization for this road, which would decrease avarage waiting times and eliminate unneccesary halts. This in turn would increase the flow rate and minimize negative traffic situations.","[Bris, Martina] Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Bris, M (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",mbris@efos.hr,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-061-2,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,235,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMP23,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273265800022,0

Our main findings are as follows. First, advertising spending, candidates in the same party as the mayor, the education level of voters and the degree of race competition had a strong effect on the candidates' vote shares but not on economic performance. Second, the advertising spending of both incumbents and challengers had a significant effect on vote shares, but the effects were greater for challengers than for incumbents. Third, the two major political camps, that is, the Pan-Blue and Pan-Green, showed that spending exerts a corresponding influence on vote shares. Fourth, we also discovered that the spending coefficients for the winners were larger than those for the losers. Finally, the logit model demonstrates the result of the impact of advertising expenditures on the predicted probability of winning the election.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Chang, Chun-Ping] Shih Chien Univ, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; Shih Chien University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,43,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Due to the economic, technical and even political transformations the adjustment to the external environment is an essential element for the enterprise existence. In fact adjustment means a new approach to management and internal organization. Therefore the changes occurring in the management requirements determine the natural tendencies of the financial administration control evolution within the new context. The financial administration control focuses its complex approach on increasing its role in the management process since it is required to offer complete and logical answers regarding the methods used to reach the strategic objectives.

While earlier studies tended to confirm the Law, more recent research generally rejects it. This article reconciles these two streams of literature, taking into account the role of market selection and learning in reshaping a given population of firms through time. Consistently with previous studies, we find that Gibrat's Law has to be rejected ex ante, since smaller firms tend to grow faster than their larger counterparts. However, a significant convergence toward Gibrat-like behavior can be detected ex post. This finding is an indication that market selection cleans the original population of firms, so that the resulting industrial core does not depart from a Gibrat-like pattern of growth. From a theoretical point of view, this result is consistent with those models based on passive and active learning, and can be seen as a defense of the validity of the Law in the long-run.","[Lotti, Francesca] Econ Res Dept, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Santarelli, Enrico] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Vivarelli, Marco] European Commiss, IPTS, Seville, Spain",University of Bologna; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Lotti, F (通讯作者)，Econ Res Dept, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",francesca.lotti@bancaditalia.it; enrico.santarelli@unibo.it; marco.vivarelli@unicatt.it,"Vivarelli, Marco/AFM-1199-2022","Vivarelli, Marco/0000-0001-8982-2163; Vivarelli, Marco/0000-0002-8746-9324; SANTARELLI, ENRICO/0000-0001-8986-2755; VIVARELLI, MARCO/0000-0003-0500-9461",,,,,43,115,123,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

However, consistent with previous findings, the period of 1999 to 2000 displays pessimistic forecasts, especially for large firms and growth firms. The macroeconomic factor does not have significant impact on analyst optimism. In contrast, the time-varying investor sentiments measured by 2 Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) put-call ratios, and the cross-sectional skewness in the forecast errors, play an important role in explaining the time variation in analyst optimism.

Leading international organisations, such as the World Bank and UN Habitat, have disseminated 'best practice' programmes identified with 'good government' policy reform efforts. One of the best known programmes, participatory budgeting (PB), was first adopted by an entrepreneurial government in 1989 as a means to promote social justice, accountability, and transparency. Yet, when these programmes are copied by policy advocates and pro forma adopters, the political pay-offs for government officials are smaller, which leads them to provide weaker support for the adopted policy. This article demonstrates that policy entrepreneurs are more likely to provide greater resources and support to innovative policies than their policy advocates and pro forma adopter counterparts due to the types of political payoffs available to them. The article concludes by considering when it might be most appropriate for international funding agencies and nongovernmental organisations to promote best practice policies.","Boise State Univ, Polit Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA",Idaho; Boise State University,"Wampler, B (通讯作者)，Boise State Univ, Polit Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA.",bwampler@boisestate.edu,,,,,,,38,15,17,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Unlike prior studies, we employ unique data that directly observe lender renegotiation actions and cover more than 60% of the U.S. mortgage market. Exploiting within-servicer variation in these data, we find that bank-held loans are 26-36% more likely to be renegotiated than comparable securitized mortgages (4.2-5.7% in absolute terms). Also, modifications of bank-held loans are more efficient: conditional on a modification, bank-held loans have 9% lower post-modification default rates (3.5% in absolute terms). Our findings support the view that frictions introduced by securitization create a significant challenge to effective renegotiation of residential loans.

For firms that restate at least one annual report, we find that investors are misled by mistakes in reported earnings at the time of initial earnings announcements. Investors react positively to the component of the favorable earnings surprise that will subsequently be restated, and they attach the same valuation to it as to the true earnings surprise. We also find that investors anticipate the subsequent downward restatements and start marking stock prices down several months before a restatement announcement, so that the full impact of a restatement is about three times as large as the restatement announcement effect. Indeed, we show that investors punish restating firms because the stock price gains that shareholders enjoy when firms initially announce overstated earnings are more than reversed by the time of the restatement announcement.","[Bardos, Katsiaryna Salavei] Fairfield Univ, Dolan Sch Business, Fairfield, CT 06824 USA; [Golec, Joseph; Harding, John P.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Fairfield University; University of Connecticut,"Bardos, KS (通讯作者)，Fairfield Univ, Dolan Sch Business, 1073 N Benson Rd, Fairfield, CT 06824 USA.",kbardos@fairfield.edu; joseph.golec@business.uconn.edu; john.harding@business.uconn.edu,,,,,,,45,16,19,1,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

The endogeneity of the labor supply plays a crucial role, as tax changes that affect hours of work will affect the distribution of wealth and income, reinforcing or offsetting the direct redistributive impact of taxes. We consider different ways of financing government expenditure and find that policies that reduce the labor supply are associated with lower output but also with a more equal distribution of after-tax income.

An asset can be fragile because of concentrated ownership, or because its owners face correlated or volatile liquidity shocks, i.e., they must buy or sell at the same time. We formalize this idea and apply it to mutual fund ownership of US stocks. Consistent with our predictions, fragility strongly predicts price volatility. We then extend the logic of fragility to investigate two natural extensions: (1) the forecast of stock return comovement and (2) the potentially destabilizing impact of arbitrageurs on stock prices.

However, problems arise in the application of nonparametric tests to multiple day analyses of cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) that have caused researchers to normally rely upon parametric tests. In an effort to overcome this shortfall, this paper proposes a generalized rank (GRANK) testing procedure that can be used on both single day and cumulative abnormal returns. Asymptotic distributions of the associated test statistics are derived, and their empirical properties are studied with simulations of CRSP returns. The results show that the proposed CRANK procedure outperforms previous rank tests of CARs and is robust to abnormal return serial correlation and event-induced volatility. Moreover, the CRANK procedure exhibits superior empirical power relative to popular parametric tests.

J,"McKnight, S",,,,"McKnight, Stephen",,,Should Central Banks Target Consumer or Producer Prices?,INTERNATIONAL FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MONETARY-POLICY; OPEN-ECONOMY; EXCHANGE-RATE; DETERMINACY; STABILITY; EQUILIBRIUM; MODELS; MATTER; RULES,"Should central banks target consumer price inflation (CPI) in the setting of monetary policy, as has been orthodoxy in most of the developed world since the 1990s? Several prominent recent studies have argued against this, based on the finding that targeting CPI can make expectations of higher consumer prices self-fulfilling. If the central bank responds to an extrinsic-shock-driven rise in CPI expectations by driving up the real interest rate, the argument goes, the resulting improvement in the terms of trade can increase consumer prices even if producer prices fall. These studies are, however, based on a flawed assumption that what motivates current transactions is the money consumers have after leaving the goods market. Using what is shown to be the more defensible assumption that such transactions are motivated by the money consumers have before entering the goods market, this paper demonstrates that targeting CPI helps to prevent self-fulfilling expectations. This is because an improvement in the terms of trade now serves to exert downward pressure on CPI, irrespective of the response of producer prices. Consequently, the initial rise in CPI expectations is not self-fulfilling under CPI targeting, whereas under producer price inflation (PPI) targeting, improvements in the terms of trade act as an undesirable negative cost shock. Central banks in open economies would therefore be ill-advised to shift from CPI to PPI targeting, as the latter is more likely to result in welfare-reducing, self-fulfilling expectations.","Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"McKnight, S (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Camino Ajusco 20, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico.",mcknight@colmex.mx,"McKnight, Stephen/AAH-1560-2020","McKnight, Stephen/0000-0003-0669-1511",,,,,26,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

We adopt a panel vector autoregressive framework which allows us to control simultaneously for common business cycle effects, unobserved cross correlation effects in return and volatility via industry effects, and heterogeneity across firms. Our results suggest that volatility feedback effects at the firm level are present due to both market and firm effects, though the market volatility feedback effect is stronger than the corresponding firm level effect. We also find that the leverage effect at the firm level is persistent, significant and negative, while the effect of market return on firm volatility is persistent, significant and positive. The presence of these effects is further explored through the responses of the model's variables to market-wide return and volatility shocks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Smith, L.

The study is based on the arguments of Ball and Cecchetti (1990) which distinguish between short-term and long-term uncertainty and Kim's (1993) unobserved component with Markov-switching heteroscedasticity. The empirical results for the period of January 1995-January 2008 suggest that inflation uncertainty is due to transitory shocks rather than the permanent shocks. The link between inflation and inflation uncertainty due to permanent shocks indicates weak negative association between the level of inflation and long-run inflation uncertainty except the crises periods. This result is not consistent with the hypothesis of Ball and Cecchetti (1990). The implication of the empirical results support the idea of unsuccessful monetary policies during high inflation period till 2001 that were characterized by frequent policy shifts and mismanagement of the economy while a strong commitment of the monetary authorities to the inflation targeting strategy reversed the stance of the monetary policy after the 2001 crises.,"[Tuna, Gulcay; Payaslioglu, Cem] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Gazimagusa, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Tuna, G (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Gazimagusa, Turkey.",gulcay.tuna@emu.edu.tr; cem.payasli@emu.edu.tr,"Payaslıoğlu, Cem/E-8478-2015",,,,,,39,0,0,0,5,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Since Fama and French (1992), there has been a vigorous, ongoing debate on whether the size premium is a compensation for systematic risk. Since the late 1990s, research on the size effect has been characterized by two developments that are seemingly contradictory. At last, theoretical models have emerged in which the size effect arises endogenously as a result of systematic risk. However, recent empirical studies assert that the size effect has disappeared after the early 1980s. In this review, I address this disconnect between recent theoretical and empirical research.

The motivation behind this paper is to investigate the factors driving this growth from both economic and strategic backgrounds. The paper employs panel data analysis covering the period 2003-2009 where we quantify the main drivers of China's outward FDI across a range of variables including bilateral and multi lateral trade, market size, GDP growth, openness and resource endowment.

Study participants were selected on the basis of being 'informal experts' - reflecting their affinity for engagement with ICTs. Through an exploration of the interview findings, it becomes clear that relatively new technological devices and applications have quickly become embedded into the participants' everyday travel and communications. Changes in social practice at the level of the individuals are not visibly dramatic, but at the same time, there is evidence of a cumulative influence of ICrs on their daily lives. Technologies are enabling the participants to better accommodate the uncertainties in activity and travel scheduling and yet also contributing to a 'fluidity' in time-space co-ordination of activities. They are also allowing the juggling of life roles in time and space leading to apparent fragmenting of activities.

High interest rate currencies load more on this slope factor than low interest rate currencies. This factor accounts for most of the cross-sectional variation in average excess returns between high and low interest rate currencies. A standard, no-arbitrage model of interest rates with two factors-a country-specific factor and a global factor-can replicate these findings, provided there is sufficient heterogeneity in exposure to global or common innovations. We show that our slope factor identifies these common shocks, and we provide empirical evidence that it is related to changes in global equity market volatility. By investing in high interest rate currencies and borrowing in low interest rate currencies, U.S. investors load up on global risk.","[Lustig, Hanno; Roussanov, Nikolai; Verdelhan, Adrien] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lustig, Hanno] UCLA Anderson, London, England; [Roussanov, Nikolai] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania,"Verdelhan, A (通讯作者)，MIT Sloan, 100 Main St,E62-621, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",adrienv@mit.edu,,/0000-0002-0319-5531,,,,,53,395,470,2,106,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Specifically, the conditions under which an equivalent quota yields higher expected welfare than a tariff are shown to depend on a set of economic variables. These variables include the initial tariff rate, the relative efficiency in production between home and foreign firms, the probability distribution of random demand shocks that make the quota binding or non-binding under uncertainty, as well as the variance of the stochastic market demand.

We show that cash savings in the short run and debt reduction in both the short and the long run account for a substantial fraction of cash flow use. Although, in the long run, investment exhibits substantial sensitivity to cash flows, investment does not absorb the entire cash flow shock. In fact, the tighter the financial constraints, the smaller the fraction of cash flow absorbed by investment and the more by leverage reduction. Firms stage their response to increases in cash flow, delaying investment while building up cash stocks and reducing leverage. These results suggest that much of the short-run economic effect of cash flow shocks to the corporate sector may be channeled into the corporate debt market rather than the capital goods market, especially when financing constraints tighten.","[Dasgupta, Sudipto] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Noe, Thomas H.] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Noe, Thomas H.] Univ Oxford, Balliol Coll, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Wang, Zhen] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Dasgupta, S (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",dasgupta@ust.hk; thomas.noe@sbs.ox.ac.uk; wang.zhen@mail.shufe.edu.cn,"Noe, Thomas/ABB-8061-2021","Noe, Thomas/0000-0003-4068-1202; Dasgupta, Sudipto/0000-0002-0346-7285",,,,,34,48,51,2,32,UNIV WASHINGTON SCH BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATION,SEATTLE,"C/O OFFICE MANAGER, 115 LEWIS HALL, BOX 353200, SEATTLE, WA 98195-3200 USA",0022-1090,,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

The unique Japanese experience of quantitative easing is the only experience which enables us to judge this therapy's effectiveness and the timing of the exit strategy. In this paper, we provide a new empirical framework to examine the effectiveness of Japanese monetary policy during the lostdecade and quantify the effect of quantitative easing on Japan's activity and prices. We combine advantages of Markov-switching VAR methodology with those of factor analysis to establish two major findings. First, we show that the decisive change in regime occurred in two steps: it crept out from late 1995 and established itself durably in February 1999. Second, we show for the first time that quantitative easing was able not only to prevent further recession and deflation but also to provide considerable stimulation to both output and prices. This positive effect is reached through the interest rate factor. These results remain valid even when fiscal policy is simultaneously taken into account in the analysis. If Japanese experience is any guide the quantitative easing policy must be seen as a symptomatic treatment; it must be accompanied with a dramatic restructuring in the financial framework. The exit from quantitative easing must be postponed and decided within a clear program and according to clear numerical objectives. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

Another look at the relative reduction in female happiness,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Happiness; Subjective well-being trends,RESPONSE RATES; MAIL; TELEPHONE; BRITAIN; HEALTH; MODE,"In a provocative paper. Stevenson and Wolfers (2009) provide evidence that women over the last several decades experienced an absolute and relative decline in happiness. The current paper draws upon novel data from the DDB Needham Life Style Survey to take another look at the evolution of women's subjective well-being. In contrast to Stevenson and Wolfers, I find that men and women between 1985 and 2005 experienced similar decreases in life satisfaction. Furthermore, both sexes witnessed comparable slippages in self-confidence, growing regrets about the past, and declines in virtually every measure of self-reported physical and mental health. The data also show that men's well-being in recent years has begun to fall more rapidly than that for women. In the final section of the paper, I present some initial evidence that the steady erosion in social and civic engagement, interpersonal trust, and financial security could be partially responsible for the widespread decline in subjective well-being over the past few decades.

Current approaches suggest that the relative equity market performance of two countries is linked to their exchange rate. In contrast, this study proposes an alternative approach where one global variable - global equity market returns - is believed to have an effect on exchange rates, with the relative interest rate level of a currency determining the sign of the relationship. Our empirical findings suggest that exchange rates and global stock market returns are strongly linked. The value of currencies with higher interest rates is positively related with global equity returns, whereas the value of currencies with lower interest rates is negatively related with global equity returns.

Age norms refer to those social norms that determine whether establishing and running a business are considered appropriate behavior for a mature individual. An empirical analysis of Finnish individuals finds that norms perceived as permissive of enterprising activity in the third age exert a significant positive influence on entrepreneurial intentions in this segment, even when controlling for the general level of entrepreneurship in the municipalities. This influence is partially mediated by whether the individual has a positive attitude toward entrepreneurship, by how the individual perceives their own ability to start and run a business, by the extent of support from their family and friends they perceive and by the importance of that support to them. Thus, if policy aims to increase enterprising activity in the third-age segment, the portfolio of instruments should include measures that address people's general awareness of third-age entrepreneurship as a viable, positive and attractive late-career option.","[Kautonen, Teemu; Kibler, Ewald] Turku Sch Econ & Business Adm, Turku, Finland; [Tornikoski, Erno T.] St Etienne Sch Management, St Etienne, France",University of Turku,"Kautonen, T (通讯作者)，Turku Sch Econ & Business Adm, Turku, Finland.",teemu.kautonen@tse.fi,"Tornikoski, Erno T./JCD-9012-2023; Tornikoski, Erno T./G-4865-2013; Kautonen, Teemu/L-8973-2013; Kibler, Ewald/M-3126-2013; Kibler, Ewald/M-3667-2014","Tornikoski, Erno T./0000-0002-2108-5483; Kautonen, Teemu/0000-0001-9357-5337; Kibler, Ewald/0000-0002-4554-0153",,,,,71,144,155,3,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

High volatility and disorder in financial markets prompted the G-7 authorities to jointly intervene to weaken the yen. This episode resembled the two most recent G-7 coordinated interventions: the June 1998 effort to strengthen the yen and the September 2000 effort to strengthen the euro. Exchange rates reacted strongly and quickly to these three interventions, moving 3 to 4 percent in the desired direction within 30 minutes of the announcement and exhibiting lower volatility in the following days. G-7 authorities have used intervention very sparingly since 1995, yet the March 2011 policy action is a reminder that it can be used to calm markets and move the exchange rate in the desired direction. Intervention has become much less common but more successful.","Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Neely, CJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA.",,"Neely, Chris/N-8182-2019","Neely, Chris/0000-0003-2852-9419",,,,,45,22,28,0,9,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

In this paper, we examine proximity to markets at different stages of the IDP as a determinant of a country's own foreign direct investment (FDI) pattern. Our main contribution lies in the empirical estimation of the importance of spatial determinants for the emergence of inward and outward FDI. Our results support that distance to countries at higher stages up the IDP which are better integrated into the world FDI network, has a negative effect on the probability of transition from any stage of the IDP to the next.

The purpose of this research is to thoroughly investigate this issue to answer the question of whether the return predictabilities based on investment and financing activity are interrelated and share the same underlying cause. We find that investment and financing activities are only weakly correlated and that the profitability profiles surrounding these two activities differ. After controlling for the book-to-market ratio, high investment firms are more profitable than low investment firms, while high financing firms are less profitable than low financing firms. In addition, the investment-return relation weakens after controlling for financing, while the financing-return relation remains significant after controlling for investment. Our evidence suggests that the investment-return relation does not explain the external financing anomaly. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings make a case for greater optimism concerning the use of such rules in NK models with capital. While Bullard and Mitra's (2002, 2007) findings for the labor-only NK model do not always extend to models with capital, we show that determinate and learnable REE can be achieved in NK models with capital if there is (i) plausible capital adjustment costs, (ii) some weight given to output in the policy rule, and/or (iii) a policy of interest rate smoothing.","[Duffy, John] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Xiao, Wei] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Duffy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",jduffy@pitt.edu; wxiao@binghamton.edu,"Duffy, John/F-6968-2015","Duffy, John/0000-0002-7660-2281",,,,,30,14,18,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

It further finds that observed quality of engineers in both SOEs and domestic private firms declines in the presence of FDI in the same industry and region, while quality of managers improves in domestic private firms.

Results show that consumers do prefer falling profiles over rising profiles; however, also a strong preference for constant profiles was found.

It argues that Schumpeter and Marx shared a common vision, including agreement on the growth in the size of the firm and in industrial concentration, the inherent instability of capitalism and the inevitability of crises, and the eventual destruction of capitalist institutions and the arrival of a socialist form of economic organization as a result of the working out of the internal logic of capitalist evolution. Schumpeter's main qualification is his insistence upon the importance of temporal lags, i.e., social forms that persist after they have lost their economic rationale, and he suggests that the essence of capitalism lies in the inevitable tendency of that system to depart from equilibrium.

Most tests of this theory look for evidence of pre-election distortions in fiscal policy. We propose a new test that explores the two-way interaction between the magnitude of the opportunistic distortion and the margin of victory.

We study the determinants of this firm-level choice. We present a simple conceptual framework to derive predictions that we subsequently test in the empirical analysis. We argue that an increment in buyers' spatial concentration benefits production in advance more in homogenous industries than in differentiated ones, while the benefits for production to order are larger as product differentiation increases. Consequently, the propensity to adopt one of the two production modes, following an increase in the number of local downstream buyers, changes according to the degree of product differentiation of the goods. Relying on a large data set of Italian manufacturing firms, we find empirical support to our ideas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Minerva, G.

The aim of this paper is to examine the potential for this transport mode within the UK and Europe. Firstly, the latest technological developments are identified, building on the last major review by Howgego and Roe (1998). There is then an analysis of the policy landscape towards freight pipelines, as successful implementation will require the support of policy makers. Finally, some of the major benefits and issues with freight pipelines are highlighted. We conclude that there are still opportunities for the use of freight pipelines, but that further research is yet required to fully understand the supply chain, logistics and other related activities that the introduction of this technology may influence. This is because systems which are presently in commercial operation have exhibited excellent characteristics, although they have not been more widely adopted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept of the focus group (FG) is widened and a method based on holding larger groups defined as mega focus groups (MFG) is proposed. These MFG allow all sections of society to be represented in the participation process, thereby involving the population at a strategic level in subjects of general interest to society and later, holding smaller FGs on more specific subject matters (tactical level). The advantage of the larger MFG over the smaller FG is that they can obtain more information (between 40 and 60 people take part) from easily run meetings (similar to the FG). The MFG also provide a territorial representation of peoples' opinions and serve as a mechanism for selecting the participants in the smaller focus groups. The information extracted from both the MFG and FG about people's perceptions of sustainable mobility provides the background to the design of pilot surveys on urban mobility. For a better understanding of the development of this method and its possible applications in any town or city the article includes its practical application in the medium sized city of Santander (Northern Spain).

We suggest that the present institutional set-ups in both England and the US too often hold schools accountable for outcomes over which they have little control - but that such problems are far from insurmountable.","[Smith, Jeffrey] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Smith, Jeffrey] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research,,ali_m@ifs.org.uk; econjeff@umich.edu,,,ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,59,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

However, as backyard hog production fell in the rich, coastal regions, the backyard hog production from less wealthy, inland provinces has increased. In this paper, we illustrate the linkage between market development and patterns of household livestock production in rural China. The results indicate that rural labor and grain market developments have significant effects on household hog production. Using household-level survey data, we find a distinctive inverted-U relationship between backyard livestock production and the stage of market development. Hence, market developments might foster the contraction of hog production in rich coastal areas and at the same time lead to an expansion in hog production in poor inland areas.","[Qiao, Fangbin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jing] Fannie Mae, Business Anal & Dev, Washington, DC USA; [Carter, Colin] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Huang, Jikun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Central University of Finance & Economics; Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae); University of California System; University of California Davis; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Stanford University","Qiao, FB (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,"Chen, Jing/Q-3352-2018",,,,,,25,9,13,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

These results hold after we control for firm-, bank-, and loan-specific factors, and account for endogeneity of bank losses. These findings, together with our evidence that borrowers took out smaller loans during the crisis when they borrowed from banks that incurred larger losses, lend support to the concerns about bank lending following their subprime losses.","[Santos, Joao A.

We examine two basic treatments, one with incomplete information and the other with complete information. In the former, subjects are informed only about their own individual payoffs and the aggregate extraction effort level of the group, and in the latter they are also informed about the individual effort levels and payoffs of each subject. Given this setting, the basic question we attempt to answer is: Will the provision of subject-specific performance information (i.e. individual's effort levels and payoffs) improve or worsen the tragedy of the commons (i.e. an exploitation effort level greater than the socially optimum level)? In order to motivate our hypotheses and explain our experimental results at the individual level, we make use of the theory of learning in games, which goes beyond standard non-cooperative game theory, allowing us to explore the three basic benchmarks in the commons context: Nash equilibrium, Pareto efficient, and open access outcomes. We use several learning and imitation theoretical models that are based on contrasting assumptions about the level of rationality and the information available to subjects, namely: best response, imitate the average, mix of best response and imitate the average, imitate the best and follow the exemplary learning rules. Finally, in order to econometrically test the hypotheses formulated from the theoretical predictions we use a random-effects model to assess the explanatory power of the different selected behavioral learning and imitation rules.

One suggestion has been that countries have sought to self-insure against future crises, either because of a perceived increase in the cost of crises or because of the perceived conditionality costs of using IMF credits. This paper offers an empirical investigation of these ideas, disaggregating across regions and across IMF facilities. We find that IMF programs have had a significant positive effect on subsequent reserve accumulation, allowing for other determinants, and that this effect endures over time. We also find that the effect differs between Latin America and Asia, and that it is not simply a phenomenon that is associated with the Asian crisis of 1997/98. The paper goes on to discuss the implications for the design of policy and for the reform of the IMF.","[Bird, Graham; Mandilaras, Alex] Univ Surrey, Dept Econ, Surrey GU2 7XH, England",University of Surrey,"Mandilaras, A (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Dept Econ, Surrey GU2 7XH, England.",g.bird@surrey.ac.uk; a.mandilaras@surrey.ac.uk,,"Mandilaras, Alex/0000-0001-5833-4458",,,,,16,7,9,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The influence of more than one agent has been recognised for many years, and yet the majority of automobile choice studies develop choice models as if a single agent is involved in the preference revelation process. What is not clear is whether it makes any substantive difference in preference revelation according to who is interviewed in a household. Using a generalised mixed logit framework that accounts for preference and scale heterogeneity, we estimate a series of models to investigate whether there are significant differences between the preferences of each individual in a household when assessed in isolation from other household members, as well as their joint preferences when expressing their preferences through a group choice task. The context is choosing amongst petrol, diesel and hybrid fuelled vehicles (associated with specific levels of fuel efficiency and engine capacity) when faced with a mix of vehicle prices, fuel prices, fixed annual registration fees, annual emission surcharges and vehicle kilometre emission surcharges. Using a stated choice experiment, we find that sampling a single individual as a representative of the household's preferences is less appropriate than utilising preference information from the relevant group of decision makers in the household.","[Hensher, David A.; Beck, Matthew J.; Rose, John M.] Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Hensher, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",David.Hensher@sydney.edu.au; Matthew.Beck@sydney.edu.au; John.Rose@sydney.edu.au,"Rose, John/AAO-2897-2021","Rose, John/0000-0003-4211-0980; Beck, Matthew/0000-0003-1111-2852; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",,,,,28,28,29,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The paper's aim is to provide all elements needed to appreciate the issues and insights which are related to the introduction of learning into this model. Rational expectations which are a building block of the original model can thus be replaced by expectations based on estimation algorithms. The permanent updating of these estimations can be interpreted as a learning process of the model's agents. This learning process induces additional dynamics into the model. The literature in question uses two criteria in order to analyse the ability of monetary policy rules to stabilise the economy: (i) uniqueness of the (non-explosive) rational expectations equilibrium in the original model and (ii) stability in regards to learning in the modified model. Taking learning into account enables to detect shortcomings of a rule according to (ii) that would not been seen in a rational expectations model. The paper ends with a discussion on the specific problems met in the introduction of a learning process in the new canonical model.","Univ Bordeaux IV, CNRS, UMR 5113, GREThA, F-33608 Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Zumpe, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux IV, CNRS, UMR 5113, GREThA, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",martin.zumpe@u-bordeaux4.fr,"Dao, Rock/E-5736-2014",,,,,,64,0,0,0,11,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We find that foreign banks are more profitable than domestic banks when they operate in a host country whose banking sector is less competitive and when the parent bank in the home country is highly profitable. Moreover, when foreign banks operate in a host country with lower growth rates of GDP, higher interest and inflation rates, and more stringent regulatory compliance with Basel risk weights, their margins increase. Specifically, changes in bank supervision of a parent bank's ownership restrictiveness in the home country significantly increases foreign bank margins, while supervisory changes in regulatory compliance with Basel risk weights in the host country enhances foreign bank margins.

At the theoretical level a simple model of elections with two time periods is presented, which takes into account whether the political regime is democratic or not. Specifically, we assume that elected officials in democracies are more accountable to voters than the respective ones in autocracies. This mechanism induces the democratic politicians to produce the public good in a more efficient way, in order to remain in power. In empirical section we examine the effect of democracy on PSE for a panel dataset of 50 developing and developed countries over the period 1980-2000. Our results suggest that the relationship between PSE and democracy is positive and statistically significant, thus confirming our theoretical priors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In Oman, (1) there are no taxes on dividends and capital gains, (2) there is a high concentration of share ownership, (3) there is low corporate transparency, and (4) firms frequently change their dividends. Our results show that announcements of dividend increases are associated with increased stock prices, while announcements of dividend decreases cause decreases in stock prices. Firms that do not change their dividends experience insignificant negative returns.

We particularly highlight poverty experiences, role of neighbourhoods, poverty dynamics and transmission, child poverty and disability and personal finance. In addition we consider psychology and policy responses by looking and autonomy and empowerment, and poverty reduction programs. Our central thesis is that the detailed knowledge of individual experiences, cognitions and social factors in psychology and related social science complements the traditional economic emphasis on structural factors and policy instruments in a way that is exemplified by emerging work in behavioural economics.

We observe substantial economies of scale that are even larger for smaller firms. In line with the efficient structure hypothesis, both stocks and mutuals are found to have comparative cost advantages. Supporting the strategic focus hypothesis, we find that more specialized insurers have lower costs.

We find that improvements in economic freedom tend to be associated with increases in public investment, while reductions in corruption produce effects going in both directions. Similarly, we show that increases in public investment are often linked with decreases as well as increases in corruption. In terms of the public finances, we detect mostly improvements in debt when there is less economic regulation, while results for the deficit are less conclusive. On the other hand, improvements in the corruption environment are mostly associated with decreases in the deficit as well as debt. As a general rule that follows from our results, steps aimed at reducing corruption and the degree of economic regulation should lead towards improvements in the fiscal position of most of the new EU countries.","[Hanousek, Jan; Kocenda, Evzen] Charles Univ Prague, CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hanousek, Jan; Kocenda, Evzen] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hanousek, Jan; Kocenda, Evzen] Angloamer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hanousek, Jan; Kocenda, Evzen] Ctr Econ Policy Res CEPR, London, England; [Kocenda, Evzen] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Kocenda, Evzen] Osteuropa Inst OEI, Regensburg, Germany",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Anglo-American University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut,"Hanousek, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",jan.hanousek@cerge-ei.cz; evzen.kocenda@cerge-ei.cz,"Hanousek, Jan/H-2879-2014; Kocenda, Evzen/R-9674-2017; Hanousek, Jan/HOC-4951-2023","Kocenda, Evzen/0000-0003-4110-1169; Hanousek, Jan/0009-0006-3997-5931",,,,,54,13,13,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We find that the trader's presence can improve efficiency overall despite the fact that it sometimes ends up selling to a net short position and then voting to decrease firm value. An efficiency improvement is likely if other shareholders' votes are not highly correlated with the correct decision or if it is relatively expensive to separate votes from shares on the record date.

This paper examines the relationship between human capital and export in provinces of Turkey, using the panel causality method with annual data from 1996 to 2008. Empirical findings reveal that there is a unidirectional causal relationship running from export to human capital except for 5th order developed provinces. The significance of this empirical result is that export can be considered as an effective instrument increasing human capital accumulation. Overall, the paper suggests that export triggers increases in human capital in provinces which have different level of socio-economic development.","[Genc, Murat Can; Deger, Mustafa Kemal; Berber, Metin] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Iktisat Bolumu, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkey",Karadeniz Technical University,"Genç, MC (通讯作者)，Karadeniz Tech Univ, Iktisat Bolumu, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkey.",mcgenc@ktu.edu.tr; mkdeger72@hotmail.com; berber@ktu.edu.tr,"Genç, Murat Can/AAW-8791-2020; BERBER, Metin/AAU-7059-2020; DEĞER, MUSTAFA KEMAL/AAT-4319-2020","Genç, Murat Can/0000-0003-0123-6042;",,,,,34,1,1,0,13,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Governments as one of the giant organizations of any society trace missions and some goals. Probably, the most important mission of states is accomplishing social justice. In order to reach it governments must realize social problems and try to solve them and achieve collectivity benefit. Digital dashboards are a common feature of an Executive Information System (EIS) that integrate information from multiple components and tailor the information to individual preferences;they commonly be employed to assist managers to identify the status of key information or critical factors of success. The author's purpose in the present article is implementation of this concept in order to help authorities to take advantages of IT Digital dashboards can use as a tool for link goals to strategies. The most important object is to realize that which information must be included in digital dashboards and how must this information be shown so that we reach the best information in minimum time. Since governments make macro, strategic decisions, they face huge and diverse data and information. Using IT and its capabilities will help to prevent from losing data and information as well as inexpensive data processing, because it does not look for everything available, it only looks for key performance indicators (KPI)s. Digital dashboards include important information so it is necessary to describe different availability levels for different users so that electronic reliance can be reached. Result of this article shows that if digital dashboards are designed and implemented correctly, the results will be: Accountability, rapidity in decision making, accessing information within large data sets, and analyzing that information for managing performance. Being inexpensive in overall administrative costs and moving across real goals instead of superficial goals such as maintenance of employees and image of power as the origin of their stability- are other advantages.","[Aliy, Nastaran] Univ Tehran, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran,"Aliy, N (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Tehran, Iran.",nastaran.aliy@ut.ac.ir,"Aliy, Nastaran/AAW-7618-2021",,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9173-2,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,12.0,,,,,,207,211,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392895700037,0

Furthermore, native views about immigration are known to vary by gender. Yet, most surveys do not inquire native men and women about their views with regards to the two distinct immigrant groups, thus impeding an analysis of differences in preferences toward legal and undocumented immigrants from the same sample of natives. Using a recent San Diego County survey, we examine differences in native male and female opinions with regard to legal and undocumented immigration and their determinants. Native preferences toward immigration appear to significantly differ by gender as well as according to immigrants' legal status. In addition, public finance and welfare concerns are among the key factors driving native male and female preferences toward legal and undocumented immigration. However, native women's attitudes are also impacted by concerns regarding the social integration and economic assimilation of undocumented immigrants possibly related to the alleged prejudice factor.

Laboratory subjects (university students) play the roles of firms whose generic product requires a specific input or permits. Scarcity is exogenously introduced by a fixed supply of tradable production permits. Three treatments are compared: No fee imposed (N); a fixed tax per permit (T); and partial retraction of permits and subsequent redistribution by auction (A). Treatments T and A represent two different ways of imposing fees, which are designed to be revenue equivalent. Our results indicate that, after controlling for deviation of permit prices from a prediction based on fundamentals, fees have an impact on distribution of permits. Interestingly, a fixed tax enhances efficiency compared to the case of no fees while retraction and reallocation by auction tends to reduce efficiency. Apparently, subjects' decision making is affected by the imposition of fees, but how and to what extent depends on the method used.","[Baldursson, Fridrik Mar; Sturluson, Jon Thor] Reykjavik Univ, Sch Business, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",Reykjavik University,"Baldursson, FM (通讯作者)，Reykjavik Univ, Sch Business, Menntavegur 1, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",fmb@ru.is; jonthor@ru.is,"Sturluson, Jon Thor/AAR-1558-2020; Baldursson, Fridrik M/C-7343-2008","Sturluson, Jon Thor/0000-0001-7625-7935; Baldursson, Fridrik/0000-0002-5921-7517",,,,,29,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The analysis is based on a sample of the first 100 companies (NYSE quoted) of the Top 500 Fortune, except for the companies in the investment funds and insurances field. In order to test and validate the work hypotheses (H-1: the level of the audit fees is mainly influenced by the company's capacity to continue its activity; H-2: the prestige of the audited company contributes to the decrease of the audit fees; H-3: the reduced fees level, paid by the customer audited by one of the Big4 companies in this exercise, contributes to the future prestige increase), the linear regression analysis (simple and multiple) and the variance analysis (ANOVA) have been used as methods of data analysis. As a result of hypothesis testing it was found a circular causality, bidirectional, on the level of the relationship between audit fees and financial performance.

Using annual data from 1980 to 2007, we examine the relevance of the argument that economies continue to add to their existing reserves stock in order to keep up with the Joneses. We find strong evidence of presence of the Joneses effect. The effect is robust to the inclusion of traditional determinants of reserve accumulation as well as region specific factors including commodity exports that set the Latin American economies apart from other emerging economies.

However, firms in proportional-electoral countries that cross-list in majoritarian system countries, tend to pay out higher dividends and the negative relation between growth potential and dividend payout tend to be stronger than their peers that do not cross-list. For a few countries that changed their electoral system towards a more proportional system, we observe a decrease in dividend payout ratio and a weaker relation between growth and dividends after the change. Overall these results indicate that a country's political system affects the severity of agency problems. Further, the effect of legal origin on dividend policy reverses once we include the political economy variables in the regressions. We also document that the electoral system not only affects the amount of dividends paid by a firm but also the form of payment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve the aim of the research, the research methodology included both quantitative and qualitative data. The questionnaire survey was developed and the primary aims were to determine the current state of ABC adoption and implementation. In the second stage, semi-structured interviews were used to determine the factors influence to ABC adoption and implementation. The analysis of the data was run by using both within company and cross-company analysis. Three criteria were used to determine the adoption and implementation rate of ABC. They are adopters, implementers, and users or implementers. The main findings indicate that ABC implementation among Jordanian manufacturing companies is about 19.5% based on the third criteria i.e. implementers or users. The results from semi-structured interviews show that fashion, forced decision, fad and efficiency are factors associated directly with the implementation decision in Jordanian manufacturing companies. Following factors namely top management support, non-accounting ownership, higher information technology, education, globalization of consumer, increased competition, growing costs, allocation problems, inability of the traditional cost systems to provide relevant information in the new environment and financial crisis facilitate and motivate the implementation of ABC. Results from semi-structured interviews with 13 companies show that the barriers and problems of ABC relate to behavioral and technical issues.","[Fadzil, Faudziah Hanim Bt] Univ Utara Malaysia, Othman Yeop Abdullah Grad Sch Business, Sintok, Malaysia; [Rababah, Abedalqader] Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Changlun, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Fadzil, FHB (通讯作者)，Univ Utara Malaysia, Othman Yeop Abdullah Grad Sch Business, Sintok, Malaysia.",fhanim@uum.edu.my; Abedra_1981@yahoo.com,"Rababah, Abedalqader/AAF-3754-2021","Rababah, abedalqader/0000-0003-3574-3309",,,,,51,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,635,+,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550000059,0

In this paper, the activity space concept was used to identify the nature of participation in activities (or lack of it) amongst a group of students using a 2 day travel-activity diary. Three different indicators such as the number of unique locations visited, average daily distance travelled, and average daily activity duration were used to measure the size of activity spaces. These indicators reflect levels of accessibility, personal mobility, and the extent of participation, respectively. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess the impacts of students socio-economic status and the spatial characteristics of home location. Although no differences were found in the levels of accessibility and the extent of participation measures, home location with respect to a demand responsive transport (DRT) service was found to be the most important determinant of their mobility patterns. Despite being able to travel longer distances, students who live outside of the DRT service area were found to be temporally excluded from some opportunities. Student activity spaces were also visualised within a GIS environment and a spatial analysis was conducted to underpin the evaluation of the performance of the DRT. This approach was also used to identify the activity spaces of individuals that are geographically excluded from the service. Evaluation of these results indicated that although the service currently covers areas of high demand, 90% of the activity spaces remained un-served by the DRT service. Using this data six new routes were designed to meet the coverage goal of public transport based on a measure of network impedance based on inverse activity density. Following assessment of public transport service coverage, the study was extended using a spatial multi criteria evaluation (SMCE) technique to assess the effect of service provision on patronage.

Data were collected through questionnaires administered to a sample group of 198 junior high students and 198 senior high students. A Likert scale was employed to assess the level of importance of factors involved in choosing a cram school and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the differences in factors' degree of importance between junior high and senior high students. The results showed that the teaching-learning factor and location factor influence both groups' choice of cram school. This study suggests that cram school entrepreneurs should use student evaluations of teachers, academic content, and other services as feedback tools to improve the quality of cram schools, which in turn will benefit both students and the entrepreneurs' businesses.

By quantifying the increases in EU butter and Skim Milk Powder (SMP) price volatility, this chapter demonstrates one of the consequences of the more recent reforms of EU dairy policy. Comparison with comparable world prices also provides an indication of how this volatility might evolve. This analysis employs a number of techniques to quantify the increased volatility from the simple and intuitive to more complex time series models (GARCH).

We analyze data from the California Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, and the National Association of Latino Elected Officials (NALEO), as well as a survey of all superintendents, board members, and a sample of principals in school districts in Central California. We include all unified, elementary, and high school districts that were open in the 2003-2004 academic year (325 districts), concentrating on the years 1995-2004. We find a positive relationship between Latino representation and the proportion of Latino students. However, it is not until Latinos are the overwhelming majority of the district, well over 60% of the students, that we see increased numbers of Latinos on school boards. In addition, the system by which school board members are elected to office is strongly associated with Latino representation, even when we account for the size of the Latino population and party affiliation. Furthermore, the system of electing board members appears to influence local policy. The findings of this study point towards potential changes in policy with changes in Latino representation on school boards.","[Reyes, Belinda I.] San Francisco State Univ, Cesar E Chavez Inst, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Reyes, BI (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, Cesar E Chavez Inst, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",reyesb@sfsu.edu; neiman@ppic.org,,,California Policy Research Center (CRPC),California Policy Research Center (CRPC),"The authors would like to thank Joaquin Avila for his contribution to this report.

We allow property rights to improve as the country transforms natural resources into capital. The ensuing power struggle about the control of resources is solved as a non-cooperative differential game. Prices of resources and depletion increase faster than suggested by the Hotelling rule, especially with many competing factions and less secure property rights. As a result, the country substitutes away from resources to capital too rapidly and invests more than predicted by the Hartwick rule. The theory suggests that power struggle boosts output but depresses aggregate consumption and welfare, especially in highly fractionalized countries with less secure property rights. Also, adjusted net saving estimates calculated by the World Bank using market prices over-estimate welfare-based measures of genuine saving. Since our theory suggests that genuine saving is zero while empirically they are negative in resource-rich, fractionalized countries, we suggest ways of resolving this puzzle.","[van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, CEPR, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Amsterdam, CESifo, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Oxford; University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; University of Amsterdam,"van der Ploeg, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,48,10,10,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

However, many its issues still need to be solved. For instance the theory does not give exact answer to why particular institutions (formal and informal norms) occur, change and cease to exist. The paper tries to solve the topic through the model of establishing and disrupting institutional equilibrium in redistribution systems. People live their whole lives in redistribution systems and they can be members of a winning coalition and receive some redistribution or they are out of coalition and the redistribution is made to their detriment. The members of a winning coalition are not, however, automatically guaranteed ongoing membership. So they have interest to establish a structure of institutions (institutional equilibrium) helping them to protect their position. The paper divides redistribution into two kinds: necessary and unnecessary redistribution. The process of creating a winning coalition in a redistribution system is described and it is shown how institutions help to facilitate the process. Then the paper defines the institutional equilibrium (IEQ) and its conditions. They are explained the connections between IEQ and redistribution systems, the conditions when is convenient for some players endeavour to create a equilibrium, the reasons why IEQ does not occur. The theory of institutional change is hereto used - if somebody endeavours to create a IEQ, (s)he also realizes a institutional change.","Univ Finance & Adm, CZ-10100 Prague 10, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Wawrosz, P (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, CZ-10100 Prague 10, Czech Republic.",wawrosz@mail.vsfs.cz,"Wawrosz, Petr/GSN-1037-2022","Wawrosz, Petr/0000-0001-8283-4428",,,,,60,4,4,0,11,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Our goal, in this paper, is to study the financial accelerator role of these countercyclical margins as a propagation mechanism of macroeconomic shocks. To do so, we apply the deep habits framework in Ravn, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe (2006) to financial markets to model this hold-up effect within a monopolistically competitive banking industry. We are able to reproduce the pattern of price-cost margins observed in the data, and to show that the real effects of aggregate total factor productivity shocks are larger the stronger the friction implied by borrower hold-up. Also, output, investment, and employment all become more volatile than in a standard model with constant margins in credit markets. An empirical contribution of our work is to provide structural estimates of the deep habits parameters for financial markets.","[Aliaga-Diaz, Roger] Vanguard Grp Inc, Malvern, PA USA; [Olivero, Maria Pia] Drexel Univ, Dept Econ, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA USA","The Vanguard Group, Inc.; Drexel University","Aliaga-Díaz, R (通讯作者)，Vanguard Grp Inc, Malvern, PA USA.",roger_aliaga-diaz@vanguard.com; maria.olivero@drexel.edu,,,,,,,39,21,27,1,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We offer a model that demonstrates how such a policy can evolve endogenously in equilibrium. An informed manager who cares about the firm's intrinsic value as well as short-term stock price allocates earnings between investments and dividends. We show that there is a continuum of equilibria in which the dividend is constant for a range of realized earnings. Compared with the standard separating equilibrium, this partial pooling behavior induces higher firm value and lower underinvestment. We offer new empirical implications relating the pooling nature of dividend stickiness to the information environment of the firm, dividend prediction models, managerial incentives, and investment.","[Kadan, Ohad] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Guttman, Ilan] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kandel, Eugene] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Business Adm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Kandel, Eugene] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Washington University (WUSTL); Stanford University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Kadan, O (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",kadan@wustl.edu,,,,,,,60,69,78,1,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

A key finding is that stronger creditor protection in reorganization improves judicial incentives to resolve financial distress efficiently, preventing a race to the bottom toward inefficient uses of judicial discretion.

First, are conventional measures of market structure (e.g. geographic market size and deposit concentration) related to bank competition for small firm financial business? Second, does an increase in bank competition produce an improvement in bank services irrespective of market structure? To answer these questions we use a survey of small firm owners that asks them to report on changes in bank competition for their business. Our findings show that reports of increased competition by small firm owners are negatively related to the level of and change in deposit concentration. In addition, we find a significant positive association between changes in bank competition reported by small firms and their reports of changes in banking outcomes (e.g. service quality) that is independent of deposit concentration, firm risk, and credit usage.

We find that both auditor type and auditor industry specialization moderate benchmark-beating (loss-avoidance and just-meeting-or-beating prior year's earnings) behavior in banks. In addition, we find that once auditor type and auditor industry specialization are included in the same tests, only auditor industry specialization has a significant impact on constraining benchmark-beating behavior.

Various measures of fiscal decentralisation, several of them novel in this context, are employed in a cross-country econometric model to test established and more recent hypotheses. Paying careful attention to variable measurement, model specification and sample coverage, the results suggest that there are significant relationships between fiscal decentralisation and income, as well as a range of other factors. However, these relationships may be more complicated than previously reported. For the entire large sample of countries, and for the OECD subsample, a positive relationship between income and decentralisation is found. This corroborates the results found in earlier studies. However, for the middle- and lower-income nations, higher income is found to be associated with less decentralisation.","[Bodman, Philip; Hodge, Andrew] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Bodman, P (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",p.bodman@uq.edu.au; a.hodge@uq.edu.au,"Hodge, Andrew/C-4779-2014","Hodge, Andrew/0000-0002-7203-9233",,,,,54,37,39,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

To frame the discussion, the author relies on an analysis that emphasizes two possible long-run steady states for the economy: one that is consistent with monetary policy as it has typically been implemented in the United States in recent years and one that is consistent with the low nominal interest rate, deflationary regime observed in Japan during the same period. The data considered seem to be quite consistent with the two steady-state possibilities. The author describes and critiques seven stories that are told in monetary policy circles regarding this analysis and emphasizes two main conclusions: (i) The Federal Open Market Committee's extended period language may be increasing the probability of a Japanese-style outcome for the United States and (ii), on balance, the U.S. quantitative easing program offers the best tool to avoid such an outcome.

A provincial analysis, taking the case of the Province of Ontario in Canada, is warranted given that the country's highly decentralized system puts provincial policies at the forefront in meeting this challenge. The paper evaluates the important progress made in this policy area and stressed the need to go beyond the traditional policy focus on the less able-bodied elderly and consider the increased heterogeneity of the elderly population with respect to lifestyle, preferences, resources, health and physical abilities. While significant efforts have been made, a more explicit recognition of population aging in Ontario's transport policy motivation that could strongly influence transport strategies and investments attuned to the mobility concerns in an aging society remains to be seen.

The COGARCH model is a continuous-time analogue to the discrete-time GARCH model and captures many of the stylized facts of financial time series, as has been shown in various papers. Principles for the estimation of point processes by MCMC are adapted to the special structure of the COGARCH(1,1) model. The algorithm uses discrete GARCH-type equations on a random grid which changes in each iteration of the MCMC sampler. Moreover, exact solutions of the volatility SDE of the COGARCH(1,1) model are available on this grid, so that no approximations of the COGARCH equations are necessary. The method is also applicable to irregularly spaced observations. A simulation study illustrates the quality of the MCMC estimates.

Asset-Backed Commercial Paper during the Financial Crisis of 2007-09,IMF ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The global imbalance explanation of the financial crisis of 2007-09 suggests that demand for riskless assets from countries with current account surpluses created fragility in countries with current account deficits, most notably in the United States. This paper examines this explanation by analyzing the geography of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits set up by large commercial banks. The paper shows that banks in surplus countries as well as banks in deficit countries manufactured riskless assets, totaling over $ 1.2 trillion, by selling short-term ABCP to risk-averse investors, predominantly U. S. money market funds, and investing the proceeds primarily in long-term U. S. assets. As negative information about U. S. assets became apparent in August 2007, banks in both surplus and deficit countries experienced difficulties in rolling over ABCP and as a result suffered significant losses. The paper concludes that global banking flows, rather than global imbalances, determined the geography of the financial crisis.

J,"Hunt, RM",,,,"Hunt, Robert M.",,,BUSINESS METHOD PATENTS AND US FINANCIAL SERVICES,CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INNOVATION,"A decade after the State Street decision, more than 1,000 business method patents are granted each year. Yet, only 1 in 10 is obtained by a financial institution. Most business method patents are also software patents. Have these patents increased innovation in financial services? To address this question, we construct new indicators of research and development intensity based on the occupational composition of financial industries. The financial sector appears more research intensive than official statistics would suggest but less than the private economy taken as a whole. There is considerable variation across industries but little apparent trend. There does not appear to be an obvious effect from business method patents on the sector's research intensity. Looking ahead, three factors suggest that the patent system may affect financial services as it has electronics: (1) the sector's heavy reliance on information technology, (2) the importance of standard setting, and (3) the strong network effects exhibited in many areas of finance. Even today litigation is not uncommon; we sketch a number of significant examples affecting financial exchanges and consumer payments. The legal environment is changing quickly. We review a number of important federal court decisions that will affect how business method patents are obtained and enforced. We also review a number of proposals under consideration in the U.S. Congress.

Our method allows for the close examination of the interpolation parameter on a rigorous theoretical footing instead of empirical regression. The method can be adapted to general diffusion processes as long as quick and accurate pricing methods exist for the corresponding European and perpetual American options. The American option price is shown to be approximately equal to an interpolation of two European option prices with the interpolation weight proportional to a perpetual American option. In the Black-Scholes model, our method achieves the same efficiency as the quadratic approximation of Barone-Adesi and Whaley in J Financ 42: 301-320 (1987), with our method being generally more accurate for out-of-the-money and long-maturity options. When applied to Heston's stochastic volatility model, our method is shown to be extremely efficient and fairly accurate.","Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Management, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Li, MQ (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Management, 800 W Peachtree St, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.",minqiang.li@mgt.gatech.edu,"Li, Minqiang/A-8465-2009","Li, Minqiang/0000-0002-8590-8186",,,,,74,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Border trade alone implies an incentive to set the domestic alcohol tax below the marginal social damage of alcohol, and to tax (subsidize) commodities that are complementary with (substitutable for) alcohol. The income tax will also be used as a corrective instrument. Furthermore, although the effects of adding illegal production are ambiguous in general, a realistic outcome is, nevertheless, that it reduces both the optimal alcohol tax and the marginal income tax rate.","[Sjogren, Tomas] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Sjögren, T (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",tomas.sjogren@econ.umu.se,,,,,,,24,4,4,0,14,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2010,66.0,2,,,,,153,169,,10.1628/001522110X524197,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,643SY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281320500004,0

These external stimuli may be used to manipulate consumerism and purchasing behaviour against the legitimate interests of consumers. The article requires a structured approach to researching consumer behaviour but also the quality of life. The aim is to draw attention to the rational behaviour of people often forced to choose between the quality of a product and the satisfying the immediate, individual need. The motivational projectivity of the behaviour of the consumer's self carries a particular strength on the individual who lets him/herself involved in a challenging source whose outcome is the selective orientation towards the source of attraction, ensuring thus the guiding of behaviour in accordance with the irradiation of the source. Identifying the numerous variables that lead to the appearance of the idea of acquisition determines the change in the polarity centre which is made up of predispositions that are at the base of the product receptivity and thus the purchase suggestion. Loyalty for products creates certain tense conditions in a universe of uncertainty of choice consequently offering certain stability in time. Quality of products may trigger an increase in the individual health, as well as the society he/she belongs to. Health is life, and a life in which the choice of the best for individual and the enterprise he/she comes from leads to absolutisation, then one can say that they have accomplished the task of giving a chance to succeed to the generations to come.","HYPERION Univ, Bucharest, Romania",,"Burghelea, C (通讯作者)，HYPERION Univ, Bucharest, Romania.",crystachy@yahoo.com,,,,,,,12,7,7,0,12,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,12.0,28,,,,,479,491,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279314000016,0

Explanatory meta-regression (robust fixed effects and random effects), that can explain about 70% of the heterogeneity in the literature, suggests that results published by some authors might consistently differ from the mainstream output and that study outcomes are systematically dependent on study design (usage of panel data, short- or long-run nature, number of countries in the data set).","[Havranek, Tomas] Czech Natl Bank, Econ Res & Financial Stabil Dept, Prague 11503 1, Czech Republic; [Havranek, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank; Charles University Prague,"Havránek, T (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, Econ Res & Financial Stabil Dept, Prikope 28, Prague 11503 1, Czech Republic.",tomas.havranek@ies-prague.org,"Havranek, Tomas/M-8888-2015","Havranek, Tomas/0000-0002-3158-2539",,,,,91,66,70,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We obtain data from a large investor in private equity funds, with detailed records on 238 funds raised between 1993 and 2006. We build a model to estimate the expected revenue to managers as a function of their investor contracts, and we test how this estimated revenue varies across the characteristics of our sample funds. Among our sample funds, about two-thirds of expected revenue comes from fixed-revenue components that are not sensitive to performance. We find sharp differences between venture capital ( VC) and buyout (BO) funds. BO managers build on their prior experience by increasing the size of their funds faster than VC managers do. This leads to significantly higher revenue per partner and per professional in later BO funds. The results suggest that the BO business is more scalable than the VC business and that past success has a differential impact on the terms of their future funds.","[Metrick, Andrew] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Yasuda, Ayako] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Yale University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Metrick, A (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Management, 135 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",metrick@yale.edu; asyasuda@ucdavis.edu,"Yasuda, Ayako/E-8547-2010; Metrick, Andrew/B-9296-2008","Metrick, Andrew/0000-0002-7930-9830",,,,,41,218,253,4,98,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Moreover, banks exposed to local financial contagion adjusted the liquidity of their portfolio mainly by actively selling and buying their securities in the financial market.

Government policy is currently one of the major constraints. In 2006, a proposed industry strategy was drafted. One of the main topics in this draft is the proposed blending percentages, namely, 8 per cent for bio-diesel and 10 per cent for ethanol. This would affect the South African animal feed industry, because Dried Distillers Grain with Solubles (DDGS) is a by-product of ethanol production from maize. The effects can be seen by applying the Agricultural Products Requirement (APR) minimum feed cost formulation model. According to the APR model, the total cost of animal feeds would decline at various blending percentages. Consumption of protein-rich raw materials declined most markedly at a 10 per cent blending of ethanol. These raw materials are mostly oil cake, which is currently imported from various countries. Some animals used more DDGS than others in their diets. According to this study, broilers used the most DDGS.","[Strydom, D. B.; Taljaard, P. R.; Willemse, B.

We find no clear evidence that either conditional volatility or unconditional volatility in January is predominantly higher across the sampling years. Hence, against the proposition, the January effect is not due to risk per se. Rather, we find strong evidence that the January effect is due to higher compensation for risk in the month. This may be possible if investors have an increasing RRA utility function. Although many studies find that volatility tends to be higher in January, we find it to be period-specific and mostly in value-weighted return series, but not in equal-weighted return series.

It contends that neo-liberalism in Turkish agriculture since the 1980s represents the abandonment of the nationalist project that underlined state policies in industry and agriculture between 1930 and the late 1970s. Neo-liberal policies implemented since 1980 have consolidated the stronghold of transnational agribusiness companies in Turkish agriculture. In cooperation with the World Bank, the EU and the WTO, the Turkish state has been preparing the necessary conditions for transnational agribusiness firms to control Turkish agriculture. Since 1999, the Turkish state has introduced fundamental institutional changes to ensure the smooth internationalization of Turkish agriculture, which has inevitably led to the impoverishment of the rural masses and to the abandonment of agriculture by small- and medium-sized households.","Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Ctr Dev Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Aydin, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Ctr Dev Studies, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",z.aydin@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,77,76,87,1,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The first concerns the political role and extent of East India patronage in Scotland between 1720 and 1784. The second relates to the 'fortunes' amassed by those in receipt of such patronage, the amounts remitted to Scotland, and the use to which these remitted surpluses were put. With respect to the former, a substantive, original contribution is made in four respects: in demonstrating the significance of colonial posts in overall patronage in Scotland; in showing the heavily disproportionate favouring of Scots in this patronage; in revealing that this was substantial and growing from the 1720s (and did not start only in the 1780s or 1770s, as has been previously assumed); and in arguing convincingly that this East India patronage was important in securing the post-1707 British state. This is a considerable achievement. While the first issue has an impressively substantive outcome, the second, no less important, set of questions, is argued presumptively: to the effect that large fortunes were made by Scots in India, significant amounts were remitted, and these were crucial in the dramatic economic advance in Scotland from the 1750s on, especially in the countryside. A plausible presumptive case is made, but this is not supported by convincing evidence. There is a need for research of the intensity that gave such impressive shape to the first set of issues, if the presumptive case is to be adequately substantiated. A brief agenda for the necessary research on agrarian change is suggested.","[Byres, Terence J.] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Byres, Terence J.] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Dev Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Byres, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",tb1@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,2,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

To do so, we begin with a simple theoretical model and test the impacts of technological innovation (treatment) on innovating firms (treated) by employing propensity score matching techniques.

However, this result was not observed for the mark-up. Especially, the net revenue reflects more robustly the impacts of the innovations. Quantitatively speaking, innovating firms experienced a 10.8-12.5 percentage points (p.p. henceforth) higher growth on employment, a 18.1-21.7 p.p. higher growth on the net revenue, a 10.8-11.9 p.p. higher growth on labor productivity, a 11.8-12.0 p.p. higher growth on capital productivity, and a 19.9-24.3 p.p. higher growth on their market share, relative to the average of the non-innovating firms in the control group. It was also observed that the conjunction of product and process innovations, relative to other forms of innovation, presents the stronger impacts on the performance of Brazilian firms.","[Kannebley, Sergio, Jr.] Univ Sao Paulo, BR-14040900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Sekkel, Julia Valeri] Interamer Dialogue, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Araujo, Bruno C.] IPEA Inst Appl Econ Res, DISET Directorate Sectoral Studies, BR-70076900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada (IPEA),"Kannebley, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Av Bandeirantes 3900, BR-14040900 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",skj@usp.br; julia@sekkel.com; bruno.araujo@ipea.gov.br,"Júnior, Sérgio Kannebley/F-9423-2015","Kannebley, Sergio Junior/0000-0003-3389-3354",,,,,14,13,16,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The objective of this study therefore was to evaluate the economic performance of this dairy establishment in the marginal zones. Three approaches were used for the evaluation: the stochastic cost frontier to determine inefficiencies and the causative institutional and socio-economic factors; cost-factor demand systems; and the supply response analyses to determine the elasticity estimates of policy variables. The results from these approaches are supplementary and seem to support the need for government interventions in institutional and socio-economic factors that have a high public good component in order to expand dairy establishment in the marginal zones.,"[Kavoi, M.

Against this background, the present paper evaluates the real-world effects of this directive. The directive has left a loophole by providing grandfathering (exemption from withholding tax) for some securities. In this paper, we compare the pre-tax returns of exempt bonds and comparable taxable bonds. If working around the Savings Directive is difficult for income tax evaders in Europe, then investors should be willing to pay a premium for bonds that are exempt from the withholding rate. Conversely, if such a premium is absent, then this suggests that the supply of existing loopholes (exempt bonds included) is large enough to allow tax evaders to continue evasion at no additional cost. The findings of our study are in line with this latter interpretation.","[Klautke, Tina; Weichenrieder, Alfons J.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Weichenrieder, Alfons J.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Oxford,"Klautke, T (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.",t.klautke@econ.uni-frankfurt.de; a.weichenrieder@em.uni-frankfurt.de,"Weichenrieder, Alfons J/J-9407-2012",,,,,,14,8,9,0,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We indicate, among other things, that a restriction on multinational investment may lower the unemployment rate and increase the total employment in the host country.

Our estimates for Bulgaria and Romania support the hypothesis that the growth of available finance might harm banking performance and deteriorate NPL dynamics, most probably due to the overheating of economies. Since we confirmed that the dynamics of net exports of these economies deteriorated the NPL ratio, the weakening of growth in export-oriented industries could lead to economic contraction with a direct impact on the sustainability of banking-sector results in these countries. Large current account deficits are typical for emerging markets and do not pose a problem as long as they are caused by the importing of capital goods, and, if future export growth is strong enough to reimburse foreign debt. Structural dependence on external financing - which is in part a by-product of the effect of low levels of internal saving - have led to large current account deficits and financial instability.","[Kavkler, Alenka] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia; EIPF, Inst Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Maribor; Institute for Economic Research - Slovenia,"Kavkler, A (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia.",alenka.kavkler@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,40,7,7,0,16,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2010,12.0,27,,,,,199,213,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,558MP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274747700015,0

Parental hands-on mentoring of financial skills was most strongly related to lower levels of credit card debt and this relationship was partially mediated by it leading to greater financial delay of gratification and less impulsive credit card purchasing which in turn were related to less problematic credit card use. Having parents who struggled with debt was not significantly related to debt although having parents who avoided talking about finances predicted problematic credit card use. Students' beliefs that their parents would bail them out of debt were related to lower levels of debt. Financial knowledge and parental verbal instruction appear to have complex relationships to credit card debt. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For positions (instruments and sub-portfolios), this problem has been well studied, and a significant theory built, around the calculation of marginal contributions. We consider the problem of determining the contributions to portfolio risk of risk factors. This cannot be addressed through an immediate extension of techniques for position contributions, since the portfolio loss is a nonlinear function of the risk factors. We employ the Hoeffding decomposition of the portfolio loss into a sum of terms depending on the factors. This decomposition restores linearity, but includes terms arising from joint effects of groups of factors. These cross-factor terms provide information to risk managers, since they can be viewed as best hedges of the portfolio loss involving instruments of increasing complexity. We illustrate the technique on multi-factor portfolio credit risk models, where systematic factors represent industries, geographical sectors, etc. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It poses the question: why do rural-urban migrant households settled in urban China have an average happiness score lower than rural households? Three basic hypotheses are examined: migrants had false expectations about their future urban conditions, or about their future urban aspirations, or about their future selves. Estimated happiness functions and decomposition analyses, based on a 2002 national household survey, indicate that certain features of migrant conditions make for unhappiness, and that their high aspirations in relation to achievement, influenced by their new reference groups, also make for unhappiness. Although the possibility of selection bias among migrants cannot be ruled out, it is apparently difficult for migrants to form unbiased expectations about life in a new and different world.

The land market has been identified in the literature as crucial for farm growth. In various studies, developments are driven by assumptions about the effects of scale and the initial heterogeneity of farms. In contrast, the present paper focuses on the potential role of opportunistic and future behaviour for the development of different farm strategies. In order to demonstrate the potentially crucial role of strategic behaviour, we introduce a thought experiment and focus on the theoretical case of identical farms. In the light of ideas from theories about oligopolistic markets, two central problems of decision-making are identified: the coordination problem of farm exits and the problem of strategic choices made by the remaining farms. This paper supplements explanations that argue on the basis of farms' heterogeneity in that it offers an approach to the question of why farms might not overcome their short-term constraints in order to realise strategic advantages in competition.","Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Rural Studies, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Margarian, A (通讯作者)，Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Rural Studies, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",anne.margarian@vti.bund.de,,,,,,,59,5,5,0,5,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

In this paper, we examine the market implications of setting a housing price to income ratio target for a market segment by the government. The policy requires active intervention by the government with regard to the targeted sector. We use a simple model of the housing market with a homeownership affordability target to derive the market implications of such targets. In the presence of uncertainty and resource constraints, the objective of homeownership affordability is achieved for the targeted group at the expense of greater volatility in residential construction activity. When the size of the targeted sector is significant in size, there are spillover price and crowding out effects on the non-targeted housing market segment. This results in political pressure on the government to expand homeownership affordability targets to increasing segments of the population. Housing price to income ratios tend to be fairly constant over time and across targeted groups, the housing supply is relatively price inelastic and the income elasticity of housing demand is less than one. The Singapore government intervenes extensively in the housing sector to ensure homeownership affordability, with a resulting homeownership rate of 91 percent for the resident population. The above hypotheses regarding the implications of setting housing price to income ratio targets are tested using the Singapore housing market. The experience and data for Singapore were found to support the above hypotheses.","[Phang, Sock-Yong] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore Management University,,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,6,CHINA ARCHITECTURE & BUILDING PRESS,BEIJING,"BAIWANZHUANG XICHENGGU, BEIJING, 10037, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-112-12328-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,143,155,,,,,,13,Economics; Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,BRM62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283112400010,0

This paper reports findings from longitudinal analyses of the German nation-wide travel Survey KONTIV for the period 1976-2002. It focuses on travel mode choice, subdivided by distance categories, and also takes car availability and city size into account. In addition, trends in car availability itself are examined by city size categories. The results indicate that even within the same distance categories car use has considerably increased. In some cases bicycle use has increased as well. Gains in the use of the private car are mainly at the expense of trips on foot and by public transport. Accordingly, the shift in modal split towards the car is not (only) caused by increasing trip distances but took place even within distance classes. Once car availability is taken into account, the modal shifts appear to be considerably weaker. This suggests that once car availability is held constant the decision rationales of mode choice for a certain trip distance have remained relatively stable. The increase in motorisation over the study period was considerably weaker in large cities than in small towns, although the cities started from a lower level in the 1970s. Thus, the motorisation divide between cities on the one hand, and suburban and rural areas on the other hand has become ever wider. For travel mode choice, the picture is similar. What is more, the results suggest that even car owners are more inclined to walk a given distance in the cities than in small towns, even more so if they live in a central urban area. The built environment, thus, appears to have a strong impact on whether an available car is used or not. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the EU directives and the national energy efficiency action plans require reduction of energy consumption especially in buildings. However, these changes made in new buildings affect the energy consumption very slowly because the building stock is only being renewed at the rate of 2% per year. Thus, it is crucial to take the renewal of existing buildings into account in order to speed up the reduction of energy consumption. Building regulations are good for influencing new construction but for the existing buildings, this can be very problematic. Regulations for existing buildings often cause uneconomical renovations, and the implementation of new building regulations can sometimes be even impossible. Building owners cannot be forced to make large investments just to make the buildings more energy efficient because most of the times the life cycle costs are unprofitable. Also the energy renovation itself causes a large amount of energy consumption which takes a very long time to save back via the energy savings made in the buildings. Therefore, there are two ways to influence the energy efficiency of existing buildings: via regulations or lifecycle costs. Regulations should be used only when renovating a building anyway,so the economic and environmental impact would be the smallest possible. The more preferred way is to use lifecycle costs to show the actual economic impact of energy efficient renovations. So there will be also economic interests for the building owner to make energy efficient renovations. Lifecycle cost comparison should be made between the regular non-energy efficient and the energy efficient renovation. As a result, this research indicates that in most of the cases energy efficient renovation is a more economic solution compared to normal renovation, although it usually is higher at the investment costs.","[Tuomo, Lindstedt; Juha-Matti, Junnonen] Aalto Univ, Dept Struct Engn & Bldg Technol, Sch Sci & Technol, Aalto, Finland",Aalto University,,tuomo.lindstedt@tkk.fi; juha-matti.junnonen@tkk.fi,,,,,,,8,0,1,0,15,CHINA ARCHITECTURE & BUILDING PRESS,BEIJING,"BAIWANZHUANG XICHENGGU, BEIJING, 10037, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-112-12328-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,377,389,,,,,,13,Economics; Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,BRM62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283112400027,0

We show that conclusions concerning diversification based solely on constant correlations across markets can be misleading, since the diversification benefits are time-varying, are affected by non-normality, and depend on the benchmark (country) employed.

The objective of this paper is to study the role of environmental performance in the profile of corporate social responsibility as perceived by consumers. We utilize a stated preference approach to the study of consumer's preferences. This approach allows for the evaluation in monetary terms of the trade-offs that individuals can make between various aspects of corporate policy decisions, including the extent of environmental performance. The data is modelled by means of a mixture heuristics approach that allows us to study the utilization of various decision rules in the choice of products with various degrees of environmental performance. The results show that the linear compensatory heuristic is the most extended across individuals and these subjects value most the policies concerned with environmental management. Those subjects opting for the non-compensatory decision rule tend to focus on the attribute of good labour relations as the most salient factor defining corporate social responsibility. In addition, policy measures are relatively more valued for some products rather than for others, suggesting that consumers discriminate between products when valuing companies' environmental profiles.","[Arana, Jorge E.; Leon, Carmelo J.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Appl Econ Anal, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Araña, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Appl Econ Anal, Edificio Econ Modulo D, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",jarana@daea.ulpgc.es; cleon@daea.ulpgc.es,"Araña, Jorge E./D-1139-2011","Araña, Jorge E./0000-0003-0878-9934",,,,,26,11,14,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

On the contrary, if the probability of a 'yes' is ex-ante perceived as less likely, the traditional sector opposes the EU reform process.

We implement the tests in a novel international data set on bilateral holdings of equity, bonds, foreign direct investment (FDI) and bank loans. In our data, high foreign capital holdings are associated with international consumption risk sharing as implied by our theory. This is especially true of investment in equity or bonds, but not of foreign direct investment or bank loans. In our model, the implication is that transaction costs are higher for FDI and international loans. The discrepancy could reflect technological differences, but also the prospect of expropriation, perhaps most stringent for FDI or loans. We argue that expropriation risk is endogenous to both the borrower's institutions and its openness to international markets. The detrimental impact of poor institutions is muted in open economies , where the possibility of subsequent exclusion from world markets deters expropriation of foreign capital. We show the implied effects of institutions prevail in both the cross-section of consumption risk sharing and in observed international investment patterns. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, decision-makers also draw on personally-salient, reflexive experiences not explicitly mentioned in the experimental task as inputs, which heretofore have not been investigated systematically. Further, interpretive approaches that might reveal such experiences generally have not been applied in the analysis of value judgments. Therefore, we study value construction processes in three types of preference reversal problems using written protocols. Our results demonstrate that task-based explanations for preference reversals are inversely weakened relative to the problems' complexity, while reflexive, experiential thoughts are increased. As such, the current approach provides new insight into the preference construction process and indicates some alternative reflexive factors and reference points that influence choice. The results also highlight that for any particular choice problem there exist distinct segments of decision-makers who differ in their value construction processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The insured aims to maximize his expected utility of terminal wealth, under the constraint that the insurer wishes to control the VaR of his terminal wealth to be maintained below a prespecified level. It is shown that when the insurer's VaR constraint is binding, the solution to the problem is not linear, but piecewise linear deductible, and the insured's optimal expected utility will increase as the insurer becomes more risk-tolerant. Basak and Shapiro (2001) showed that VaR risk managers often choose larger risk exposures to risky assets. We draw a similar conclusion in this paper. It is shown that when the insured has an exponential utility function, optimal insurance based on VaR constraint causes the insurer to suffer larger losses than optimal insurance without insurer's risk constraint.

Growth is driven by the development of both (i) idiosyncratic R&D innovations and (ii) general innovations that can be freely adopted by many firms. Firm-level volatility is affected primarily by the Schumpeterian dynamics associated with the development of R&D innovations. The variance of aggregate productivity growth is driven by the arrival rate of general innovations. Ceteris paribus, the share of resources spent on development of general innovations increases with the stability of the market share of the industry leader. As market shares become less persistent, the model predicts an endogenous shift in the allocation of resources from the development of general innovations to the development of R&D innovations. This results in an increase in R&D, an increase in firm-level volatility, and a decline in aggregate volatility. The effect on productivity growth is ambiguous. On the empirical side, this paper presents new cross-country evidence that R&D subsidies are not significantly associated with higher growth but are associated with lower aggregate volatility. It also documents an upward trend in the instability of market shares, a positive association between firm volatility and R&D spending, and a negative association across sectors between R&D and how correlated the sector is with the rest of the economy.

The paper argues that increasing availability and accessibility of investment opportunities in the financial markets help real sector firms sustain profit margins despite market rigidities, increasing goods market competition, or higher levels of risks. The empirical results based on dynamic panel estimations show that increasing macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility have a significantly negative effect on firm profitability. In contrast, increasing the share of financial investments in total assets is found to be reducing such negative effects at a statistically and economically significant level.","Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Demir, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Hester Hall,729 Elm Ave, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",fdemir@ou.edu,,"Demir, Firat/0000-0002-5063-7670",,,,,50,44,48,4,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The dynamic optimization problem is solved for the political intervention of the central government in an intersectoral population distribution with taxes and subsidies. Our analysis provides the following results: (i) a big-push policy that leads an economy to a higher-income steady state with urbanization is not necessarily desirable if the government cannot borrow money at a sufficiently low interest rate; (ii) in order to sustain an appropriate urbanization speed. urbanization control policy should have a switch: the urban sector should be subsidized in order to accelerate rural-urban migration in early stages of development, and taxed to decelerate and eventually cease the migration in later stages.

Understanding distances between places is a fundamental task for the geographer, while the representation of distances constitutes one of the major functions of cartography. Among the types of maps invented to represent time-space, distorted projections were supplemented with time-space relief cartography in the 1990s. This paper proposes a representation of the time-space relief of the USA considering terrestrial and air modes. This constitutes a key innovation in this type of cartography, giving the possibility of creating a representation of global time-space. The metaphors associated with the images proposed are then discussed evoking the shrinking, the crumpling and finally the shrivelling of time-space. The shrivelling metaphor takes account of the complicated contraction/expansion movement that high-speed transport impacts on space and allows for a rich interpretation of the time-space relief map of the USA in the perspective of the processes of globalisation and metropolitanization.

Firstly, we analyse the important question of the differentiated nature of what is called affect in the psychological literature. Our review presents the different methods used recently by some economists in order to measure the valence of emotions or to induce bad or good moods to their subjects before the beginning of the games. Secondly, we analyze the behavioural impact of incidental emotions in experimental economics, We focus on the role of affect in risky behaviour and social games (cooperation, negotiation, trust). Our review shows the crucial role of intentions, anticipations, emotion expressions, as well as unconscious processes or judgment biases, in observed behaviours in the laboratory. Thirdly, we examine the first attempts of introduction of the role of affects in economic behavioural theory (inter temporal choice, social preferences models).","Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, GREThA, UMR, F-33608 Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Petit, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, GREThA, UMR, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",emmanuel.petit@u-bordeaux4.fr,,,,,,,160,6,6,1,30,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

A Vector Auto Regression (VAR) of flows and returns shows that the behavior of fund investors is more consistent with contrarian rather than momentum characteristics. Past fund flows have a positive impact on future fund returns, with the long-term information effect dominating the transient price-pressure effect. Seasonality in daily flows, such as day-of-week and day-of-month patterns are present, and daily flows are generally mean-reverting. Probit regressions indicate that fund investment objective, marketing policy and level of active management explain cross-sectional variation in the behavioral patterns displayed in daily flows. Our results are robust to the different methods of calculating daily flows based on whether or not the day-end TNA figures include the current-day's flow. Throughout the analysis, we contrast the dynamics of daily flows with established results for monthly fund flows and find important differences between the two. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We take these as evidence in favor of the explanatory power of the model.

I propose a novel explanation for this phenomenon: the sharp increase in market competition worldwide, which reduces prices and profits and drives firms into the shadow economy. Empirical evidence from a panel covering 45 countries from 1995 to 2000 shows that increased competition is indeed correlated with an expansion of the underground economy. The effect is strongest in low-tax, high-corruption countries that do not provide the public services which make it worthwhile for firms to remain official despite growing competitive pressure.

In this article, upgrading is approached more broadly as reaching a better deal, including a balance between rewards and risk. The case study of South African wine shows that better product quality, improved processes, and some functional upgrading have co-existed with processes of downgrading, higher risks, and limited rewards, especially in traditional export markets.

We assess empirical evidence for two sets of theories that allow for endogenous variation in the slope of the short-run Phillips curve. At an empirical level, we examine why large negative output gaps in Japan in the late 1990s did not lead to accelerating deflation but instead coincided with stable, albeit moderately negative inflation. Our results suggest that this episode is most convincingly interpreted as reflecting a gradual flattening of the Phillips curve. We find that this flattening is best explained by models with endogenous price durations. These models imply that in any economy where trend inflation is substantially lower (or substantially higher) today than in past decades, time variation in the slope of the Phillips curve has become too important to ignore.",,,,Emmanuel.deVeirman@rbnz.govt.nz,,,,,,,48,19,19,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Specifically, we study the effects of aggregation in the labor markets on the distribution of employment and inflation pressures, where there are differences in market structures and transmission mechanisms underpinned by relatively immobile labor. To demonstrate these ideas, we take the European experience as a laboratory to show what can be expected from globalization in the labor markets in practice. Using models of wage leadership vs. locational competition, we examine the extent and strength of aggregation effects on labor market costs using a sample of data from 1983 to 2007 which covers the period of the creation of the Euro. We find that the aggregation effect has decreased significantly since the start of EMU, improving the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. At the same time, while Germany played an important role in the run-up to EMU in terms of wage leader, its role has now decreased and been replaced by globalization forces. This implies increased locational competition in terms of wage formation. We demonstrate this with the emerging role of the US as the benchmark for wage setting in Europe.

Based on these models, we hypothesize that returns in the home (U.S.) market on high-volume days are more likely to continue to spill over into the U.S. (home) market for those cross-listed stocks subject to the risk of greater informed trading.

We show theoretically that intertemporal trade-offs between interest income taxation and the cost of external finance determine optimal savings.

Consistent with theory, we estimate negative propensities to save out of cash flow. We also find that income uncertainty affects saving more than do external finance constraints.

The main contribution of this article is to provide a quantitative. and comparative assessment of two approaches to potential Output measurement, namely DSGE and PFA, in an integrated framework. The authors find that medium-term fluctuations in potential Output measured by the PFA are likely to result from a large variety of shocks, real or nominal.

Welfare analysis is applied to investigate the performance of such schemes relative to alternative investment strategies such as fixed-mix policies. We carry out this analysis in the context of a broad family Of utility functions, which takes into account the possible presence of two benchmark levels corresponding to a minimum guaranty and to full indexation, respectively. For the put-pose of comparability, we construct a self-financing continuous-time implementation of the conditional indexation scheme. The implementation involves continual adjustment of the parameters of the contingent claim representing final payoff. Our findings indicate that, in situations where large weight is placed oil the benchmark levels, conditional indexation is fairly close to being optimal.","[Dai, Renxiang; Schumacher, J.

Considering a tax and benefit system with benefit taper rates whereby some benefits are received by income groups other than those at the bottom of the distribution, it is suggested that a tax-free threshold is not a necessary requirement to achieve redistribution. Four alternative policy changes, each involving the elimination of the tax-free threshold in Australia and designed to achieve approximate revenue neutrality, were examined using the Melbourne Institute Tax and Transfer Simulator. A range of implications were examined, including labour supply responses to tax changes and the effects of policy changes on inequality and social welfare. The results demonstrate that it is possible to eliminate the tax-free threshold under approximate overall revenue and distribution neutrality, but that it is impossible to improve labour supply incentives at the same time. In order to achieve improved incentives, either revenue or distribution neutrality has to be sacrificed.","[Creedy, John] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Herault, Nicolas; Kalb, Guyonne] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Creedy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",jcreedy@unimelb.edu.au; nherault@unimelb.edu.au; g.kalb@unimelb.edu.au,"Herault, Nicolas/K-7080-2012; Kalb, Guyonne/H-7383-2015","Herault, Nicolas/0000-0003-2080-0390; Kalb, Guyonne/0000-0001-6582-8608",,,,,15,1,1,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We operationalize this distinction in the context of a new methodology for constructing affordability measures that draws on the value-at-risk concept and takes account of the whole distribution of household income and house prices rather than just the median. Empirically we find that the distinction between purchase and repayment affordability can be pronounced. In the Sydney prime mortgage market over the period 1996-2006, repayment affordability deteriorated very significantly while purchase affordability remained quite stable. This difference can be attributed to the loosening of credit constraints in the mortgage market which it seems has carried through primarily into higher house prices rather than an improvement in purchase affordability. We also show how median house-price-to-income ratio measures of affordability can be extended to take account of the whole distribution of income and house prices, and how as a result of differential skewness in the house price and income distributions the housing affordability problem may be significantly worse for lower income households than suggested by standard median measures.

Stricter bank entry requirements and more generous deposit insurance schemes, however, mitigate the influence of bank efficiency on market share and market concentration.","Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Sch Business & Econ, Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"González, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Sch Business & Econ, Ave Cristo, Oviedo, Spain.",fgonzale@uniovi.es,"Gonzalez, Francisco/H-1565-2015","Gonzalez, Francisco/0000-0002-8808-4434",,,,,26,25,27,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Building on Misina's study (2003), we first argue that the theoretical assumptions granting that the RAI correctly distinguishes between changes in risk and changes in risk aversion are very restrictive. Then, by comparing the RAI with a measure of risk aversion obtained from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), we find that the estimates are surprisingly similar. We prove that if the variance of returns is sufficiently smaller than the variance of asset riskiness, then RAI and CAPM provide essentially the same information about risk aversion. We also show, however, that RAI and CAPM suffer from exactly the same implementation problems - the main one being the difficulty in measuring ex-ante returns. At high and medium frequencies, the standard method of measuring ex-ante with ex-post returns may generate negative risk aversion and other inconsistencies.

Firms are not able to adjust continuously their prices. In this paper, we make a synthesis of the main microeconomic price setting theoretical models and of their empirical counterparts. Price rigidity is often justified by two models: a first one assumes that prices are time-dependent. At each period, a constant proportion of firms can change their prices. A lot of recent empirical works provide estimates of this proportion and evaluate its stability over time. A second model assumes that prices are state-dependent. Firms have to pay an adjustment cost each time they change their price and it can be optimal to differ a price change. These adjustments costs are empirically measured and recent studies focus on the impact of these menu costs on the inflation process.

Surprisingly, a benchmark calibration implies an optimal inflation rate of -1.9 percent. The analysis also shows that trend inflation has important effects on the economy when combined with nominal contracts and real output growth. Steady-state output and welfare losses are quantitatively important even for low values of trend inflation. Further, nominal wage contracting is found to be quantitatively more important than nominal price contracting in generating the results. This conclusion does not arise from price dispersion per se, but from an effect of nominal Output growth on the optimal markup of monopolistically competitive labour Suppliers. Finally, accounting for productivity growth is found to be important for calculating the welfare costs of inflation. Indeed, the presence of 2 percent productivity growth increases the welfare costs of inflation in the benchmark specification by a factor Of four relative to the no-growth case.

Although no alternative factor drives out the money growth factor, the conditioning CAY factors of Lettau and Ludvigson (2001b) add explanatory power.","[Balvers, Ronald J.] W Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Huang, Dayong] Univ N Carolina, Bryan Sch Business & Econ, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA",West Virginia University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Balvers, RJ (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",rbalvers@wvu.edu; d_huang@uncg.edu,"Balvers, Ronald/AAT-5976-2021","Balvers, Ronald/0000-0002-5285-6084",,,,,47,19,27,2,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Financial development enables the financial system to allocate capital to its most productive uses and is crucial to the success of an economy. Financial globalization encourages financial development by weakening the power of groups such as government and entrenched private special interests, which have much to lose from an efficient financial system, and by encouraging support for institutional reforms to make the financial system work better. On the other hand, financial globalization, if it is not managed properly, has a dark side and can lead to financial crises that cause much economic hardship. Getting financial globalization to work well is no easy task and requires policies that promote property rights and good-quality financial information that encourage effective prudential supervision, and that promote a stable macroeconomic environment. Although these policies need to be home-grown, international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can create incentives to promote these policies in emerging market countries. Citizens in advanced countries can also help by supporting the opening up of their markets to goods and services from poorer countries, and thereby encourage expansion of their export sectors, which creates increased support for financial development and less vulnerability to financial crises.

In the South, pollution is abated by both private producers and the public sector. The North suffers from cross-border pollution from the South. The policy instruments are foreign aid for the North, and funds for public abatement, emission tax rate, and a tax on foreign capital, for the South. We characterize the Nash equilibrium under two scenarios: foreign investment is (i) exogenous, and (ii) endogenous. Under (i), we examine the effect of a reform where both foreign investment and aid are changed in an income-neutral way. In the latter case, we analyze the effect of a tax-induced change in foreign investment on pollution.

In this paper, we apply and extend Glaeser and Gyourko's methodology in order to estimate the regulatory tax on an individual house level in a set of Florida metropolitan areas. Our novel data address some of the quality measurement concerns raised about the Glaeser and Gyourko methodology and allow us to look at the evolution of the regulatory tax over a 10-year period. We find that the tax is an important component of sales price and that as a percentage of sales price has increased in a majority of Florida's MSAs. In addition, we decompose the overall house price increase into land, materials and regulatory components and find that increasing stringency in the regulatory environment within Florida represents a substantial portion of the run-up in house prices in most metropolitan areas.

An Interstate Comparison,FISCAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,R&D; tax credit; income apportionment; tax policy; H25; H71; O38,BASIC RESEARCH; PRODUCTIVITY; FIRM,"As of 2005, 31 US states offered corporate income tax credits on research and development (R&D) expenses in order to encourage more in-state innovation activities. Empirical questions about the efficacy of such tax breaks at the state level persist, in part because the complexity of the tax laws means that simple credit-rate comparisons across states do not fully capture the differential variation in effective after-tax price incentives firms face in choosing where to locate R&D activities. We are unaware of any research analysing and comparing the effective prices of R&D faced by firms, across all US states and utilising micro-level data. Using data extracted from detailed reading of individual firms' 10-K and S-1 filings and of state-level tax credit rules, we estimate the effective after-tax price of basic and qualified research expenditure each firm would have faced in each of the 50 states had they been located there. Our methodology simulates the effective tax price of each firm's marginal dollar of research expenditure, assuming the firm chose to move all of its R&D operations to each of the 49 other states. Through Monte Carlo techniques, we consider the sensitivity of our interstate comparative results to several modelling assumptions. We find significant variation in after-tax R&D prices across states with quite different R&D tax laws. Prices range from $0.176 to $0.520 on a marginal dollar of R&D in Virginia and Washington State, respectively. We also find that the interstate variability is generally more important - indeed, much wider than we had anticipated before investigating state-by-state regulations - than the inter-firm variability within states.","[Paff, Lolita] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Watkins, Todd A.] Lehigh Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Lehigh University,"Paff, L (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",lap21@psu.edu; watkins@lehigh.edu,,"Watkins, Todd A./0000-0001-8264-0420",,,,,22,1,1,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

However, the context of rural poverty has been changing across the world, with high growth in some economies and stagnation in others. Furthermore, increased openness in many economies has affected the specific role of agricultural growth for rural poverty reduction. This paper revisits an 'old' question: how does growth and poverty reduction come about if most of the poor live in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture? What is the role of agricultural and rural development in this respect? Focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa, and using economic theory and the available evidence, the author comes to the conclusion that changing contexts has meant that agricultural growth is only crucial as an engine for growth in particular settings, more specifically in landlocked, resource-poor countries, which are often also characterized by relatively low potential for agriculture. However, extensive market failures in key factor markets and likely spatial effects give a remaining crucial role for rural development policies, including focusing on agriculture, to assist the inclusion of the rural poor in growth and development. How to overcome these market failures remains a key issue for further research.","[Dercon, Stefan] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Dercon, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",stefan.dercon@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,69,82,100,0,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Estimates are based on a conditional risk-set model. The study relies on an original database regarding Finnish SPs: 252 firms that in the year 2002 were located in the Parks and the firms' lifetime patenting activity, over a 33-year-period.

Even if coded knowledge is easier to diffuse, the role of tacit knowledge is often essential for being able to use coded knowledge. Coded knowledge can even be unusable without the augmentation of tacit knowledge. The role of organizational culture is highly relevant for tacit knowledge sharing, which is social activity, face-to-face interaction and therefore can be influenced only through culture. This paper represents a theoretical research about how the types of organizational culture according to the Competitive Values Framework model are supportive for tacit knowledge sharing. The Competing Values Framework consists of four culture types: clan, adhocracy, market and hierarchy. Clan culture is found to support tacit knowledge sharing all, factors described refer to clan culture values and description. Adhocracy culture is the second culture type most supporting tacit knowledge sharing. Market and hierarchy hardly do so, and organizations willing to increase tacit knowledge sharing will have to increase the presence in their culture of clan and adhocracy types. These findings provide with insights, which put us closer to better understanding what factors to use to change organization in the direction of high tacit knowledge sharing. The article does not claim the final truthfulness of these conclusions, but more calls for further practical research to validate or disclaim them as well as provide with the extent of validity of these conclusions, which the author will carry out.

However, the literature has yet to find evidence of such services from the pricing of sovereign bank loans. The research on the pricing of sovereign bank loans has focused on interest spreads alone, while the pricing structure typically includes an up-front fee, as well. In this paper. I explore empirically the economic motivations for such a pricing structure. I find that up-front fees are explained by the probability of renegotiation and by proxies for informational problems. My findings provide evidence that the unique pricing structure of bank loans helps banks provide sovereign borrowers with renegotiation services. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the pace of transition has led to variation across the Country in the level of development. In this paper, We use panel data for the Chinese provinces to study the role of legal institutions. financial deepening and political pluralism on growth rates. The most important institutional developments for a transition economy are the emergence and legalization of the market economy, the establishment of secure property rights, the growth of a private sector, the development of financial sector institutions and markets, and the liberalization of political institutions. We develop measures of these phenomena, which are used as explanatory variables in regression models to explain provincial GDP growth rates. Our evidence suggests that the development of financial markets, legal environment, awareness of property rights and political pluralism are associated with stronger growth. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The high incentive of the first innovator may dominate the potentially negative incentives of subsequent innovations.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper takes an institutional approach. It compares the situation in China and Germany, looking into the regulatory framework of both countries and identifying the winners and losers of the conversion process, which are different in both countries. Finally some alternative institutional designs are proposed. Findings - In both countries, the winners are well organized groups, which work hand in hand with local governments. The costs of land conversion are externalised and shifted to poorly organized groups or to society as a whole. Therefore, the problems related to farmland conversion are, first and foremost, problems of market failure. To resolve them, we propose such instruments as suitable leasehold or land tax systems which are able to internalize the externalized costs. And to consider the relevant social aspects, it may be useful also to set up some kind of redistribution system. Research limitations / implications - The paper only provides a rough analysis of the situation. It does not discuss detailed questions such as how to design the proposed tools. Further research is necessary, particularly regarding the institutional embedding of the proposed tools. Originality/value - The paper draws on ideas that were discussed and advanced by the European and American land reform movements; these ideas have often been ignored by economists and politicians. Nevertheless, it does not suggest that these ideas should be applied like a ready-made solution without making careful adaptations. Rather, they may serve as a guideline in order to assess the consequences for politicians.","Univ Appl Sci Trier, Trier, Germany",,"Löhr, D (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Trier, Trier, Germany.",d.loehr@umwelt-campus.de,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,,,,,2009,,,,,,,347,361,,,,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BME64,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272028800025,0

Many economists believe that extensive clusterization is one of the main instruments to stimulate the growth of regional economies. Moreover, it is also seen as a force to develop and introduce them into the global markets. Traditions and existing business patters dominate in the formation of various interorganizational relations: industrial regions, business systems, science and technology parks, competence networks, associations, partnerships, clusters, etc. It must be emphasized that all of the aforementioned business structures have at least one thing in common - they are designed to seek after maximum benefits (profits, added value, etc.) through the combination of competition and cooperation, also known as coo-petition. Competitive companies inside a cluster contribute to the growing competitiveness of economic sectors, regional and national economies. The competitiveness of cluster companies lies on their productivity, innovativeness and ingenious business solutions. The latter benefits appear as a result of knowledge, skills, competencies, information, know-how, and resources exchange among the companies that belong to the same cluster. Coo-petition also works as a stimulus in the processes of increasing innovation and efficiency. The formation of clusters can be observed all over the world. Regions that are characterized by large conglomerations of cluster companies play the role of economy catalysts. The aim of this study is to analyze the importance and weight of regional clusters in the context of regional economy development. In order to achieve the aim of the study the following objectives have been set: 1) to investigate and systematize different aspects of cluster influence on competitiveness; 2) to analyze the competitive role of clusters on the company, economic sector, regional and national levels; 3) to systematize and evaluate the advanced experience (practice) of developed countries in the formation of regional clusters. The study has been carried out, using the scientific research methods of systematic-logical analysis, and synthesis. It can be deduced that cluster companies can serve as innovators, initiators, competitors, and information carriers. Thus, the concentration of companies in urban and rural regions is a factor of increasing social and economic welfare, for they induce the creation of new jobs, growth of investment and revenue. The formation and development of clusters should become an integrative part of regional and macroeconomic policies of all developing countries.","[Navickas, Valentinas; Malakauskaite, Asta] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ & Int Trade, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,,valentinas.navickas@ktu.lt; asta.malakauskaite@stud.ktu.lt,"Navickas, Valentinas/AAC-9651-2019; Navickas, Valentinas/I-9119-2018; Navickas, Valentinas/GPX-0310-2022","Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410; Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410",,,,,16,2,2,0,8,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,253,259,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000028,0

While trying to attract more customers, organizations have to adopt some particular tactics of customer relationship management. However, in case of sport, the customer relationship management can be transformed to sponsor relationship management. Considering the relationships between the organization and its sponsors, some conjunctive elements are necessary. One of the elements is sport sponsorship. The interest in sport sponsorship as a marketing tool is growing worldwide, and it is becoming a natural component of sport. In order to manage relationship with sponsors, some particular mechanism or system is necessary.

This paper proposes a simple no-arbitrage based lease pricing model, and estimates it using a large proprietary data set of leases on several property types. We also define a new measure, the Option-Adjusted Lease Spread, or OALS (analogous to an option's implied volatility, or a mortgage-backed security's Option-Adjusted Spread), that allows us to compare leases with different maturities and contract terms on a consistent basis. We find sizeable pricing errors that cannot be explained using interest rates, lease maturity, or information on the options embedded in the contracts. This suggests either that there are significant mispricings in the market for real estate leases, or that lease terms depend heavily on unobservable, property-specific characteristics.","[Stanton, Richard; Wallace, Nancy] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Stanton, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",stanton@haas.berkeley.edu; wallace@haas.berkeley.edu,"Stanton, Richard/AAW-2551-2021","Stanton, Richard/0000-0003-1222-6763",,,,,32,11,13,0,11,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

In fact, fiscal policy can be conceived only as a mixture between the methods of procurement of resources available to the state and those regarding the destinations that are given to these resources, in the performance of its functions and tasks. Fiscal policy represents the aggregate of decisions that are taken in order to achieve the structural modeling of the tax system, the guarantee of its functioning in order to accomplish the desired aims in economics by the public decision-making person. Therefore, fiscal policy is a component of the state financial policy, including all the regulations on the establishment and collecting of taxes and materializing the state's options about taxes, also the decisions concerning public expenses that are financed. But, its components must be concerted with those of the budgetary or monetary policy, also of the price policy and the employment policy etc., so that they become integrated into the general policy. When it comes to taxation, European policy has two major components: direct taxation - which is the responsibility of member states and indirect taxation, which affects the free movement of goods and services. Member states have already taken measures to prevent tax evasion and double taxation, and European policy in this area aims to ensure that on the home market the competition is not distorted by differences between the systems and the installments of indirect taxation. Moreover, measures have been taken to prevent the negative effects of competition in taxation, which may arise in case of assets transfers between EU member states.","[Tuncu, George-Florin] Constantin Brancoveanu Univ, Fac Management Mkt Econ Business, Rm Valcea, Romania",Constantin Brancoveanu University,,tun_flo@Yahoo.com; lumizamfirescu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,645,652,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000099,0

Next we compare the welfare effects of fuel economy standards and fuel taxes and discuss whether these two types of policies can be complementary.

In this paper, we explore the extent to which the nascent growth is sustainable or not due to higher incidences of terrorism and commodity price declines. Our analysis is based on a rich unbalanced panel data set with annual observations on 46 countries from 1968 to 2004. We explore these data with cross-sectional and panel growth regression analysis and quantile regressions. We estimate the economic and statistical effect of terrorism on growth in sub-Saharan Africa, controlling for a variety of other factors. We then investigate the extent to which there appears to be a structural break in the estimated relationships. We find that the terrorist-oriented fragility of sub-Sahara has increased in the most recent period. We find that most of the fragility can be explained by the growth in countries that are primary fuel exporters. Indeed, our evidence points to the fact that resource-rich countries have not done an adequate job of investing in counter-terrorist policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In a dual-system perspective, when proposers are cognitively constrained and thus their deliberative capacity is reduced, their offers are more likely to be influenced by spontaneous affective reactions. We find that under time pressure proposers make higher offers. This increase appears not to be explained by more reliance on an equality heuristic. Analysing the behaviour of the same individual in both roles leads us to favour the strategic over the other-regarding explanation for the observed increase in offers. In contrast, proposers who are under cognitive load do not behave differently from proposers who are not. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We also show that in the absence of estimation risk, the unconditional backtest is affected by model misspecification but the independence test is not. We propose using resampling methods to implement robust backtests. Our experiments suggest that block-bootstrap outperforms subsampling methods in size accuracy. We carry out a Monte Carlo study to see the importance of model risk in finite samples for location-scale models that are incorrectly specified but correct on average .

The concept of mean-preserving, spread-reducing (MPSR) effort is introduced to model the broker's activities. Using the first-order approach, it is shown that under some common conditions, the insured may concavify the reward function to induce the risk-neutral agent to exert MPSR brokering effort.

We demonstrate an additional bias (overconditioning) that can occur any time an empiricist estimates risk using information, such as a realized beta, that is not available to investors ex ante. Calibrating to U.S. equity returns, volatility timing and overconditioning can plausibly impact alphas more than market timing, which has been the focus of prior literature. To correct market- and volatility-timing biases without overconditioning, we show that incorporating realized betas into instrumental variables estimators is effective. Empirically, instrumentation reduces momentum alphas by 20-40%. Overconditioned alphas overstate performance by up to 2.5 times.

We consider the provision of wood and non-wood forest products, recreation and passive use services, and carbon sequestration. The valuation framework derives per hectare estimates by applying meta-analysis, value-transfer and scaling-up procedures in order to control for the existing heterogeneities across world regions and forest biomes. The first part of the study estimates stock values per hectare for each forest ecosystem service in the baseline year 2000 and in the year 2050. Results differ per geographical region and biome. Carbon stocks represent, on average, the highest value per hectare, followed by provisioning services, passive use and recreational values respectively. The second part provides an estimation of the welfare loss (or gain) associated with policy inaction in the period 2000-2050 leading to a change in the forest area. Welfare results are mixed and require a careful interpretation, ranging from a worldwide annual benefit of + 0.03% of 2050 GDP to an annual loss of -0.13%. The highest damage is expected in Brazil due to the increasing deforestation taking place in tropical natural forests, which is causing a considerable loss of carbon stocks.","[Chiabai, Aline; Markandya, Anil] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Spain; [Travisi, Chiara M.] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei FEEM, Milan, Italy; [Markandya, Anil] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Ding, Helen] Univ Padua, Dept Agr & Nat Resources, Padua, Italy; [Nunes, Paulo A.

Toward this aim, we employ a rich data set of detailed imports to individual EU-15 countries from 140 non-EU exporters, covering the period 1962-2006. Using these data, we both perform a thorough descriptive analysis of the duration of EU trade, and test the data in a regression analysis, using discrete-time duration models with proper controls for unobserved heterogeneity. Some interesting empirical findings emerge in our analysis. First, we find that EU imports from the rest of the world are very short-lived. The median duration of EU imports is merely 1 year. Moreover, almost 60% of all spells cease during the first year of service, and less than 10% survive the first 10 years. Second, we find that short duration is a persistent characteristic of trade throughout the extended time period that we study. Third, we find a set of statistically significant determinants of the duration of trade. Among the more interesting determinants is export diversification, which-both in terms of the number of products exported and the number of markets served with the given product-substantially lowers the hazard of trade flows dying. For instance, exporting a particular product to ten rather than one EU markets increases the probability of surviving the first year of trade in any given trade relationship by as much as 31 percentage points (from 33 to 64%).","[Hess, Wolfgang; Persson, Maria] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Hess, Wolfgang] Lund Univ, Ctr Econ Demog, Lund, Sweden; [Persson, Maria] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Persson, M (通讯作者)，POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",maria.persson@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,39,60,69,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The CPS could reflect the relative importance of the CEO as well as the extent to which the CEO is able to extracts rents. We find that, controlling for all standard controls, CPS is negatively associated with firm value as measured by industry-adjusted Tobin's q. CPS also has a rich set of relations with firms' behavior and performance. In particular, CPS is correlated with lower (industry-adjusted) accounting profitability, lower stock returns accompanying acquisitions announced by the firm and higher likelihood of a negative stock return accompanying such announcements, higher odds of the CEO receiving a lucky option grant at the lowest price of the month, lower performance sensitivity of CEO turnover, and lower stock market returns accompanying the filing of proxy statements for periods when CPS increases. Taken together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that higher CPS is associated with agency problems and indicate that CPS can provide a useful tool for studying the performance and behavior of firms.
