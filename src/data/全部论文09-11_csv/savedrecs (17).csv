With or without friction, the competitive equilibrium is efficient. Without friction, the market price is completely determined by the marginal production cost. If friction is present, no matter how small, then the market price fluctuates between zero and the choke-up price, without any tendency to converge to the marginal production cost, exhibiting considerable volatility. The distribution of the gains from trading in an efficient allocation may be skewed in favor of the supplier, although every player in the market is a price taker.","[Cho, In-Koo] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Meyn, Sean P.] Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Chicago, IL 60680 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Cho, IK (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",inkoocho@uiuc.edu; meyn@control.csl.uiuc.edu,,,,,,,31,26,37,0,14,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Larger markets, in the sense of more people or more open trade, support a larger variety of goods, resulting in a more crowded product space. This raises the price elasticity of demand and lowers markups. Firms, therefore, become larger to break even. This facilitates process innovation, as larger firms can amortize R&D costs over more goods. We demonstrate this mechanism in a standard model of process and product innovation. In doing so, we question some important results in the new trade and endogenous growth literatures.","[Parente, Stephen L.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; CEPR, Madrid, Spain",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Parente, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, David Kinley Hall,Box 64,1407 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",parente@illinois.edu,,"DESMET, KLAUS/0000-0002-8206-845X",,,,,44,53,61,4,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

In fact, the players may further benefit from commitments that are conditional on the commitments of others. This paper proposes a model of conditional commitments that unifies earlier models while avoiding circularities that often arise in such models. A commitment folk theorem shows that the potential of voluntary conditional commitments is essentially unlimited. All feasible and individually rational payoffs of a two-person strategic game can be attained at the equilibria of one (universal) commitment game that uses simple commitment devices. The commitments are voluntary in the sense that each player maintains the option of playing the game without commitment, as originally defined. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We assume that household preferences are biased towards the goods produced within the country. We use this setup to show how the degree of financial integration and the home bias affect the welfare efficiency of fiscal policy. This is particularly important for the implications of a fiscal policy launched by a member of the euro zone where the home bias is in a decreasing trend due to higher goods market integration and where there are explicit efforts to enhance financial integration. The results show in particular how the effects of an increasing financial integration on the impact of a fiscal policy can be mitigated or amplified by a decreasing home-product bias. Moreover, under certain conditions, the degree of financial integration has no effect on the welfare efficiency of fiscal policy despite its non-negligible effects on the components of welfare.

Thus, our results show that, in the absence of certain match variations, the newly designed student-optimal algorithm adopted by the NRMP since 1998 either may be bias in favor of hospitals in terms of the true preferences or fails to produce a true stable matching.

In this model, we endogenize both the currency of liability denomination and the currency of export pricing. We show that a key factor that affects firms' dollarization decisions is exchange rate policy. Twin dollarization is an optimal strategy for all firms when exchange rate flexibility is limited, which implies that a fixed exchange rate regime may lead to an equilibrium with twin dollarization. Furthermore, we find that twin dollarization can reduce the welfare loss caused by the fixed exchange rate regime, as it helps to cushion the economy against domestic nominal risk.

Critical cost gap determines that long-run degree of privatization is larger than the short-run one.

Depending on the measure of uncertainty used, investment may be stimulated or curtailed by the effects of uncertainty on its own or through its interactions on cash flow.","[Baum, Christopher F.] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Baum, Christopher F.] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Caglayan, Mustafa] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Talavera, Oleksandr] Robert Gordon Univ, Aberdeen Business Sch, Aberdeen AB9 1FR, Scotland",Boston College; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Sheffield; Robert Gordon University; University of Aberdeen,"Baum, CF (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",baum@bc.edu; m.caglayan@sheffield.ac.uk; o.talavera@rgu.ac.uk,"Baum, Christopher F/A-9424-2008; Talavera, Oleksandr/ABE-1913-2021; Baum, Christopher/B-4811-2011","Baum, Christopher F/0000-0003-4766-3699; Talavera, Oleksandr/0000-0002-4799-778X; Caglayan, Mustafa/0000-0002-1606-6501",,,,,47,56,62,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In our paper, we provide a systematic overview and discussion of Schumpeter's varied writings on unemployment, from 1908 to 1954. We compare his view with the positions of some of his contemporaries, such as Wicksell, Hicks, Beveridge and Keynes.

With this in mind, we examine two approaches to contest success functions (CSFs). In the first, we analyze the implications of contestants' incomplete information concerning the 'type' of the contest administrator. While in the case of two contestants this approach can rationalize prominent CSFs, we show that it runs into difficulties when there are more agents. Our second approach interprets CSFs as sharing rules and establishes a connection to bargaining and claims problems which is independent of the number of contestants. Both approaches provide foundations for popular CSFs and guidelines for the definition of new ones. The strategic approach also seeks to combine axiomatic cooperative solutions and non-cooperative solutions.

China needs to liberalize and open its financial system and make the RMB fully convertible, and to adopt a more flexible exchange rate system to speed up its currency internationalization, for which China could follow either a global or regional approach. The global approach is a riskier and more unpredictable strategy because it would demand a scope and timeframe of financial liberalization that is likely to be beyond China's institutional capacity over the coming decade. There are two options that could be taken in following the regional approach. One is creating an ASEAN+New 3 (the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) RMB bloc and the other is liberalizing China's financial industries and internationalizing the RMB by playing a leading role in East Asia's economic integration within the framework of ASEAN+3.

Review of Economic Studies 73, 195-218], firm-specific marginal cost shocks are not fully passed through to product prices. That is, in response to a firm-specific increase in marginal costs, prices rise, but by less than marginal costs leading to a decline in the firm-specific markup of prices over marginal costs. Pass-through is predicted to be even lower when shocks to marginal costs are anticipated by firms. In our model unanticipated firm-specific cost shocks lead to incomplete pass-through (or a decline in markups) of about 20 percent and anticipated cost shocks are associated with incomplete pass-through of about 50 percent. The model predicts that cost pass-through is increasing in the persistence of marginal cost shocks and U-shaped in the strength of habits. The relative-deep-habits model implies that conditional on marginal cost disturbances, prices are less volatile than marginal costs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we apply the choice experiment approach under both real (the laboratory experiment) and hypothetical (the field survey) environments to investigate how consumers value a food additive (sodium nitrite) present in ham sandwiches and whether the provision of information about sodium nitrite affects individuals' choice. The results suggest that in both real and hypothetical situations, participants do not favor the use of sodium nitrite, per se, regardless of whether or not the detailed information is provided. Moreover, the willingness to pay values for ham sandwiches without sodium nitrite are estimated to be lower in the experiment and higher in the survey after negative and positive information is provided, implying that the effect of information provision differs between these two environments. In addition, further investigation of the participants' reasons for choosing ham sandwiches indicates that the information related to flavor seems to have more influence on the consumers' choice behavior in a real situation, while the information associated with health risk is like to play a relatively more important role in a hypothetical situation.

Our indicators cover regional integration in trade, investment, financial assets, and people-to-people exchange. We also analyze measures of regional cooperation such as the density of free trade agreements and official policy dialogues. We find that in various Asian groupings, and especially in a group of 16 integrating Asian economies, interdependence in trade, direct investment, financial flows, and other forms of economic and social exchange has increased significantly over time, and now approaches that in the European Union. Nonetheless, Asia's official cooperation remains weak and formal regional institutions remain relatively underdeveloped. To provide insight into the causes of this discrepancy, we also develop quantitative measures of political and cultural similarity of nations, and find that Asian countries have relatively low levels of political and cultural proximity compared to regions such as Europe. The diversity of political interests and cultural values may have hindered more intense cooperation among Asian economies in the past. But if regional economic and social interactions continue to grow, requirements for joint decision-making are also likely to expand, leading to stronger frameworks of official cooperation.","[Capannelli, Giovanni] Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Mandaluyoung City, Metromanila, Philippines; [Lee, Jong-Wha] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyoung City, Metromanila, Philippines; [Petri, Peter A.] Brandeis Univ, Int Business Sch, Waltham, MA 02454 USA",Asian Development Bank; Asian Development Bank; Brandeis University,"Capannelli, G (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyoung City, Metromanila, Philippines.",gcapannelli@adb.org; jwlee@adb.org; ppetri@brandeis.edu,"Lee, Jong-Wha/I-1076-2016","Lee, Jong-Wha/0000-0002-3152-4961",,,,,24,13,17,0,32,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We use binary dictator games involving a choice between a relatively equitable allocation and an unfair allocation that is both less generous and makes the recipient's payment dependent oil a p = 0.5 lottery. Dictators choose the unfair option more frequently when the recipient's allocation depends on an ambiguous lottery than on a lottery with a known probability - even though the objective distributions of outcomes are identical under the two kinds of lotteries. Dictators' estimates of the expected value of the recipients' allocations are inflated under ambiguity, indicating that dictators form self-serving beliefs about ambiguity. Finally, increased unfair behavior under ambiguity is extinguished when dictators are constrained by their own initial unmotivated, and negative, attitudes towards ambiguity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In active monetary policy, changes in short-term interest rates are due to the exogenous actions of the central bank. Such a policy is successful only when economic agents in the money market are policy invariant in the sense that their behaviors are constant under interventions. Otherwise, an interest-rate-smoothing regime in which the central bank follows a rule-based policy is optimal. It was found that the coefficient of Fed funds rate in Treasury bill-Fed funds rates relationship is not policy invariant while the coefficient of the Treasury bill rate in Fed funds-Treasury bills rates relationship is policy invariant. Consequently, the optimal overnight monetary policy would be an interest-rate-smoothing process. it was found that such a policy has been followed in the United States. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

First, using the SupLM statistic, we report estimates of two thresholds for the three-regime model to explain the nonlinear dynamics in arbitrage of the S&P 500 index and futures. This provides empirical evidence of the no-arbitrage band predicted by the cost-of-carry model. Second, using quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, we demonstrate that those indexes that are located outside the no-arbitrage band are a nonlinear stationary process of mean-reversion to the no-arbitrage band. However, index and futures that are located within the no-arbitrage band are non-stationary. Third, we confirm an earlier finding that futures price leads the nonlinear mean-reverting behavior of the index but not vice versa. Impulse response function analysis and forecasting performance of three-regime error-correction model reinforce our findings and our estimation results are robust with different specifications of pricing error terms and endogenous variables.

In this model there is a strong second-mover advantage, so the lobbyist moving first will make offers to legislators only if he deters any credible counter-reaction from his opponent, i.e. if he anticipates winning the battle. Our main focus is on the calculation of the smallest budget that he needs to win the game and on the distribution of this budget across the legislators.

The appropriate technology theory extended with non-immediate spillovers is the theoretical framework used, while the decomposition analysis is carried out from a non-parametric approach. Obtained results point that high labour-productivity growth rates are mainly due to technical change and, to a lower extent, to capital intensification, while differences in speed of spillover assimilation has not been enough to shorten the existing distances to new frontiers (excluding USA). Policies that affect the incentives to invest in physical capital, as well as to create new knowledge and to favour the willingness to adapt to change are needed to foster labour-productivity growth in an industry that has a leading role for economic growth and social progress of nations in the 21st century.

In this paper, we focus on some determinants of internal migration in Poland. The choice of variables is guided by recent considerations about interregional migration in other transitional economies. The quantitative analysis of Polish migration flows has been performed by considering migration interactions over time. A dynamic version of an origin-constrained spatial interaction model is proposed. This approach relies on using the method of offsets, generalizing the Poisson regression framework, and applied to the calibration of spatial interaction models.","[Sarra, Anna Lina] Univ GAnnunzio, Dipartimento Metodi Quantitativi & Teoria Econ, I-65127 Pescara, Italy; [Del Signore, Mariarosaria] Dipartimento Econ & Storia Terr, I-65127 Pescara, Italy",,"Sarra, AL (通讯作者)，Univ GAnnunzio, Dipartimento Metodi Quantitativi & Teoria Econ, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy.",asarra@dmqte.unich.it; mariarosaria.delsignore@gmail.com,,"Sarra, Annalina/0000-0002-0974-0799",,,,,30,7,9,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

In terms of unobserved characteristics, we find positive selection in migration to be related to the alternatives of not working and local farm work, and negative selection to be related to local nonfarm work. Controlling for self-selection, the wage returns to gender (male), education and health are lower than those obtained from OLS, and the returns to experience are higher.

Funke and Strulik [2000. On endogenous growth with physical capital, human capital and product variety. European Economic Review 44, 491-515] suggest that the typical advanced economy follows three development phases, characterized in a temporal order by physical capital accumulation, human capital formation, and innovation, and that the transitional dynamics of the model reproduce such a sequencing. I argue that other sequences of the phases of development are possible and show that the model can generate a trajectory in which innovation precedes human capital formation. This trajectory accords with the observation that the rise in formal education followed with a considerable lag the process of industrialization. U.S. income and educational time series data are used to corroborate the innovation-education trajectory. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a flexible damped diffusion framework that is able to break many types of bubbles and preserve the martingale pricing approach. Damping can be done on either the diffusion or drift function. Oftentimes, certain solutions to the valuation PDE can be ruled out by requiring the solution to be a limit of martingale prices for damped diffusion models. Monte Carlo study shows that with finite time-series length, maximum likelihood estimation often fails to detect the damped diffusion function while fabricates nonlinear drift function.

Additionally to the voting manipulation, the participants learned that either they themselves or others would benefit from tax-financed projects. The results from both experiments suggest that voting, i.e., participation, increases cooperation.

This study claims that although capital flows may be required for the increase in output, other forces are causing this growth and creating the demand for capital. We construct a model in which growth requires both decisions of firms regarding training of managers in order to expand, representing the absorption capacity of the firms, and capital for the firms' expansion. The model shows that in early stages of development when output is low, capital inflows are increasing with an increase in the output, but are not the cause for the output growth. However, when output is higher, an increase in the output is associated with financial outflows since the local savings are increasing by more than the local demand for capital. Although we cannot empirically test the model, we use cross-country regressions to show that capital flows are in-line with the predictions of the model and manage to explain half of the variations in net FDI flows per capita using the stage of development. Many policies regarding capital flows may be, therefore, irrelevant.",,,,,,,,,,,47,2,2,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We analyze how sequentiality and its interaction with asymmetries across bidders and lots affect the sustainability of supplier/bidder collusion. Sequential procurement stabilizes supplier collusion (compared to simultaneous procurement) by allowing not only to identify or punish deviations within the sequence, but also to allocate the last lot to the bidder with the highest incentive to defect. We then analyze how to counteract these effects by exploiting (or creating) asymmetries in the value of lots, finding that the most effective policy procures the most valuable lot at the end of each sequence.","[Spagnolo, Giancarlo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, SITE, EIEF, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,,gianluigi.albano@tesoro.it; giancarlo.spagnolo@uniroma2.it,"Albano, Gian Luigi/O-7102-2019","SPAGNOLO, GIANCARLO/0000-0003-4117-6283",,,,,24,2,2,0,9,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

In contrast, nonlinear models with more elaborate mean-reverting components dominate at longer horizons especially when deviations from long-term equilibrium are large.

Within the model, the government builds a corporate tax function that defines the tax rate as a function of a 'desired' pollution level. The tax rate decreases as the 'desired' pollution level is higher. When the 'desired' pollution level is higher than the actual pollution level, production is subsidized and pollution levels rise.

The modelling of decisions included, as instruments, the valuation of the assets in risky conditions, theory of games and ARMA econometric model. The study concludes that in the early periods of economic crisis it is not the ease of tax administration (rescheduling, delays, exemptions) that leads to an effective policy but rather government policies that reduce the probability of bankruptcy among companies. Regarding the tax inspection, the model used leads to possibilities of profound analysis of the dimensions of the control activity and the design of a flat tax. Financial modelling of several tax administration decisions resulted in a procedure by Order of the President of the National Agency for Tax Administration (ANAF) no. 1126/2008 and therefore the use of flexible models must consider, even in the budgetary sector, besides increasing profitability on earnings also the risk of insolvency.","[Brojba, Laura-Cornelia; Dumitru, Corina-Graziella; Belciug, Adrian Vintilescu] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Brojba, LC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",laura_brojba@yahoo.com; corinnadumitru@yahoo.com; vintilescu_adrian@yahoo.com,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,8,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The analysis focuses on French data over the 1987 - 2006 period. This relationship is expressed in two ways: in terms of Marginal Propensity to Consume out of wealth (MPC) and in terms of Elasticity of consumption to wealth. Three concepts of consumption are investigated: total households consumption expenditure, consumption excluding financial services and consumption excluding durable goods. Different estimators are also considered. Based on the MPC approach, when considered as permanent by households, an increase (decrease) in total wealth of one euro would lead to an increase (decrease) of 1 cent in total consumption. In terms of elasticity, an increase (decrease) of 10% in wealth would imply also a relatively small impact of 0.8 to 1.1% on consumption depending on the concept of consumption considered. In most cases, the effect of a change in financial wealth is bigger than of a change in housing wealth. The results indicate that the wealth effects in France are smaller than in the UK and US but close to what is observed in Italy. In addition, any deviation of the variables from their common trends is corrected at first by adjustments in disposable income in line with what has been uncovered by studies on Germany and consistent with the saving for the rainy days approach of Campbell (1987).

J,"Chreptaviciene, V; Starkute, J",,,,"Chreptaviciene, Virginija; Starkute, Jovita",,,The Model of Cohesions between Career and Competence,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,career; contemporary and traditional career; competence; competence levels,,"In the concept of traditional career the success is measured by objective criteria (status, the position taken, obtained income, etc.). The contemporary success of career is defined by more subjective criteria - satisfaction with the activity performed, implementation of inner potential, implementation of life goals, etc. the realisation of the latter career is related to the quality of person's competence, its development, re-qualification. Only when possessing the competence of proper level, a person, according to Bridges (1994, will be able 'to change the course' in his / her life by considering market needs as well as the goals of personal self-realization. Environmental changes adjusted the system of organization's and employees' values, and especially the viewpoint to career. Contemporary career is treated as sequence of individual's roles based on the work, experience, increased responsibility (Baruch, 2006), regular interaction with other people, production of new knowledge and work forms as well as generation of ideas (Arthur, Rousseau, 2001), independence from a particular organization (Greenhouse, 2000). Such changes in understanding career, as Brown, Scase (1997) state, require universal technical, social and personal competences, but not specific skills. The latter do not lose their importance, but are treated only as one part of individual's competence. As activity environments get more complex, the successful activity cannot be explained only by collection of possessed specific skills. Complex unique situations provoke premeditated and conscious behaviour. In this case, the person's competence is considered because, according to Jucevicius (1998), unstable not-established model of contemporary career in an organization requires individual's autonomy; however it is meaningful only when it is based on competence. Autonomy at work, according to Norman (1983), is understood as the case when the greatest satisfaction of person's life is found in performing certain activity, for which a person has to use all his / her creative abilities, to show emotions, solidarity. Grin (1991) states that becoming autonomous at work is the process when the personality integrates because it sees all activities as elements of personal planning and reviews all its experiences as giving the basis for the implementation of personal expectations and goals. In respect of contemporary career individual's autonomy is one of the conditions of career success because self-knowledge, independence, sense of responsibility and development ensures not only harmony of person's and environment's interaction but also the possibility of career development. Thus, in striving for career competence is the main requirement. A person striving for career at an organization faces the complex assignments possessing elements of tactics and strategy, to perform which he / she has to show abilities to handle increasing information flow, to think appropriately, to fast and qualitatively solve complex problems. This needs the competence of a certain level: the more complex activity (for example, requiring analytical thinking), the higher competence level is. Considering the importance of competence level in respect of career, competence is defined as ability to apply for practical situations principles and techniques of certain activity (Nickols, 2000), a wide list of high-level skills and behaviours, which determines the ability to successfully act in complex unforeseen situations (Westera, 2001) as well as the set of personal traits, behaviour and features, which is necessary for successful performance of the work (Abraham, 2001). Thus, the changing concept of career allows offering appropriate perspectives for career estimation referring to competence levels. At each career stage employee's competence is evaluated: readiness to perform an assignment / activity as well as competence level. The career based on the identification of competence levels shows that it is not enough to possess only certain competence, it is important to determine a competence level as well as to identify what competences lack. In a career process a constant growth of employee's competence initiates emergence of a new activity or creation of the new work, which requires from an acting person to apply the possessed competence for the conditions of the new activity or to be able to critically evaluate own experience and to learn if an activity situation changes. Thus, these levels emphasize not only results but also in striving for a higher level possibilities of development of new activities - competence - emerge. The level of employee's competence depends not only on the functions being performed, activity results achieved, improvement of the work process, abilities constantly being developed, sharing of new knowledge, experience with organization's employees, but also on obligations for the organization, the level or responsibility manifestation, the degree of the responsibility taken by an employee. In this case the identification of the levels of career and competence is purposeful and necessary. In order to theoretically substantiate the change of competence levels as well as to distinguish the criteria characteristic for each level, every competence level is equated to career stages. All career stages, according to Greenhous, Callanan, Godshalk (2000), show that an employee advances by constantly moving through all stages, which present appropriate assignments and challenges. The competence levels distinguished by Bowden, Marton, (1998, 2003), Juceviciene, Lepaite (2000) correlate with the fours career stages distinguished by Dalton, Thompson (1986), in which the relation between the age of an individual and the position taken is emphasized, it is shown how employees move from one stage to another within an organization (fours stages). Such movement conditions activity changes, the change of functions as well as competence growth. The growth of a competence level is ensured by career possibilities. The designed model of interface of competence levels and career stages (see Figure 2.) reflects how competence enables acting in different contexts of the activity as well as constantly changing activity conditions and it influences individual's career. Competence levels correlate with four career stages, in which the relation between the age of an individual and the position taken is pointed out, it is shown how employees move from one career stage to another within an organization. As employee's competence grows, the possibilities for career increase. Thus as conditions change and new activities emerge, which require from an acting person to adjust the possessed competence under conditions of a new activity or to be able to critically evaluate own experience and to learn if the activity situation changes; the competence level also changes. Each career stage needs assessment of employee's competences: readiness to perform the work and a competence level. The greater it is, the better career planning skills and greater possibilities for career are.","[Chreptaviciene, Virginija; Starkute, Jovita] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Chreptaviciene, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",virginija.chreptaviciene@ktu.lt; jovita.starkute@ism.lt,,,,,,,72,3,3,0,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The elasticity of tax revenue with respect to changes in the corporation tax rate are decomposed into a variety of responses. As well as distinguising real from profit-shifting responses, it is important to separate the responses of gross profits from those of deductions (such as claims for past or current losses) where these are endogenously related to gross profits declared at home. This endogeneous response can be expected to differ over the business cycle, which can be important for empirical estimates of aggregate behavioural responses especially, but not exclusively, during cyclical downturns. It is suggested that the revenue elasticity can be expected to be asymmetrical between periods of above- and below-trend growth, arising from the asymmetric treatment of losses by the tax function.","[Creedy, John] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Gemmell, Norman] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Melbourne; University of Nottingham,"Creedy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,5,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2010,,193,,,,,109,130,,,,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,791AT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292632900004,0

We mainly focus on the pandemic view of contagion where local shocks, originating from a country or a local housing market, spread out to other domestic housing markets. An interesting finding is that, even allowing for other channels of international transmission (through global interest rates or activity), the US real house prices, which appear to be exogenous in the US dynamics, unidirectionally causes the international house price factor, which in turn causes the domestic real house price growth for several countries. The channels of contagion from the US appears therefore to be either direct, through house prices (in particular in the UK or Spain), or indirect through other variables.","[de Bandt, Olivier; Barhoumi, Karim; Bruneau, Catherine] Banque France, Paris, France; [Bruneau, Catherine] Univ Paris Ouest, Nanterre, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Universite Paris Saclay,"de Bandt, O (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",olivier.debandt@banque-france.fr; karim.barhoumi@banque-france.fr; cbruneau@u-paris10.fr,,"de BANDT, Olivier/0000-0001-5052-4812",,,,,20,24,24,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-15339-6,,,,2010,,,,,,,129,+,,10.1007/978-3-642-15340-2_7,0.0,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS93,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300025200007,0

The use of the new measure is illustrated by re-evaluating persistence of inflation for the United States and the Euro Area. The conclusions for the United States do not differ significantly from what has been found in previous empirical studies. However, for the Euro Area we find evidence of a significant break occurring in 2001/2002, such that persistence becomes virtually nil for the period that follows the launch of the euro and the implementation of a common monetary policy by the European Central Bank.

Since 1992, the most industrialized countries have promised to help the most vulnerable nations face the adverse consequences of climate changes by supporting the costs of adaptation. The commitment was included in the convention frame that gave birth to the Kyoto Treaty, which was rejected by the George W. Bush administration, even though the initial document, issued in 1992, had been signed by George Bush. The industrialized countries that signed the Kyoto Treaty have decided to create a special fund for climate adaptation. Hundred of millions of dollars had to be used in order to diminish the impact of the global warming in the most exposed areas. Lately, maybe because the CO2 emissions increase due to human activities, the planet climate has changed in worse. 2007 was a key year in evaluating the reply the planet would give to the global overheating, mainly caused by the green-house effect and worsen by El Nino oceanic stream. This superposition of climate factors made 2007 to be one of the warmest years ever registered.","[Dobrescu, Emilian] Romanian Acad, Econ Law & Sociol Sect, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Dobrescu, E (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Econ Law & Sociol Sect, Bucharest, Romania.",dobrescu@acad.ro,"Dobrescu, Emilian/AAK-4781-2021","Dobrescu, Emilian/0000-0002-6063-1125",,,,,7,0,0,0,0,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-987-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,236,243,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI7KE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000414298300032,0

Portugal adopted this exchange rate target zone from April 6 1992 until December 31 1998. During this period, the exchange rate distribution reveals that the majority of the observations lie close to the central parity, thus rejecting one of the key predictions of the Paul Krugman (1991) model. The analysis of the data also shows that exchange rate volatility tended to increase as the exchange rate approached the edges of the band, contrary to the predictions of the basic model. Interest rate differential volatility, on the other hand, seemed to behave in line with theoretical predictions. This suggests an increase in the credibility of monetary policy, allowing us to conclude that the adoption of a target zone has contributed decisively to the creation of the macroeconomic stability conditions necessary for the participation in the European Monetary Union (EMU). The Portuguese integration process should therefore be considered as an example to be followed by other small open economies in transition to the euro area.","[Duarte, Antonio Portugal; Andrade, Joao Sousa; Duarte, Adelaide] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,,portugal@fe.uc.pt; jasa@fe.uc.pt; maduarte@fe.uc.pt,"Duarte, António Portugal/GOK-0204-2022","Duarte, António Portugal/0000-0002-5388-0051; Andrade, Joao/0000-0003-0999-2264; Duarte, Adelaide/0000-0002-6585-2744",,,,,51,2,3,1,9,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2010,57.0,3,,,,,261,282,,10.2298/PAN1003261P,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,671PM,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283519000002,0

For a specific random advertising technology, we show that one firm will always be half as large as the other. No pure-strategy price equilibrium exists in the stage-2 game, and as long as there is some overlap in customer bases, the mixed-strategy price equilibrium does not converge to the Bertrand equilibrium.","[Eaton, B.

There is little empirical evidence that changes in demographics are responsible for the falling participation rates. Rather, it appears that this trend is concentrated amongst women with children under the age of two and that federal maternity leave mandates are most responsible. I estimate the effect of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) on participation by using the FMLA as a natural experiment and exploiting state-level differentiation in maternity leave statutes. Theoretically, maternity leave statutes intend to preserve job tenure for expecting mothers. However, if an employed mother on maternity leave learns that her value for staying at home exceeds her value from working, she will exit the labor force once the leave expires. Difference-in-differences estimates show that after the FMLA, employed and expecting married mothers who live in an area without state-mandated maternity leave are 2.7 percentage points more likely to leave the labor force after taking maternity leave than those who live in an area with state-mandated maternity leave. As a sensitivity test, I evaluate married women without infant children and single women as additional control groups to estimate difference-in-difference-in-differences effects of the FMLA. Altogether, the increase in the proportion of mothers leaving the labor force due to federally-mandated maternity leave accounts for almost two-thirds of the overall fall in labor force participation.",,,,natalie.goodpaster@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,8,9,0,24,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This is likely due to their complexity. We investigate the scope for using somewhat simpler policies that are more closely related to pricing schemes already used by regulators in many jurisdictions. These schemes have a discrete block pricing (DBP) structure whereby a given unit price for pollution is applied up to a specified level of pollution for any given polluter, and a higher unit price is applied to any pollution from that polluter above the specified level. If the same price schedule is applied uniformly to all firms, we call it UDBP. We derive the optimal UDBP schedule for any given number of price blocks. We also derive the optimal limiting case of the UDBP schedule (with an infinite number of price blocks) as a uniform linear increasing marginal price schedule (ULIMP). The optimal ULIMP scheme strikes a balance between the information-related benefits of increasing marginal prices on one hand, and an increase in aggregate abatement cost, due to the non-equalization of marginal abatement costs across firms, on the other. In particular, the optimal schedule is steeper with larger aggregate uncertainty about marginal abatement costs, and flatter with more observable heterogeneity across firms. We then compare our price schemes with those proposed by Weitzman (1978) and Roberts and Spence (1976).","[Kennedy, Peter W.] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Whittington, Dale] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of Victoria; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Kennedy, PW (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",pkennedy@uvic.ca; benoit@laplante.org; dale_whittington@unc.edu,,"Whittington, Dale/0000-0002-6075-8812",,,,,18,3,3,0,8,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In response to Hume, Smith argues that sympathy is about the attenuation, rather than the escalation, of original emotions because sympathy involves judgment. Sympathy means that the spectator understands an emotion felt by the principal by placing him or herself in the principal's shoes. Such understanding would not take place unless the principal's emotion is proper in that the principal has attenuated the pitch of the emotion via self-command, that is, via rational choice. Smith's notion of sympathy solves the commitment problem: agents command their emotions, which include the temptation to cheat their future selves and others, in order to receive approval.

On Our extended domain, we analyze the implications of two central properties which, on the Nash domain, are known to be incompatible: strong monotonicity [Kalai, E.. 1977.

We also show that dropping scale invariance from this list characterizes the whole class of monotone path rules. We then introduce a symmetric monotone path rule that we call the Cardinal Egalitarian rule and show that it is weakly Pareto optimal, strongly monotonic, scale invariant, symmetric and that it is the only rule to satisfy these properties on a class of two-agent problems.

Moreover, in contrast to prior studies focusing on examining case studies involving mature stock markets, this study not only adopts US SP 500 stock market as the sample but also adds an analysis of one emerging stock market, Hungarian BSI and examines the differences between them. Finally, this investigation employs a rolling estimation process to examine the impact of arbitrage threshold behaviours on the setting of futures hedging ratio. The empirical findings of this study are consistent with the following notions. First, arbitrage behaviour reduces co-movement between futures and spot markets and increases the volatility of both futures and spot markets. Second, this article denotes the outer regime of futures-spot market for the case of Hungarian BSI (US SP 500) as a crisis (an unusual) condition.

Compared with studies focusing on retail prices, little empirical work has measured the impact of wholesale concentration on wholesale prices. Economic theory suggests that the sensitivity of purchase price in response to degree of wholesale concentration is smaller for large retail formats than for small retail formats in the presence of intra-format retail competition. To test the validity of the theoretical implication, I measure the impact of the concentration on purchasing prices for retailers by format. Empirical findings support the hypothesis that the large retail format tends to draw advantageous purchase prices when wholesalers become increasingly oligopolistic.","[Matsui, Kenji] Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Business Adm, Hodogaya Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan",Yokohama National University,"Matsui, K (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Business Adm, Hodogaya Ku, 79-4 Tokiwadai, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan.",kmatsui@ynu.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730196] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,17,2,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article examines the influence of fees on client impact and satisfaction. It finds that fees have no significant relationship with client satisfaction or impact. Government targets and manager/advisor policies have, therefore, been wrong to pursue an explicit fee-based targeting strategy. Instead, satisfaction and impact are most significantly influenced by the character of the BL provider, being significantly higher for franchises managed by chambers of commerce and other agents, and being poorer for independent stand-alone providers. Service type has a significant influence on the propensity to charge a fee and on service impact. Small-and medium-sized enterprises characteristics have little influence on client evaluations.

Four testable hypotheses on the impact of technological convergence on follower's and leader's competitiveness and welfare are presented. We then use 1993-2001 data from 128 manufacturing industries in 35 countries to test these hypotheses. Results show that followers' relative wages and global value-added shares increase with technological convergence. Followers benefit from convergence's positive income effect. Leader's own technological progress is the key to its welfare improvement, while terms-of-trade effects appear less important.","[Ruan, Jun] Momentum Market Intelligence, Portland, OR USA; [Gopinath, Munisamy] Oregon State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Ruan, J (通讯作者)，Momentum Market Intelligence, Portland, OR USA.",jun_ruan@mointel.com,,"Munisamy, Gopi/0000-0002-6249-7548",,,,,31,4,4,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The evidence shows that Thailand's latecomer firms accumulated their technology primarily from foreign direct investment, mostly from Japanese car makers. There has been a significant rise in the demand for engineering and technological capabilities that has driven some amount of technological catch-up in the industry. However, the lack of engineers and technological capabilities among Thai supplier firms has restricted the catch-up process. To upgrade further the Thai automobile firms should build a strong industrial cluster by stimulating the development of technological human capital to provide the horizontal integration necessary for the suppliers to remain competitive. Upstream technological capability is important for this to take place, but it can only be achieved through the development of human capital.","Meijo Univ, Fac Econ, Aichi, Japan",Meijo University,"Sadoi, Y (通讯作者)，Meijo Univ, Fac Econ, Aichi, Japan.",sadoi@ccmfs.meijo-u.ac.jp,"Sadoi, Yuri/AAM-4141-2021",,,,,,28,3,3,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The level of regulation is exogenously fixed and constant over time. The compliance cost of a firm at each point of time depends on its current output, its accumulated past investment and the level of regulation. We outline sufficient conditions under which industries with more stringent regulation are associated with higher investment in compliance cost reduction and higher shake-out of firms over time; the opposite may be true under certain circumstances.

For service sectors, this ratio is strongly influenced by capacity utilization and exhibits a non-linear pattern, especially for short-term tourism applications that involve dramatic demand fluctuations as a consequence of mega events, natural disasters or societal instability. The purpose of this study is to decompose the relationship between capacity utilization and the JSR so that the underlying factors that cause the instability of JSR can be identified. Time-series data from the Taiwanese tourist hotels and aviation sectors are adopted to discuss the strength of the relations between price per unit and capacity utilization, total employee numbers and utilization, service capacity and utilization, and labor efficiency and utilization, respectively. The results indicate that the adjustment of labor efficiency is the prominent factor in determining the stability of the jobs-to-sales ratio, while price, to employee number and service capacity are relatively stable in response to demand, leading to changing JSRs.","[Sun, Ya-Yen] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Kinesiol Hlth & Leisure Studies, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Wong, Kam-Fai] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Inst Stat, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung; National University Kaohsiung,"Sun, YY (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Kinesiol Hlth & Leisure Studies, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",yysun@nuk.edu.tw,"Sun, Ya-Yen/N-2051-2018","Sun, Ya-Yen/0000-0001-6788-7644",,,,,46,3,5,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The challenging issues are those of applying Art.102 of the Treaty to, e.g.: essential facilities, imposing compulsory licenses, defining the collective market dominance, linked transactions, cartelization and concentration, as well as the determinants of effective consumer protection. Problems arising from the more economic approach in competition law are: the danger of relativization of rules; legal uncertainty; rising costs; length and complexity of procedures; conflict between the so-called per se. rule and rule of reason in the application of competition law; and designing optimally diversified rules and regulations to provide stable and secure competitive freedom to business. The use of economic knowledge in the field of competition law involved inspirations mostly from neoclassical equilibrium theory, while ideas belonging to development economics, behavioral economics, workable competition theory and strategic analysis were underrated. There is no unified theory of competition, but new approaches are developing, e,g, in industrial economics, new institutional economics and the Austrian School. But the lawmakers are often not clear about their goals and values which make them choose a particular theory. This leads to neglecting the development trends and the dynamic competition which promotes innovations in the economy.","Szkola Glowna Handlowa, Katedra Prawa Adm Finansowego Przedsiebiorstw, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Szpringer, W (通讯作者)，Szkola Glowna Handlowa, Katedra Prawa Adm Finansowego Przedsiebiorstw, Warsaw, Poland.",wloszp@wp.pl,,,,,,,98,1,1,0,9,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2010,,3,,,,,285,318,,,,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,632AS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280392900001,0

Crisis problems are solved not in its primary stage and usually chaotic, without any strategic crisis situation or crisis management plans (Yair, Golenko-Ginzburg, Laslo, 2007; Bivainis, Tuncikiene, 2007; Ciegis, Gineitiene, 2008; Diskiene, Galiniene, Marcinskas, 2008; Kaplinski, 2008; Markovic, 2008). Even more difficult situation appears when company's employees as well as the internal and external environment have to be informed. Therefore it is necessary to represent the organization realistically (Tijunaitiene, Neverauskas, 2009; Deep house, 2005), to train the specialists of knowledge management (Melnikas, 2005, 2008; Saee, 2005; Sakalas, Ciutiene, Neverauskas, 2006; Kumpikaite, 2007; Rees, 2008; Boguslauskas, Kvedaraviciene, 2008). The situation does not become easier because of the negative attitude to crises (Klein, 1981; Rosenblatt, Sheaffer, 2002; Anikin, 2008; Virbickaite, 2009). Therefore crisis solution can bring positive consequences in company's change (Gummensson, 1991; Heath, 1994; Sakalas, Savaneviciene 2003; Garskaite, Garskiene, 2005; Adekola, Korsakiene, Tvaronaviciene, 2008; Valackiene, 2009; Startine, Remeikiene, 2009). One of them is efficient communication and conflict management during a crisis period (Varey, White, 2000; Januleviciute, Bieleviciene, Dambrava, 2003; Steyn, 2003; Talef-Viia, Alas, 2009). The efficiency of communication process is confirmed by the worldwide models designed and applied in practice (Turney, 2004; Deephouse, Carter, 2005; Neville, Bell, Menguc, 2005; Luecke, 2007). Worldwide management practice demonstrates the appearance of new management area corporate communication. Global business confederations (European Confederation of PR and CERP) prepare recommendations of public relations in business environment, which are successfully applied in strategic planning, scientific research institutes (Corporate Communication Institute, New Jersey, USA; BNFL Corporate Communication Research Unit, Salford, UK; MBA Corporate Communication Concentration New Jersey, USA; Annenberg Strategic Public Relations Center, USA), where different business researches are done in the area of public relations. Scientific and practical discussions are published in the continual reviewed scientific journals (Theory, Culture, Society, USA; Evolution of Communication, Netherlands; European Journal of Communication, UK; Corporate Communications: An International Journal, UK). Universities in all over the world (Scotland University of Sterning; University of Alabama, USA; Viena Institute for Communications Management and other) prepare professionals according to the Corporate Communication Management program. Communication agencies, crisis management consulting teams, consulting and teaching services successfully work in Lithuania, too, which give wide spectrum of service in public relation area: corporate and marketing communication, strategy creation of crisis communication, government relation, public relation and crisis management problem solving.

Our decomposition of the increase in stockholders' share of aggregate labor income documents that one half is due to the equi-proportional increase in participation and one quarter each is due to the non-proportional part of the changes in stockmarket participation and changes in the income distribution, respectively. The change due to the labor income distribution is driven entirely by the increase in the share of labor income accounted for by the top labor income decile. Using a simple model with limited stockmarket participation, we present a mechanism for how the increase in stockholders' share of aggregate labor income has affected the ex ante equity premium (i.e. the discount rate applied to equity). The mechanism works through the composition of income of stockholders. The resulting decrease in the equity premium is 44 percent, which roughly coincides with the historical change in the post-1951 equity premium implied by the simple dividend growth model in Fama and French (2002).",,,,,,,,,,,35,9,9,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We consider a typical employment contract with an extra control option. This option is contractable ex ante, exercisable ex post, and good for incentives. But, the employer may choose not to have it in a contract. We identify some interesting circumstances under which the option is not in the optimal contract. Our main findings are that (1) external risks determine contractual incompleteness, and (2) a complete contract can better handle incentives, while an incomplete contract can better handle external risks. Hence, our analysis of incomplete contracts is somewhat consistent with Williamson's (1985) idea of low-powered incentives inside the firm and high-powered incentives outside the firm.","HKUST, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Wang, SS (通讯作者)，HKUST, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",s.wang@ust.hk,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,11,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Furthermore, we define an index to show the eco-efficiency of consumer behavior. Through such a study, we can determine what action is appropriate for a 'sustainable consumption' society. If some change of consumer behavior greatly improved utility while increasing the environmental load, then technological progress to reduce the environmental load must be stimulated. However, if other changes in consumer behavior increase the environmental load while not improving utility very much, then such changes should be strongly discouraged.","[Washizu, Ayu] Waseda Univ, Sch Social Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakano, Satoshi] Japan Inst Labour Policy & Training, Tokyo, Japan",Waseda University,"Washizu, A (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Sch Social Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",washizu@waseda.jp,"Nakano, Satoshi/AAI-3793-2021","Nakano, Satoshi/0000-0003-0424-585X",,,,,21,5,5,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

In an international perspective, family-background effects are relatively large in Argentina, and relatively small in Colombia. A specific Argentine feature is the lack of performance differences between rural and urban areas. A specific Colombian feature is the lack of significant between-gender performance differences. Nonnative students and students not speaking Spanish at home perform particularly weak in both countries.

An accommodating monetary policy, conducted alongside the reform, could help bring positive welfare effects of the reform to the fore. In order to identify the mechanisms through which monetary policy can affect the welfare effects of a reform, we add stylized features of the labor market to a standard New-Keynesian model for monetary policy analysis. A labor market reform is modeled as a structural change inducing a permanent shift in the flexible-price unemployment and output levels. In addition to the permanent gains, the impact of the timing and magnitude of the reform-induced adjustments on the welfare of workers - employed and unemployed is crucial to the transition welfare costs of the reform. Since the adjustments depend not only on the macroeconomic structure, but can also be influenced by monetary policy, we simulate various degrees of output persistence across different policy rules. We find that, if inertias are present, monetary policy affects the adjustment path following reform implementation. In general, the more expansionary (or the less contractionary) the policy is, the faster the recovery to the new steady-state equilibrium is, and therefore the lower the transition costs are.

J,"Edelman, B",,,,"Edelman, Benjamin",,,Markets Red Light States: Who Buys Online Adult Entertainment?,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper studies the adult online entertainment industry, particularly the consumption side of the market. In particular, it focuses on the demographics and consumption patterns of those who subscribe to adult entertainment websites. On the surface, this business would seem to face a number of obstacles. Regulatory and legal barriers have already been mentioned. In addition, those charging for access to adult entertainment face competition from similar content available without a fee. In the context of adult entertainment, free access offers consumers an extra benefit: online payments tend to create records documenting the fact of a customer's purchase; consumers of free content may feel more confident that their purchases will remain confidential. More broadly, measured levels of religiosity in American are high. On the other hand, social critics often argue that the rise of Internet pornography is contributing to a coarsening of American culture. Do consumption patterns of online adult entertainment reveal two separate Americas? Or is the consumption of online adult entertainment widespread, regardless of legal barriers, potential for embarrassment, and even religious conviction?","Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Edelman, B (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",bedelman@hbs.edu,,,,,,,27,113,131,2,23,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

While the causes of corruption have drawn economists' interest in recent years, our main contribution is to examine the corruption determinants throughout the conditional distribution of corruption across nations. Are there different causes of corruption in highly corrupt nations compared to the least corrupt countries? For instance, we examine whether greater democracy and more economic freedom consistently reduce corruption among the most and the least corrupt. Our results for the significant determinants support some findings in the literature, but also provide new conclusions. In many cases, quantile regression estimates are quite different from those from OLS regressions. Among the most corrupt nations, larger governments and greater economic freedom do not appear to reduce corruption, but greater democracy seems to alleviate it. Our results suggest that some current corruption control policies may be reconsidered, especially among the most corrupt and least corrupt nations.

Secondly, we establish a sense in which the subjective state space is uniquely pinned down by the ex ante ranking of (random) menus.

We introduce a new methodology to compare the behavior of agents that occupy the same rank in the two different income distributions but typically have different levels of incomes. Here, an increase in incomes of the least endowed improves their welfare, yet it also increases social competition, making those in the middle to be worse off-even if they have higher incomes as well. As social competition can be lowered by Spreading agents apart in income space, we find that an increase in incomes for all, augmented by (weakly) increased income dispersion, constitutes a sufficient condition for Pareto-improvement. We also show that one can have an increase both in income and relative position but still be worse off. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

For some interest rates reputational equilibria exist only with envious agents. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For an economy calibrated to replicate key aspects of the U. S. wealth distribution, we find that the quantitative effects of financial policy are relatively small. The reason is that the households determining aggregate behavior are relatively well insured and can therefore offset the actions of the firm by modifying their portfolio allocations. However, financial policy has important effects on asset prices. Whereas a higher level of debt in the capital structure of the firm introduces more risk into the economy by increasing the volatility of the equity return, it enhances the liquidity of households by increasing the supply of bonds. In an economy with a substantial amount of heterogeneity, this last effect dominates and leverage leads to a decrease in the equity premium. This is in contrast to the findings in representative agent models, in which leverage unambiguously increases the premium through a higher equity return volatility.

Existence of an equilibrium is ensured if the hazard rate of the demand distribution is monotonically decreasing with respect to the shock outcome and sellers have non-decreasing marginal costs. Multiple equilibria can be ruled out for markets, for which the auctioneer's demand exceeds suppliers' capacity with a positive probability. The derived equilibrium can be used to model strategic bidding behavior in pay-as-bid electricity auctions, such as the balancing mechanism of United Kingdom.

The quality of an individual's occupational choice is measured using job congruence, a commonly-used construct in the psychometric literature. Better-matched individuals should be more productive and, as a result, have higher earnings. Previous studies were unable to address the importance of job preferences to earnings because available data do not include both job congruence and individual earnings. The Alumni Outcomes Survey, recently produced by ACT Inc., is among the first data sets to include both variables. We use these data to estimate the importance of job congruence on earnings after controlling both for job tenure and for academic achievement, measured by an individual's ACT score. Results indicate that job congruence is positively correlated with earnings, and has effects on earnings that are of almost equal magnitude with years of education.

Although traditional comparisons of the series sometimes suggest that simple-sum and Divisia monetary aggregates share similar dynamics, there are important differences around turning points that cannot be evaluated by their average behavior. We use a factor model with a regime-switching model that separates the common movements underlying the monetary aggregate indices from idiosyncratic variations in each series. We find that the major differences between the simple-sum aggregates and Divisia indices occur around the beginnings and ends of recessions and during some high-interest-rate phases. We note the inferences' policy relevance, which is particularly dramatic at the broadest (M3) level of aggregation.

This situation is beginning to change, but our estimates suggest that as much as $800 billion is still excluded from U.S. published data (as of 2003), and that this leads to the exclusion of more than $3 trillion of business intangible capital stock. To assess the importance of this omission, we add intangible capital to the standard sources-of-growth framework used by the BLS, and find that the inclusion of our list of intangible assets makes a significant difference in the observed patterns of U.S. economic growth. The rate of change of output per worker increases more rapidly when intangibles are counted as capital, and capital deepening becomes the unambiguously dominant source of growth in labor productivity. The role of multifactor productivity is correspondingly diminished, and labor's income share is found to have decreased significantly over the last 50 years.","[Corrado, Carol] Conf Board, Econ Programs, New York, NY 10022 USA; [Hulten, Charles] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hulten, Charles] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sichel, Daniel] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Corrado, C (通讯作者)，Conf Board, Econ Programs, 845 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10022 USA.",carol.corrado@conference-board.org,,,,,,,66,436,446,3,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In the status quo, Home and Foreign implement nondiscriminatory policies toward international factor flows in order to maximize the domestic median voter's welfare. Then the two countries simultaneously hold referenda on a common market initiative, leading to the removal of the pre-existing policies for factor flows between the member countries, while no coordination is imposed on policies vis-a-vis the Rest of the World. Several interesting results emerge. In a common market, the returns on factors moving between the members are more likely to increase the larger is the import demand of one country relative to the factor supply of the exporting partner. Factors that do not relocate are more likely to see their returns decrease when flows are large and import demands are inelastic. Importantly, for the common market to emerge as an equilibrium, some factors must continue to experience enhanced protection when the integration process is completed. This result highlights the potential tension between social desirability and the political feasibility of the integration process.

We analyze empirically the geographical composition of the cross-border portfolio holdings of more than 40 source countries. We compare these benchmark results with those of four subgroups: advanced industrial economies, emerging market economies, European economies, and Asia-Pacific economies. The lack of liquidity in Asian financial markets turns out to be one reason why Asian capital is invested predominantly outside the region, notwithstanding the short distances and large trade flows between Asian economies. Initiatives to improve the liquidity of Asian financial markets, therefore, may be a useful way to stimulate financial integration within the region.","[Garcia-Herrero, Alicia] BBVA, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wooldridge, Philip] Bank Int Settlements, Representat Off Asia & Pacific, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Doo Yong] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan",Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"García-Herrero, A (通讯作者)，BBVA, 43-F,2 Int Finance Ctr, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",alicia.garcia-herrero@bbva.com.hk; philip.wooldridge@bis.org; dyyang@adbi.org,,"Garcia Herrero, Alicia/0000-0003-4916-7293",,,,,31,26,27,0,10,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

The surplus of households is determined by individual choices of levels of friendliness to each other. A strategic conflict arises from a coupling condition that ceteris paribus, a person's friendlier attitude reduces the individual's influence in the household's collective decision on how to divide the ensuing surplus. While partners in an isolated household choose the minimum level of friendliness, competition for partners tends to promote friendliness. We find that affluence does not buy affection, but can lead to withholding of affection by an affluent partner who can afford to do so. In general, the equilibrium degree of friendliness proves sensitive to the socio-economic composition of the population.","[Gersbach, Hans] ETH, CER, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Haller, Hans] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Gersbach, H (通讯作者)，ETH, CER, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",hgersbach@ethz.ch; haller@vt.edu,,,,,,,24,3,4,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The resultant output gap has a clear interpretation as a measure to gauge future inflationary pressures. It also exhibits better predictability for future inflation changes in comparison with previous output gap measures.

We show that according to the value of the marginal cost of the public firm, there always exists a pair of share ratios of the owners of both the (pre-merged) public firm and the (pre-merged) private firm such that the market structure with the merger between the public firm and one private firm belongs to the core.

Additional support for this view resides in a number of earlier studies that have found that the impact of interest rates on the real economy has been miniscule. However, taking into account numerous reforms in the financial sector and more widely in the Chinese economy, interest rates may have gained some influence in the last few years. It is important to study the effectiveness of interest rates also in light of future reforms of the monetary policy tools in China. Whereas administrative policy measures were effective in guiding the behaviour of state-owned enterprises, the authorities may need to increase the use of more market-oriented monetary policy tools as the share of the economy in private and foreign ownership grows. We use a vector error correction model to study, within a credit demand framework, whether the impact of interest rates in China has become stronger over the last decade. Our results suggest that loan demand has indeed become more dependent on interest rates, albeit the channel from interest rates to the real economy is still weak. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We assess if differences in household formation are associated to differences in access to credit by estimating the impact of the cost of a mortgage on the probability that a young adult leaves his or her parents' home. Exogenous changes in the cost of credit are identified using the reform in 1998 and the cancellation in 2002 of Credito Bonificado, a Portuguese program that provided four different reductions of the interest rate of mortgages signed by low- and medium-income youth. Using a unique data set that links administrative records of debt with the 1998-2004 waves of the Employment Survey, we document three findings. First, borrowing among young adults fell when borrowing costs increased. Second, the elasticity of new household formation with respect to net interest rates lies between -0.8 and -3.3. Third, young adults responded to the increase in mortgage costs by delaying home purchases or by reducing the quality of housing services purchased, but there was only a modest increase of the probability of renting a new accommodation.

We use full information maximum likelihood estimation procedures and find that exchange rate uncertainty has a negative and significant effect on US exports.

The difference between the nominal and real forward rates (called inflation compensation) on a particular day is then used as a proxy for the market's inflation expectations.

Exchange rate stability has been argued to affect growth negatively as it deprives countries from the ability to react in a flexible way to asymmetric real shocks and increases the probability of speculative capital inflows and overheating. In contrast, exchange rate stability can be argued to affect growth in emerging market economies positively as transactions costs for international trade decline, uncertainty for international capital flows is less and macroeconomic stability is enhanced. Cross country panel estimations provide evidence for a negative impact of the exchange rate volatility on growth in both Emerging Europe and East Asia. Parts of this negative growth effect can be associated with exchange rate volatility caused by macroeconomic instability.","Univ Leipzig, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University,"Schnabl, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Marschnerstr 31, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",schnabl@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,28,23,24,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Resulting estimates of 40-50% transient poverty point to the policy conclusion that poverty may be a less serious social problem than it appears in annual data due to rural income volatility. Here, we instead use a direct method to adjust rural income for volatility using a certainty equivalent income measure and recomputed summary statistics for the distribution of volatility corrected incomes, including the urban-rural income gap on which much of current poverty debate in China focuses. Available data indicate a growing urban-rural income gap (the ratio of mean urban to rural incomes) with a significant increase from around 1.8 in the late-1980s to over three today. These estimates do not take into account the higher volatility of rural incomes in China. Since an uncertain income stream is worth less in utility terms than a certain income stream, we argue that heightened rural volatility increases the effective urban-rural income gap and intensifies not weakens poverty concerns. Using Chinese longitudinal rural survey data for which current decompositions can be replicated, we make adjustments for certainty equivalence of rural household income streams, which not only widen the urban-rural income gap in China but also increase other distributional summary statistics. Depending upon values used for the coefficient of relative risk aversion, the measured urban-rural income gap increases by 20-30% using a certainty equivalent measure to adjust rural incomes for volatility. We also conduct similar analysis using consumption data, for which similar (but slightly larger) increases occur.

The aim of these reforms was to accelerate labor market flows and reduce unemployment duration. Without attempting to evaluate the specific components of these Hartz reforms, this paper provides a first attempt to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the first two reform waves, Hartz I/II and III, in speeding up the matching process between unemployed and vacant jobs. The analysis is conceptually rooted in the flow-based view underlying the reforms, estimating the structural features of the matching process. The results indicate that the reforms indeed had an impact in making the labor market more dynamic and accelerating the matching process.","[Sunde, Uwe] Univ St Gallen, SEW HSG, IZA, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Fahr, Rene] Univ Paderborn, Bonn, Germany",University of St Gallen; University of Paderborn,"Sunde, U (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, SEW HSG, IZA, Varnbuelstr 14, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",uwe.sunde@unisg.ch,,"Fahr, Rene/0000-0002-0304-6675",,,,,25,67,71,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

When physical attractiveness is entered into the model as the only measure of personal appearance (as has been clone in previous studies), it has a positive and statistically significant impact on GPA for female students and a positive yet not statistically significant effect for male students. Including personality and grooming, the effect of physical attractiveness turns negative for both groups, but is only statistically significant for males. For male and female students, being very well groomed is associated with a statistically significant GPA premium. While grooming has the largest effect on GPA for male students, having a very attractive personality is most important for female students. Numerous sensitivity analyses support the core results for grooming and personality. Possible explanations for these findings include teacher discrimination, differences in student objectives, and rational resource allocation decisions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

EVIDENCE FROM TWO NATURAL EXPERIMENTS,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MATERNITY LEAVE; EMPLOYMENT; FAMILY; WELFARE; HEALTH,"This paper analyzes the effects of changes in the duration of paid, job-protected parental leave on mothers' higher-order fertility and postbirth labor market careers. Identification is based on a major Austrian reform increasing the duration of parental leave from one year to two years for any child born on or after July 1, 1990. We find that mothers who give birth to their first child immediately after the reform have more second children than prereform mothers, and that extended parental leave significantly reduces return to work. Employment and earnings also decrease in the short run, but not in the long run. Fertility and work responses vary across the population in ways suggesting that both cash transfers and job protection are relevant. Increasing parental leave for a future child increases fertility strongly but leaves short-run postbirth careers relatively unaffected. Partially reversing the 1990 extension, a second 1996 reform improves employment and earnings while compressing the time between births.","[Lalive, Rafael] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Univ Zurich, Inst Empirical Econ Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Lausanne; University of Zurich,"Lalive, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",,,"Lalive, Rafael/0000-0003-1938-692X",,,,,30,246,289,5,97,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Inspired by recent contributions on open source, we propose a two-stage game with perfect information and product differentiation, in which producers first set software quality and then determine prices (the price is zero for open source programs). We assume perfect software compatibility and model lock-in effects, a network externality component of software quality, and accumulation of experience in software use and implementation. In comparison to the monopolistic benchmark case, we argue that, in a duopoly created by the emergence of an open source program, the proprietary software producer will reduce its selling price if. (i) its network of users is larger than the open source network and its consumers are largely familiar with its program, (ii) it has a small network of unskilled consumers. On the other hand, the price of proprietary software will increase if its users form a large, but poorly-skilled network. Furthermore, we show that, in all of the above cases. the hedonic quality of proprietary software increases. Finally, by modeling experience accumulation processes through difference equations, we show that the ratio between the closed and open source programs' opportunity costs for software learning and deployment plays a crucial role in shaping market outcomes. If open source software remains too complex and technical for unskilled or time-pressed users, a shared market solution, in which both programs are adopted, is likely to emerge. However, if opportunity costs in learning and understanding open source programs are particularly low, or at least equal to the opportunity costs of a closed-source program, then open source dominance emerges (i.e. markets tip to open source).

In the 1990s, domestic cigarettes were legally exported to be subsequently illegally imported. At first, smuggling was done by individual consumers who bought cigarettes abroad and brought them back through policed points of entry. This Mom and Pop smuggling was a mechanism to implement a second-degree price discrimination scheme by cigarette manufacturers. Regrets from committing tax evasion and labels on exported cigarettes packs permit vertical differentiation of illegal and legal cigarettes. Paradoxically, labeling measures can make illegal sales more resilient to tax reductions, and stricter border enforcement encourages a switch to a less benign smuggling technology exclusive to criminal organizations. High export taxes terminated export-to-smuggle schemes, but brought about a surge of counterfeit cigarettes. Because of a second-degree price discrimination scheme, the elimination of taxes need not suffice to eradicate smuggling.","[Larue, Bruno] Univ Laval, Canada Res Chair Int Agrifood Trade, Ctr Res Econ Agri Food CREA, FSAA, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Pouliot, Sebastien] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA USA; [Constantatos, Christos] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece",Laval University; Iowa State University; University of Macedonia,"Larue, B (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Canada Res Chair Int Agrifood Trade, Ctr Res Econ Agri Food CREA, FSAA, 4417 Pavillon Paul Comtois, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",Bruno.Larue@eac.ulaval.ca; pouliot@iastate.edu; cconst@uom.gr,"Constantatos, Christos/AAP-7303-2021","Pouliot, Sebastien/0000-0002-5961-5363",,,,,21,2,2,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

When prices are driven above the soft cap, offer curves become flat, in contrast to the hockey stick shape observed in a typical uniform price auction for electricity.

Still, by far most of the poor in rural China belong to the ethnic majority. The relatively high poverty rates for ethnic minorities in rural China are found to be due to higher rates of entry than for the majority, while differences in exit rates across ethnicities are few. To a large extent, ethnic poverty differences can be attributed to differences in location, together with temporary and persistent poverty in rural China having a very clear spatial character. Poverty is concentrated in the western region and villages with low average income.

This analysis is based on a vector autoregressive (VAR) model that partly includes the distribution chain of prices (import prices and consumer prices). I observe how the size and speed of the pass-through decrease along the distribution chain. Exchange rate pass-through is larger for these developing countries than that derived in previous studies of the United States and euro area. I also find evidence for Taylor's (2001) hypothesis of a positive relation between the degree of the exchange rate pass-through and inflation, observing less inflation and long-run exchange pass-through in inflation targeting countries, such as Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The relation between exchange rate pass-through and openness is unclear Finally, I analyze exchange rate pass-through by industry, comparing results in the manufacturing and energy sectors and finding evidence of a larger response in energy than in manufacturing.","[Maria-Dolores, Ramon] Univ Murcia, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, E-30001 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"María-Dolores, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,,,,,,27,5,5,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

The model is cast as a sequential game with imperfect information featuring firms, employees and labor judges. The judges' error margin increases with the congestion of the judicial system. The game presents multiple equilibria which differ in the frequency of good workers fired for unfair motives and the frequency of unreliable workers who abusively sue firms for unfair dismissal. The probability that the judge sits with the employee appears to be positively related to the ratio between the severance payment for economic dismissal and the company fine for abusive dismissal.

The precipitous decline of the newspaper industry is one manifestation of the symbiotic relationship between online content and advertising. Online-advertising is provided by a series of interlocking multisided platforms that facilitate the matching of advertisers and consumers.

Mothers participating in the couples program had larger immediate gains in employment and earnings and decreases in TANF receipt following their exit from the program relative to mothers who received employment assistance as individuals. Fathers showed similar although weaker results. These immediate benefits appeared to be driven by higher rates of program completion among couples' participants. Couples in which both partners completed the program experienced the largest quarterly earnings gains, and couples with greater earnings' gains were more likely to still be together one year after the program ended. Mothers' earnings gains eroded in the two years following program completion and many reported new pregnancies and problems with child care. We suggest directions for future programs and encourage future studies to consider the range of mechanisms associated with a couples focus, including potential motivational benefits and unintended consequences.","[Heinrich, Carolyn J.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Heinrich, Carolyn J.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Inst Res Poverty, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gordon, Rachel A.] Univ Illinois Chicago, Dept Sociol, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Gordon, Rachel A.] Univ Illinois Chicago, Inst Govt & Publ Affairs, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago,"Heinrich, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, 1225 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",cheinrich@lafollette.wisc.edu,,,,,,,35,0,1,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Can this phenomenon be counteracted by government intervention? To answer this question, this paper introduces diversity to the canonical model of.,warm glow giving. Diversity may have two effects on incentives: it may attenuate individuals' altruistic preferences for public goods, and it may cool off the warm glow that individuals get from voluntarism. Either of these effects leads to diverse communities having lower levels of public goods, consistent with prior research. However, these effects have opposite implications for the efficacy of government intervention. I then empirically investigate whether government intervention is more effective in diverse communities. For identification, I exploit the Supreme Court-mandated 1991 expansion of the SSI program. Using a new dataset of United Methodist churches from 1984 to 2000, the results show that the expansion of SSI crowded-out charitable spending by churches. The crowd-out estimate for the average church is reasonably large, but this masks significant differences in crowd-out between communities. Crowd-out occurred almost entirely in relatively homogeneous communities; there is only modest evidence of crowd-out in racially diverse communities. Thus diverse communities, while having the lowest levels of altruism, are in this instance the most amenable to government intervention. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This set is interpreted as a collection of the decision maker's possible future beliefs. When choices cannot be deferred, the decision maker evaluates every uncertain prospect via an epsilon-mixture of the least favorable element in the set Delta and her current probabilistic belief p is an element of Delta.

This paper aims to explain the difference. A standard measure of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) calculated at the aggregate level shows that over one-third of the difference in economic performance can be explained by the change in TFP growth rates in the two periods. The question is further pursued at the manufacturing level. A time-series cross sectional analysis of the manufacturing sector confirms that TFP growth rates fell after the revolution and did not recover anywhere close to their pre revolution levels even after the Iran-Iraq war. The regression analyses show that decreasing returns to scale and mark-up pricing behavior have developed in the manufacturing sector under the Islamic Republic. A Tornqvist measure of TFP, corrected for market imperfections and non-constant returns to scale technology, is used to explain sources of productivity slowdown. The results show that manufacturing TFP increases with (i) private participation rate in economic activities and (ii) exports. Manufacturing TFP falls with (iii) increase in capital-intensity and (iv) higher entry/exit barriers.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Mojaver, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",fmojaver@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

No obvious regional differences in the universities' productivity growth are apparent between 1998 and 2002. Decomposition of the Malmquist productivity index indicates that although there has been technological progress over the years, poor scale efficiency and technical efficiency have resulted in deterioration in the universities' average productivity.

It finds an empirical correlation between the home country tax rate of a parent and the net of tax profitability of its German affiliate that is consistent with profit shifting behavior. For profitable affiliates that are directly owned by a foreign investor the evidence suggests that a 10-percentage point increase in the parent's home country tax rate leads to roughly half a percentage point increase in the profitability of the German subsidiary. On the outbound side of German FDI, the data provides some evidence that tax rate changes in the host country lead to a stronger change in after-tax profitability for affiliates that are wholly owned, which may reflect the larger flexibility of these firms in carrying out tax minimizing behavior without interference of minority owners.","[Weichenrieder, Alfons J.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Weichenrieder, Alfons J.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Weichenrieder, Alfons J.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford, England",Goethe University Frankfurt; Ifo Institut; University of Oxford,"Weichenrieder, AJ (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.",a.weichenrieder@em.uni-frankfurt.de,"Weichenrieder, Alfons J/J-9407-2012",,,,,,27,76,81,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Both short-run and long-run situations are analysed. It is well known that tourism converts non-traded goods into tradable goods. An increase in the demand for a non-traded good raises its relative price, which results in an expansion of the non-traded sector at the expense of the traded goods sector. This output shift raises labour employment in the short run. However, in the long run, the higher relative price leads to higher wages, resulting in a negative impact on labour employment. If the output effect is dominant, the expansion in tourism raises employment and welfare. However, under realistic conditions tourism may lower both labour employment and welfare due to rising costs. These results are demonstrated by simulating a dynamic model for the case of Hong Kong.","[Hazari, Bharat R.] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chao, Chi-Chur] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Laffargue, Jean-Pierre] Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France",City University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Hazari, BR (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bhazari@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,13,13,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

In the literature, it is usually assumed that all the agents are endowed with cardinally comparable, additive, and monotone utility functions. In many economic and political situations violations of these assumptions may arise. We show how a family of cardinally comparable utility functions can be obtained starting directly from the agents' preferences, and how it fair division of the land is feasible, without additivity or monotonicity requirements. Moreover, if the land to be divided can be modeled as a finite dimensional simplex, it is possible to obtain envy free (and a fortiori fair) divisions of it into subsirnplexes.

If supply falls short of demand, then price increases or voluntary demand reductions might help to maintain the balance in the system. Should these prove insufficient, then rationing is necessary. Rationing means interrupting the electricity delivery to certain areas or specific electricity users in order to preserve system stability. Since the cost of an interruption differs among electricity users, the social cost of different rationing mechanisms varies. This paper explores the cost difference between efficient regional rationing (minimizing social costs by rationing regions with low costs first) and random rationing (not taking into account social costs). For this the value of lost load calculations of De Nooij et al. [De Nooij, M., Bijvoet, C.C., Koopmans, C.C., (2007).

It is well known that many topologies are not efficient for network games. We characterize efficient topologies in network games with a finite set of players, each wishing to transmit an atomic unit of unsplittable flow. We distinguish between two classes of atomic network routing games. In network congestion games a player's cost is the sum of the costs of the edges it traverses, while in bottleneck routing games, it is its maximum edge cost. In both classes, the social cost is the maximum cost among the players' costs. We show that for symmetric network congestion games the efficient topologies are Extension Parallel networks, while for symmetric bottleneck routing games the efficient topologies are Series Parallel networks.

We implemented a randomized field experiment to ask whether provision of insurance against a major source of production risk induces farmers to take out loans to adopt a new crop technology. The study sample was composed of roughly 800 maize and groundnut farmers in Malawi, where by far the dominant source of production risk is the level of rainfall. We randomly selected half of the farmers to be offered credit to purchase high-yielding hybrid maize and groundnut seeds for planting in the November 2006 crop season. The other half of farmers were offered a similar credit package, but were also required to purchase (at actuarially fair rates) a weather insurance policy that partially or fully forgave the loan in the event of poor rainfall. Surprisingly, take-up was lower by 13 percentage points among farmers offered insurance with the loan. Take-up was 33.0% for farmers who were offered the uninsured loan. There is Suggestive evidence that reduced take-up of the insured loan was due to farmers already having implicit insurance from the limited liability clause in the loan contract: insured loan take-up was positively correlated with farmer education, income, and wealth, which may proxy for the individual's default costs. By contrast, take-up of the uninsured loan Was uncorrelated with these farmer characteristics. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings establish that when costs are symmetric, price matching guarantees significantly increase market prices. In markets with cost asymmetries, guaranteed prices remain high relative to prices without the use of guarantees, but the overall ability of price guarantees to act as a collusion facilitating device becomes contingent on the relative cost difference. Lesser use of guarantees, combined with lower average prices and slower convergence to the collusive level, suggests that the mere presence of cost asymmetries may curtail collusive behavior.

We explore the effect of the concern for relative consumption on the growth rate and the welfare of an economy where agents appropriate from a common property resource. Our model shows that the greater is agents' concern about their relative status, the more aggressively they tend to behave. Consequently, social welfare is lower because the growth rate of the public asset is reduced due to higher extraction rate. We also consider the effect of increased heterogeneity, and show that social welfare decreases as the distribution of status-consciousness among agents widens. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the basic model, maintenance spending affects both the durability and efficiency of public capital. The balanced growth path is derived and transitional dynamics associated with a revenue-neutral increase in expenditure on maintenance are analyzed. The model is then extended to account for the possibility that public spending on maintenance affects also the durability of private capital. The growth-maximizing tax rate and share of infrastructure investment are calculated in both cases. First- and second-best welfare-maximizing solutions are also discussed.","[Agenor, Pierre-Richard] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Agenor, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Pierre-richard.Agenor@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,12,23,28,1,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

In this paper, I contribute to this literature by proposing a unified structure to marry the two conflicting views. I argue that overcoming diseases are of prime importance at an early stage of economic development, whereas institutions are more important at a later stage.

The (best) response of a coalition is defined to be an operator from sets of conjectures to sets of strategies. A strategy is epistemic coalitionally rationalizable if it is consistent with rationality and common certainty that every coalition is rational. A characterization of this solution set is provided for operators satisfying four basic properties. Special attention is devoted to an operator that leads to a solution concept that is generically equivalent to the iteratively defined concept of coalitional rationalizability. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We present evidence that comovements in macroeconomic variables do not concern only real activity, but are an important feature also of stock market returns, inflation rates, interest rates and, to a smaller extent, monetary aggregates. Both common sources of shocks and similar transmission mechanisms explain international comovements, with the only exception of Japan, where the idiosyncratic features seem to dominate. Finally. concerning the origin of global shocks, evidence of both global supply-side and demand-side disturbances is found. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper considers such a firm, which controls group entry by setting a series of anonymous prices. We show that private provision systematically leads to two distortions relative to the efficient solution: first, agents are segregated too finely; second, too many agents are excluded from all groups. We demonstrate that these distortions are a consequence of anonymous pricing and do not depend upon the nature of the peer effects. This general approach also allows us to assess the way the 'returns to scale' of peer technology and the cost of group formation affect the optimal group structure.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Board, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",sboard@econ.ucla.edu,,,,,,,31,12,15,1,14,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Inferences from previous investigations have been confounded with issues concerning the preference functionals of the agents. Here, we present an innovative experimental design which is driven purely by dominance: if preferences satisfy dominance, we can infer whether subjects are planning or not. We implement three sets of experiments: the first two (the Individual Treatments) in which the same player takes decisions both in the present and the future; and the third (the Pairs Treatment) in which different players take decisions at different times. The two Individual treatments differed in that, in one, the subjects played sequentially, while, in the other, the subjects had to pre-commit to their future move. In all contexts, according to economic theory, the players in the present should anticipate the decision of the player in the future. We find that over half the participants in all three experimental treatments do not appear to be planning ahead; moreover, their ability to plan ahead does not improve with experience, except possibly when we force subjects to pre-commit to their future decision. These findings identify an important lacuna in economic theories, both for individual behaviour and for behaviour in games.","[Bone, John; Hey, John D.; Suckling, John] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Hey, John D.] LUISS, Rome, Italy",University of York - UK; Luiss Guido Carli University,"Hey, JD (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",jdb1@york.ac.uk; jdh1@york.ac.uk; jrs1@york.ac.uk,"Suckling, John/ABD-7246-2021","Suckling, John/0000-0002-5098-1527",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-27-0077] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,7,16,17,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

This paper develops a quality-ladder growth model with overlapping intellectual property rights and capital accumulation to quantitatively evaluate the effects of blocking patents. The analysis focuses on two policy variables (a) patent breadth that determines the amount of profits created by an invention and (b) the profit-sharing rule that determines the distribution of profits between current and former inventors along the quality ladder. The model is calibrated to aggregate data of the US economy. Under parameter values that match key features of the US economy and show equilibrium R&D underinvestment, I find that optimizing the profit-sharing rule of blocking patents would lead to a significant increase in R&D, consumption and welfare. Also, the paper derives and quantifies a dynamic distortionary effect of patent policy on capital accumulation.","Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chu, AC (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",angusccc@econ.sinica.edu.tw,"Chu, Angus/GNH-3700-2022",,,,,,45,58,58,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Standard models cannot account for this phenomenon. This paper develops and estimates a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model that can account for this key regularity. My model incorporates three shocks to the economy: monetary policy shocks, neutral technology shocks, and embodied technology shocks in the capital-producing sector. The estimated model is able to account for the response of the U.S. economy to all three shocks.

A number of countries, especially in Eastern Europe and West Africa, have recently undergone significant reforms to make employment laws more flexible. Conversely, several countries in Latin America have made employment laws more rigid. These reforms are larger in magnitude than any reforms in developed countries and their study can produce new insights on the benefits of labor regulation.

Combining this with historical data on national savings rates, we are able to investigate the relationship for 11 developed countries over the period 1921-2002. We find no consistent relationship between lagged top income shares and current savings rates, and our standard errors are small enough that we are able to reject more than modest effects in either direction.

The important results on the existence of equilibrium in this model assume that there is a finite number of commodities traded in each spot market and that preferences are given by smooth utility functions. With these assumptions an equilibrium exists outside an exceptional set of assets structures and initial endowments. The present paper extends these results by allowing for general infinite dimensional commodity spaces in each spot market. These include all the important commodity spaces studied in the literature on the existence of Walrasian equilibrium-in each spot market the consumption sets are the positive cone of an arbitrary locally solid Riesz space or of an ordered topological vector space with order unit or of a locally solid Riesz space with quasi-interior point. The paper establishes that even with our very general commodity spaces there exists an equilibrium for a very dense set of assets structures. Our approach is in the main convex analytic and the results do not require that preferences be smooth or complete or transitive.

Restricting aid to single mothers, for instance, has the potential to distort behaviour along three demographic margins: marriage, fertility, and divorce. We contrast the Canadian and the U.S. policies within an equilibrium model of household formation and human capital investment on children. Policy differences we consider are eligibility, dependence of transfers on the number of children, and generosity of transfers. Our simulations indicate that the policy differences can account for the higher rate of single-parenthood in the U.S. They also show that Canadian welfare policy is more effective for fostering human capital accumulation among children from poor families. Interestingly, a majority of agents in our benchmark economy prefers a welfare system that targets single mothers (as the U.S. system does), yet (unlike the U.S. system) does not make transfers dependent on the number of children.","[Guner, Nezih] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Knowles, John] Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Econ Div, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of Southampton,"Guner, N (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",nguner@eco.uc3m.es; J.A.Knowles@soton.ac.uk,"Guner, Nezih/L-8382-2014","Guner, Nezih/0000-0003-4604-4159",,,,,46,6,8,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Two primary hypotheses have been advanced to explain the famine. One is that China experienced three consecutive years of bad weather while the other is that national policies were wrong in that they reduced and misallocated agricultural production. The relative importance of these two factors to the famine remains controversial among China scholars. This paper uses provincial-level demographic panel data and a Bayesian empirical approach in an effort to distinguish the relative importance of weather and national policy on China's great demographic disaster. Consistent with the qualitative literature in this area, we find that national policy played an overall more important role in the famine than weather. However, we provide new quantitative evidence that weather was also an important factor, particularly in those provinces that experienced excessively wet conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Welfare obtained under different implementations of the USO depends on whether use of the unit subsidy is limited or not. In this respect, franchise bidding for the USO, where firms submit bids for lump-sum subsidies, is welfare-dominated by the exogenous choice of the USP and by pay-or-play regulation. Similarly, the second-best allocation can be attained through the endogenous choice of the USP's geographic area of monopoly, provided the unit subsidy instrument is available. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A gravity model is used to empirically assess the effectiveness of the convergence criteria by examining location-specific advantages that guide multinational investment within the European Union. A fixed effects model based on a panel data of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows within the EU-15 shows that horizontal investment promotes the diffusion of the production process across the national border.

However, these models only offer two points in time: one before a trade reform and the other after the reform. As such, they do not provide a region of acceptance or rejection, which enables us to test the models empirically. Our study overcomes those problems, develops an intervention model, estimates the impulse response function and estimates the short-term and the long-run impacts of NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) on the variable representing Canada's welfare.

Under such concept the overarching objective of development in developing countries is the reduction of poverty over a reasonable time horizon. Though highly restrictive, the standard money metric approach to the measurement of poverty could provide the required policy framework. Growth enhancing policies (that increase per capita consumption expenditure), as well as inequality reducing policies (that enhance the opportunities for individuals to participate in the development process) recommend themselves as the relevant policies in post-conflict situations. Given recent experience with economic policy reforms post-conflict countries desiring to transit to sustainable development need to define what constitutes good policy bench marks in their respective circumstances rather than adopting cross-country based benchmarks.","Arab Planning Inst, Kuwait, Kuwait",,"Ali, AAG (通讯作者)，Arab Planning Inst, Kuwait, Kuwait.",aali@api.org.kw,,,,,,,55,1,3,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

As most UK retail banks have located their branch networks in different combinations within the regions and nations of the United Kingdom, the availability of banking services across the United Kingdom differs. This study examines whether this uneven dispersion of bank branching is associated with deposit account interest rate setting by UK banks over the sample period 1992 to 2006. While banks with branch networks predominately located in certain regions set deposit interest rates at different levels, the degree of overlap between bank branch networks is not a significant factor in deposit interest rate setting. These findings have importance for the definition of banking markets in competition assessments and future assessments of interest rate setting within international banking markets where bank branching restrictions have been lifted.","[Ashton, John K.] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich NR4 6PG, Norfolk, England; [Ashton, John K.] Univ E Anglia, ESRC Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 6PG, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of East Anglia,"Ashton, JK (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich NR4 6PG, Norfolk, England.",j.ashton@uea.ac.uk,"Ashton, john/W-7178-2018","Ashton, john/0000-0002-1132-0857",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-578-28-0001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,40,3,3,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Both the parametric stochastic frontier and the non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods show that the degree of technical efficiency has increased during the transition, and that farm specialisation associated with technological change is found to be a crucial determinant for increasing technical efficiency. A negative impact of farm commercialisation on technical efficiency is found, explained by the specific nature of livestock farms, in particular, with intra-farm intermediary consumption. The use of hired labour has no significant influence, but mixed results are found for rented land.

This article applies quarterly data for four regions in Taiwan during the 1981-2004 period and the empirical results indicate that regional diversity can reduce the national unemployment rate, and this is solid support for the hypothesis of inter-regional migration. To further evaluate this, the interactions among regional unemployment rates are tested using the seemingly unrelated regression estimation approach, where the negative correlations of the regional residuals show that inter-regional migration is indeed an important common factor among regions. An isolated regional labour market with the highest unemployment rate in Taiwan re-confirms that inter-regional migration plays a critical role in lowering national unemployment. In sum, regional diversity can induce migration, which then reduces national unemployment.","Chang Jung Univ, Dept Int Business, Tainan, Taiwan",Chang Jung Christian University,"Chiang, SH (通讯作者)，Chang Jung Univ, Dept Int Business, Tainan, Taiwan.",shuhen@mail.cjcu.edu.tw,"Chiang, Shu-hen/AAS-6562-2021",,,,,,28,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By using the dynamics of natural gas price movements (and other explanatory variables), we can forecast the dynamics of movements in the production of textiles, leather, fur and clothes, rubber and plastic-based products, metals, furniture, as well as in the processing industry, recycling, electricity, natural gas, steam and hot water supplies in Slovenia.

Using a panel of politically relevant dyads, I find robust empirical evidence that human capital may significantly decrease the likelihood of militarized conflict between nations.

Due to this, the study focuses on its characterization from two standpoints. In the first part, position of foreign controlled enterprises (FCE) is investigated in comparison with nationally controlled firms - domestic enterprises (DE). There are discovered all differences in the position of these firms in the economy as well as in their performance parameters, while particular attention is being devoted to manufacturing industry, where the foreign controlled firms occupy the key position. Apparently, majority of the domestic business sector consists of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The second part of the study deals with the SMEs in comparison with big enterprises.

Unlike traditional parametric methods used to analyse state tax revenue variability, the portfolio approach allows the computation of a tax's share of total tax revenue that minimizes the overall variability in total state tax revenue given a state's portfolio of tax revenue sources. The model can thus be used to evaluate how closely a state's revenue portfolio is constructed to minimize variability in total state tax revenue. An empirical application of the model is conducted on a sample of US states. The volatility model presented here serves as a useful complement to parametric techniques that have been used to estimate tax revenue variability.","Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO 63166 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Garrett, T (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, POB 442, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",garrett@stls.frb.org,,,,,,,7,6,6,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

An eGovernment Interoperability Framework (eGIF) is one way to achieve eGovernment interoperability. An eGIF is a set of standards and guidelines that a government uses to specify the preferred way that its agencies, citizens and partners interact with each other. eGIF includes: ... the basic technical specifications that all agencies relevant to the eGovernment strategy implementation should adopt. eGovernment Interoperability Frameworks appear as the governmental policy cornerstones for deploying joined-up information systems and providing one-stop services to citizens and businesses. Lack of interoperability is due to a number of factors. It may be due to policy reasons. Privacy, particularly as it relates to personal health information and national security, are good examples. Lack of interoperability also has to do with the heterogeneous nature of government information systems the result of past decisions regarding hardware, software, and legacy systems. There is also the turf issue various agencies want their own systems and are worried about sharing data and/or common services. Lastly, the network effect of some companies that use proprietary standards have helped create some of the current problems. Many governments did not know they had a choice, nor were they aware of the long-term effects of their procurements. Thus, to achieve interoperability, there needs to be a desire for transformation and the cooperation of the various agencies of government. Unless commitment to achieving interoperability is demonstrated at the highest levels, a plethora of policies, as well as bureaucratic and narrowly construed corporate interests can always be used to challenge efforts to make interoperability happen. In order to come up to the expectations of their stakeholders and to achieve real resolution of the evolving interoperability problems, the scope of the eGIFs needs to be extended, including service composition and discovery, development and management of semantic schemas for governmental documents, certification mechanisms and authentication standards. Moreover, a shift from a paper-based specification towards a repository of services, data schemas and process models is needed, in order to serve the ever-changing nature of governments under transformation. Upon conducting a state of the art analysis of relevant frameworks at a pan-European and national level, lessons learnt from the pioneers UK eGIF, German SAGA and Greek eGIF are presented. The proposed Lithuanian eGIF model describes new approach outlines the technical, semantic and organization dimensions and stresses the importance of political interoperability. It also provides three layers model moving from only standards and specifications based approach to systems and coordination support elements. Finally the paper tackles the issues that rose within stakeholders' community in the eGovernment interoperability context.","[Gatautis, Rimantas; Vitkauskaite, Elena] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Kulvietis, Genadijus] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Gatautis, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",rgataut@ktu.lt; gk@fm.vgtu.lt; elevitk@ktu.lt,"Vitkauskaitė, Elena/A-7574-2010","Vitkauskaitė, Elena/0000-0003-3421-4093",,,,,28,8,9,0,15,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The effects of privatization are thus more nuanced than suggested in earlier studies.

To tackle this weakness a broad mixture of policy measures was carried out in recent years. Particular attention is drawn to the development of industry concentrations and economic 'clusters'. However, little is known about the effectiveness of these policy measures regarding how industry concentrations in fact promote innovative performance in Eastern Germany. The present study tries to fill this gap by analysing the relationship between industry concentration in Eastern Germany and regional innovative performance. Our empirical analysis is based upon the number of patent applications of 22 manufacturing industries in 22 Eastern German planning regions. The estimated regression models indicate an inverted-U relationship between the degree of industry concentration and innovative performance. An exceedingly high degree of industry concentration in one region hampers regional innovative output.

Comparison of subjective probabilities with actual outcomes shows that the probabilities have considerable predictive power in situations where individuals have considerable private information, such as survival and retirement. In contrast, the subjective probability of a stock market gain varies greatly across individuals even though no one has private information and the outcome is the same for everyone. An explanation is that there is considerable variation in accessing and processing information. Further, the subjective probability of a stock market gain is considerably lower than historical averages, providing an explanation for the relatively low frequency of stock holding. An important research objective will be to understand how individuals form their subjective probabilities.","[Hurd, Michael D.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA; [Hurd, Michael D.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",RAND Corporation; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hurd, MD (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA.",mhurd@rand.org,,,"NIA NIH HHS [P01 AG026571, P01 AG008291, P01 AG008291-15] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,35,139,148,0,27,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4601-0,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Job seekers are divided into four employability groups according to their labour market status. The dataset consists of highly disaggregated monthly data from 146 Local Labour Offices in Finland over 14 years. The results indicate that the employability of job seekers differs. Therefore, the composition of the pool of job seekers in a local labour market affects the ability of that market to form successful matches. The long-term unemployed have a negative effect on matches while job seekers out of the labour force notably improve the production of matches.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla,"Hynninen, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",sanna-mari.hynninen@econ.jyu.fi,,,,,,,19,4,4,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

However, because of the lumpy nature and irreversibility of investments and the presence of uncertainty about future economic developments, a specific percentage change in relative prices and output demand may not always lead to the same percentage change in capital stocks. That means that different regimes may exist in investment behaviour. We test whether such regimes exist using high-quality data on eight manufacturing industries in the Netherlands. Three different regimes can be identified that are characterized by differences in the relative input price levels and we find that if relative prices take on extreme values, the propensity to adjust the scale of production to changes in demand is very low.","[Jacobs, Jan; Kuper, Gerard H.] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ & Econometr, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Jacobs, Jan; Kuper, Gerard H.] Univ Groningen, SOM, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [van Soest, Daan P.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Soest, Daan P.] Tilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Jacobs, J (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Econ & Econometr, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",j.p.a.m.jacobs@rug.nl,"van Soest, Daan P/C-5544-2013; Jacobs, Jan/GRX-7316-2022","van Soest, Daan P/0000-0002-3100-1810; Kuper, Gerard/0000-0003-4316-418X; Jacobs, Jan/0000-0002-7994-5175",,,,,19,4,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By forward induction, cooperation is incentive-compatibly self-enforcing.

Such diversification is socially beneficial, because it reduces the transmission of factor price volatility, like oil-price shocks, to consumer prices. Therefore, many countries have implemented policies aimed at increasing technological diversification. The question is whether such policies are necessary. We use a two-stage investment model to address this question in the setting of perfect competition and of a monopoly. We show that factor price uncertainty leads to diversification, if capital is not too expensive, and that this diversification is due to each firm investing in a diversified technology portfolio. An important implication of this form of diversification is that technological diversity is socially optimal, even in the case of a monopoly. Thus policy intervention is unnecessary and might even be detrimental.","Univ Basel, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Krysiak, FC (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland.",frank.krysiak@unibas.ch,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,6,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We propose a theoretical justification for the skewness of the inefficiency term, arguing that this skewness is the key testable hypothesis of the frontier approach. We propose to test the regression residuals for skewness in order to distinguish the two competing approaches.

We find that Korea's income tax system has a surprisingly high level of gap between economic income and taxable income, due to remarkably generous levels of allowance and deduction. These have made nearly half of total taxpayers, specifically 47% in 2000, to pay no taxes effectively. Having analysed the impact of each component of Korea's income tax system on overall progressivity, we find that deduction policy has more impact on progressivity than tax rates and allowance. We highlight that tax credit has played an opposite role in determining the level of progressivity, which is regressive.

Equilibrium wages, equilibrium job assignments, and the strength of career-concern incentives are the same for all employment histories that lead to the same worker's reputation. (With reputation we refer to beliefs about the worker's future productivity.) We show that, typically, workers with better reputation have stronger incentives than workers with worse reputation. Furthermore, we show that when the strength of incentives depends on employment history, (i) a ratchet effect may appear, (ii) in spite of this ratchet effect, incentives may be stronger, and (iii) incentives may be stronger when beliefs about ability are more precise.","Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Richmond, VA 23219 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond,"Martinez, L (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Richmond, VA 23219 USA.",leo14627@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,10,10,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

As certification is not randomly assigned but there is 'self-selection into treatment', we use propensity matching methods to estimate the causal effect of certification on the change in the firms' value of export sales between 2000 and 2004.

If crude oil production is a non-linear process, conventional unit root tests, which assume linear and systematic adjustment. could interpret departure from linearity as permanent stochastic disturbances. The objective of this paper is to test for non-linearities and unit roots in crude oil production. To realize our objective, this study applies a threshold autoregressive model with an autoregressive unit root to monthly crude oil production for 17 OPEC and non-OPEC countries over the period January 1973 to December 2007. Specifically, first we test for the presence of non-linearities (threshold effects) in the production of crude oil in two regimes. Second, we test for a unit root against a non-linear stationary process in two regimes and a partial unit root process when the unit root is present in one regime only. We find that crude oil production is characterized by threshold effects. We find that for eleven of the countries a unit root was present in both regimes, while for the others a partial unit root was found to be present in either the first regime or second regime.

On the other hand, various statistical tests applied to the SRCs show that there are significant differences among the high-income, middle-income and low-income country groups with regards to the salient aspects of capital mobility. First, there are significant differences in the average SRCs of the country groups. Second, the SRCs are differently distributed around their means among the country groups.

Several theories have emerged on the nature of the firm: the neo-classical theory of the firm, the principal agency theory, the transaction cost theory, the property rights theory, the resource-based theory and the evolutionary theory. Each of these theories identify some elements that describe the nature of the firm, but no single theory is comprehensive enough to include all elements of the nature of the firm. Economists began to seek a theory capable of describing the nature of the firm within a single, all-encompassing, coherent framework. We propose a unified theory of the firm, which encompasses all elements of the firm. We then evaluate performances of Korean firms from the unified theory of the firm perspective.

The end result was creation of a dual economy: highly favored manufacturing sector with high and rigid wages and neglected agricultural sector with low wages and poverty. Because of the higher wages in the manufacturing sector, the rural laborers migrate to the urban sector, a typical characteristic of the Harris-Todaro developing economy. Realizing this crisis, the Indian government recently initiated policies to boost agricultural production to curb the labor migration and improve the welfare of the rural population. In this study, we develop a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for India by incorporating Harris-Todaro economic characteristics of unemployment, labor migration, farm dependant population, and labor-intensive agriculture. We use the model to analyze the effects of agricultural production subsidy policies on employment, factor price, output price, output levels, and welfare in agricultural and manufacturing sectors. Our findings show that agricultural production subsidy increases agricultural production, reduces unemployment, raises the wage rate in the agriculture sector, augments the consumption among the rural and urban households, and increases the rental rate for capital in agricultural sector.","[Razack, Abdul] Global Energy Decis, Sacramento, CA 95838 USA; [Devadoss, Stephen] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Holland, David] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; Washington State University,"Razack, A (通讯作者)，Global Energy Decis, Sacramento, CA 95838 USA.",razackabdual@yahoo.com,,,,,,,24,8,10,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In particular, I show that higher income inequality may benefit the poor via a trickle-down effect operating through the entry of firms into the market.","Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Tarasov, A (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",alexander.tarasov@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,"Tarasov, Alexander/M-6371-2015","Tarasov, Alexander/0000-0002-4393-9419",,,,,17,3,3,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Our findings support the view that if research institutions are encouraged to engage only in those lines of research that are likely to receive the highest rating according to the adopted evaluation criteria, a convergence process is to be expected within Economics, resulting in a disregard of heterodox schools and historical methods in favour of mainstream approaches and quantitative methods. In our view, a proper fine-tuning of the assessment methodology is needed, before subsequent rankings can be used as a guide for the allocation of public financing among research institutions. In the case of Economics, this means overcoming the limits of commonly adopted peer review approaches, through the development of proper evaluation designs and the integration of qualitative appraisals with quantitative indicators.

Our main finding is that they do so, albeit in a different way than theory predicts. The importance of the first mover's social preferences for trusting behavior is recognized by the owner subjects, but the significant (first order) impact second movers' social preferences have on trusting behavior of first movers seems to be overlooked.

Yet its causes remain poorly understood. We suggest in this paper that the level of others' happiness may be a risk factor for suicide (although one's own happiness likely protects one from suicide). Using U.S. and international data, the paper provides evidence for a paradox: the happiest places tend to have the highest suicide rates. The analysis appears to be the first published study to be able to combine rich individual-level data sets one on life satisfaction in a newly available random sample of 1.3 million Americans and another on suicide decisions among an independent random sample of about 1 million Americans to establish this dark-contrasts paradox in a consistent way across U.S. states. The study also replicates the finding for the Western industrialized nations. The paradox, which holds individual characteristics constant, is not an artifact of population composition or confounding factors (or of the ecological fallacy). We conclude with a discussion of the possible role of relative comparisons of utility. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper revisits the Graue study in the context of the current recession using a simple institutional economic framework. Consistent with Graue, we begin shortly after the implementation of the Bankruptcy Abuse Protection and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) and follow its evolution to the present time. Our analysis suggests that, since passage of BAPCPA, both total filings and Chapter 7 filings decreased significantly, however temporarily. Moreover, Chapter 7 filings as a percentage of Chapter 13 filings also temporarily decreased. These results are not only consistent with Crane's analysis, but also demonstrate that the institutional characteristics of bankruptcy law have a profound impact on the decision to file for bankruptcy and the chapter under which a petitioner files.","[Friesner, Dan] N Dakota State Univ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Friesner, Dan; Hackney, Donald; McPherson, Matthew] Gonzaga Univ, Spokane, WA USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; Gonzaga University,"Friesner, D (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",,"Friesner, Daniel/AAK-2377-2020",,,,,,49,0,0,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Although there has been extensive prior research in both fields, there remains a large disconnect between the source of gender differences in pro-sociality and experimental research aimed at informing cooperation and generosity. Thus, the main contribution of our article is to bridge this gap by arguing that differences in male and female motives for pro-sociality stem, at least in part, from gender differences in mating strategies. In particular, we discuss gender differences in: (i) signaling behaviors; (ii) conformance to social norms; and (iii) approaches toward resolving intra- and inter-group dilemmas. This article may be a useful resource for those hoping to gain a better understanding of the foundations of gender differences in pro-sociality; likewise, it draws useful attention to empirical research aimed at promoting charitable giving and enhancing resource allocation efficiency.

Our results suggest that the composition of capital flows matters, crises can explain the volatility of portfolio flows and foreign direct investment, and modeling them as endogenous breakpoints improves the results considerably. By using data from the Turkish economy, we estimate these breakpoints together with the parameters of the model and find that they correspond to international and domestic crises that hit the country. Although both components are affected by similar crises, direct investment reacts strongly to the domestic crisis, while portfolios flows are more sensitive to global financial conditions. Breaks also have an effect on the significance and sign of determinants of each type of international investment. Evidence indicates changes in all coefficients in both investment types and suggests that analyses assuming parameter constancy lead to misleading results if they ignore the influence of endogenous breaks.

What is the set of outcomes that are consistent with common knowledge of rationality and market clearing? To address this question we define an epistemic model for the economy that provides a complete description not only of the beliefs of each agent on the relationship between states of nature and prices but also of the whole system of interactive beliefs. The main result, Theorem 1, provides a characterization of outcomes that are consistent with common knowledge of rationality and market clearing (henceforth, CKRMC outcomes) in terms of a solution notion - Ex-Post Rationalizability - that is defined directly in terms of the parameters that define the economy. CKRMC manifests several intuitive properties that stand in contrast to the full revelation property of Rational Expectations Equilibrium. In particular, for a robust class of economies: (1) there is a continuum of prices that are consistent with CKRMC in every state of nature, and hence these prices do not reveal the true state, (2) the range of CKRMC outcomes is monotonically decreasing as agents become more informed about the economic fundamentals, and (3) trade is consistent with common knowledge of rationality and market clearing even when there is common knowledge that there are no mutual gains from trade.

Our findings reveal several interesting facts. First, the time-varying degree of integration of four emerging regions under consideration, satisfactorily explained by the regional level of trade openness and the term premium of US interest rates, has recently tended to increase, but these markets still remain substantially segmented from the world market. Second, the local market risk premium is found to explain more than 50% of the total risk premium for emerging market returns. Finally, we show that conditional correlations usually underestimate and overstate the measure of time-varying market integration. The empirical results of this study have some important implications for both global investors and policymakers with respect to dedicated portfolio investments in emerging markets and policy adjustments.

The work is based on recent methods of separating realized volatility into two components: continuous and jump volatilities. In addition, the link between future price volatility and current observable economic variables is examined. The measures-trading volume, time-to-maturity, asymmetric effect from negative shocks, and intra-week seasonality are assessed to identify improvements in day-ahead predictions. The model where the total variation is separated into its continuous and jump components is compared with the simpler heterogeneous autoregressive model of realized variation both in- and out-of-sample. The results show a strong degree of persistence in realized volatility, and significant impacts from the mentioned market measures when predicting Nord Pool forward price volatility. Hence, there is a clear preference for models accounting for the systematic impact of market measures to improve volatility assessment for tomorrow. Moreover, separating the total variation into continuous and jump components seems potentially useful when predicting day-ahead volatility. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

When a large trader issues a derivative and (partially) hedges his risk by trading in the underlying, he influences both his hedge portfolio and the derivative's payoff. In a Black-Scholes model with a price impact on the drift, we analyze the resulting trade-off by explicitly solving the utility maximization problem of a large investor endowed with an illiquid contingent claim. We find several interesting phenomena which cannot occur in frictionless markets. First, the indifference price is a convex function of the contingent claim - and not concave as in frictionless markets implying that for any claim the buyer's indifference price is larger than the seller's indifference price. Second, the seller's indifference prices of large positions in derivatives are smaller than the Black-Scholes replication costs. Therefore, a large trader might have an incentive to issue options if they are traded at Black-Scholes prices. Furthermore, he hedges option positions only partly if he has a negative price impact and thus exploits his ability to manipulate the option's payoff. For a positive price impact he overhedges the option position leading to an extra profit from the stock position exceeding a perfect hedge. Finally, we also study a model where the large shareholder has a price impact on both drift and volatility. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The DSGE receives a substantial weight in the pool (at short horizons) provided the VAR components exclude structural breaks. In this case, the inflation forecast densities exhibit calibration failure. Allowing for structural breaks in the VARs reduces the weight on the DSGE considerably, but produces well-calibrated forecast densities for inflation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In April 1929, a fruit fly infestation in Florida forced the U.S. government to quarantine fruit shipments from the state and destroy infested groves. In July, depositors panicked in Tampa and surrounding cities. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta rushed currency to member banks beset by runs. We show that this intervention arrested the panic and estimate that bank failures would have been twice as high without the Federal Reserve's intervention.

Building on Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001), we introduce physical capital; internal costly investment in both capital and R & D; and complementarities between intermediate goods. We only find a positive relationship between the relative labour endowment and both the skill premium and economic growth within determined intervals of relative labour endowment values, which vary with the absolute productive advantage of high over low-skilled labour. The model thus accommodates theoretically mixed empirical results on the relative labour endowment-skill premium relationship. We further find that the impact on both the relative labour endowment and the skill premium of a rise in investment costs or in the complementarities degree depends on: (i) the absolute productivity advantage of high over low-skilled labour; and (ii) the relative labour endowment.

Their main result concerns the existence of a mixed Nash equilibrium and an associated sharing rule. Its proof is based on a discrete approximation scheme from within the payoff correspondence. Here, we present a new, related closure result for games with possibly noncompact action spaces, involving a sequence of Nash equilibria. In contrast to Simon and Zame (Econometrica 58:861-872, 1990), this result can be used for more involved forms of approximation, because it contains more information about the endogenous sharing rule. With such added precision, the closure result can be used for the actual computation of endogenous sharing rules in games with discontinuous payoffs by means of successive continuous interpolations in an approximation scheme. This is demonstrated for a Bertrand type duopoly game and for a location game already considered by Simon and Zame. Moreover, the main existence result of Simon and Zame (Econometrica 58:861-872, 1990) follows in two different ways from the closure result.","Univ Utrecht, Math Inst, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Balder, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Math Inst, POB 80-010, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands.",E.J.Balder@uu.nl,,,,,,,23,13,13,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The macrodynamics of the model results from the combination of the commitment to maintain the peg - that makes liquidity closely dependent on the dynamics of foreign reserves - and the non-linear real and financial interactions that drives the pro-cyclical behaviour of the economy. Within this context, the external financing ease during an economic upswing leads to debt-supported growth and financial fragility; the consequent deterioration of profitability expectations brings about a capital reversal that, in the absence of monetary stabilisation tools, makes the currency arrangement unsustainable. A financial crisis may thus turn into a currency crisis. We run a continuous-time estimation of a non-linear differential equations system for Argentina during the years of the currency-board arrangement. We find that two steady-state solutions exist. The local stability and sensitivity analysis show that both equilibria are unstable and that the qualitative nature of the equilibria depends in particular on lenders' responsiveness to the degree of leverage. We also show that relaxing the assumption on the currency arrangement and allowing for an autonomous monetary policy makes both equilibria stable. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, amidst calls for a new approach to economic management, there is a danger that a new policy framework may overlook underlying economic governance structures that exist (and may evolve) within the economy. Such oversight has implications for development. This paper seeks to demonstrate that the long run efficacy of industrial strategy depends upon designing appropriate economic governance structures that serve the wider public interest. It does so by exploring past experiences of industrial strategy, drawing lessons from the USA, the UK, Japan, the third Italy and the emerging and transition economies.

The key features are indivisible labor, nonseparable preferences, and bargaining. Their results are derived only for a special case of bargaining, take-it-or-leave-it offer by buyers. Instead of bargaining, this paper considers competitive search. I show that the results of Rocheteau et al. can be generalized to an environment where both buyers and sellers have nonseparable preferences. In addition, the relationship between inflation and unemployment is robust to allowing free entry by sellers, which cannot be studied in Rocheteau et al.

However, conventional trade theory models assume that producers can directly access foreign consumers. We introduce intermediaries in an international trade model where producers differ with respect to productivity as well as regarding their varieties' perceived quality and tradability. Trade intermediation is prone to frictions owing to the absence of enforceable cross-country contracts while own wholesale subsidiaries require additional capital investment. The sorting pattern of firms depends on their degree of competitive advantage; the equilibrium prevalence of intermediation in the industry depends negatively on the heterogeneity among producers, and the market-specificity of goods, and positively on expropriation risk. Using sectoral US export data by destination country, we confirm the empirical validity of these predictions.","[Felbermayr, Gabriel] Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Felbermayr, Gabriel] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany; [Jung, Benjamin] Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Felbermayr, G (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",felbermayr@ifo.de; benjamin.jung@uni-tuebingen.de,,"Felbermayr, Gabriel/0000-0003-4984-9745",,,,,19,46,50,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

While some results are obtained from Johansen's VECM model, most of the analysis is carried out within an Error-Correction ARDL framework, following the bounds testing approach of Pesaran et al. (2001). Besides showing that an aggregate equation for intermediate imports can be satisfactorily estimated, the paper focuses on two specific results. First, exports have a very significant effect on imports, and failure to control for this effect (as in most previous studies) can yield misleading results, like an over-estimation of the output elasticity of imports. Second, the response of imports to variations in the real exchange rate has fallen over time, presumably because of the rising share of maquila in Mexico's export basket and the increasing vertical specialization of non-maquila export production. Some implications of the estimation results are briefly discussed, making reference to the possible external constraint on Mexico's economic growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We show that if players can jointly deviate ate only if they form a clique in the network, then the degree of inequality that can be sustained depends on the cardinality of the maximum independent set. For bipartite networks, the size of the maximum independent set fully characterizes the degree of inequality that can be sustained. This result extends partially to general networks and to the case in which a group of players can deviate jointly if they are all sufficiently close to each other in the network.

This paper finds that the prediction crucially depends on the stages of financial development that the country is undergoing. The benefits of financial depth only occur if the country has reached a threshold level of financial development. Below this critical value, financial development counteracts income inequality. Our policy implication is that a minimum level of financial development is a necessary precondition for achieving reduction in income inequality through financial development.

Financial liberalization with market reopening by the Taiwanese government in 1991 reduces ROA. Cost Efficiency (CE) and Allocative Efficiency (AE) assessed with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) increase procyclical ROA but are unrelated to ROE, suggesting effectiveness of cost control over productivity innovation for the 'Top 10' to maintain performance. Operation expansion merely aggravates hierarchical complexity. Market Share (MS) and Market Concentration (CR) behave oppositely and profit is unaffected by their interaction term, substantiating the standard efficient structure hypothesis and confirming inappropriateness of using MS as a proxy for efficiency. Under the trend towards universal banking, longer-term revenue generated from geographical and operational diversification, on balance, is likely to overweigh the cost linked with greater asymmetry of information in loan making.","[Huang, Chen-Jui] Tunghai Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 407, Taiwan; [Lin, Jwu-Rong] Tunghai Univ, Dept Int Business, Taichung 407, Taiwan",Tunghai University; Tunghai University,"Huang, CJ (通讯作者)，Tunghai Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 407, Taiwan.",cjhuang@thu.edu.tw,,,,,,,26,5,5,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Much of the conventional literature focuses on 'un-bounded rationality' of the rationality-as-consistency variety. Theorizing of bounded rationality tends to assume that the problem to be solved is independent of the nature of bounded rationality. Following the insights from the works of Herbert Simon and contributions from outside economics, both bounded rationality and the environment are inextricably linked. The boundaries between bounded rationality and its environment can shift. The form in which bounded rationality is found depends on the complexity of the environment. Furthermore, if local interactions between bounded rational agents result in the formation of hierarchies - the complexity of the collective system will change. Whether this will occur depends on the nature of bounded rationality at the individual level.","Univ Wollongong, Sch Econ, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Lee, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Econ, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",,"Lee, Cassey/A-7881-2012","Lee, Cassey/0000-0002-4591-6210",,,,,76,12,16,8,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Our results show that both world commodity price and world interest rate shocks impact external debt accumulation in the majority of our sample African countries.

Second, if not, how do they go out and develop their investments, and who helps them overcome the obstacles to investing in Africa? We find that very few Chinese private enterprises follow a linear internationalization process, and most depend on the local overseas Chinese network and other networks to facilitate their entry into the host market. The reason lies in that Chinese private enterprises are still at the early stage of internationalization.

One reason for the importance of this issue is simply the quantitative significance of households formed around couples. A second reason is that the economic theory of optimal taxation and tax reform, at least as it is presented in the mainstream literature, provides little guidance on this issue, resting as it does on models of the single person household. An old insight in the earlier public finance literature is that any discussion of the taxation of two-person households necessarily involves the recognition of the importance of household production. In this article, we analyse optimal linear taxation and tax reform to put the 'conventional wisdom', which says that it is optimal to tax women on a separate, lower tax schedule than men, on a firmer basis. We also discuss some recent literature on the non-linear taxation of two-earner households. What emerges clearly from the analysis is how centrally important the relationship between productivity in household production and female labour supply really is, and how little we know about it empirically.

When they depend on intergovernmental grants for local development and have opportunities to lobby upper-level governments for such grants, horizontal intergovernmental competition in lobbying activity may emerge in addition to competition over public infrastructure. This paper empirically examines the existence of these interactions between Japanese localities, by using data on the value of industrial parks as infrastructure provisions and on personnel interchanges between the central and local governments as a measure of lobbying activity. Our results suggest that a Japanese local government's choice of the size of industrial parks and its invitation to central officers to act as a director on loan are positive responses to the neighboring local government's policy choices. As the value of the industrial parks in a district is affected by the neighboring districts' lobby activities and their industrial park values, we can interpret these results as evidence of inter-regional competition in these two dimensions, rather than control by the central government in this unitary state.","[Bessho, Shun-ichiro] Hitotsubashi Univ, Sch Int & Publ Policy, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Bessho, Shun-ichiro] Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Terai, Kimiko] Hosei Univ, Fac Business Adm, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1028160, Japan",Hitotsubashi University; Hitotsubashi University; Hosei University,"Bessho, S (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Sch Int & Publ Policy, 2-1 Naka, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",bessho@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,"Bessho, Shun-ichiro/S-1224-2019","Bessho, Shun-ichiro/0000-0003-0667-4834; Terai, Kimiko/0000-0002-3309-175X","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22530304, 23530382] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,35,3,3,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,,,ECON GOV,Econ.

In comparison to static Shapley-value decompositions and traditional decompositions for the square of the coefficient of variation and the Gini index, the new dynamic Shapley-value approach is intuitively appealing as a decomposition procedure for changes in inequality. It is expected to yield relatively small differences among various inequality measures, essentially maintaining consistency with income source classification. Path dependency, a possible drawback of the new decompositions, is not expected to be a particular problem in the usual cases. The properties are illustrated for application to the increase in US family income inequality during 1979-1996. In this empirical study, the new decompositions showed a tendency that was clearly different from those of the existing decompositions, indicating that the proposed procedures shed new light on analysis of the causes of inequality changes. An extension to incorporate other factors such as family structure is also successful without loss of the desirable properties.","Stat Res & Training Inst, Minist Internal Affairs & Commun, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1628668, Japan",,"Okamoto, M (通讯作者)，Stat Res & Training Inst, Minist Internal Affairs & Commun, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1628668, Japan.",mokamoto2@soumu.go.jp,,"Okamoto, Masato/0000-0003-1652-7061",,,,,18,7,8,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

These traders report their true types in direct mechanisms and bid/ask their values/costs in auctions. We show that by expropriating naive traders in direct mechanisms, the mechanism designer can subsidize additional trades by strategic traders and improve efficiency. In fact, complete expropriation of naive traders is a necessary condition for constrained efficiency. A significant implication is that in the presence of naive traders, ex-post individually rational mechanisms are not constrained efficient. In contrast, if the traders must use a given mechanism, then the introduction of naive traders has an ambiguous effect on efficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The data shows a high, but gradually decreasing ownership stakes of firm insiders (managers and workers). We estimate the effect of a wide range of firm characteristics on the decision to privatize, the initial ownership structure after privatization, and on subsequent changes of ownership stakes. We test and find support for several predictions of the model by Aghion and Blanchard (1998). For example, collusion among workers makes them more reluctant to sell shares to outsiders. Firms in financial distress show a higher incidence of insiders selecting the option of privatization leading to high insider ownership. This can be explained by their desire to insure against unemployment in the case of restructuring by outsiders. No evidence is found of a sequencing in privatization according to the performance of firms before privatization. A methodological novelty of this paper is the application of a tobit model with sample selection to the choice of ownership stakes. Journal of Comparative Economics xxx (xx) (2011) xxx-xxx.

The results show that, when examined separately, economic liberalization leads to a significant reduction in volatility while democratization is not followed by a decrease in growth volatility. For countries that undertake only one liberalization, opening up the economy to international trade reduces volatility in growth; becoming a democracy, on the other hand, seems to increase macroeconomic instability. For countries that implement both political and economic liberalizations, no statistically significant effect on volatility is detected. These results serve to provide additional support for the policy recommendation that developing countries should liberalize their economy first and then consider political liberalization.

Many cooperatives try to adapt to novel consumer demands by engaging more in product development, with the aim of manufacturing and selling more differentiated products. The article discusses which governance problems that are likely to unfold as cooperatives engage more in the development, production and sales of differentiated end-products. The idea to be advanced is that the nature of the governance problems is contingent on where in the cooperative's production chain the main sources of uniqueness and product differentiation have their origin. When the uniqueness of the end-product is created at the raw-commodity level (on-farm), haggling over appropriable quasi-rent between members and the cooperative is likely to emerge, leading to a hold-up situation. When the uniqueness of the differentiated end-product is created at the cooperative level, the cooperative community is likely to be exposed to consequential incentive problems related to motivation and control.

As an alternative of decision-making under uncertainty, prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky (1979), Tversky and Kahneman (1992)) has been obtained empirical support, for example, Kahneman and Tversky (1979), and Camerer and Lowenstein (2003). It is beginning to explore optimal taxation in the context of prospect theory, for example, Oswald (1983), Tuomala (1990) in conventional setting without utility interdependence, and Kanbur, Pirttila, and Tuomala (2008) for separable value functions between income and effort. It is challenging in the prospect theory to treat with optimal taxation for inseparable value function between income and effort. In this paper, we model taxation under income uncertainty by sufficiently considering government's risk aversion and individuals' loss aversion. We obtain its sufficient condition for the first order approach to general value functions including inseparable value function between income and effort, hence generalizing Oswald (1983), Tuomala (1990) to optimal taxation with utility interdependence, and Kanbur, Pirttila, and Tuomala (2008) to inseparable value functions between income and effort.","Wuhan Inst Technol, Sch Law & Business, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China",Wuhan Institute of Technology,"Dai, XH (通讯作者)，Wuhan Inst Technol, Sch Law & Business, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China.",xhrdai@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,9,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

The effects of the resulting moral hazard problem on the self-selection mechanism are analyzed in a model in which workers simultaneously choose an employment sector and an effort level. The implications of the model reveal that in the presence of moral hazard, workers' effort decisions become an additional mechanism determining the pattern of selection into sectors. Workers' sector-specific endowments impact sectoral allocation through their effect on workers' comparative advantage as well as their effect on workers' shirking propensity. The model is then used in an empirical application that analyzes workers' self-selection into white collar and blue collar occupations. The estimation results, based on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, suggest that workers' occupational self-selection leads to higher wages and lower dismissal rates in both occupations, compared to an economy in which workers are randomly assigned to each occupation. The difference in dismissal rates between the two occupations is driven by the higher expected productivity in the white collar sector. The positive effects of occupational sorting diminish as the labor market becomes increasingly characterized by moral hazard. Results also suggest that human capital investments in skills that are most relevant to blue collar jobs may generate higher wages and lower dismissal rates in both white collar and blue collar occupations.

However, these mechanisms rely on buyers sharing their private information about sellers, and thus may suffer from too little feedback when provision is costly. We experimentally compare a standard feedback mechanism to one in which sellers can inspect a buyer's feedback-provision history, thus providing incentives to share private information even when costly. We find fairly high trust and trustworthiness in all markets, with buyers providing costly feedback, especially negative, sufficient to induce trustworthiness. However, feedback-provision histories did not improve outcomes, and at least weakly decreased trustworthiness with experienced participants, as this information enabled sellers to discriminate and ship less frequently to buyers lacking a reputation for information sharing.","[Gazzale, Robert S.] Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Khopkar, Tapan] Cartesian Consulting Pvt Ltd, Bombay 400018, Maharashtra, India",Williams College,"Gazzale, RS (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Dept Econ, 24 Hopkins Hall Dr, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",rgazzale@williams.edu; tapan.khopkar@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,7,7,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

The research questions are explored using an evolutionary model, which emphasizes geographical spaces and production of intermediate goods. In particular, we are concerned with how cooperative behaviour of technology producers is affected by the need to protect technological secrecies and of being financially constrained by firms demanding innovative input. Based on the theoretical model, we provide an analysis using computer simulations. The primary findings are, first, that the model generates predictions suited for empirical research as to the way in which economic selection influences cooperative behavior of innovative actors. Second, we demonstrate how a region's entrepreneurial activity and growth can be controlled in a decentralized way by regions.","[Gunnarsson, Jan; Wallin, Torsten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Gunnarsson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bygning 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark.",jg@econ.ku.dk,,,,,,,30,6,11,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

On the Kontek Cable, implicit auctioning has first been implemented with no coupling between the relevant Power Exchanges, followed by a volume coupling implementation, and finally a one way price coupling implementation that is still operational today. The main contribution of this paper is to compare the theoretical properties of these three implementations and to analyze their performance empirically. We find that the third implementation is significantly outperforming the previous two implementations, but in this third implementation stakeholders partly abandoned the volume coupling approach they initially believed to be a viable alternative and institutionally easier to implement.

It also raises income variability, but the most successful quartile gains much more than the least successful quartile loses. Key determinants of the decision to become an entrepreneur are occupational qualifications, family resources, gender, and work environments.

Our main finding is that the correlations of tax rates with cyclical GDP are generally quite small and statistically indistinguishable from zero. This finding is quite robust and is more consistent with the implications of the Tax Smoothing hypothesis than either the recommendations of the standard Keynesian model or predictions of the political economy theory of Battaglini and Coate.","[Karras, Georgios] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Furceri, Davide] OECD, F-75775 Paris 16, France",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Karras, G (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 601 S Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",davide.furceri@oecd.org; gkarras@uic.edu,,,,,,,22,6,6,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

However, the possibility of counterfeiting fiat money can affect its value, velocity, output, and welfare, even if no counterfeiting occurs in equilibrium. We provide two extensions of the model under which the threat of counterfeiting can materialize: counterfeits can circulate across periods, and sellers set terms of trade in some matches. Policies that make the currency more costly to counterfeit or easier to recognize raise the value of money and society's welfare, but the latter policy does not always decrease counterfeiting.","[Rocheteau, Guillaume] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Li, Yiting] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Taiwan University,"Rocheteau, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",grochete@uci.edu,,,,,,,27,42,53,0,30,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We develop a model in which the demand for liquidity arises suddenly in response to continued funding needs of partially completed investment projects whose outcomes are subject to idiosyncratic shocks and moral hazard. When the economy experiences an adverse aggregate productivity shock, incentive constraints that underlie equity contracts may bind, provided the shock is severe enough. In this case, credit-rationing appears, and the heightened demand for liquidity coincides with a greater reluctance to take on equity positions or deepen investments in on-going investment projects. The consequence is a reduction in new investment and termination of on-going projects due to a lack of liquidity, thereby worsening the economic slowdown. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Leading indexes have been widely used since their introduction in the late 1930s. One construction method dominated until academic research interest into alternative techniques re-appeared in the late 1980s. What has been missing so far in the literature is a thorough comparison of old and new techniques in terms of forecasting performance. This article is a step in that direction. The methods covered here reflect varying degrees of technical sophistication, ranging from simple scoring of changes to relying on frequency domain methods to extract dynamic latent factors from a large dataset. The results show that no single index dominates in terms of forecasting employment growth one to four quarters ahead.

Given the expansive system boundaries and multi-decadal timescales involved, addressing future uncertainty in these models is a critical challenge. The approach taken by many modelers is to build larger models with greater complexity to deal with structural uncertainty, and run a few highly detailed scenarios under different input assumptions to address parametric uncertainty. The result is often large and inflexible models used to conduct analysis that offers little insight. This paper introduces a technique borrowed from the operations research literature called modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) as a way to flex energy models and systematically explore the feasible, near-optimal solution space in order to develop alternatives that are maximally different in decision space but perform well with regard to the modeled objectives. The resultant MGA alternatives serve a useful role by challenging preconceptions and highlighting plausible alternative futures. A simple, conceptual model of the U.S. electric sector is presented to demonstrate the utility of MGA as an energy modeling technique. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Hart-Landsberg, M",,,,"Hart-Landsberg, Martin",,,The Chinese Reform Experience: A Critical Assessment,REVIEW OF RADICAL POLITICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; market socialism; transnational production; economic development,,"The consensus among economists is that China's post-1978 market reform policies have produced one of the world's greatest economic success stories. Some progressives believe that China is now capable of serving as an anchor for a new (non-U.S. dominated) global economy. A few claim that the reform experience demonstrates the workability (and desirability) of market socialism. This article is critical of these views. Its four main conclusions are as follows: first, the reforms have led to the restoration of capitalism, not a new form of market socialism. Second, the gains attributed to the reforms have been seriously overstated. Early successes were largely due to the economic foundation established during the pre-reform Mao era. Moreover, the reform process has begun to undermine this foundation, increasing the country's dependence on foreign investment, technology, and markets. Third, the reforms have produced an increasingly exploitative growth process, one that generates considerable wealth for a minority at unacceptably high cost for the majority. Finally, the reforms also produced a growth process whose logic led it to become enmeshed in, and dependent upon, a broader process of transnational restructuring, one controlled by transnational capital. As a result, China is not only incapable of serving as an anchor for an alternative global economy, its accumulation dynamics actually contribute to the strengthening of existing structures of power and the global imbalances and tensions they generate.","Lewis & Clark Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97219 USA",,"Hart-Landsberg, M (通讯作者)，Lewis & Clark Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97219 USA.",marty@lclark.edu,,,,,,,52,21,23,2,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

However, entrepreneurship is not only influenced by institutions - entrepreneurs often help shape institutions themselves. The bilateral causal relation between entrepreneurs and institutions is examined in this paper. Entrepreneurs affect institutions in at least three ways. Entrepreneurship abiding by existing institutions is occasionally disruptive enough to challenge the foundations of prevailing institutions. Entrepreneurs sometimes have the opportunity to evade institutions, which tends to undermine the effectiveness of the institutions, or cause institutions to change for the better. Lastly, entrepreneurs can directly alter institutions through innovative political entrepreneurship. Like business entrepreneurship, innovative political activity may be productive or unproductive, depending on the incentives facing entrepreneurs.","[Henrekson, Magnus; Sanandaji, Tino] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Sanandaji, Tino] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); University of Chicago,"Henrekson, M (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden.",magnus.henrekson@ifn.se; tino@uchicago.edu,"Henrekson, Magnus/JXL-1358-2024","Henrekson, Magnus/0000-0002-1640-7126",,,,,91,91,99,1,45,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Some have argued that market failures reduce private investments that are necessary to find out whether a new product can be exported profitably, thus implying that the threat of entry can reduce export discoveries and consequently hamper diversification. In parallel, the trade literature on the extensive margin of trade has focused on the role of fixed costs of exporting, which affects the number and types of firms that enter into exporting activities. This article presents data suggesting that export diversification and export discoveries are correlated over the course of development, and it provides an empirical test of market failures that might deter export discoveries. The findings suggest that the threat of entry by imitators reduces the number of export discoveries within countries and industries for a given rate of growth of non-discovery exports. However, this market-failure effect is less pronounced when allowing for inter-industry spil-lovers, whereby export discoveries in one industry lead to discoveries in another industry. The policy implication is that barriers to entry should not be used to protect innovators from the threat of imitation, but governments could consider interventions that directly focus on stimulating export discoveries.

We extend the model to the case in which the home firm has private information about its own costs, which it may want to signal to the government through its investment choice.

Custom plausible loss events defined in a particular scenario are merged with the original data sample and their impact on capital estimates and on the financial institution as a whole is evaluated. Two main questions are assessed what is the most appropriate statistical method to measure and model operational loss data distribution and what is the impact of hypothetical plausible events on the financial institution. The g&h distribution was evaluated to be the most suitable one for operational risk modeling. The method based on the combination of historical loss events modeling and scenario analysis provides reasonable capital estimates and allows for the measurement of the impact of very extreme events on banking operations.","[Rippel, Milan; Teply, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, CZ-11000 Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Rippel, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, CZ-11000 Prague, Czech Republic.",milanrippel@seznam.cz; teply@fsv.cuni.cz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018",,,,,,18,16,18,2,25,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Evidence from Sri Lanka,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Political competition; Ethnic discrimination; Food stamps; Sri Lanka,PUBLIC-GOODS; ELECTION GOALS; DIVERSITY; REDISTRIBUTION; ECONOMY,"The impact of political competition on ethnic discrimination remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper explores the relationship between the level of political competition and the probability of receiving government transfers among ethnic minorities in Sri Lanka in the run up to the national elections of 2000. The paper shows that making politicians dependent on the votes of members of ethnic groups other their own can encourage moderation in discriminatory practices towards ethnic minorities. Specifically we find that political competition positively influenced the distribution of government food stamps among Sri Lankan Tamils, who otherwise are less likely to receive food stamps relative to the Sinhalese majority. The negative impact of political competition on discrimination is higher when minorities form part of swing constituencies than when they form part of the base support for political parties. Lessons learnt here suggest that having built-in incentives in the design of the electoral process for intergroup bargaining and cooperation in countries with ethnically heterogeneous societies can be an effective restraint on ethnic discrimination. This is consistent with other research that considers political institutions to be a key lever for making ethnically divided societies more inclusive. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Since the integration of formerly strongly-regulated markets into global markets can also lead to an increase in the dependence of the CEECs' economies on global sentiments, we also investigate the relationship between global economic sentiments, domestic income, and share prices. Applying a restricted cointegrating VAR (CVAR) framework, which allows us to distinguish between the long-run and the short-run dynamics, our results for the short run suggest that economic sentiments are influenced by share prices but also offer some predictive power with respect to the latter.

Other variables such as cost of land, quality of access roads and distance to markets are less important. There were statistically significant differences in the part-worth estimates of raw materials and wage costs among decision-makers but not between regions in an ordered model for site preference.

In this framework, current inflation redistribute wealth from the cash-rich employed to the cash-poor unemployed and induce the former to increase their labour supply in order to maintain their desired levels of consumption and precautionary savings. If the shocks are persistent, however, they also raise inflation expectations and thus deter the employed from saving and supplying labour.

We found no strong evidence that the PSNP protects livestock in times of shock. Shocks appear to lead households to disinvest in livestock, but not in trees.

The time period between the two papers contributes to the reliability of the results derived, not just by increasing the number of observations, but also mainly by incorporating the progress made in the realm of artificial intelligence. The focus on the case of both countries unlike the paper mentioned above that dealt with just the Greek side provides ample room for comparative purposes regarding the determinants of defense expenditure on both sides. The results derived in terms of input significance estimation support the findings of the earlier research as indicated above, pointing to the leading role of the demographic preponderance of Turkey over Greece. The paper also points to the fact that 10 years later, Turkey continues to set the arms race rules against its rival by determining the defense expenditure of Greece, whereas the role of the latter in affecting the military spending of Turkey is non-existent.","[Zombanakis, George A.] Bank Greece, Res Dept, Athens 10250, Greece; [Andreou, Andreas S.] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn & Informat Technol, Lemesos, Cyprus",European Central Bank; Bank of Greece; Cyprus University of Technology,"Zombanakis, GA (通讯作者)，Bank Greece, Res Dept, 21 Panepistimiou St, Athens 10250, Greece.",gzombanakis@bankofgreece.gr,,"ANDREOU, ANDREAS/0000-0001-7104-2097",,,,,21,6,6,1,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

It is therefore understandable in the current situation, where there is a lack of funds for acute care and physicians are limited in prescription drugs, that the spa seems an unnecessary luxury. The impact of restrictive measures in the Czech health insurance system on the economic situation of individual spas is obvious. It manifests itself mainly in the amount of the contribution that health insurance companies provide for each patient The allowance for spa treatment each year is subject to a conciliation procedure between the insurers and the Union of Medical Spas for the Czech Republic, which represents individual spa organizations. Another consequence is the decreasing number of patients who have health insurance companies that are willing to pay for comprehensive or partial coverage of spa stays. Czech spas are a part of the system of medical care in the Czech Republic, but more than other types of health care, they are dependent on direct revenues from patients. This is one of the positive effects of large-scale privatization, which the Czech spa industry underwent in the last decade of the 20th century. Most spa organizations are privately owned, and only a small part is owned and operated by state or municipal spas. Individual spa organizations must be able to deal with this issue. The solution is to increase the number of domestic and foreign self-paying patients, reduce the average length of stay and in some cases, make at least a partial shift from traditional spa treatment to newer, non-medical forms of health tourism.","[Attl, Pavel; Certik, Miroslav] Inst Hospitality Management Prague 8 Ltd, Dept Travel & Tourism Studies, Dept Hospitality Management, Prague 18100 8, Czech Republic",,,attl@vsh.cz; reditel@vsh.cz,,,,,,,13,3,3,0,10,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,17,23,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200002,0

This paper therefore addresses the question: What change in sectoral labour productivity levels would have been required to deliver the actual change in final demands in Greece between 1995 and 2005, if working hours in each sector had been reduced to their EU averages? In this framework, we develop a methodology for calculating labour productivity change by sector of economic activity in an input-output context. Next, we apply it to the Greek economy for the time period 1995-2005, the most recent period for which the required data are available.

To understand how the housing and financial wealth effects have changed over time, we use a combination of recent time series techniques, including system structural break tests and linear projections, to estimate impulse response functions of consumption to both forms of wealth over relatively short sub-samples. Our key results are that the housing wealth effect gets larger over time, with the largest effect apparent after 1998; while the financial wealth effect diminishes over the same sub-samples, even over a period that includes the equities boom of the 1990s.

Interpreting the utility representations of preferences as capturing these phenomena requires one to use the notion of a sign of a state. For linear preferences, we completely characterise the sign of a state in terms of its analytic representation as an integral with respect to a signed measure. In models with finitely many states, a state is either positive or negative, but never both. We show that in models with infinitely many states, a state can be both positive and negative. Thus, models with finitely many states may not capture all the behavioural features of an infinite model.

We find that noncognitive skills have a substantial effect on the probability of employment in many, though not all, occupations in ways that differ by gender. Consequently, men and women with similar noncognitive skills enter occupations at very different rates. Women, however, have lower wages on average not because they work in different occupations than men do, but rather because they earn less than their male colleagues employed in the same occupation. On balance, women's noncognitive skills give them a slight wage advantage. Finally, we find that accounting for the endogeneity of occupational attainment more than halves the proportion of the overall gender wage gap that is unexplained. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Highly significant estimates of the user cost elasticity that are in the vicinity of the -1.0 benchmark implied by a Cobb-Douglas production function are obtained using a variety of specifications, including panel cointegration techniques that correct for small sample bias. Unlike most previous studies, meaningful elasticity estimates are also obtained using stationary panel specifications. The robustness of these estimates may be due, in part, to the possibility that the capital demand curve is better identified in a small open economy where shocks to capital supply are more likely to be exogenous. The economic embargo imposed on South Africa from 1985 to early 1994 temporarily forced its economy to become more closed and therefore provides a unique opportunity to assess the importance of identification in the estimation of the user cost elasticity. User cost elasticity estimates using embargo and non-embargo period data are consistent with a substantial bias from endogeneity.","[Coulibaly, Brahima] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Int Finance, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Millar, Jonathan N.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Res & Stat, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Coulibaly, B (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Int Finance, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",brahima.coulibaly@frb.gov; jonathan.n.millar@frb.gov,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,3,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

With the growing numbers of both types of studies, several meta-analyses have become available that provide insight into the results of both methods.

The efficient-market hypothesis, which translates the idea of Walrasian general equilibrium into financial markets, has a profound hold on economists' thinking; it represents an intellectual sink that leads to ideas about financial policy reform which protect established interests and disregard any reform's broader economic consequences. This reference point is problematic because it refers to a world that does not exist except in the realms of pure theory. It is imperative to find an alternative frame of reference for evaluating financial-regulatory policy, one which takes into account whether financial market institutions are meeting the needs of society. This is done here by introducing 'social efficiency' as an alternative to the 'economic efficiency' derived from the Walrasian system. This social efficiency criterion focuses on whether financial policy changes are likely to reduce or widen inequality, and to reduce or increase a society's ability to guarantee the attainment of basic capabilities for all.","[Dymski, Gary A.] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,,,"Dymski, Gary/AFQ-4226-2022","Dymski, Gary/0000-0001-9667-2693",,,,,52,3,3,0,5,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-0-23030-768-1,INT PAP POLIT ECON,,,2011,,,,,,,77,115,,,,,,39,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BWV66,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295079400003,0

We construct a composite indicator for financial deepening and use it to detect Granger causality within a modified Vector Autoregressive/Vector Error Correction Model (VAR/VECM) framework. We find almost no evidence for the popular hypothesis of financeled growth. Evidence of bidirectional finance-growth causality is stronger but mostly instable in the long run. Most results indicate a demand following or insignificant causal relationship between finance and growth. There is also no evidence that finance indirectly induces growth via the channel of trade openness. Hence, policies that prioritize financial and trade sector development cannot be supported.","[Gries, Thomas; Kraft, Manfred; Meierrieks, Daniel] Univ Paderborn, Dept Econ, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany",University of Paderborn,"Gries, T (通讯作者)，Univ Paderborn, Dept Econ, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",thomas.gries@notes.upb.de,,,,,,,39,13,15,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Mexico is abundant in low-skill workers relative to the US and Canada, and so, by the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson trade model, NAFTA ought to have raised the relative earnings of low-skill workers, that is, lowered returns to skill in Mexico. Analysis of Mexican labour micro-data yields the finding that while returns to skill in industries producing tradeables have risen, ceteris paribus, since Mexico embarked upon trade liberalization by joining the GATT in 1986, this rise was less pronounced by 1999 in industries liberalized relatively rapidly by NAFTA, launched in 1994, than in industries liberalized relatively slowly by this phased trade treaty. This is considered evidence of NAFTA holding back rise in returns to skill, since it is plausible such a dampening would have been more marked in industries more rapidly exposed to trade with Mexico's skill abundant northern neighbours. Hence, this study suggests trade with developed nations may lower returns to skill in developing nations.","[Hazarika, Gautam; Otero, Rafael] Univ Texas Brownsville, Dept Business Adm, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Hazarika, G (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Brownsville, Dept Business Adm, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA.",gautam.hazarika@utb.edu,,,,,,,16,2,2,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The first, an investment-specific technology shock, affects the transformation of consumption into investment goods and is identified with the relative price of investment. The second shock affects the production of installed capital from investment goods or. more broadly, the transformation of savings into the future capital input. We find that this shock is the most important driver of U.S. business cycle fluctuations in the post-war period and that it is likely to proxy for more fundamental disturbances to the functioning of the financial sector. To corroborate this interpretation, we show that it is closely related to interest rate spreads and that it played a particularly important role in the recession of 2008-2009. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The auditor should, by using the optimal dose of professional scepticism, make the corresponding modification of the auditing reports, whether errors or illegal acts are in question. Their successes are the result of their experience, logic and ability to spot things that are not obvious. The aim of this paper is to describe the circumstances in which fraud happen, including the motives.

Without a fundamental reconsideration of the RDI system, there is little perspective for making Romanian economic structures compatible with world trends and for decreasing competitivity gaps as compared to global competitors.

J,"Kimenyi, MS",,,,"Kimenyi, Mwangi S.",,,Contribution of Higher Education to Economic Development: A Survey of International Evidence,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GROWTH; INVESTMENT; RETURNS,"While developing countries have prioritised primary education, higher education seems to have been neglected. The paper suggests that the low emphasis placed on higher education is because there has been a general under-appreciation of the contribution of higher education to development. The paper starts by proposing a functional definition that considers 'higher education' as a dynamic concept which changes over time and with levels of development. The paper also emphasises the importance of quality of education in development and suggests that most policy focus in Africa has focused on the quantity of education and largely ignored the equally important quality dimension. The paper reviews a wide range of literature that has sought to investigate the link between higher education and development. The studies reviewed focus on returns to higher education and the impact on higher education on economic growth. One of the evidence of the importance of higher education on development is revealed by the fact although there has been convergence across countries in primary school enrolments, the incomes of African countries have diverged from those of Asian and Latin American counterparts. On the other hand, just as incomes have diverged so have enrollments in tertiary education. Overall, the empirical evidence available shows that higher education is crucial to the development of today's societies. The paper concludes with confidence that while primary and secondary education is necessary for development and economic growth, it is clearly not sufficient. The paper provides suggestions for research.","Brookings Inst, African Growth Initiat, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brookings Institution,"Kimenyi, MS (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, African Growth Initiat, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",mkimenyi@brookings.edu,,,,,,,46,16,21,4,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Using a detailed 2006-2008 data set for Spanish manufacturing firms, we then establish a number of stylized facts about firm-level heterogeneity in sourcing strategies that have largely gone unnoticed in existing literature on input sourcing. Finally, we explore this heterogeneity through econometric estimation of productivity premia associated with different sourcing strategies. We find a robustly significant premium on a strategy that features offshore production of intermediate inputs through a related party (vertical integration). Lower productivity premia are found for strategies that rely on outsourcing to unrelated parties abroad or on vertical integration within the home economy. Across all specifications employed, estimated mean productivity is lowest for domestic-outsourcing firms.","[Kohler, Wilhelm K.] Univ Tubingen, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Kohler, WK (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Nauklerstr 47, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",wilhelm.kohler@uni-tuebingen.de; marcel.smolka@uni-tuebingen.de,,,,,,,24,22,24,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The report Energia, Economia y Sociedad (Energy, Economy and Society) explores these issues primarily from the point of view of energy. It proposes to deal with the decline of cheap oil and the need to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a two-pronged approach: demand management (energy savings) and supply management (changing from the current energy mix to a situation where renewable energy is the dominant generation type). The report therefore aims to help stimulate a social debate that sheds light on the opportunities for a paradigm shift.","[Martinez Gonzalez-Tablas, Angel] Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"González-Tablas, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",angelmtablas@ccee.ucm.es; orlandini.arnaldo@gmail.com; msherrero@madrid.uned.es,,,,,,,13,2,2,1,11,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Using firm-level data, the firm's certification status is modelled using Heckman's two-step procedure. The first-stage results using a probit model show that the likelihood of certification is determined by the sector, the firm's awareness of trade standards, the level to which the firm's markets are diversified, external pressure for certification and the firm's primary export market. The intensity of certification is treated as the number of standards a firm has invested in, which can be seen as ordered into distinct categories, such that an ordered probit model can be applied, correcting for sample selection bias. The results show that the number of standards to which a firm is certified is influenced by firm size, a firm's primary export markets, level of awareness of trade standards and level of market diversification. Overall, the results suggest that certification can be enhanced through increased private and institutional incentives, such as reducing transactions costs in the fisheries and agro-processing sectors, as well as increased regulatory enforcements in supply chains and support for raising the technical capacity of the sector.","[Masakure, Oliver; Cranfield, John; Henson, Spencer] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Masakure, O (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",masakure@uoguelph.ca,,"Cranfield, John/0000-0002-3475-6709",,,,,68,20,21,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The paper is aimed at education and qualifications, their importance and their impact on the employment and unemployment rate and the level of remuneration. The education level of Slovak citizens has developed in a positive way and results in growth of education level of labour force. The impact of education on the unemployment rate can be proved via the rate of unemployment when the education level increases and unemployment rate decreases. Higher level of education is a prerequisite for better remuneration. Educational potential of population is also an important condition for building knowledge-based economy.

We estimate quantile regressions with technological dummies and carry out a decomposition analysis, both at the aggregate level and by occupations. At the aggregate level, most of the wage gap between both populations is explained by the divergence in their labour characteristics. In jobs where ICT are not very diffused, the technological premium is larger than in jobs characterized by a large presence of novel technologies. Whereas in the former type of jobs, the technological premium is mainly justified by a divergence in the labour market characteristics between ICT users and nonusers, in positions characterized by a wide presence of novel technologies the technological premium responds rather to a divergence in the returns to identical characteristics.","[Wolff, Francois-Charles] Univ Nantes, Nantes, France; [Moreno-Galbis, Eva] Univ Maine, F-72017 Le Mans, France; [Moreno-Galbis, Eva] CEPREMAP, Paris, France; [Wolff, Francois-Charles] CNAV, Paris, France; [Wolff, Francois-Charles] INED, Paris, France",Nantes Universite; Le Mans Universite,"Wolff, FC (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, Nantes, France.",wolff@sc-eco.univ-nantes.fr,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is to be expected that weather fluctuations will increase in the future due to climate change. Traditionally, farmers tried to protect themselves against weather-related yield variations by buying insurances. More recently, there has been a discussion regarding the use of weather derivatives to safeguard against volumetric risks. Although weather derivatives display advantages over traditional insurances, there is only a relatively small market for these products in agriculture. This is partly attributed to the fact that it is unclear whether and to what extent weather derivatives are a useful instrument of risk management in agriculture. This study applies real yield and weather data from Northeast Germany in order to quantify the risk-reducing effect that can be achieved in wheat production by using precipitation options. To do so stochastic simulation is used. The hedging effectiveness is controlled by the contract design (index, strike level, tick size). However, the local basis risk and the geographical basis risk remain with the farmer. We separate both causes of basis risk and reveal the extent of each. This enables conclusions regarding the design of weather derivatives; thus the question dealt with here is relevant both for farmers and for potential sellers of weather derivatives.","[Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Odening, Martin; Xu, Wei] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Social Sci, Berlin, Germany",University of Gottingen; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Musshoff, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",oliver.musshoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021; Odening, Martin/AAV-9918-2020","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Odening, Martin/0000-0001-6427-1641",,,,,27,57,59,6,67,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The ability of any free trade zone member country to sustain its competitive position requires that its unit variable costs of production (or unit labour costs) remain relatively constant as compared with those of its trading partners. This can be achieved by: (1) periodical changes in rates of exchange, or periodical restoring of the balance of trade equilibrium with the help of instruments of (2a) monetary policy, or (2b) fiscal policy, or by (3) commonly agreed rules of income distribution between profits and wages. Under a common monetary system, the ways of restoring balance of trade equilibrium through (1) and (2a) are closed, hence this aim can be achieved only through (2b) or (3). Restrictive fiscal policy implies however high economic, social and political cost. Hence, common income policy and its institutional arrangements are better instruments to guarantee that wage growth rates are in line with the rise in labour productivity. In this context, the author discusses the premises for Poland regarding a safe and successful entry to the eurozone. First, there is a need for further changes in the branch structure as to increase the share of technologically advanced branches, promising high growth of factor productivity and proliferation of new technologies. Second, inflation targets should not be realised by restrictive monetary and fiscal policies, which hamper economic growth and increase unemployment but through a deliberate income policy. Real convergence of the Polish economy with the advanced economies of the eurozone requires further advancement of modernization in many sectors of the economy and in the infrastructure. It also requires continued reduction of energy intensity of output and increased shares in total output of technologically advanced products that have substantial spill-over effects. Both will require significant public spending at least in the next few years, which would make it difficult to fulfill fiscal convergence criteria. Another important question is how to reduce the relative share of foreign financing of public borrowing needs as to alleviate the pressure of global financial markets on liquidity of the public sector.","Wyzsza Szkola Finansow & Prawa, Inst Nauk Ekonomicznych PAN, Bielsku Bialej, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Higher School of Finance & Law in Bielsko-Biala,"Osiatynski, J (通讯作者)，Wyzsza Szkola Finansow & Prawa, Inst Nauk Ekonomicznych PAN, Bielsku Bialej, Poland.",jerzy.osiatynski@sejm.gov.pl,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,6,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2011,,5,,,,,659,676,,,,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865UG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298335800001,0

Our results indicate that although there is no evidence for the FDI-led growth hypothesis in Turkey, there is evidence for causality in the backwards direction. There is also a strong arrow of causality running from HC to FDI and economic growth. Our findings are in line with the existing literature on the linkages between HC and economic growth; however, the fact that FDI does not cause economic growth contradicts a vast range of work in the literature. To this end, we employ a trivariate framework to analyse whether FDI and HC jointly Granger-cause per capita economic growth.

These models account for the data ambiguity, and therefore extend the application field of the discrete choice modeling. The facial expression recognition (FER) is highly relevant in this context. We develop a dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) framework based on discrete choice models (DCM). The DFER consists in modeling the choice of a person who has to label a video sequence representing a facial expression. The originality is based on the the analysis of videos with discrete choice models as well as the explicit modeling of causal effects between the facial features and the recognition of the expression. Five models are proposed. The first assumes that only the last frame of the video triggers the choice of the expression. The second model has two components. The first captures the perception of the facial expression within each frame in the sequence, while the second determines which frame triggers the choice. The third model is an extension of the second model and assumes that the choice of the expression results from the average of perceptions within a group of frames. The fourth and fifth models integrate the panel effect inherent to the estimation data and are respectively extensing the first and second models. The models are estimated using videos from the Facial Expressions and Emotions Database (FEED). Labeling data on the videos has been obtained using an internet survey available at http://transp-or2.epfi.ch/videosurvey/. The prediction capability of the models is studied in order to check their validity by cross-validation using the estimation data.","[Robin, Thomas; Bierlaire, Michel; Cruz, Javier] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Transport & Mobil Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Robin, T (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Transport & Mobil Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",thomas.robin@epfl.ch; michel.bierlaire@epfl.ch; javier.cruz@epfl.ch,,"Bierlaire, Michel/0000-0002-5275-7692",,,,,32,12,12,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Results point to a significant long-term relationship not only between higher education and growth but also between lower schooling levels and growth.

What distinguishes Feenstra's exact price index is that it incorporates new product varieties. The exact import price index thus calculated suggests that US conventional import prices are biased upwards. The consequent downward adjustment in import prices causes appreciation in the real exchange rate and lowers the excessive portion of imports (the difference between actual and theoretical amounts of imports obtained from the import demand equation). Since the early 2000s, however, the role that new product varieties play in lowering the excessive portion of imports has declined because the impact of new products on import prices has been outweighed by the impact of the spike in primary commodity prices, which has resulted in a substantial depreciation of the real exchange rate. It is possible that this depreciation combined with relatively large excessive imports has caused the subsequent US current account deficit to stop expansion from the late 2000s onwards.","Nikkei Inc, Editorial Bur, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008066, Japan",,"Takeuchi, F (通讯作者)，Nikkei Inc, Editorial Bur, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-7 Otemachi, Tokyo 1008066, Japan.",takeuchi.fumihide@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,1,1,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The policy of vertical unbundling is an attempt to introduce competition into the provision of railway services. The vertical unbundling strategy in railways has been strongly advocated by the European Commission as a possibility to increase competition and efficiency in this sector. The strategy has been applied since the beginning of 1990's in many European countries with varied energy, depth and timing. An evaluation of vertical unbundling strategy reveals both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side there are clear indications that introduction of reforms has improved efficiency. But it is evident that power of competition has significant limits in railways due to numerous specifics of this unique industry. If the unbundling policy has more advantages than disadvantages is subject to debate but there are strong indications that there are also other possible ways of combating inefficiencies in the railway sector.","Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Tomes, Z (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",tomes@econ.muni.cz,"Tomes, Zdenek/AAB-5013-2021","Tomes, Zdenek/0000-0002-6759-1293",,,,,6,3,3,0,10,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Some even question their relevance, especially given the financial crisis. The global scorecard shows that half of the road has been covered so far but it has taken three quarters of the time. Thus, are the MDGs a noble but unrealistic aspiration? Not quite. After some false dawns and missed opportunities, it is natural for some to dismiss the MDGs as targets that are 'easily set but never met'. However, it would be too early and too pessimistic to consider the MDGs as 'mission impossible'. After exposing the two most pervasive misconceptions about the MDGs, the paper shows that addressing the growing disparities within countries offers the best hope for achieving the MDGs. It shows that only one out of eight countries with recent data in Asia - Indonesia - managed to achieve pro-poor progress in reducing infant and child mortality.

We used an augmented gravity model with a panel data for 21 years. This paper utilizes the panel fixed effects decomposition and Hausman and Taylor estimation methods to estimate the effect of time-invariant variables on the volume of potential trade. The present volume of trade is dwarfed by our estimates of the potential trade. This seems to ratify the expectation of businesses on both sides. It would appear that the development of a bilateral relationship between India and Pakistan, in the context of regionalization, should be motivated by strong economic considerations. It would include sector-driven as well as market-access approaches. While the theoretical background appears subtle, strategic market consequences arise from the dynamics of regional market structure. Assuming a positive relationship between trade and per capita income, here is a peace dividend that is difficult to ignore in a regional environment of oppressive poverty.","[Vemuri, Vijay K.] Hofstra Univ, Dept Management Entrepreneurship & Gen Business, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA; [Siddiqi, Shahid] Long Isl Univ, Brookville, NY USA",Hofstra University; Long Island University Post,"Vemuri, VK (通讯作者)，Hofstra Univ, Dept Management Entrepreneurship & Gen Business, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA.",vijaya.vemuri@hofstra.edu,,,,,,,39,1,2,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

In this enhancement program, the FSA recommended that regional financial institutions introduce new financial products such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and collateralized bond obligations (CBOs). However, this was left up to each institution's discretion rather than being mandatory. This resulted in a large difference in the introduction of new products. Therefore, this article has analysed what kinds of credit associations favourably increased the use of new financial products. As a result, it has been confirmed that the larger their lending shares and management scale and the better their business conditions are, the more positively they work on the introduction of new products. Considering the fact that relationships between financial institutions and enterprises tend to be fixed in Japan, this means that medium and small enterprises will have restrictions on the financial products they can use depending on the situation of their main banks.","[Yamori, Nobuyoshi; Tomimura, Kei] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Harimaya, Kozo] Sapporo Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Ebetsu, Hokkaido 0698555, Japan",Nagoya University,"Yamori, N (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",yamori@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Yamori, Nobuyoshi/JHS-6924-2023","Yamori, Nobuyoshi/0000-0002-4145-0476",,,,,4,0,0,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We estimate equations for net immigration flows as a share of the labour force and Gross Domestic Product Per Capita (GDPPC) growth and also for all their regressors including remittances and official development aid. We use dynamic panel data methods for a sample of poor countries with GDPPC below $1200 (2000), for which aid is about 9.5% of GDP. The partial effects in these regressions are working against each other. Therefore, we integrate all equations into a dynamic system and run a simulation. One result is an endogenous migration hump with several peaks. In a counterfactual simulation, we double aid with the consequence that for more than a 100 years migration is reduced and the GDPPC is enhanced, because the positive effects of aid on investment and education dominate the negative direct effects of aid on growth and the unfavourable effects on savings, tax revenues and labour force growth.","[Ziesemer, Thomas] Univ Maastricht, Dept Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Ziesemer, Thomas] UNU MERIT, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Ziesemer, T (通讯作者)，Univ Maastricht, Dept Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",t.ziesemer@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Ziesemer, Thomas/0000-0002-5571-2238",,,,,30,4,5,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

More egalitarian societies are also associated with less social conflicts, and individuals have a lower tendency to report themselves happy when inequality is high. Therefore, it is important to study the reasons why the elite opposes the development of a strong public education system. It might be that education is related to social status and a strong public education system might threaten the elite's political power. We show that one aspect of social status is the specialization of skilled workers in high-paid jobs and the abundance of unskilled workers in the production of cheap home goods in the market, such as painting and cleaning a house, babysitting, and/or cooking. We emphasize the role of general equilibrium price adjustments to show that depending on the level of inequality, the elite might prefer an economy with a positive and high cost of education than an economy where skills are freely provided. We show that this result goes through even if the skilled wage is not directly affected by the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers. We also provide empirical evidence consistent with our theory.","[Cavalcanti, Tiago V. de V.] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England; [Cavalcanti, Tiago V. de V.] Univ Cambridge Churchill Coll, Cambridge, England; [Alexopoulos, Joanna] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Cavalcanti, TVD (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.",jalexop2@uiuc.edu; tvdvc2@cam.ac.uk,,"Alexopoulos, Joanna/0000-0001-9905-3839",,,,,52,6,6,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

However, to a large extent it is still unknown how the hourly wage rate, an important component of taxable income, reacts to changes in marginal tax rates. In this study we use a rich panel data set and a sequence of tax reforms that took place in Sweden during the 1980s to estimate the elasticity of the hourly wage rate as well as the taxable labor income elasticity with respect to the net-of-tax rate. We also estimate elasticities with respect to the non-labor income in a way that is novel in the literature. While carefully accounting for the endogeneity of marginal tax rates we find a statistically significant response in wage rates both among married men and women. The estimates of the hourly wage rate elasticity with respect to the net-of-tax rate fall in the range of 0.14-0.16 for males and 0.41-0.57 for females, whereas the corresponding taxable labor income elasticity estimates hover between 0.19-0.21 for males and 0.96-1.44 for women. Moreover, for men we find that the taxable labor income elasticity with respect to non-labor income is statistically significant; the point estimate being -0.07.

It employs a unique firm-level data set of German manufacturers combining financial statements with firm-specific information about credit market restrictions. The results show that approximately 20 per cent of all firms report both positive taxable income and capital market restrictions. Taking account of the income tax rates and the size differences of the firms, we find that demand stabilization through the corporate income tax amounts to about 8 per cent of an initial shock to gross revenues. This stabilization effect varies over the business cycle and tends to increase during cyclical downturns.","[Buettner, Thiess] Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Fuest, Clemens] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford OX1 HP, England",Ifo Institut; University of Oxford,"Buettner, T (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",buettner@ifo.de; clemens.fuest@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,"Buettner, Thiess/0000-0001-7490-0122",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,12,13,14,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

This paper attempts to bridge this gap by providing a new, 'improved' human development index (IHDI), informed by welfare economics. The IHDI is presented here alongside the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) HDI for the world and its main regions since the late 19th century. Social dimensions in the IHDI are derived, following Kakwani (Journal of Development Economics 41 (1993), pp. 307-336), with a convex achievement function, whereas a geometric average is employed to combine its dimensions (longevity, knowledge and income). Thus, the IHDI does not conceal the gap between rich and poor countries and casts a much less optimistic view than the conventional UNDP index, while it fits with the UNDP concern for international differences. The paper's findings highlight main weaknesses in human development dimensions of present-day developing countries.","Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"de la Escosura, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",,"de la Escosura, Leandro Prados/H-9476-2015","de la Escosura, Leandro Prados/0000-0002-2362-4305",,,,,220,19,20,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We demonstrate that when using a conventional definition of the social deprivation index typically applied in the literature, immigrants do not necessarily appear to be socially deprived. We propose a weighting scheme that weights components of social deprivation by their subjective contribution to an overall measure of life satisfaction. Using this weighting scheme to calculate an index of social deprivation, we find that immigrants experience a significant degree of social deprivation, confirming much of the economic literature examining the economic assimilation of immigrants in Germany. This result is driven by particularly high weights being attributed to employment. Also the size of the groups in need is smaller when using the innovative weighting scheme, allowing a more precise targeting of economic policy.","[Sinning, Mathias] Australian Natl Univ, RSE, Social Policy Evaluat Anal & Res Ctr SPEAR, RWI, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Haisken-DeNew, John] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany",Australian National University; Ruhr University Bochum,"Sinning, M (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, RSE, Social Policy Evaluat Anal & Res Ctr SPEAR, RWI, Crisp Bldg, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",mathias.sinning@anu.edu.au,"de New, John/K-1071-2013","de New, John/0000-0002-9198-1814; Sinning, Mathias/0000-0002-8526-3517",,,,,37,20,20,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Some of the largest reductions in poverty are observed for provinces with poverty rates close to the national average. The poorest provinces are experiencing reductions in poverty, albeit at a more modest pace. Provinces and districts with a larger poverty reduction in the period 1999-2006 tended to have a lower level of inequality in 2006.

Further, Zipf's law on word frequency is confirmed to be universally independent of individual activity types.","[Sano, Yukie; Takayasu, Misako] Tokyo Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Computat Intelligence & Syst Sci, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268502, Japan",Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Sano, Y (通讯作者)，Tokyo Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Computat Intelligence & Syst Sci, Midori Ku, 4259 Nagatsuta Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268502, Japan.",ysano@phys.ge.cst.nihon-u.ac.jp,"Sano, Yukie/AAD-4791-2020; Takayasu, Misako/H-9890-2014","Sano, Yukie/0000-0001-8670-1024; Takayasu, Misako/0000-0002-2467-614X",,,,,11,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

The form of uncertainty is manifested as uncertainty about the effect of past disinflation policy on the current output gap. This differs from other studies on learning and control in a monetary policy context (e.g., Ellison, 2006; Svensson and Williams, 2007) that assume uncertainty about the effects of current policy actions on the economy. We derive the central bank's optimal disinflation strategy under active learning (DOP) and compare it with two limiting cases-certainty equivalence policy (CEP), or passive learning, and a Brainard-style cautionary monetary policy (CP). It turns out that under the DOP inflation stays between the levels implied by the CEP and the CP. A novel result-e.g., unlike Beck and Wieland (2002)-is that this holds irrespective of the initial level of inflation. At high levels of inherited inflation the DOP moves closer to the CEP, at low levels of inherited inflation the DOP resembles the CP. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Tesfaselassie, M.

We provide an example in which an agent's equilibrium consumption is zero eventually with probability one even if she has correct beliefs and is marginally more patient. We then prove the following general result: if markets are effectively incomplete forever then on any equilibrium path on which some agent's consumption is bounded away from zero eventually, the other agent's consumption is zero eventually so either some agent vanishes, in that she consumes zero eventually, or the consumption of both agents is arbitrarily close to zero infinitely often. Later we show that (a) for most economies in which individual endowments are finite state time homogeneous Markov processes, the consumption of an agent who has a uniformly positive endowment cannot converge to zero and (b) the possibility that an agent vanishes is a robust outcome since for a wide class of economies with incomplete markets, there are equilibria in which an agent's consumption is zero eventually with probability one even though she has correct beliefs as in the example. In sharp contrast to the results in the case studied by Sandroni (2000) [29] and Blume and Easley (2006) [8] where markets are complete, our results show that when markets are incomplete not only can the more patient agent (or the one with more accurate beliefs) be eliminated but there are situations in which neither agent is eliminated.

This technique allows us to simultaneously analyze the impact of the aforementioned factors on each other. We find that increases in well-being are associated with subsequent increases in income, marriage, employment, and health variables, while increases in the these life-domain variables (except health) tend to be followed by decreases in well-being in subsequent periods, suggesting adaptation dynamics in all domains. In addition to the robust observation that well-being is associated with subsequent longer-term improvements in health status, we observe that health improvements themselves have a long-lasting positive contribution to employment status. Employment status, in turn, has lasting positive effects on income growth. Although well-being per se may be a short-lived phenomenon, our results suggest that it may have longer-term effects through these particular channels. These findings are quite robust to different model specifications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As the analysis demonstrates, the unemployment rates of these two types of labor often move in opposite directions, thereby dampening the change in aggregate unemployment.

These policies may be called successful when the formerly unemployed individuals remain in employment for a longer period of time either as self-employed or as paid-employed worker and also when they become employers they contribute to reduce unemployment not only by creating their own jobs but also by hiring new employees.

Agents are matched in pairs to compete, and each pair faces a particular environment. They are ranked according to the quality of their performances in this particular environment, and a fraction of the highest ranked agents are promoted. The size of this fraction characterizes the selectivity of the process, and we distinguish between local and global selectivity. We study the role of the degree of selectivity in the dynamic process where types of agent differ in their expected performances. Surprisingly, we find that an increase in the selectivity of the process can be detrimental to the agents with the highest expected performances and can increase the survivability of the lesser performing. However, if the selectivity decreases, the only survivor is the agent with the highest expected performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The gap between best possible practice and actual performance (often referred to as the know-do gap) is difficult to measure among doctors who differ in levels of training and experience and who face very different types of patients. we exploit the Hawthorne effect-in which doctors change their behavior when a researcher comes to observe their practices-to measure the gap between best and actual performance. We analyze this gap for a sample of doctors and also examine the impact of the organization for which doctors work on their performance. We find that some organizations succeed in motivating doctors to work at levels of performance that are close to their best possible practice. This paper adds to recent evidence that motivation can be as important to health care quality as training and knowledge. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The paper breaks with the mainstream economics approach which dominates the music file-sharing discussion. Whereas such models assume relationships at the micro level (e.g. between file-sharing and purchases) based on observations made at the macro level, our evolutionary economics approach measures the direct effects using micro data representative of the Canadian population. The behavioral incentives underpinning free music downloading, novel to this paper, are the multiple effects of: 'unwillingness to pay' (market substitution), 'hear before buying' (market creation), 'not wanting to buy a whole album' (market segmentation), and 'not available in the CD format or on electronic pay-sites' (market creation). Although the two first mentioned incentives significantly influence CD album purchases-i.e. there is a negative and significant market substitution effect and a positive and significant market creation effect-on the whole, these two effects 'cancel' one another out, leading to no association between the number of P2P files downloaded and CD album sales.","[Andersen, Birgitte; Frenz, Marion] Univ London, Dept Management, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London,"Andersen, B (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Management, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",b.andersen@bbk.ac.uk; m.frenz@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,30,47,51,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

A well known result of tax incidence is that consumers of a more heavily taxed good pay a higher price and thus buy less of the good. The present paper shows that this result need not hold in a two-sided market. On the contrary, a higher ad valorem tax may lower end-user prices and spur sales. Thus, two-sided platform firms may not at all engage in tax shifting via price increases. We further show that a higher ad valorem tax may undermine a firm's incentive to differentiate its product from that of its competitors.

A principal-agent framework is used to model the landlord's decision to rent when he takes into account the risk of losing the land to the tenant and when contract enforcement is decreasing in social distance with the tenant. These effects are quantified for the case of local land rental markets in the Dominican Republic. Results show that insecure property rights lead to matching in the tenancy market along socioeconomic lines, severely limiting the size of the rental market and the choice of tenants for landlords, both with efficiency costs. Social segmentation reduces access to land for the rural poor, with high equity costs. Simulations suggest that improving tenure security would increase rental transactions by 21% and the area rented to the poor by 63%. Increased property rights security is hence beneficial not only to asset owners, but also to those with whom they might interact in the market. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The economics profession itself, overly confident of its ability to engineer stability encouraged financial actors to exceed the traditional dictates of caution. The financial crisis that ensued also revealed many fault lines. One of the most glaring was an absence of international coordination, which encouraged regulatory shopping. Dramatic actions taken by public authorities in the fall of 2008 avoided collapse, but left a legacy of increased moral hazard, to which the best long-term answer is radical structural reform.

I classify 72 economists and find that most of those economists who publish a judgment favor liberalization to one extent or another. This consensus among the surveyed economists pretty well fits opinion of economists in general. The consensus is not universal, however. The organ issue raises interesting analytic issues in the meaning of liberalization, for quite a few economists favor reforms of presumed consent or mandated choice, both of which, in themselves, would seem to be a contravention of the liberty principle.

We investigate these questions in the case of finitely repeated public goods experiments. We find that belief accuracy is significantly higher when beliefs are incentivized. The relationship between contributions and beliefs is slightly steeper under incentives. However, we find that incentivized beliefs tend to lead to higher contribution levels than either non-incentivized beliefs or no beliefs at all.

A central result is that the positive relationship between caring and a favourable access to land bequest indeed exists, yet is only observed for migrant children (whether urban or rural, long-distance or short-distance migrants). Combined with other findings and observations, this result strengthens the case for an interpretation based on an active role of potential heirs in the determination of inheritance outcomes. It therefore calls into question the strategic bequest theory which presumes that parents are the ultimate decision-makers in this matter. In addition, our study shows that inheritance patterns are complex: besides migration and caring behavior, personal characteristics of potential heirs, such as gender, birth order, and family status (having children or not), do appear to influence division of parental land.

First, it highlights the fact that lighter data collection processes in some developing countries have added to measurement errors in consumption and income aggregates measurement errors. The paper reasserts the need to apply reference guidelines to the measurement of household consumption in order to compute comparable distribution indicators across countries and over time. Second, it contends that it is hard to analyze inequality solely from consumption patterns without taking income and savings into account. Two solutions are proposed for the correction of income measurement errors: by using savings declarations and by implementing a multiple imputation procedure. The results are based on a careful analysis of the EPM93 survey of Madagascar whose design is quite close to the LSMS household surveys, and the ENV98 survey of Cote d'Ivoire representative of surveys conducted nowadays in most Sub-Saharan African countries.","[Mesple-Somps, Sandrine] IRD, UMR DIAL, F-75010 Paris, France; [Mesple-Somps, Sandrine] Univ Paris 09, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Guenard, Charlotte] Univ Paris 01, UMR Dev & Soc, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Mesplé-Somps, S (通讯作者)，IRD, UMR DIAL, 4 Rue Enghien, F-75010 Paris, France.",mesple@dial.prd.fr,"Guénard, Charlotte/H-2112-2018; mesple-somps, Sandrine/G-4526-2016","mesple-somps, Sandrine/0000-0002-0795-7871",,,,,44,6,7,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Markov regime-switching (MRS) models seem to be a natural candidate for modeling this spiky behavior. However, in the studies published so far, the goodness-of-fit of the proposed models has not been a major focus. While most of the models were elegant, their fit to empirical data has either been not examined thoroughly or the signs of a bad fit ignored. With this paper we want to fill the gap. We calibrate and test a range of MRS models in an attempt to find parsimonious specifications that not only address the main characteristics of electricity prices but are statistically sound as well. We find that the best structure is that of an independent spike 3-regime model with time-varying transition probabilities, heteroscedastic diffusion-type base regime dynamics and shifted spike regime distributions. Not only does it allow for a seasonal spike intensity throughout the year and consecutive spikes or price drops, which is consistent with market observations, but also exhibits the 'inverse leverage effect' reported in the literature for spot electricity prices.

Although we show that the degree of prudence is not an accurate indicator of the degree of downside risk aversion, we nonetheless demonstrate that a uniform increase in prudence accompanied by a uniform increase (decrease) in risk aversion is sufficient to indicate greater downside risk aversion, provided prudence is greater (less) than three times the degree of risk aversion.

Monetary policy is identified within a nonlinear, structural VAR framework with a regime-switching policy block that allows for contemporaneous policy reactions in a small open economy. The key finding is that monetary policy in Canada has undergone important changes in monetary policy regimes since the early 1970s that correspond to changes in operating procedures and medium-term inflation targets. Overall, the Bank of Canada is found to use a hybrid operating procedure in different monetary policy regimes, where it sets a monetary policy rate, while leaning against the wind to smooth exchange-rate fluctuations and to offset unexpected increases in long-term yields in order to maintain monetary conditions. Although the magnitude of the contemporaneous monetary policy responses are regime-dependent, the transmission of the responses through financial markets are regime independent. The study also constructs regime-switching measures of the overall level and relative volatility of monetary conditions that captures both the endogenous and exogenous components of the monetary policy response function.

The logical inconsistency is because the AD and AS curves represent two mutually exclusive theories of the relation between output and the price level in the same economy. The empirical unreality is that it assumes that, when there is excess supply, prices will fall, and furthermore, falling prices will return the economy to full employment. Neither of these assumptions is valid for our economy today.

The presented methodological approach is applied on the real gross domestic product data sets, the total industry (excluding construction), the gross capital formation and the final consumption expenditure. The selected variables are taken from the national accounts system. The obtained results are compared to the widely used naive technique of business cycle dating written by Canova (1998, 1999) or Bonenkamp (2001).

The survey included 21 policy questions, each anchored in the status quo and soliciting judgment on whether policy should be liberalized, kept the same, or made more restrictive. Of the 21 issues, on 13 the average judgment leans toward liberalization (often dramatically so), on 3 is very close to the status quo, and on 5 leans toward greater restriction (never dramatically so). I create a liberalization score for each respondent and find that a majority lean toward liberalization. Comparing Czech economists to American economists, we notice some interesting differences.

To operationalize the concept of these intangibles we use the idea of the 'nation brand'. Nation brands are strongly related to the idea of 'country-of-origin' biases for both industrial and consumer products. It is known that the 'country-of-origin' serves often as a product characteristic, an informational cue, but also as a means of applying a heuristic for simplified decision-making. Given its role for purchase decisions, the size and direction of the country-of-origin bias should be important for multinational investors when choosing the location of production, and everything else given, investors should choose as their location of production countries to which consumers show a positive country bias. In a similar spirit, the strength of nation brands may be used as a heuristic or a source of information about the quality of a country as an investment decision. Using the EUROSTAT data on FDI flows from 30 source countries to 34 host countries for the years 2005 and 2006 and the Anholt Nation Brands Index as our measure of these intangibles, we find that this index has a significant and strong impact on FDI flows in a multivariate analysis that is based on the knowledge-capital (KC) model of FDI. The volume of FDI into a host country is shown to rise by 27 percent as its nation index, the measure for the quality of these intangibles, improves by one point. Among the six components of the index, the perceptions about a country's products, about its social and economic conditions and about cultural aspects are most relevant. Our results suggest that the nation brands index accounts for important aspects of FDI decisions that are not captured in fundamental data which explain FDI in the standard foreign trade approach to FDI.","[Konrad, Kai A.] Max Planck Inst Intellectual Property Competit &, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Kalamova, Margarita M.] Social Sci Res Ctr Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Konrad, KA (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Intellectual Property Competit &, Marstallpl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",margarita.kalamova@oecd.org; kai.konrad@ip.mpg.de,,,,,,,36,16,19,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2010,63.0,3,,,,,400,431,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00480.x,0.0,,,32,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,626AV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279939000005,0

But while the adverse effect of AD on product-level trade has long been established, the question remains whether there are trade effects at the aggregate level. The recent proliferation wave of AD laws and their use provides us with a unique policy change to estimate the true trade effects of adopting and enforcing AD laws. For this purpose, we estimate the effect of AD on bilateral trade flows between the new adopters of AD laws and their trade partners. Using a gravity model of annual observations (1980-2000) our estimates show that AD has trade chilling effects on aggregate import volumes but the impacts are heterogeneous across sectors. We find that new tough users experience a chilling of their aggregate imports of 14 billion US$ a year (or 5.9%) as a result of AD measures. For some countries like Mexico and India, the dampening effects of AD laws on trade flows are found to substantially offset the increase in trade volumes derived from trade liberalization.

Both sectors are subjected to search and matching frictions in the labour market and wage bargaining. As a result, some of the workers searching for jobs end up being unemployed. Countries are similar except for frictions in their labour markets, such as efficiency of matching and costs of posting vacancies, which can vary across the sectors. The differentiated-product industry has firm heterogeneity and monopolistic competition. We study the interaction of labour market rigidities and trade impediments in shaping welfare, trade flows, productivity, and unemployment. We show that both countries gain from trade. A country with relatively lower frictions in the differentiated-product industry exports differentiated products on net. A country benefits from lowering frictions in its differentiated sector's labour market, but this harms the country's trade partner. Alternatively, a simultaneous, proportional lowering of labour market frictions in the differentiated sectors of both countries benefits both of them. The opening to trade raises a country's rate of unemployment if its relative labour market frictions in the differentiated sector are low, and it reduces the rate of unemployment if its relative labour market frictions in the differentiated sector are high. Cross-country differences in rates of unemployment exhibit rich patterns. In particular, lower labour market frictions do not ensure lower unemployment, and unemployment and welfare can both rise in response to falling labour market frictions and falling trade costs.","[Helpman, Elhanan] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Itskhoki, Oleg] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Harvard University; Princeton University,"Helpman, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"tavasoli, farzan/0000-0001-5211-645X",,,,,45,221,251,1,75,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We draw inspiration from the literature on self-reproducing automata to clarify the notion of information transfer in replication processes. To enhance complexity, developmental instructions must be part of the information that is transmitted in replication. In addition to the established triple conditions of causality, similarity and information transfer, a generative replicator involves a conditional generative mechanism that can use signals from an environment and create developmental instructions. We develop a simple model, a one-dimensional linear automaton that is consistent with our four proposed conditions for a generative replicator. We show that evolution within this model will indeed approach maximal complexity, but only if our four proposed conditions are not violated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The presence of rate of return regulation for prices, the impact of the Telecommunications Act 1996. the application of unbundled network elements-platform (UNE-P) and total element long-run incremental costs (TELRIC) rules and inter-modal competitive threats have pressurized wages downwards, while after mergers smaller firms experience higher wage levels.

The political and social history of Europe provides a rich source of variation in these two variables at a regional level.

However, water delivery is a local government function, which, in the absence of a national regulator, is largely operated as a commercial service. Using the lens of the Mazibuko water rights case-the first South African test case on the right to water-this article examines the conflict between a progressive rights-based model, which views water as a social good, and the commercialized model, which treats water as a source of revenue instead of a public service. The article finds in the legal iterations of the Mazibuko applicants the potential for a new, more equitable approach to water services.

Conditional on shocks to technology and monetary policy, the results square with simple models. Moreover, permanent inflation shocks accounted for the counter-cyclical and inversely leading behavior of the real rate during the Great Inflation (1959-1979).

In particular, this paper considers a growth model in which the young generation confronts a trade-off between an education for human capital accumulation and child labour. At low levels of human capital, both the fertility rate and income transfers from children to parents are at high levels, because the opportunity cost of child rearing is low, and the wages of child labour are important for household income with low parental labour wages. An increase in the human capital decreases the fertility rate and reverses the income transfers to the opposite direction from parents to children. Thus, we demonstrate the significant relationship between demographic transition and intergenerational transfers. We also demonstrate the possibility of multiple equilibria in the form of a poverty trap equilibrium with a low human capital level and a steady state with a high human capital level.

Following the death of a superstar, we find that collaborators experience, on average, a lasting 5% to 8% decline in their quality-adjusted publication rates. By exploring interactions of the treatment effect with a variety of star, coauthor, and star/coauthor dyad characteristics, we seek to adjudicate between plausible mechanisms that might explain this finding. Taken together, our results suggest that spillovers are circumscribed in idea space, but less so in physical or social space. In particular, superstar extinction reveals the boundaries of the scientific field to which the star contributes-the invisible college.","[Azoulay, Pierre; Wang, Jialan] MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zivin, Joshua S.

Income comparisons are considered to be at least somewhat important by three-quarters of Europeans. They are associated with both lower levels of subjective well-being and a greater demand for income redistribution. The rich compare less and are happier than average when they do, which latter is consistent with relative income theory. With respect to the direction of comparisons, colleagues are the most frequently-cited reference group.

In the model, Northern firms invent new higher-quality products, multinational firms transfer manufacturing operations to the South and the Southern firms imitate products produced by multinational firms. It is shown that stronger IPR protection in the South (i.e., the adoption and implementation of the TRIPs agreement) leads to a permanent increase in the rate of technology transfer to the South within multinational firms, a permanent increase in R&D employment by Southern affiliates of Northern multinationals, a permanent decrease in the North-South wage gap, and a temporary increase in the Northern innovation rate.

Although the standard literature suggests that firms should only invest if the return exceeds the cost of capital, there are several theories that explain the use of investment hurdle rates that differ from discount rates. In fact, our data show that instances where hurdle rates are either above or below the discount rate are common. In a statistical analysis, we find that this behaviour can be explained by a combination of agency theory and real options theory. We take this as important evidence that a full explanation of capital investment cannot be accomplished without a consideration of behavioural and strategic influences on the investment decision.","[Driver, Ciaran] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Imperial Coll Business Sch, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Temple, Paul] Univ Surrey, Dept Econ, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England",Imperial College London; University of Surrey,"Driver, C (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Imperial Coll Business Sch, London SW7 2AZ, England.",c.driver@imperial.ac.uk,"Driver, Ciaran/AAN-8007-2020","driver, ciaran/0000-0002-9297-806X",,,,,61,6,6,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We also compare announced reductions in domestic government employment and consumption, showing that these two policies have the same qualitative effects.

For (i), we examine how inflow and outflow of foreign physical capital affects current account. For the second case, we examine how an increase in current account deficit affects foreign investments.

This is deemed difficult, contingent, and only partially understood. The adage 'health is wealth' is still, primarily, an intuitive proposition. A vast majority of researchers instead present theoretical and empirical arguments of the reverse proposition, i.e. 'wealth is health'. A recent strand of the literature, however, reflects changes in the perceptions: improvements of health and longevity are no longer viewed as a mere end-or by-product of economic development; but argued as one of the key determinants of, and therefore means to achieve, economic development and poverty reduction. Hence, better health does not have to wait for an improved economy; rather, measures to reduce the burden of disease, to give children healthy childhoods, to increase life expectancy etc. will in themselves contribute to creating richer economies. Drawing on the traditional and emerging perspectives on the health-income relationship, this literature review presents a non-exhaustive survey of existing methodological approaches and their results that are applied to track and measure how health influences economic outcomes.","[Husain, Muhammad Jami] Keele Univ, Res Inst Publ Policy & Management, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England",Keele University,"Husain, MJ (通讯作者)，Keele Univ, Res Inst Publ Policy & Management IPPM, Claus Moser Res Ctr, Room CM 2-02, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England.",m.j.husain@ippm.keele.ac.uk,,"Husain, Muhammad Jami/0000-0001-6049-0505",,,,,165,1,1,3,8,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 28,2010,4.0,,,,,,,,201014,,,,,53,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865AN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298282900001,0

The technological achievement index (TAI) and its four components, creation of technology, diffusion of old innovations, diffusion of recent innovations and human skills, are used as proxies for technological innovation. The two first components are considered proxies for knowledge acquisition and assimilation (potential absorptive capacity), whereas the last two are taken as proxies for knowledge transformation and exploitation (realised absorptive capacity). We hypothesise that the effect of technological innovation on trade could vary according to the technological achievement by generating a non-linear relationship between technological innovation and trade. Our findings indicate a positive and non-linear effect of technological innovation on export performance, which indicates that there are thresholds for positive signs to occur. To foster exports, countries have to consider not only acquisition and assimilation capabilities, but also transformation and exploitation capabilities once a minimum level of potential absorptive capacity has been achieved.","[Marquez-Ramos, Laura] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Marquez-Ramos, Laura] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Ibero Amer Inst Econ Res, Gottingen, Germany",Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I,"Márquez-Ramos, L (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",lmarquez@eco.uji.es,"Márquez-Ramos, Laura/ABB-6904-2021; Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014","Márquez-Ramos, Laura/0000-0002-2193-9645; Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557",,,,,35,25,26,1,41,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 8,2010,4.0,,,,,,,,201011,,,,,38,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865AK,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298282500001,0

The optimal mechanism under these changing circumstances involves a remedy system for breach of trade agreements that specifies less-than-proportional retaliations against deviating parties. This result is in contrast to the conventional wisdom in the literature regarding the efficiency of the Reciprocity Principle as a rule of renegotiation in trade agreements. I also consider an institutional structure in which only commensurate retaliations are practical but governments can employ a public randomizing device to authorize retaliations. I show that it is optimal to authorize retaliations only randomly. This suggests a role for the WTO dispute settlement process as a public randomizing device. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The theory assumes that information is immense and that economic actors are boundedly rational. This makes practically all economic activities to some extent uncertain and unpredictable; they become experimental in nature. Economic growth is, hence, viewed as an evolutionary process of the discovery, use and selection of knowledge. So-called competence blocs-the minimum set of agents with different, but complementary competencies required to generate and commercialize new combinations-are identified as necessary for efficient resource allocation. The incentives given by the institutions to the actors in the competence bloc are crucial for economic performance.","Ratio Inst, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Johansson, D (通讯作者)，Ratio Inst, POB 3203, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden.",dan.johansson@ratio.se,,,,,,,77,15,15,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In times when US housing collateral is scarce nationally, regional consumption is about twice as sensitive to income shocks. We also document higher sensitivity in regions with lower housing collateral. Household-level borrowing frictions can explain this new stylized fact. When the value of housing relative to human wealth falls, loan collateral shrinks, borrowing (risk-sharing) declines, and the sensitivity of consumption to income increases. Our model aggregates heterogeneous, borrowing-constrained households into regions characterized by a common housing market. The resulting regional consumption patterns quantitatively match those in the data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, at the aggregate level, while the Vickrey auction generates significantly higher revenue than does iBEA, the iBEA auction generates significantly higher bidder profit and efficiency. Additionally, a significantly larger proportion of iBEA auctions achieves 100% efficiency than does the Vickrey auction.

We find that introducing a fixed deficit regime does not affect the long run growth rate compared to a balanced budget while establishing a golden rule results in higher growth. Simulations of welfare effects indicate that a golden rule leads to highest welfare followed by a balanced budget and a fixed deficit regime. A maximum fraction of deficit financed public investment is derived. Varying the intertemporal elasticity of substitution shows that economies populated by households who have a strong tendency to smooth consumption should adhere to a balanced budget from a welfare point of view.

This result follows because at-the-money options used to induce managerial effort tilt the CEO's preferences toward project continuation. When the CEO is free to unload stock options at will, he will do so exactly in those states where the continuation bias is most detrimental (i.e., in the event of bad news), making the CEO willing to abandon the project.","Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Laux, V (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",volker.laux@mccombs.utexas.edu,"laux, volker/C-5230-2017",,,,,,30,5,7,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

We adopt a Component-ARJI model with structural break analysis, utilizing daily data on West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot and futures contracts. The analytical results verify the existence of permanent and transitory components in conditional variance, with the permanent component of conditional variance increasing with the occurrence of a sudden major event (such as the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait, Operation Desert Storm and the war between the US and Iraq), and a relatively greater increase in the transitory component over the same period. Notably, jump intensity fluctuates with an increase in the transitory component of conditional variance in response to abnormal events. it is the transitory component which serves as the primary influential factor for jumps in returns: therefore, speculators are willing to take large risks, particularly with respect to anticipating future price movements, or gambling, in the hopes of rapidly making substantial gains: thus, speculators prefer the temporary volatility component and engage in trade activities. However, investors prefer the permanent volatility component, because they may well be better off relocating their assets into more stable portfolios to outperform the market portfolio over the long run.

An information structure is better than another, with respect to a certain Solution concept, if the highest solution payoff it induces is at least that induced by the other structure. This paper characterizes the Situation where one information structure is better than another with respect to various solution concepts: Nash equilibrium, strategic-normal-form correlated equilibrium, agent-normal-form correlated equilibrium and belief-invariant Bayesian solution.

We find empirical evidence that Mexico and Brazil pursues a 'tough' monetary policy, whereas Chile and Peru appear to pursue 'mild' monetary policy against inflation. Apparently, Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela do not change nominal interest rates to tackle inflation fluctuations and adopt 'lax' monetary policies. Exchange rate change seems to be a relevant variable for interest rate decisions only for Mexico, whereas the output gap only appears to matter to Chile, Colombia and Venezuela.

Legal persons are fictitious non-mortal species whose evolution has played a major role in economic development. In what sense can they be said to have a purpose? Thanks to several important mutations, the status of legal persons was transferred from public bodies to business corporations. This evolutionary journey is complementary to the Coasian view, which, moving in the opposite direction, explains the firm as a centralization of market transactions. If the corporation emerged also from a process of decentralization of public attributes, some features of public legal persons, are lacking in its business mutation. Also some ways of motivating people are only available to the original species.","[Pagano, Ugo] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Pagano, Ugo] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary",University of Siena; Central European University,"Pagano, U (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",pagano@unisi.it,,,,,,,15,7,7,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Previous analysis of this trend tends to focus on either the cost savings for the patients or the revenue potential for the host economies. However, viewing the health sector merely in the monetary terms of transnational trade presents contradictions, which call for re-evaluating yet again the limitations of measuring economic progress merely in monetary terms. This article examines these contradictions based on a case study of the medical tourism industry in India. While health tourism is a potential revenue source, it also competes with the domestic health sector and could transfer some of the health care problems of the developed world to the developing world.","Richard Stockton Coll New Jersey, Pomona, NJ 08240 USA",Stockton University,"Vijaya, RM (通讯作者)，Richard Stockton Coll New Jersey, Pomona, NJ 08240 USA.",,,,,,,,34,32,33,1,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

I confirm and extend this result using data from 1958 to 1996 that includes 35 industries (roughly two-digit SIC level) and spans the entire US economy. Changes in industry shares in total value-added are essentially unrelated to aggregate labor's share movements. Industry labor's shares comovements contribute positively to aggregate labor's share movements. These findings give us a clearer perspective on one of the stylized facts of economic growth. If the great macroeconomic ratio is meaningful, it must be interpreted in terms of long-run, offsetting shifts in services industries versus goods industries, both in terms of their labor's shares and shares in total value-added. At least at an annual frequency, there is nothing particularly stable about aggregate labor's share. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We find that the substitution elasticity between employment of the EUR14 parent companies and employment in their foreign affiliates in the CEEC is quite low. Furthermore, the substitution possibilities are higher between parent company and affiliate employment in other West European countries than those between parent company and affiliate employment in the CEEC. Finally, we find that the output change of the parent company and to a lesser extent that of the foreign affiliates is more important than changes in relative wages in determining the relative labour demand.","[Falk, Martin; Wolfmayr, Yvonne] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,"Falk, M (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",Martin.Falk@wifo.ac.at; yvonne.wolfmayr@wifo.ac.at,"Falk, Martin Thomas/T-8325-2019","Falk, Martin Thomas/0000-0003-0518-6513",,,,,25,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2010,37.0,1,,,SI,,87,100,,10.1007/s10663-009-9112-9,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V25OC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208486300006,0

We show the conditions under which guilt, favoritism, and altruism can be identified using such data. We find that parents behaved altruistically, showed favoritism, but also exhibited guilt: the child experiencing more rustication years received higher parental transfers despite having higher earnings.

An increase in the accessibility to health care services is associated with higher per capita real health care expenditure.

While the primary measure for convergence and catching up is per capita output, we also look at other macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment rates, wage rates and production levels in the manufacturing sector. In contrast to existing studies of convergence between regions of the reunified Germany, our approach is based purely upon the time series dimension and is thus directly focused on the catching up process in East Germany as a region. Our testing set-up includes standard ADF unit root tests as well as unit root tests that endogenously allow for a break in the deterministic component of the process. We find evidence of catching up for East Germany for most of the indicators. However, the convergence speed is slow, and thus it can be expected that the catching up process will take further decades until the regional gap is closed.","[Scheufele, Rolf] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Aumann, Bernd] Univ Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); University of Lausanne,"Scheufele, R (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Halle, Saale, Germany.",rolf.scheufele@iwh-halle.de,,,,,,,32,3,3,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,2,,,,,177,192,PII 922471301,10.1080/14631371003740662,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,600SB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278006500004,0

As both nature and society exist and develop in the geographic space, a good decision making can hardly be imagined without a prior thorough analysis of spatio-temporal distribution and spatial correlation of diverse ecological, economical and social parameters. Wherever such geospatial relationships are concerned, the methods of geography as of a geographic information science are commonly applied, among which cartography is the most efficient information communication method. Different levels of representation of geographic information, such as databases, geographic information systems (GIS), maps, atlases and Spatial Data Infrastructures can be easily and conveniently used for different steps of planning. More than that, maps have a hidden potential to reveal unknown spatial patterns and trends and the process does not require any specific technological skills from the user. Therefore it is very important to include geographic/cartographic dimension into regional and national sustainable development strategies, so that spatial structures, diversities, similarities and geographic determination are always taken into account. To facilitate the process of geographic decision making, we develop a uniform model of description of geographic methods that could be used online and provide suggestions on which of the known methods could be efficiently applied.","[Beconyte, Giedre; Kryzanauskas, Audrius] Vilnius Univ, Ctr Cartog, LT-03101 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Beconyte, G (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Ctr Cartog, MK Ciurlionio G 21-27, LT-03101 Vilnius, Lithuania.",giedre.beconyte@gf.vu.lt; a.kryzanauskas@gis-centras.lt,"Beconyte, Giedre/AEQ-4037-2022",,,,,,19,9,9,0,10,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-8619,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

That is why some procedures for the transformation of cost criteria to benefit criteria are necessary to be used. Unfortunately, these procedures are usually outside of the MCDM methods' algorithms. The problem is that some combinations of criteria transformation method and the MCDM method provide incorrect results of the original MCDM model and so they cannot be used.

A static model estimated by first differencing gavethe best overall results in terms of theoretical expectations, pattern ofresiduals, prediction accuracy and parsimony. The results showed thatsawlog supply responded positively to its own price (elasticity e = 0.91 +/- 0.07) but negatively to the pulpwood price (e = -0.22 +/- 0.06). The pulpwood supply responded positively to the price of both pulpwood (e = 0.53 +/- 0.06) and sawlogs (e = 0.20 +/- 0.07). Sawlog and pulpwood supply had a common elasticity of 2.04 (+/- 0.25) with respect to the growing stock, and of 0.30 (+/- 0.21) with respect to the interest rate. The supply elasticity of substitution of sawlog for pulpwood with respect to their relative price was 0.74 +/- 0.04. Policies to raise the annual harvest, which is currently well below the annual growth, should focus on stimulating sawnwood production (thus increasing sawlog prices), because this would increase supply of both pulpwood and sawlogs. Instead, policies to stimulate pulpwood demand (thus increasing pulpwood prices), would give more pulpwood, but less sawlogs.","[Buongiorno, Joseph] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Bolkesjo, Torjus F.; Solberg, Birger] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Buongiorno, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jbuongio@wisc.edu,,,,,,,30,22,23,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using quantile regression, the article describes the effects of schooling on the location and shape of the conditional wage distribution in each sector. While the average impact of schooling on wages is similar across sectors, the impact of schooling on within-groups dispersion is found to be substantially larger in the private sector than in the public sector.

We then constructed distributions of intensities and electoral outcomes and estimated the probable impact of the bonus vote through bootstrapping techniques. The bonus vote performs well: when minority preferences are particularly intense, the minority wins at least one contest with 15-30 percent probability; when the minority wins, aggregate welfare increases with 85-95 percent probability.

Under the pseudo complements regime, firm A behaves as if it is an independent monopolist, whereas firm B behaves as if the two products are strict complements. We characterize several properties of the pseudo complements regime. We show that the double mark-up problem persists in the pseudo complement regime. However, when firm A incorporates firm B's function into product A, it alleviates the double mark-up problem.

Despite many publications on perceived quality, the position of the construct relative to the other key constructs in marketing remains vague. This research tries to bring conceptual clarity with regard to the relationship between perceived service quality, perceived price, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. The proposed model is defined in line with the existing theoretical findings. Besides, this research is conducted to examine the sustainability of service quality dimensions and service price dimensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina's retail banking. In order to test the defined model and research hypotheses empirical research was conducted on the sample of 300 retail bank customers of three leading banks in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Research results indicate that the defined model has an acceptable level of fit to the empirical data. This paper contributes to the existing literature by identifying the effects of different service quality and price quality dimensions on customer satisfaction and loyalty. A dimension-specific approach used in this study can help bank managers to gain useful insight regarding the relative contribution of each dimension to the management of customer satisfaction and loyalty. This research has several limitations that need to highlight. The sample size was relatively small (n= 300) and the survey was conducted in a single service setting with a few banks under investigation. Thus, future research with a larger sample and tested in other service setting is needed to enhance the generalizability of the findings.","[Cinjarevic, Merima; Tatic, Kasim; Avdic, Armin] Sch Business & Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Cinjarevic, M (通讯作者)，Sch Business & Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",merima.cinjarevic@efsa.unsa.ba; kasim.tatic@efsa.unsa.ba; armin.avdic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Činjarević, Merima/H-5915-2019","Cinjarevic, Merima/0000-0002-1751-8311",,,,,42,9,9,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We depart from the two familiar explanations of equity home bias: transaction costs that impede international diversification, and terms of trade responses to supply shocks that provide risk sharing, so that there is little incentive to hold diversified portfolios. We show that the interaction of the following ingredients generates a realistic equity home bias: capital accumulation and international trade in stocks and bonds. In our model, domestic stocks are used to hedge fluctuations in local wage income. Terms of trade risk is hedged using bonds denominated in local goods and in foreign goods. In contrast to related models, the low level of international diversification does not depend on strongly countercyclical terms of trade. The model also reproduces the cyclical dynamics of foreign asset positions and of international capital flows. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For given cost reductions, lower elasticities harm consumers through a lower pass-through to prices. But these same lower elasticities may increase cost-reducing innovation by firms and thereby help consumers by leading to lower prices. To explore this trade-off, pass-through elasticities are first estimated for 253 US manufacturing industries. After this, two second-stage regressions that use the estimated elasticities are introduced. The first regression finds that higher seller concentration leads to lower pass-through elasticities, whereas the second finds that the lower pass-through elasticities, which accompany higher concentration, lead to higher average annual productivity growth. This means there is a trade-off, and lower elasticities can benefit consumers.","Univ New Brunswick, Dept Econ, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada",University of New Brunswick,"Dickson, V (通讯作者)，Univ New Brunswick, Dept Econ, POB 4400, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada.",vadecon@unb.ca,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

He uses this putative fact about the size distribution of home runs to argue that concern about the use of steroids to enhance home run ability is necessarily misplaced. In this article, we show that the initial claim is false and argue that the subsequent claim about the potential importance of steroid use does not follow from the first. We also show that the method used to establish that the size distribution of home runs is characterized by an infinite variance is unreliable and will find evidence consistent with infinite variance in all but the most trivial of data sets generated by processes with finite variance. Despite a large and growing literature that spans several fields and uses methods and arguments similar to DeVany's, we argue that mere inspection of the unconditional distribution of some human phenomenon is unlikely to yield much insight.

This article examines whether there are any symptoms of the Dutch disease in Russia. Using a variety of Rosstat publications and the CHELEM database, we analyse the trends in production, wages and employment in Russian manufacturing industries, and we study the behaviour of Russian imports and exports. We find that, while Russia exhibits some symptoms of the Dutch disease, e.g. the real appreciation of the ruble, the rise in real wages, the decrease in employment in manufacturing industries and the development of the services sector, manufacturing production nonetheless increased, contradicting the theory of the Dutch disease. These trends can be explained by the gains in productivity and the recovery after the disorganisation in the 1990s, by new market opportunities for Russian products in the European Union and in CIS countries, by a growing Chinese demand for some products and by a booming internal market. Finally, investment in many manufacturing industries was largely encouraged, whereas investment in the energy sector was strongly regulated, which contributed to economic diversification.","[Turkisch, Edouard] Univ Paris Ouest, Nanterre Def & Gen Directorate Treasury & Econ Po, French Minist Econ Ind & Employment, Paris, France; [Turkisch, Edouard] OECD Dev Ctr, Paris, France; [Dobrynskaya, Victoria] Ctr Adv Studies Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Dobrynskaya, Victoria] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",Universite Paris Saclay; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Turkisch, E (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest, Nanterre Def & Gen Directorate Treasury & Econ Po, French Minist Econ Ind & Employment, Paris, France.",edouardturkisch@hotmail.com,,"Dobrynskaya, Victoria/0000-0001-7602-7240",,,,,14,21,26,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,3,,,,,283,302,PII 925489500,10.1080/14631377.2010.498680,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,636WF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280773700002,0

We suggest that the definition for the user costs of housing should be extended by an additional term which mirrors the credit constraints a household would be faced with. This extension term consists of the inflation gap between consumer and house price inflation multiplied by an average loan-to-value ratio and the real house prices. The empirical relevance of our finding is confirmed by a VECM. We provide evidence that the dynamics of residential investment in Germany are significantly influenced by the extended user costs (i.e. basic user costs plus the extension term) as well as by net financial wealth.

In fact, they would have the opposite effect. The business practices that would be banned by such regulation are efficient mechanisms for spreading and reducing risk, lowering transactions costs, and enhancing marketing activities, all of which contribute to innovation and choice. Moreover, product differentiation increases competition and thus contributes both directly and indirectly to consumer choice. While some types of exclusive agreements and other discriminatory practices can theoretically harm competition, the precondition for such harm to occur - i.e., market power in one or more of the affected markets - generally is not present in wireless markets. Hence, the proposed regulations cannot be justified on grounds of market failure. Rather than increasing innovation and consumer choice, as promised, they would severely disrupt the wireless sector's highly successful business model and significantly reduce innovation and consumer choice.","[Leighton, Wayne A.] Francisco Marroquin Univ, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Eisenach, Jeffrey A.] George Mason Univ, Sch Law, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,,ehrlich@evehrlich.net; jeisenach@empiris.com; leighton@ufm.edu,,,,,,,43,5,6,0,13,CONCEPT ECONOMICS,KINGSTON,"CANBERRA OFFICE, 27 JARDINE STREET, PO BOX 5430, KINGSTON, 00000, AUSTRALIA",1446-9022,,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Two rationales for the takeover are advanced: the securing of weapons and other materials to support the conflict, and ideological opposition to resource extraction, particularly gold mining. Resource-related grievances rather than greed provide the main explanation for the takeover and looting. Key concerns registered against the mine include a lack of jobs for locals and regional disappointment over the distribution of the mine's revenue.","World Bank, Honiara, Solomon Islands",The World Bank,"Evans, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Honiara, Solomon Islands.",,,,,,,,33,5,5,0,6,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

The latter, in fact, are found to be harmful for long-run neoclassical economic growth and, in contrast with the common belief, for the rate of population growth as well.

However, we find substantial heterogeneity in the treatment effects, and those most likely to participate in PSE programmes are those who benefit the least from such programmes.","[Graversen, Brian Krogh] Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, DK-1052 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Jensen, Peter] Aarhus Univ, DK-8230 Aabyhoej, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Graversen, BK (通讯作者)，Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, DK-1052 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",brg@sfi.dk; pje@asb.dk,,"Jensen, Peter/0000-0002-5179-6884; Graversen, Brian Krogh/0009-0002-3202-1765",,,,,24,5,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Employment of provided taxation deductions not only provides proper environment for tax system existentialism, but also creates added value for the taxpayer. Deficiency of economic and accounting knowledge of the latter enables a legitimate overpay of the taxes payable for the state, though, not registering this fact with any economic operation. Reform of taxation for persons engaged in agricultural activities and real property trade, recently performed in Lithuania, conditions new scientific research in this area of tax system. Land site taxation, seems such a narrow profiled field of tax system, becomes more and more important tax within Lithuanian tax system. As the carried out statistical analysis of national budget administration data reveals, collection scope of taxes, where taxable object is real property, during the last decade is only increasing both in Lithuania and all EU countries. One of the most significant reasons determining such changes is micro economic condition of the country, however, state fiscal policy also plays quite a considerable role in this field. Lately, when budget becomes the basis for the stable state finance, debates, regarding both land site and other real property taxations are more frequent. Though, before initiating an exhaustive analysis of taxes, where a taxable object is the latter, it is important to emphasize that extremely wide range of application of taxation deductions exists in this field. Every municipality, in turn and on the budget account, may reduce the tax or even relief from the tax payable. As a performed empirical research shows, the latter taxation deductions, frequently applied in practice, do also increase demand for allocation while conditioning the lesser municipality budget income. Hereby, from the first sight, even pretty simple and insignificant taxes become more and more important, especially when national budget deficit and its control become the most important task both in the state and global financial market. Application of econometric models is being propagated for few decades now, however, in the field of the usage of taxing laws and regulations such models are not applied in worldwide practice. Adaptability of a graphic model is considered to be a real revolution in the field of tax system efficiency evaluation. A formed graphic model, in which taxable object is a land site, proves that even such a small taxable sector exhibits a lot of confusion, which can be exploited by the taxpayer to receive his fiscal benefit. Whereas the main purpose of laws, regulating the taxes, is calculation of the amounts payable and regulation of payment itself, construction of a graphic model allows us to evaluate not only budget and target funds fiscal income, but also influence of the latter on macro economic indicators of the country.","[Jakstonyte, Gintare; Boguslauskas, Vytautas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Jakstonyte, G (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania.",gintare.jakstonyte@ktu.lt; vytautas.boguslauskas@ktu.lt,,,,,,,18,5,5,2,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The DSS was designed to aid in decision making regarding ground and surface water resources, by two potentially conflicting stake holders in Konin county (Central Poland) that is, the County Administration and the open pit mine industry. Estimates of potential changes in groundwater head are achieved by numerical modelling of the groundwater system in which the open cast mines and receptors are located. The evaluation of spatially and time-distributed environmental risk is obtained by means of GIS supported Monte Carlo methodology. Calculations can be run in the DS WMVOC resulting maps of the risk to different receptor types, and maps of relative risk for different abstraction or dewatering scenarios, as well as an overall risk value for the region. Estimation of the magnitude of any adverse impact is related to the element (type of receptor) being impacted and a sensitivity rating has been devised for each receptor type. The risk estimation methodology implemented in the DS WMVOC was illustrated by analysis of two hypothetical groundwater management scenarios.","[Kochanek, Krzysztof] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geophys, PL-01452 Warsaw, Poland; [Tynan, Suzanne] Tynan Environm, Environm & Hydrogeol Consulting, Strandhill, Sligo, Ireland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Kochanek, K (通讯作者)，Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geophys, Ksiecia Janusza 64, PL-01452 Warsaw, Poland.",Kochanek@igf.edu.pl; stynan@tynanenvironmental.com,"Kochanek, Krzysztof/I-2824-2016",,,,,,23,6,6,0,16,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We use a representative panel data set of French establishments that contains direct measures of these various costs as well as measures of entries and exits for the years 1992 and 1996. First, we show that our panel data source is able to reproduce results obtained by Abowd and Kramarz (2003) when we use the cross-section dimension. our estimates show that collective terminations are much more expensive than individual terminations: legislation, namely the requirement to set up a social plan in case of collective terminations, magnifies firing costs. Collective terminations entail very large fixed costs. Termination costs are essentially linear in the number of terminated workers, with collective terminations being much more expensive. The costs of retirement are concave in the number of retired workers with a fixed cost component which is smaller than the one estimated for terminations, and quite smaller than that obtained by Abowd and Kramarz (2003). Finally, we find that hiring costs are small and seem only present when hiring on CDI; costs of hiring on short-term contracts are almost zero. Finally, the fixed (firm-specific) component of hiring costs is very small. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Individuals often do not realize that they communicate differently, have different understanding of the same subject, or hold differing beliefs about appropriate and inappropriate behavior, until they actually experience the impact of those differences to the final result. Cultural differences are named to be one of the biggest reasons why outsourcing deals are experiencing problems. Physical obstacles to successful outsourcing such as infrastructure and facilities have been mostly resolved, but the soft issues, cultural differences, will continue to be the main challenge. By its very definition, offshore outsourcing involves interplay of different companies, countries, regions etc. That evidences, that representatives of different nations will expect different results and will have different expectations from business relationships. Culture is difficult to assess, as it embraces so many aspects. Awareness of cultural differences in all the dimensions, mentioned in the paper, between outsourcing partners would be very helpful in reducing communication gaps and to understand the reasons of misunderstanding. Cultural compatibility in existing outsourcing country selection models is treated just as one of the multiple sub-criteria. Cultural differences are not marked as one of the Top features to be considered and therefore cause many outsourcing deals to fail, because they were not properly evaluated and addressed. There are certain cultural criteria, which are very important in selecting the site. The results of the empirical survey are presented in the article. Some authors assigned cultural differences only to company's culture differences and that is not exactly correct. There should be distinguished between Nations' cultural differences and companies cultural differences. In onshore outsourcing arrangements the key is companies cultural differences, while in nearshore and offshore outsourcing Nations cultural differences are far more important. Often cultural hurdles can be overcome, when approached with a non judgmental, open mind and with preparation in advance. The goal of both parties should be: making the most of both cultures to add value to outsourcing relationships much beyond cost reduction. Requirements for the nations around the globe to work so close, so dynamic and at such scale as today - have never been present before. We are at the stage of major cultural shift: not only embracing extreme diversity but also enabling this diversity to synchronize and deliver results effectively.","[Kvedaraviciene, Goda; Boguslauskas, Vytautas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Kvedaraviciene, G (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",goda.kvedaraviciene@gmail.com; vytautas.boguslauskas@ktu.lt,,,,,,,30,2,6,0,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Even when default is costless, some borrowers repay loans as a signal of low risk-type to insurers. There are multiple equilibria and equilibrium refinement techniques have no bite. The equilibrium amount of debt is indeterminate. For low credit scores, equilibrium involves randomization between default and repayment. This can explain the 'hockey-stick' shape of interest rates observed in several markets.

Only if the constraint is binding can fiscal policy increase the buyer's surplus; monetary, but not fiscal, policy affects the agents' bargaining position, leaving a special role for monetary policy. If the buyer's surplus share is inefficiently small, the intensive margin is distorted and the constrained optimal policy includes a money growth rate above that prescribed by the Friedman rule, even in the presence of fiscal policy instruments.

But there are known problems with only one criterion. In the continuous problems we speak about mathematical programming. A small group of single-criteria problems has however discrete feasibility set. There exist several methods for solving of these problems. This paper is focused on possible problems related with implementation of these methods in the computer support software. These problems relate firstly with construction of the utility function in the area of decision making under certainty. The second problem deals with definition of optimism coefficient (Hurwitz's index) in the area of decision making under uncertainty. The next problem focuses on data requirements for Bayesian analysis in the area of decision making under risk. In the real situations these problems are solved interactively but in the case of computer implementation is necessary to know at first how to solve these problems. This paper discusses mainly the problematic of utility function construction and related problems. Furthermore assumptions for utility functions are defined and the model example is examined and discussed. The results of this paper can be applied to any decision making software.,"[Smrcka, Pavel; Kalcevova, Jana] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Fac Informat & Stat, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,xsmrp01@vse.cz; kalcevov@isis.vse.cz,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,572,577,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900097,0

This is the reason why management of organizations should have MA system (MAS) effectively providing information for decision-making at the acceptable costs. Issue of the right MA tools setting and correct transformation of existing system into the optimal one is not new. Nevertheless, the biggest part of scientific works related to MA is concerned with separate tools of MA and are fragmented. The main aspect of the relevance of this issue is the question what features should have modern MA and how should the existing MA systems be changed into modern ones. The objective of this paper is to examine theoretical and practical assumptions for the development of MAS adjusted with the environment of an organization. According to the mentioned objectives theoretical and practical assumptions for the development of modern MAS adjusted with the environment of an organization and satisfying management needs of timely receiving the most relevant information with no surplus costs was examined in this paper. The analysis of scientific literature, the systemization of results of different researches related to MA, the studies of business companies, the conduction of financial and managerial analysis, the synthesis of management/MA theories, methods and practical cases were made in this research. The research disclosed that MA could be assessed company-wide, seeking to find an optimal configuration of the local management accounting system (Technical - Managerial View). Also different MA theories, MAS of different companies can be compared and the best choice or conclusions can be achieved based on systemization of theories and practices (Pragmatic Interpretive View). Besides that, relationship between MA and external environment in much wider context can be analyzed (Critical-Socio-Economic View). The performed analysis showed that MAS are strongly influenced by the internal, external environment and objectives of organization. Organizations differently pursue Return on Capital (ROE) maximization. Each type of organization has interim objectives helping them to cope with the obstacles of external/internal environment and to take advantage on possibilities. Companies performing in volatile environment use simpler MAS and vice versa, so different sets of MA tools should be applied to different types of organizations. This assumption is the key matter for the modern MA system creation. Basic principles of modern MAS development state that managers first of all should determine an organization type. Depending on that set of MA techniques adoptable to the particular organization should be determined and applied. Implementation of proposed MA tools demands to organize that on a project basis. Project team should be organized and an approval as well as the support of the top management is mandatory. Acceptance, support and involvement of all management and employees are necessary for a successful change of existing MAS. Constant monitoring of an organization type change, the assessing of MAS effectiveness and top management's support is necessary for a successful functioning of modern MAS.","[Strumickas, Marius; Valanciene, Loreta] Kauno Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Strumickas, M (通讯作者)，Kauno Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",mariusstrumickas@yahoo.com; loreta.valanciene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,41,3,4,1,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

A low level of technological development in industry and the potential of knowledge resources at regional agglomerations' disposal do not support innovation activity in enterprises, thus spatial proximity weakens rather than improves innovativeness. A dichotomy of phenomena is observed in this case, however. On the one hand, a low potential of knowledge combined with its limited quality (in terms of its up-to-dateness and applicability) is incapable of generating a critical mass of auto-dynamism of an innovation system. On the other hand, however, the rising costs of agglomeration discourage potential investors from locating their enterprises within the boundaries of the agglomeration, especially that the solutions applied may be considered high tech on the national scale whereas according to international methodological standards they may be perceived as medium high tech instead. In industrial systems at their early phases of development, high tech solutions are usually owned by a relatively small number of enterprises, usually foreign ones. This affects a slow and limited diffusion of knowledge in regions.

But why have ever more Russians been drinking themselves to death? Some attribute this to despair in the face of painful economic change. I present evidence that, in fact, the surge in alcohol-related deaths - and premature deaths in general - was fuelled by a dramatic fall in the real price of vodka, which dropped 77 percent between December 1990 and December 1994. Variation in vodka prices - both over time and across Russia's regions - closely matches variation in mortality. Although market competition and weak excise collection help explain the fall in prices, the main reason appears to be populist price regulation during inflationary periods.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Treisman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",Treisman@polisci.ucla.edu,,,,,,,78,42,44,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

To this end we use a mixture model of Gaussian, Gumbel and Gumbel survival copulas. Our results indicate that none of the pairs of stock markets exhibit a right-tail dependence structure. All valid models exhibit a mixture of Gaussian and left-tail dependence structure. Our findings imply that Gaussian dependence structure is dominant in most of the models. The emerging equity markets in the European region exhibit the most significant dependence structure with the world leaders. Furthermore, most of the emerging equity markets have a significant dependence structure with the US stock market. We further compare our findings with the results of the conventional correlation coefficients and conclude the importance of using copula models in analysing the portfolio diversification opportunities. Our findings overall indicate two important remarks: First, the copula models reveal better indicators for global investors to establish a diversified portfolio; Second, international equity markets exhibit significant dependence, which leaves a smaller opportunity to benefit from international portfolio diversification.","[Turgutlu, Evrim] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Business, TR-35160 Izmir, Turkey; [Ucer, Burcu] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Stat, Fac Arts & Sci, TR-35160 Izmir, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University; Dokuz Eylul University,"Turgutlu, E (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Business, TR-35160 Izmir, Turkey.",evrim.gursoy@deu.edu.tr,"Hudaverdi Ucer, Burcu/P-7919-2019","Hudaverdi Ucer, Burcu/0000-0002-6939-9668",,,,,31,14,18,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We also simulate equilibrium and motion of the global economy with three countries and Cobb-Douglas production functions. We demonstrate effects of changes in technology and inflation policy.

Using the index the emission performance of the world's 18 top CO2 emitters from 1997 to 2004 is studied. The results obtained show that the total factor carbon emission performance of the countries as a whole improved by 24% over the period and this was mainly driven by technological progress.

As the penetration of for-profit hospitals has gradually increased, there is a growing need for policy research to assess their impact oil medical spending from the patient perspective. Using panel data at the provincial level in China, this paper examines the impact of the penetration of for-profit hospitals on average medical expenditures for both outpatient and inpatient services in public general hospitals. Based on fixed-effect model estimates, the study shows that the penetration of for-profit hospitals has lowered the average medical expenditures for both inpatient and Outpatient services across regions, especially for pharmaceuticals. Together with other results, this study finds no evidence that private for-profit hospitals drive up average medical expenditures while serving their profit-maximization objectives. Rather, they help increase the market supply of health care, which in turn better serves the increasing demand. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This impact is captured by means of the price elasticity of poverty. The total effect of changes in price on poverty is explained in terms of two components, income and distribution effects. The income effect measures the change in poverty when all prices increase uniformly, whereas the distribution effect captures the change in poverty because of changes in relative prices. Using this decomposition, the paper derives an empirically operational index, which reveals whether the price changes have been pro-poor or anti-poor. The paper also derives a new price index for the poor. While this index can be computed for any poverty measures, our empirical analysis applied to Brazil is based on three poverty measures, the head-count ratio, the poverty gap ratio and the severity of poverty. The empirical analysis shows that price changes in Brazil during the 1999-2006 periods have been anti-poor. Nevertheless, during the last 2 to 3 years, the price changes have affected the poor less adversely than the non-poor.","[Son, Hyun H.] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyong City, Philippines; [Kakwani, Nanak] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia",Asian Development Bank; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Son, HH (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyong City, Philippines.",hhson@adb.org,"Kakwani, Nanak/Q-5581-2019",,,,,,21,10,11,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

In this respect, long-term increasing returns permit the inclusion of capability lifecycles in the analysis. Even more importantly they allow for interchanges between trends and cycles in capabilities and those in competencies. Competencies are defined here according to some 16 criteria that differentiate them from capabilities. Consideration of the rise of technological capabilities over periods of expansion in catching-up, countries suggests patterns of two-way leads and lags between competency acquisition and capability accumulation, in place of an either/or viewpoint. Implications include the limitations on human capital models of growth, which-in as much as these depict competency acquisition alone-undervalue the effort and commitment required via accompanying capability formation to bring about the desired growth outcomes. While both are required for sustained growth, the distinctions between the concepts highlight the interdependencies involved.","Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"von Tunzelmann, N (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England.",,,,,,,,81,10,10,0,21,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We first investigate to which extent a more flexible labor market would alter the business cycle behavior and the transmission of monetary policy. We find that while a lower degree of wage rigidity makes monetary policy more effective, i.e. a monetary policy shock transmits faster onto inflation, the importance of other labor market rigidities for the transmission of shocks is rather limited. Second, having estimated the model by Bayesian techniques we analyze to which extent labor market shocks, Such as disturbances in the vacancy posting process, shocks to the separation rate and variations in bargaining power are important determinants of business cycle fluctuations. Our results point primarily towards disturbances in the bargaining process as a significant contributor to inflation and Output fluctuations. In sum, the paper Supports current central bank practice which appears to put considerable effort into monitoring euro area wage dynamics and which appears to treat some of the other labor market information as less important for monetary policy.

We model a two-dimensional contest, where two unions, representing different sections of workers, jointly but non-cooperatively invest resources against employers in enforcing an exogenously given rent, while also contesting one another. The rent arises from a 'living' wage, set above reservation wage rates via labour regulations. We show that high reservation wage workers gain, and employers lose, from better social entitlements for low reservation wage workers. The latter however benefit, with employers and against the former, from weak labour regulations. When minority/immigrant workers are marginalized both in the labour market and in non-wage entitlements, improving job access and expanding 'social support' has contradictory effects on class and ethnic conflicts. 'Trade unionism', i.e. political articulation of shared economic interests alone, appears insufficient to temper ethnic conflicts among workers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our exploratory study examines how family ownership and management influence the performance and internalization of family businesses in transition economies and estimates their importance for these economies, based on the case of Slovenia as one of the most developed European transition countries. Our proposals and conclusions could be useful for policymakers and family business owners and managers in other transition countries.","[Duh, Mojca; Tominc, Polona] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ Anal, Maribor, Slovenia; [Rebernik, Miroslav] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Entrepreneurship & Business Econ, Maribor, Slovenia; [Rebernik, Miroslav] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Entrepreneurship & Small Business Management, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Duh, M (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ Anal, Maribor, Slovenia.",,"Duh, Mojca/A-5128-2013",,,,,,46,21,21,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

After deriving the feedback Nash equilibrium, we provide examples to consider how the difference in the number of firms or costs affects gainfulness of trade. We prove that feedback strategies can result in implications for trade gains which are sharply different from the open-loop case.","Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University,"Fujiwara, K (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Uegahara 1-1-155, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan.",kenjifujiwara@kwansei.ac.jp,,,,,,,8,4,4,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.
