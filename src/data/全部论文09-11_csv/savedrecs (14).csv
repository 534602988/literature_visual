The evolutionary trajectory of organizational competence conception, including its formation and management, follows the path from the static to the more dynamic; from the rationalistic to a more interpretative approach; from the functional to a more structural approach; from the technology-based to a more social-learning-based approach; from the isolated and fragmented to a systems approach; from a single to a multi-disciplinary approach. In today's market competitive advantage can be ensured only by particular mutually coordinated competences that correspond to organization strategy. This reference and recent organizational competence conception there competence is treated as newly created and developed rather than already existing resources (Hong, Stahle, 2005) are the base assumptions for analyzing the principles of organizational competence formation and management. Further on the new approach consideration was taken - from cross-cultural management perspective. The necessity of forming and effectively managing organizational competence in cross-cultural context is rapidly growing alongside the internationalization of business that becomes so complex and chaotic as well as changing management theories and practices. Cross-cultural setting is involved as directly influencing organizational competence and its competitiveness. This new theoretical approach to the formation and management of organizational competence based on cross - cultural perspective is a multidimensional synthesis of recent advances and insights into new integrated theory in the area of international management that give rise to five aspects treated as principles that should be evaluated while forming organizational competence in cross-cultural context. These principles are explained, systematized and presented as a model in this paper.","[Kersiene, Kristina; Savaneviciene, Asta] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Kersiene, K (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",kristina.kersiene@stud.ktu.lt; asta.savaneviciene@ktu.lt,"Savanevičienė, Asta/I-8581-2019","Savanevičienė, Asta/0000-0003-3132-860X",,,,,73,9,15,1,25,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

(1999) (BGG), in order 1) to evaluate the mean features of the BCC and 2) to assess the benefits of a countercyclical prudential measure. In a costly state verification framework, banks are charged a financing premium on their external funds which depends on the structure of their balance sheets and which then fluctuates in a counter-cyclical way. This premium is lastly passed on to firms' credit conditions. Simulations confirm that shocks are more amplified than in the BGG model, and confirm the importance of the financial context for macroeconomic volatility. Given the effects of this channel and the ineffectiveness of monetary policy in a capital crunch context, the model finally allows a conclusive evaluation of the advantages associated with a preemptive and counter-cyclical prudential measure in a DSGE model to be made.","CNRS, UMR 6221, Lab Econ Orleans, Orleans 2, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Levieuge, G (通讯作者)，CNRS, UMR 6221, Lab Econ Orleans, Rue Blois,BP 6739, Orleans 2, France.",gregory.levieuge@univ-orleans.fr,,"Levieuge, Gregory/0000-0003-2152-0737",,,,,43,4,4,0,3,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

The authors emphasize significant differences between the two systems of corporate governance, which should be critical for the owners when the decision about the appropriate system is about to be made. The introduction of one-tier system into the croatian law, as a result of harmonisation with the EU law, makes it possible for croatian joint stock companies to change the existing two-tier system into a new one-tier system. The theory of corporate governance stands in line with the main hypothesis of this paper - each corporate governance system is immanent to the specific legal environment, continental and anglosaxon. In order to prove their opinions regarding new practice in Croatia, the authors analize, in the second part of the paper, reasons for and model of changed corporate governance system in a croatin stock company.

The analisied company showed the expected reasons for change - the change is a choice made by owners who are more familiar with one-tier system. In line with the theory and expectations regarding introduction of one-tier system in croatian stock companies, a following conclusion is made - the change to one-tier system will lake place only in few companies and mostly because of the owner's link-age with one-tier system.","[Maurovic, Ljiljana; Gonan Bozac, Marli; Grgorinic, Sabina] Sveuciliste Jurja Dobrile Puli, Odjel Ekon & Turizam, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Maurovic, L (通讯作者)，Sveuciliste Jurja Dobrile Puli, Odjel Ekon & Turizam, Pula, Croatia.",ljmaurov@efpu.hr; mbozac@efpu.hr; sgrgor@efpu.hr,"Gonan Božac, Marli/E-9900-2019","Gonan Božac, Marli/0000-0002-1554-4540",,,,,8,2,2,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We find that for 14 out of 15 OECD countries, there is evidence of a cointegration relationship between nominal exchange rate and relative prices at the 5% level.

This is done using data from the 1993 and 1998 Vietnam Living Standards Surveys and a flexible decomposition technique based on quantile regression that explains change throughout the complete distribution of child height. One-half of the decrease in the proportion of children stunted is explained by changes in the distributions of covariates and 35% is explained by change in the distribution of income.

This tendency is intensified when the elasticity of a child's income to parent's educational investment is higher. In this setup, it is shown that progressive income tax can be a welfare-enhancing tool by increasing social mobility.

However, time series studies are useful for country-specific policies. But in many recent works ad hoc specifications have been used to analyse the contribution of various factors to growth. This article uses an improved specification to estimate the effects of openness on growth in a small open economy namely Fiji. In addition to trade openness, we include, as additional variables, the basic conditioning variables namely factor inputs into our specification. The need for the inclusion of some basic conditioning variables has been emphasized by Boswoth and Collins (2003) in their cross country studies. Our results show that trade openness and output are cointegrated. Neglecting the conditioning variables seems to lead to some overestimation of the effects of openness and at times a cointegrating vector may not exist.","[Rao, B.

It arises from what humans learn about life, death, incapacitation, suffering, health, and success and from the realization that they need to know more about the quality of life to make decisions. And although during the decision-making process they may be prompted by instinctive impulses, in the main, quality of life decisions are arrived at through deliberating alternatives, predicting the consequences of following. Happiness, life satisfaction and subjective well-being are mutually interrelated - and indeed they are all closely connected with the notion of quality of life - but they are also highly contested constructs. 'Happiness' is perhaps the most contested,- indeed, the disagreement about happiness is at an absolutely basic level. One of the leading figures in the study of quality of life and a Nobel Laureate, Daniel Kahneman does not trust people's own statements and beliefs on this topic. Indeed, he goes further than this and claims: 'they do not generally know how happy they are, and they must construct an answer to that question whenever it is raised' (Kahneman, 1999). He claims that the starting point should not be people's subjective views about how happy they are but instead objective measures of those sensations that are associated with the real-time feeling of happiness - in other words, objective happiness. Perhaps the greatest strength of any approach to subjective well-being is that it pays serious attention to people's happiness and life satisfaction. Happiness may not be enough as a measure of quality of life as can be seen from the case of the 'happy poor'. But even though it cannot be a sufficient criterion of quality of life, any measure of quality of life that took no account at all of whether a person was miserable or dissatisfied would surely be lacking an important dimension. It is clear, though, that there is more to quality of life than just subjective attributes such as happiness or satisfaction. There are objective qualities too, and some of these, such as sufficient nutrition, a non-hazardous environment, and a long and healthy life are universally, or virtually universally uncontroversial as components of quality of life.","[Susniene, Dalia; Jurkauskas, Algirdas] Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, LT-35209 Panevezys, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Susniene, D (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Klaipedos Str 1, LT-35209 Panevezys, Lithuania.",dalia.susniene@ktu.lt; g_sargunas@panko.lt,"Susniene, Dalia/A-1626-2016","Susniene, Dalia/0000-0003-1639-7180",,,,,39,15,26,1,15,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

There is a strong connection between investments, economic growth and welfare, but the development of new production facilities determines not only evolution and welfare, but also damages the environment, and the grievance of a sustainable development becomes less irrefutable. The negative effects of economic activities are not measured and assesed on the market, being called externalities and taking the form of pollution. Pollution is found both as a phisical effect on the environment generated by discharging waste and as human reaction to this effect.

Cost benefit analysis approach is a useful tool for investment decision-making from an economic perspective. Cautions should also be given to the methods of determining the value of social and local interests, Some social externalities, such as employment and regional economic impacts, are generally omitted in current practices. Current practices tend to use cardinal or ordinal scales in measure in non-monetized criteria. The use of unreasonable monetization methods in some cases has discredited cost benefit analysis in the eyes of decision makers and the public. It may be appropriate to consider these externalities in qualitative forms in a multi-criteria analysis. Multi-criteria decision making is used in various areas of human activities. The Criteria can be qualitative and quantitative. They usually have different units of measurement and differ in optimization direction. The normalization aims at obtaining comparable scales of criteria values. In the new version of the program LEVI 4 the normalization methods are including vector, linear scale, non-linear and new logarithmic techniques may be used This software considers the main aspects of two-sided game problems, The following strategic principles are used: Wald's rule, Savage criterion, Hurwicz's rule, Laplace's rule, Bayes's rule and Hodges-Lehmann rule.

It is noticed that the employee identification in an organization is a complex process. To identify yourself in an organization means to be actively involved into the processes which include specific activity areas and behaviour, determined by the interaction of the organizational environment and employee adaptive behaviour. Employee social identification in an organization actualizes one of the socium expression aspects in the labour environment. When employee social identification is unsatisfactory and inadequate, the possibility for crisis situation grows up and it needs to be controlled operatively to avoid the crisis. These actions enable to moderate crisis development in an organization and to control its consequences. The discussed problems have become the aspect of the research analysis. The scientists analyse the coordination positions of the organization and employee interests in the transformable business environment (Davidaviciene, 2008), as well as the changes of business and management in the informative century (Sakalas, Ciutiene, Neverauskas, 2006), survey the influence of employee interests in the contemporary career formation (Savaneviciene, Stukaite, Silingiene, 2008), they also notice that it is very important to develop individual strategic competencies in an organization (Melnikas, 2005), point out the main principles of managers' training and apply practical experiments (Kumpikaite, 2007), survey the economic costs of personnel training in Lithuanian organizations (Saee, 2005), emphasize the efficient leadership in the global economics. The authors claim that the main attention should be paid to the individual, improving his professional skills, developing his competencies, that help him successfully identify in an organization and enables to integrate in the labour activities in the nearest future. This is the essential principle of crisis situation management and decision making. The principle requires to evaluate the processes of employee socialization, individualization and adaptation as well as to form the expression of employee identification in an organization. Recent scientific literature deals mainly with the problems of crisis in a company in the economic aspects. Altman (1968;1971;1983), Alesina (1997), Ansoff (1987), Darling (1998), Fink (1986), Kash (1998), Cumikov (1998), Roselieb (1999), Hauschildt (2000), Bard (2000), Sarafanova (2001), Petuhov (2007) and other scientists deals with the analysis of crisis in a company. Lithuanian authors Januleviciute (2003), Bieleviciene (2003), Dambrava (2003), Sakalas, Savaneviciene (2003), Valackiene (2005), Virbickaite (2006); Garskaite, Garskiene (2005), Berzinskiene (2006; 2007), Virbickaite (2006; 2007), Stoskus (2007), Stundziene (2006), Boguslauskas (2006), Neverauskas (2008), Staskeviciute (2008), Valackiene (2009) and others write about the structure of crisis situation, pointing out the reasons of the economic expression, describe the methodology of crisis diagnosis and possible decisions. The social aspect of this phenomenon is less presented. If the crisis is analyzed as the social phenomenon, then crisis reasons are hardly estimated and defined. It is not easy to explain the employee identification in an organization as well as to form conceptual expressions to estimate identification positions in crisis situations. The same situation is with crisis situation management (socio-economic aspect). Analyzing the mentioned phenomena - the employee social identification and crisis management - the methodological difficulties appear: the design of research instrument, analysis presentation. Every manager should know the weakest areas in personnel management and have the prepared identification strategy, which will relieve the adaptation of a new member in an organization, its aims and value process and influence on the performance efficiency and satisfaction of the work seeking to control a crisis situation. Difficult business environment stimulates to look for new ways to assess the changing situation as well as to implement and manage new means for business continuity. The structure of the paper: in the first part of the paper the strategic dimensions of employee identification in an organization have theoretically been based; in the second part the results of the combinative research have been presented applying two research methods: questionnaire, which helps to define dimension expression of employee identification in an organization (questionnaire was given to the employees of Panevezys clinics) and structural interview, which helps to present the trends of crisis situation management in organizations (the interviewed organizations: Panevezys clinics, UAB Odenta, UAB Dentavita and co, and UAB Panevezys odontologai executives); the third part of the paper presents the theoretical model of social identification managing crisis situations in an organization. The theoretical model of social identification of managing crisis situation in an organization was justified, which requires designing the programs of crisis situation prevention in every dimension of employee identification in an organization considering the priority of the employees. In this model crisis situation management is described as the closed cycle involving these stages: the design of crisis situation management programs; the identification of crisis nature; the operative means in crisis situation and its liquidation in rehabilitating organizational performance.","Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Valackiene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Nemuno Str 33, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania.",asta.valackiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,35,13,13,0,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

None of the conceptual approaches dominate. Some of them, such as contingency, agents, contract theories are popular among management accounting researchers, others are quite new at least in the sense of application in performance measurement studies, namely, complexity and open systems theory. Analysis of performance measurement from different theoretical points of view leads to the formulation of framework with featured theoretical dimensions. Elements of performance measurement systems interpreting it as an open system are presented in this study. Two pure theoretical situations of performance measurement system are determined. Performance measurement could be objectively based on hard measures and their interpretation (explicit knowledge) or subjectively based on experience, analytical abilities and intuition (tacit knowledge). Both of them could be disclosed in each organization but in different levels. Those aspects could be analyzed according to the featured elements of open system (input, process and output) and forms of perfection level of a particular organization. Dimensions of theoretical framework as well as elements of open system could be the basis constructing instruments of empirical performance measurement researches. This paper aims to disclose how changes of organizational environment are reflected in performance measurement system. Experience in this field is unique in each organization. In most cases quantitative research methods have some limitations to disclose and to generalize this experience. Changes of case study organization's performance system's content were analyzed during three periods. Performance systems content were disclosed using research framework based on open systems dimensions. Organizational values were chosen as a measure of organizational environment. Some implications to economic conditions as shaping factors for organizational environment were made. The main results are findings that economic conditions could be enabling factor for the unique configuration of objective and subjective features of open performance measurement system in each organization. This impact could be analyzed indirectly through organizational values and reflection of them in performance measurement system's perfection level. Interpretations of those results do not lead to generalized conclusions but shed more light on the phenomena of performance measurement system and defines the way it could be diagnosed, interpreted and improved.","[Valanciene, Loreta; Gimzauskiene, Edita] Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Valanciene, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",loreta.valanciene@ktu.lt; edita.gimzauskine@ktu.lt,,,,,,,31,13,14,0,12,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In many respects, the temptation to inflate away some of this debt burden is similar to that at the end of World War II. In 1946, the debt ratio was 108.6%. Inflation reduced this ratio by more than a third within a decade. Yet there are some important differences - shorter debt maturities today reduce the temptation to inflate, while the larger share of debt held by foreigners increases it. This paper lays out an analytical framework for determining the impact of a large nominal debt overhang on the temptation to inflate. It suggests that when economic growth is stalled, the US debt overhang may induce an increase in inflation of about 5% for several years that could significantly reduce the debt ratio.

Many studies have shown that tax cheating has to be attributed to a considerable extent to the tax morale of taxpayers. The aim of the present paper is to shed light on the relationship between the taxpayer and the public sector; specifically, we investigate whether public spending inefficiency shapes individual tax morale. Combining data from Italian municipalities' balance sheets with individual data from a properly designed survey on tax morale, we find that the attitude towards paying taxes is better when resources are spent more efficiently. This evidence seems not to be driven by some confounding factor at the municipality level or by spatial sorting of citizens and proves robust to accounting for alternative measures of both inefficiency and tax morale. We also find that the negative effect of inefficiency is larger if the level of public spending is lower and/or the degree of fiscal autonomy is higher.","[Barone, Guglielmo; Mocetti, Sauro] Bank Italy, Bologna Branch, Econ Res Unit, Bologna, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Barone, G (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Bologna Branch, Econ Res Unit, Bologna, Italy.",guglielmo.barone@bancaditalia.it; sauro.mocetti@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,35,93,100,3,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to analyse the difference between various systems of holding securities and second (section I and 2), to assess the Croatian securities holding system (section 3). Our attention is especially focused on Croatian legislation governing securities, with emphasis on the national Central Clearing and Depository Agency.

The land certification program is designed to enhance land tenure security of farmers, by maintaining (egalitarian) status quo land distribution and equity concerns. The major contribution of the analysis lies in the exogenous nature of the program which addresses the endogeneity problems that characterize related studies, assessing the impact of policy related variables on trust. The effects of the land certification program on trust are identified both by the difference-in-difference approach and by non-parametrical analysis of average treatment effects. Overall trust is found to be enhanced by the certification program, with trust towards formal institutions being more responsive to the program than interpersonal trust. The major policy implication of the result is that trust could be invested on through policy changes regarding the economic betterment of societies.

Nonlinear SUR estimates from Generalized Leontief (GL) specifications reveal elasticities of substitution from 0.02 to 0.07, confirming that industrial customers (connected to the transmission grid) shift consumption across peak and off-peak periods in order to reap benefits of lower prices. Estimates from FGLS and IV models suggest that this reduction in demand by industrial customers results in lower wholesale prices, which benefits all consumers.

The adult thus faces a tradeoff; on the one hand, household income rises if she sends her child to work. On the other hand, the adult suffers disutility from violating the social harm in so doing. We also suppose that the extent of disutility falls as more other adults have their children work. We then explore how the total amount of child labor in an economy changes as adults' labor efficiencies rise or become more unequal. Our analysis reveals that a more equal distribution or rises in adults' labor efficiency help decrease child labor only under certain conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

On the financial theory of the firm, the responsibility for upholding ethical standards, forcing the internalization of costs, and so on, belong ultimately to government, not to corporate managers. The main argument for this position is that corporate managers have neither the right nor the ability to pursue multiple, nonfinancial goals. By contrast, stakeholder theory contends that the list of corporate constituencies includes all those who have a legitimate interest in the activities of a firm, regardless of any interest that the firm takes in them. Furthermore, the interests of these stakeholder groups merit consideration for their own sake, not because of their usefulness to the,firm. Stakeholder theory has not been developed as a full-fledged alternative to the financial theory, and it is questionable whether it is necessarily incompatible with it. SWM is justified on the financial theory for its benefits to the whole of society, which includes all stakeholder groups. Corporate managers need not consider the interests of all stakeholders as long as these interests are adequately protected by some means, such as government regulation. In addition, managing a corporation with attention to stakeholder interests may be an effective means for maximizing shareholder value.

These problems raise valid concerns about the policy relevance of the evidence arising from the studies. A more reliable approach to study the link between institutions and development and overcome the inherent problems of cross-country empirical analysis is to direct focus to microeconomic analysis of institutions.

In a theoretical model we formalize the tradeoff between increased productivity from high priority communication and reduced productivity due to distractions caused by low priority e-mails. We consider employees with present-biased preferences as well as time consistent employees. All present-biased employees ex-ante are motivated to read only important e-mail, but in the interim some agents find the temptation to read all e-mail in their inbox too high, and as a result suffer from productivity losses. A unique aspect of this paper is the social nature of procrastination, which is a key to the e-mail overload phenomenon. In considering the firm's policies to reduce the impact of e-mail overload we conclude that a firm is more likely to restrict e-mail in the case of employees with hyperbolic preferences than in the case of time-consistent employees.

These methods do not require any estimation of earnings equations and hence no validity-out-of-the-support assumptions; furthermore, this approach allows us to estimate not only the average wage gap but also its distribution. Our main findings indicate that the average public sector worker earns more than his/her private counterpart, and that this differential increased over the 1992-2007 period. Important differences along the wage distribution are also shown in the results; in fact, public servants in the highest percentiles of the wage distribution generally earn less than their private sector equivalents. Nonetheless, the percentile at which a positive wage gap becomes a wage penalty shifted over the period as the average wage gap experienced by most countries widened. Still, the most qualified public sector workers do face a wage penalty. Furthermore, indicators of government effectiveness show no relationship with the country ranking according to the public-private wage gap. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We find that, when the economy faces external shocks, if monetary policy can stabilize the real economy, then sectoral labor market adjustment cost will lead to welfare loss. However, if monetary policy such as fixed exchange rates cannot stabilize real variables, then some degree of labor market friction will improve welfare instead and the gain will be significant. As a result, the welfare gap between flexible exchange rates and fixed exchange rates decreases with sectoral labor market friction. This is because the friction can offset some of the nominal rigidity and become a substitute for monetary policy to stabilize the real economy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Some have suggested a theoretical synthesis based on these commonalities. In spite of these theoretical and conceptual commonalities each tradition has developed significantly different methods of analysis. Instead of theoretical or conceptual synthesis we seek here to present a methodological synthesis. Institutionalist methods have yielded plausible explanations, but these have been too vague and suggestive to be consistently used for economic policy. Post-Keynesian methods have policy necessary rigor, but the similarity to neoclassical methods has exposed post-Keynesian theories to unwarranted synthesis with incompatible traditions. This essay presents a synthesis of post-Keynesian and institutionalist methodology, one of plausible rigor, combining elements of institutional dynamics with a heuristic framework based on John Dewey's instrumental logic, and proposes that the resulting approach overcomes weaknesses in the methods of analysis of both schools.","Univ Missouri, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Tauheed, LF (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",,,,,,,,57,9,12,0,15,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The most remarkable property of the Bonferroni index is that it overweights income transfers among the poor, and the weights are higher the lower the transfers occur on the income distribution. Hence, it is a good measure of inequality when changes in the living standards of the poor are concerned. There are many problemsespecially in labor economicsthat fall into this category. Using a version of the assignment model, we show that the Bonferroni index can be formulated endogenously within a mechanism featuring efficient assignment of workers to firms. This formulation is useful in evaluating the interactions between the distribution of skills and earnings inequality with a special emphasis on the lower tail of the earnings distribution. Moreover, it allows us to think about earnings inequality by separately analyzing the contribution of each economic parameter.","[Tumen, Semih] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Head Off, TR-06100 Ulus Ankara, Turkey; [Tumen, Semih] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Tumen, S (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Head Off, Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06100 Ulus Ankara, Turkey.",semih.tumen@tcmb.gov.tr,"Tumen, Semih/S-3412-2019","Tumen, Semih/0000-0002-8841-2290",,,,,45,1,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We define the Standard of Perfect Banking Integration (SPBI), which characterizes the scenario attainable when bank flows are not geographically biased, and cross-border asset trade is not affected by home bias. We assess the gap between a hypothetical scenario of geographic neutrality and the current level of banking integration, along with both of its components. The empirical application to the banking systems of 23 countries over the 2003-2009 period enables us to conclude that the level of banking integration has advanced rapidly over the last few years and, according to our indicators, is close to 45% as of 2009, i.e.. we are not halfway to the SPBI. However, notable differences among countries are both persistent and growing, and the integration level achieved for each banking system differs when either assessed from the bank inflows or outflows perspective.

I use this population shock and a series of topographic barriers that resulted in variation in refugee intensity to investigate the short- and long-run causal effects of hosting refugees on outcomes of local children. This strategy provides evidence of adverse impacts over one year after the shock: a worsening of children's anthropometrics (0.3 standard deviations), an increase in the incidence of infectious diseases (15-20 percentage points) and an increase in mortality for children under five (7 percentage points). I also find that intra- and inter-cohort variation in childhood exposure to the refugee crisis reduced height in early adulthood by 1.8 cm (1.2%), schooling by 0.2 years (7.1%) and literacy by 7 percentage points (8.6%). Designs using the distance to the border with Rwanda as an alternative identification strategy for refugee intensity support the findings. The estimates are robust across different samples, specifications and estimation methods and provide evidence of a previously undocumented indirect effect of civil wars on the well-being of children and subsequent economic growth in refugee-hosting communities.

In our model, carriers supply transport services for shipping manufactured goods, and freight rates are set to clear transport markets. Each carrier must commit to the maximum capacity for a round-trip and thus faces a logistics problem as there are opportunity costs of returning empty. These costs increase the freight rates charged to firms located in regions that are net exporters of manufactured goods. Since demand for transport services depends on the spatial distribution of economic activity, the concentration of production in one region raises freight rates to serve foreign markets from there, thus working against specialization and the agglomeration of firms.

First, we show that a necessary condition for recurrent implementation in better-response dynamics (BRD) is a small variation of Maskin monotonicity, which we call quasimonotonicity. We also provide a mechanism for implementation in BRD if the rule is quasimonotonic and excludes worst alternatives - no worst alternative (NWA). Quasimonotonicity and NWA are both necessary and sufficient for absorbing implementation in BRD. Moreover, they characterize implementation in strict Nash equilibria. Under incomplete information, incentive compatibility is necessary for any kind of stable implementation in our sense, while Bayesian quasimonotonicity is necessary for recurrent implementation in interim BRD. Both conditions are also essentially sufficient for recurrent implementation, together with a Bayesian NWA. A characterization of implementation in strict Bayesian equilibria is also provided. Partial implementation results are also obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This paper takes an empirical perspective and focuses on poverty, as opposed to growth alone. The contribution of a sector to poverty reduction is shown to depend on its own growth performance, its indirect impact on growth in other sectors, the extent to which poor people participate in the sector, and the size of the sector in the overall economy. Bringing together these different effects using cross-country econometric evidence indicates that agriculture is significantly more effective in reducing poverty among the poorest of the poor (as reflected in the $1-day squared poverty gap). It is also up to 3.2 times better at reducing $1-day headcount poverty in low-income and resource rich countries (including those in Sub-Saharan Africa), at least when societies are not fundamentally unequal. However, when it comes to the better off poor (reflected in the $2-day measure), non-agriculture has the edge. These results are driven by the much larger participation of poorer households in growth from agriculture and the lower poverty reducing effect of non-agriculture in the presence of extractive industries.

The analysis includes product differentiation and asymmetric costs. We show that with the cost asymmetry the countries will disagree on the choice of tariff regime. When the choice of import tariffs and export subsidies is made sequentially the uniform tariff regime may not be sustainable, because of an incentive to deviate to a discriminatory regime.

Several countries introduced STW from scratch or significantly expanded the scope of the programmes already in place. In some countries like Italy, Japan and Germany between 2.5% and 5% of the workforce participated in STW schemes at the trough of the recession. In this paper we analyse the rationale for STW benefits and their effects on labour adjustment from both a cross-country and a time-series perspective. We find that STW actually contributed to reduce job losses during the Great Recession. However, the number of jobs saved, according to our macroeconomic and microeconomic estimates, is smaller than the number of participants in these schemes and the full-time equivalent jobs involved, pointing in some countries to sizeable deadweight costs. Other institutions, like plant-level bargaining over hours, wages and employment levels, may be more effective than STW in encouraging adjustment along the intensive margins in the presence of temporary shocks. Our results also suggest that STW cannot be readily extended to countries having much different institutional configurations as the demand for STW is very much affected by other institutions such as employment protection legislation and the degree of centralization of collective bargaining. Furthermore, STW must be temporary as during upturns may actually negatively affect employment. We also find that specific design features of STW - such as experience-rating and disincentives to 100% reductions in working hours - are important in improving the cyclical properties of STW.","[Boeri, Tito] Univ Bocconi, Fdn Rodolfo Debenetti, Mainz, Germany; Univ Bamberg, Inst Employment Res IAB, Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Boeri, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Fdn Rodolfo Debenetti, Mainz, Germany.",,,,,,,,37,67,71,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

We do this by modelling multiple, co-existing, non-identical general purpose technologies (GPTs). Three sectors producing pure and applied research and consumption goods, employ different, evolving, technologies. Agents within each sector operate under conditions of Knightian uncertainty and path dependence, employing technologies that differ in specific parameter values. This behaviour produces a non-stationary (non-ergodic) growth process. Important characteristics of structured technology, previously only described historically, are successfully modelled, including co-existing GPTs some of which compete with each other while others complement each other in varying degrees. Because changes in technology are partial causes of, but not contemporaneous with, GDP changes, their separate evolutions can be studied.","[Carlaw, Kenneth I.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Lipsey, Richard G.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; Simon Fraser University,"Carlaw, KI (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Kelowna, BC, Canada.",kenneth.carlaw@ubc.ca; rlipsey@sfu.ca,,,,,,,39,14,15,2,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This paper contributes by considering this issue with heterogeneous firms and endogenous entry. This yields two results. First, a cut in the tariff reduces the size of the informal sector. Second, the imposition of VAT need not increase the size of the informal sector. Turning to simulation results, we find that switching from a tariff to a revenue-neutral VAT increases welfare, in part because of the selection effect generated by heterogeneous firms.","[Davies, Ronald B.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Paz, Lourenco S.] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY USA",University College Dublin; Syracuse University,"Davies, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Newman Bldg,Room G215, Dublin 4, Ireland.",ronbdavies@gmail.com,"Davies, Ronald/AAT-4531-2021","Paz, Lourenco/0000-0001-8953-6087; Davies, Ron/0000-0002-9738-9256",,,,,26,12,12,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The main purpose of this paper is to identify empirically the effects of household characteristics and of inequality at the village level on natural resource extraction and dependence. We use data from the Mexico National Rural Household Survey (ENHRUM). Our results show that in rural Mexico natural resource extraction is predominantly an activity carried out by poor households. The same is true for dependence. There are important differences across Mexico in terms of both participation and dependence on resource income. These differences are most evident when one compares the south and north of the country. When relatively rich households participate in resource extraction their natural resource income is considerably higher than that of the poor.","[Yunez-Naude, Antonio] El Colegio Mexico, Ctr Econ Studies, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,,alejandro.lopez@cide.edu; taylor@primal.ucdavis.edu; ayunez@colmex.mx,"Lopez-Feldman, Alejandro/AAI-2918-2020","Lopez-Feldman, Alejandro/0000-0002-9194-2612",,,,,20,4,4,0,11,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

This paper analyzes information transmission in asset markets when agents' information is ambiguous. We consider a market with risk-averse informed investors, risk-neutral competitive arbitrageurs, and noisy supply of the risky asset, first studied by Vives (Rev Financ Stud 8:3-40, 1995a, J Econ Theory 67:178-204, 1995b) with unambiguous information. Ambiguous information gives rise to the possibility of illiquid market where arbitrageurs choose not to trade in a rational expectations equilibrium.

In order to achieve this purpose, the authors provide a potential definition of globalization which arises not from empirical evidences but from the analysis of the links existing between Adam Smith's thought and Amartya Sen's one. Globalization is here considered first as a global division of labour, second as a global market where the products generated by the division of labour are exchanged, and third as a complex socio-economic phenomenon which generates positive outcomes under two conditions: on one hand, every agent has to respect the rules coming from a common ethic, and, on the other hand, countries and International Organizations have to guarantee that every agent respects national and international laws.

Immigrants, being new to the labor market, may be less aware of employment protection regulations and less likely to claim their rights, which may create a gap between the costs for employers of hiring a native relative to hiring an immigrant. This paper tests that hypothesis drawing on evidence for the EU and on two natural experiments for Spain and Italy. The results suggest that strict employment protection legislation (EPL) gives immigrants a comparative advantage relative to natives. Stricter EPL is found to reduce employment and reduce hiring and firing rates for natives. By contrast, stricter EPL has a much smaller effect on immigrants. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We show that it is optimal to impose ceilings on foreign ownership of domestic firms when the government's objective is to maximise domestic shareholder profits, or a sum of those profits and tax revenues. While the optimal ceiling is high enough for the multinational enterprise (MNE) to gain control of the domestic firm, it nevertheless influences the price that the MNE must pay for the domestic firm's shares to the advantage of the domestic shareholders.

It collects and analyzes survey data from 473 households in Yunnan, China in 2004. In particular, it investigates the effects of government efforts to promote improved upland rice technologies. Our analysis shows that farmers who adopted these technologies had incomes approximately 15% higher than non-adopters. Despite this relatively large increase, we estimate that the impact on income inequality was relatively slight. This is primarily due to the fact that lower-income farmers adopted the improved rice technology at rates that were roughly equivalent to those of higher-income farmers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Our objective is to characterize the behavior of market participants and, in particular, that of buyers in such a market structure. Our analysis shows that buyer-seller relationships are less important than in a pairwise bargaining market such as the Marseille Fish market but that a significant amount of loyalty is still present under the auction mechanism. We provide an explanation of the declining price paradox for the fish market of Ancona by linking the rule used by the buyers to set their bid to the relationship between the variation in the price of the last transactions in the day and the quantity of fish available on that day. In fact, the average price tends to increase for the last transactions on days characterized by a limited supply of fish. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using new data that sample entrepreneurs just before they start their businesses, we show that few small businesses intend to bring a new idea to market or to enter an unserved market. Instead, most intend to provide an existing service to an existing market. Further, we find that most small businesses have little desire to grow big or to innovate in any observable way. We show that such behavior is consistent with the industry characteristics of the majority of small businesses, which are concentrated among skilled craftspeople, lawyers, real estate agents, health care providers, small shopkeepers, and restaurateurs. Lastly, we show that nonpecuniary benefits (being one's own boss, having flexibility of hours, and the like) play a first-order role in the business formation decision. Our findings suggest that the importance of entrepreneurial talent, entrepreneurial luck, and financial frictions in explaining the firm size distribution may be overstated. We conclude by discussing the potential policy implications of our findings.","[Hurst, Erik; Pugsley, Benjamin Wild] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Hurst, E (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,"Hurst, Erik/W-4996-2019","Pugsley, Benjamin/0000-0001-6371-0235",,,,,63,220,286,4,46,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

We address these questions by estimating the multinomial probit model using survey data for households surrounding Chimaliro and Liwonde forest reserves in Malawi. After controlling for heterogeneity among households, we find strong substitution opportunities across fuelwood collection sources. Attributes of the fuelwood sources (size and species composition) and distance to the sources are the most important determinants of fuelwood choice. Further results show that customary managed forests generate environmental benefits by reducing pressure on both plantation forests and forest reserves. These findings support the need to strengthen community-based institutions to manage local forest resources. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Jumbe, Charles B.

This debate has seriously questioned the desirability of limiting scarcity prices in markets with fluctuating demand by emphasizing their potentially negative impact on firms' investment decisions in the long run. A prominent example are recently liberalized electricity markets, where competition authorities have imposed price caps(3) or adopted other measures to mitigate high scarcity prices. The impact of reduced scarcity prices in the long run still is only incompletely explored. We thus analyze investment of firms in base load and peak load technologies in a market with fluctuating demand under imperfect competition. We show that an appropriately chosen limitation of scarcity prices is not only beneficial in the short run but also in the long run. It leads to a strict increase of investment in peak load technologies, leaving investment in base load technologies unchanged. Furthermore, we characterize the optimal limit on scarcity prices.

The FTA with the EU was simulated to bring about little influence on the quantity of domestic pork with a relatively big impact on the domestic pork price. After the elimination of the tariff on EU and US pork, the mean of the fall in the quantity of domestic pork was simulated to be 2.51 percent with a standard deviation of 0.6 percent, and the mean of the decrease in the producer price of pork was simulated to be 9.42 percent on average with a standard deviation of 2.18 percent.

Several different empirical tests consistently point to the existence of a systematic branch-specific component to employee attitudes. Branch effects can also explain why a significant positive cross-sectional correlation between branch-level employee attitudes and branch sales performance is not observed in longitudinal fixed-effects sales models. The results of our empirical tests concerning the determinants of employee attitudes and the determinants of branch sales are consistent with an interpretation that workplace-specific factors lead to better outcomes for both employees and the bank, and that these factors are more likely to be some aspect of the branches' internal operations rather than some characteristic of the external market of the branch.

Medicaid, which provides means-tested public assistance and pays for almost half of long-term care costs, spends more than $100 billion annually on long-term care. In this paper, I exploit variation in the adoption and generosity of state tax subsidies for private long-term care insurance to determine whether tax subsidies increase private coverage and reduce Medicaid's costs for long-term care. The results indicate that the average tax subsidy raises coverage rates by 2.7 percentage points, or 28%. However, the response is concentrated among high income and asset-rich individuals, populations with low probabilities of relying on Medicaid. Simulations suggest each dollar of state tax expenditure produces approximately $0.84 in Medicaid savings, over half of which funnels to the federal government. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Guest, R",,,,"Guest, Ross",,,"POPULATION AGEING, CAPITAL INTENSITY AND LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY",PACIFIC ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper analyses the implications of population ageing for the capital intensity of output and, therefore, labour productivity. Population ageing leads to sectoral shifts in demand for goods and services. If such shifts occur between goods that differ in their capital intensity, there will be a change in the average capital intensity of the economy and, therefore, in average labour productivity. In order to gauge the magnitudes of such effects, the present paper reports simulations of a calibrated model with two final goods and two intermediate goods, using data for two Pacific Rim countries for comparison: the United States and Australia. The data for these countries suggest that population ageing will, on average, shift expenditure towards goods with a relatively high capital intensity. The magnitude of the increase in labour productivity according to the simulations is likely to be small, but perhaps not trivial: in the order of 1-4% per annum by 2050. This might partially offset the negative effect of ageing on living standards.","Griffith Univ, Gold Coast, Qld 9726, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Guest, R (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, PMB 50, Gold Coast, Qld 9726, Australia.",r.guest@griffith.edu.au,,"Guest, Ross/0000-0002-7171-3054",,,,,11,7,7,2,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Our main motivation is a critical assessment of common assertions that draw inferences from pre-merger observable variables to post-merger incentives to foreclose. In particular, we find that, contrary to some commonly expressed views, high margins on the downstream and low margins on the upstream market are not good predictors for the incentives of a newly integrated firm to foreclose rivals. Besides this contribution to policy, our model also extends existing results in the literature on vertical foreclosure through allowing for the interaction of product differentiation on the upstream and on the downstream market.

Under SA, we find that increases in the corporate tax rate raise the wage level of domestic workers, while they lower the remuneration of foreign workers. The main insight emerging from a tax competition game is that the endogenous wage level gives rise to an ambiguous fiscal externality, which may dampen the race-to- the-bottom in corporate tax rates. A switch to a tax system with FA principles reverses the impact of corporate taxes on negotiated wages. While increases in the corporate tax rate reduce domestic wages, they raise the wage level of foreign workers. In a tax competition game, the endogenous wage level gives rise to a positive fiscal externality that enforces the race-to-the-bottom in corporate tax rates.","Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford OX1 1HP, England",University of Oxford,"Riedel, N (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Pk End St, Oxford OX1 1HP, England.",nadine.riedel@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,11,11,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We employ county-level aggregate data, instrumental variables and spatial econometric techniques to analyse the determinants of variation in SSDI rates and explicitly account for the endogeneity and measurement error of the self-reported disability measure. Two surprising results are found. First, it is shown that measurement error is the dominating source of the bias and that the main source of measurement error is sampling error.

The aim of this paper is to summarize the most important insights for competition policy that could be derived from the turbulent period 2008-2010. The financial crisis is seen as project that demanded sound management from competition policy and enforcement. The insights will be presented in the instructive form of 'lessons learnt' which represents a common approved project management technique. We come to the result that the financial crisis is not the result of 'too much competition', but of regulatory failure and that the main answers to the financial crisis have to come from 'smart regulation'. The relaxation of competition policy would be the wrong policy response in troubled times since competition policy can play an important role in bringing the crisis economy back on track. In contrast to banking we see no economic rationale for rescue packages for other economic sectors by referring to systemic risk. The renaissance of industrial policy is viewed with great skepticism since empirical evidence shows that the effort of picking 'winners' all too often results in saving 'losers'.","Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,"Böheim, MH (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Object 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",michael.boeheim@wifo.ac.at,,,,,,,30,2,3,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,JUL,2011,38.0,3,,,SI,,315,330,,10.1007/s10663-010-9163-y,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022VX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309993400003,0

We show that only a fraction of UK firms engage in international trade in services, that trade participation varies widely across industries and that service traders are different from non-traders in terms of size, productivity and other firm characteristics. We also provide detailed evidence on the trading patterns of service exporters and importers, such as the number of markets served, the value of exports and imports per market and the share of individual markets in overall sales. We interpret these facts in the light of existing theories of international trade in services and goods. Our results demonstrate that firm-level heterogeneity is a key feature of services trade. Also, we find many similarities between services and goods trade at the firm level and conclude that existing heterogeneous firm models for goods trade will be a good starting point for explaining trade in services as well.

Compared with the case where guanxi can only be used to reduce the individual's set-up cost to become an entrepreneur, it is shown that if guanxi can also help a worker find a job, then whether the employment rate might be improved or worsened will depend on the absolute risk aversion that is increasing or decreasing in income.

We apply the technique to an ex-vessel fish market that changed management systems from a regulated open-access system to an individual fishing quota (IFQ) system over the timespan analyzed. We find that post-IFQ implementation fishers do improve their bargaining power and thus accrue more of the rents generated by the fishery. However, unlike previous studies, we find that fishers do not move to a point of complete rent extraction. Rather, fishers and processors appear to be in a near-symmetric bargaining situation post-IFQ implementation.","[Fell, Harrison] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Haynie, Alan] NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",Resources for the Future; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Fell, H (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",fell@rff.org; Alan.Haynie@noaa.gov,,"Fell, Harrison/0000-0002-5749-3040",,,,,33,5,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

As subjects gained experience with the interface and each other, they typically exhibit fewer instances of mispricing and at lower magnitudes. But questions regarding trading experience are not easy to address in the lab with the typical subject pool since the kind of experience one can typically generate in the lab is experience with the experimental environment itself not with external environments. However, in virtual worlds asset markets are highly evolved, providing a subject pool with skilled and experienced traders that can be accessed via the Internet. This study compares experimental asset markets with participants recruited from virtual world trading groups to experimental markets with participants recruited from the virtual world at large. I further examine trader performance and trading behavior within markets. The findings indicate that asset markets with virtual world participants recruited from trading groups are more prone to exhibit bubbles than are markets with virtual world participants recruited at large. Within condition, experienced traders are less likely to follow fundamentals and more likely to engage in strategies that result in loss of earnings. Excess confidence is rejected as an explanation for this pattern, as confidence is found to be related to higher earnings and fundamental value trading strategies.","Univ Passau, Sch Business Adm & Econ, Inst Management People & Informat, D-94032 Passau, Germany",University of Passau,"Fiedler, M (通讯作者)，Univ Passau, Sch Business Adm & Econ, Inst Management People & Informat, Innstr 27, D-94032 Passau, Germany.",marina.fiedler@uni-passau.de,,,,,,,36,5,7,1,9,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Moreover, we demonstrate that parental investment has contemporaneously positive effects on skill levels for all age groups. Investigating other determinants of these skills, we find child health at age one to influence cognitive abilities at age five, whilst child health at age one is influenced by parental care already during pregnancy and earliest childhood.

I characterize necessary conditions for equilibrium bidding. The characterization reveals a close relationship between bidding in multiunit auctions and oligopolistic behaviour. I demonstrate that a recently proposed indirect approach to the revenue comparisons of discriminatory and uniform price auctions is not valid if bid functions have steps. In particular, bidders may bid above their marginal valuation in a uniform price auction. In order to demonstrate that discrete bidding can have important consequences for empirical analysis I use my model to examine a data set consisting of individual bids in uniform price treasury auctions of the Czech government. I propose an alternative method for evaluating the performance of the employed mechanism. My results suggest that the uniform price auction performs well, both in terms of efficiency of the allocation and in terms of revenue maximization. I estimate that the employed mechanism failed to extract at most 3 basis points in terms of the annual yield of T-bills worth of expected surplus while implementing an allocation resulting in almost all the efficient surplus. Failing to account for discreteness of bids would in my application result in overestimating the unextracted revenue by more than 50%.","[Kastl, Jakub] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kastl, Jakub] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kastl, J (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0752860] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,47,54,61,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The model is an extension of the Leontief two sector model, which analyzes the optimal allocation of capital and labor to a consumption good sector and an investment good sector. The paper extends this framework to include consumable capital. Thus, the planner has preferences over the consumption good and the consumable capital. Future welfare levels are treated equally as current ones. Geometric techniques are applied to characterize the optimal policy if the consumption good is labor-intensive. The results suggest that if the initial capital stock is above a threshold level, that depends upon the consumption of capital, every optimal program is monotonic, converges to the golden rule stock in a finite number of periods, and undergoes either unemployment or excess capacity of capital.

Sustainable Recovery and Reform,EASTERN EUROPEAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The conventional way to become a developed emerging market has been to rely in large part on investments from high-income countries. This approach has failed, most obviously during the recent global financial crisis, and may not be feasible again for some years. Azerbaijan and five ex-Soviet Central Asian economies have been set back by the world economic crisis. As the recovery continues, these countries will be able to use the proceeds from their staple exports to expand their basic industries (energy, basic chemicals, and metals), but in order to attract diverse foreign investments, they could also make greater efforts to promote a diverse private sector Besides credits and more predictable taxes, surveys show that private owners want and can benefit from better enforcement of property rights, reduced corruption, and easier access to regional and international markets. All the governments recognize these issues, but effective action has been halting. A possible alternative to promoting private enterprise and thus attracting first-world capital would be to expand the state sector and public infrastructure, as a precursor to privatization, as has occurred elsewhere in Asia.","[Spechler, Martin C.] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Spechler, Martin C.] Indiana Univ, Inner Asian & Ural Natl Resource Ctr, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Spechler, MC (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,9,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Senior participation rates to the labor force not only differ strikingly in level from one country to another, they also differ in their reaction to retirement incentives set by governments. This paper highlights how disutility to work can influence the effectiveness of such reforms. The authors build a highly stylized model according to which the reaction of senior activity rate to monetary incentives to work depends on the properties of the specific distribution of working conditions in the country. Second, taking the quality of labor relations as a proxy for working conditions, the authors show empirically that aggregate reactions to retirement incentives depend on the distribution of labor relations at country level. They use panel data for nineteen OECD countries from 1980 to 2004. They show that the elasticity of senior male labor force participation rate to retirement incentives is stronger in countries with better and more homogeneously distributed labor relations.","[Blake, Helene; Sangnier, Marc] Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Sangnier, M (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",sangnier@pse.ens.fr,,,,,,,13,0,0,2,6,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 30,2011,5.0,,,,,,,,20118,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2011-8,0.0,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865BS,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298286400001,0

We use a Dynamic Selection Control model in which young men make sequential choices about work and family and estimate the model using an approach that takes account of self-selection, simultaneity and unobserved heterogeneity. The results quantify how job stability affects wage rates, how both affect marital status, and how marital status affects earnings and job stability. The study reveals robust evidence that job changes lower wages and the likelihood of getting married and remaining married. At the same time, marriage raises wage rates and job stability. To project the sequential effects linking job change, marital status, and earnings, we simulate the impacts of shocks that raise preferences for marriage and that increase education. Feedback effects cause the simulated wage gains from marriage to cumulate over time, indicating that long-run marriage wage premiums exceed conventional short-run estimates.","[Lerman, Robert I.] American Univ, Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Lerman, Robert I.] IZA, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Ahituv, Avner] Carmel Acad Ctr, Haifa, Israel",Urban Institute; American University,"Lerman, RI (通讯作者)，American Univ, Urban Inst, 2100 M St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",avner@ry.org.il; rlerman@american.edu,"Lerman, Robert/AAK-6855-2021",,,,,,48,16,21,3,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

A closed-form solution for a long-run Phillips curve relates average output gap to average wage inflation: it is virtually vertical at high inflation and flattens at low inflation. Macroeconomic volatility shifts the curve outwards and reduces output. The results imply that stabilization policies play an important role, and that optimal inflation may be positive and differ across countries with different macroeconomic volatility. Results are robust to relaxing the wage constraint, for example, when large idiosyncratic shocks arise.

Strong FCL growth was mainly driven by private sector consumption and investment. Foreign banking groups easily intermediated international financing into open CEE markets. International measures, which could have limited FCL, were not taken. I found an inconsistency: FCL was primarily a result of macroeconomic imbalances, but macroeconomic policies mostly proved inefficient to downsize it. Administrative measures seemed to be the most effective, however, only for a short period due to the high degree of financial liberalisation. Regulatory measures proved less efficient, while relatively frequently used supervisory actions did not have any notable effects. Financial education, moral suasion, and market development measures (with the exception of long-term, fixed rate local currency (LC) housing finance) were not efficient at all. Out of 12 investigated countries 6 had some success to limit FCL. Others did not have any efficient policy mix. Comparing the experiences of Hungary and other countries I found that the 'we cannot do anything' is a worse policy approach than the 'we will try to do something' one in spite of its deficiencies.

In an economy with government intervention and capital accumulation, state-appointed bureaucrats are responsibile for procuring public goods which contribute to productive efficiency. Corruption arises because of an opportunity for bureaucrats to appropriate public funds by misinforming the government about the cost and quality of public goods provision. The incentive for each bureaucrat to do this depends on economy-wide outcomes which, in turn, depend on the behaviour of all bureaucrats. We establish the existence of multiple development regimes, together with the possibility of multiple, frequency-dependent equilibria.

Hence, when markets for assets are thin, firms' average productivity and capacity utilization are lower, and the dispersions of productivity and of capacity utilization are higher.

The question whether currency investments can be treated as efficient asset classes is not finally answered in theory and practice. This article applies a modified historical simulation approach to shares, bonds and currencies. The questions according to the efficiency of currency investments are answered empirically from a euro-investor's point of view. The empirical analysis leads to the result that currency investments are not efficient in general. Some specific cases exist. The used data lead to the result that the Czech koruna seems to be an efficient asset class and leveraging a euro portfolio by other currencies is useful as well. But it has to be doubted if these effects will remain in the future.","[Reuse, Svend] Sparkasse Mulheim Ruhr, DE-45481 Mulheim, Germany; [Reuse, Svend; Svoboda, Martin] Masaryk Univ Brno, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic; [Reuse, Svend] FOM Univ Appl Sci, Mulheim, Germany",Masaryk University Brno,,Svend.Reuse@gmx.de; svoboda@econ.muni.cz,"Reuse, Svend/F-5053-2013",,,,,,28,0,0,0,8,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The sports industry offers a wealth of data and specific hiring practices which mitigates this difficulty. The Rooney Rule requires National Football League teams to interview at least one minority candidate when hiring a head coach. We examine a unique data set of high-level assistant coaches (offensive and defensive coordinators) from the beginning of the 1970 season through the beginning of the 2009 season to determine whether race is a factor in NFL teams' decisions to promote these assistants to head coach. Using logit and hazard models that control for age, experience and performance, we conclude that conditional on a coach reaching coordinator status, there is no evidence that race influences head coach hiring decisions. We also find no evidence that the Rooney Rule has increased the number of minority head coaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The merits of viewing routines as multilevel mechanisms are that it helps in putting together a coherent picture of what routines are, what routines do, and how they do it. In particular, it helps in getting a clearer picture of how skills and routines are ontologically (rather than metaphorically) related to each other. It allows us to see that while routines are generative mechanisms producing recurrent patterns of firm behavior, as multilevel mechanisms they themselves are at the same time recurrent patterns of interaction within firms. Because of its 'behavioral' spirit, viewing routines as multilevel mechanisms (rather than as, for example, unobservable dispositions of firms to energize patterns of behavior in firms) greatly facilitates further empirical research on crucial, as yet unresolved issues, such as how stable and robust routines are and to what extent firm behavior is routine.","Erasmus Univ, EIPE, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Vromen, JJ (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, EIPE, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",vromen@fwb.eur.nl,,,,,,,45,18,18,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

Accession to the WTO has allowed China to fully integrate into the world system and capture the gains of its comparative advantage in abundant labor supply. Structural change has a dampening effect on the Balassa-Samuelson effect so as to sustain China's competiveness in the world market. The double transition will take 10 to 15 years to finish; in this time period, China will likely continue its fast export-led growth. Along the way, export-led growth has also created serious structural imbalances highlighted by underutilized savings, slow growth of residential income and domestic consumption, and a heavy reliance on investment. This linkage requires new thinking when global imbalances are to be tackled.","[Yao, Yang] Peking Univ, CCER, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yao, Yang] Peking Univ, NSD, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"Yao, Y (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, CCER, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yyao@ccer.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,36,8,9,0,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

In particular, we combine evolutionary selection among heterogeneous classes of models through predictor choice dynamics based on a logit model, with adaptive learning in the form of parameters updating within each class of rules. We find that, for different parameterizations, it can happen that fundamentalists drive chartists completely out of the market or vice versa, and also that heterogeneous equilibria in which fundamentalists and chartists coexist are possible. Interestingly, though, only equilibria in which fundamentalists outperform chartists turn out to be adaptively learnable by agents. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To what extent can the growth in informality be attributed to a sharp increase in the real value of the minimum wage since 2001, when minimum-wage setting was decentralized to the provincial governments? To answer this and related questions we use survey data on the labor market, on household income and expenditure, and on the industrial sector to construct a district-level dataset spanning the period 1996 to 2004. The effects of changes in the minimum wage on unemployment, formal-sector employment, and the incidence of informality in urban areas are estimated by fixed effects with a seemingly unrelated regression estimator. We find that an increase in the ratio of the minimum to the mean wage is associated with a net increase in employment: a rise in informal-sector employment more than compensates for job losses in the formal sector.","[Comola, Margherita] Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France; [de Mello, Luiz] OECD, Dept Econ, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Comola, M (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Bl Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",comola@pse.ens.fr,,,,,,,38,32,39,3,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We extend the neo-Schumpeterian growth framework to investigate the role of strong uncertainty in the innovative process. In particular, we postulate that, when deciding upon R&D efforts, investors hold 'ambiguous beliefs' about the exact probability of arrival of the next vertical innovation, and that they face ambiguity via the alpha -MEU decision rule (Ghirardato et al., J Econ Theory 118:133-173, 2004). Along the balanced growth path, the higher the agent's ambiguity aversion (alpha), the lower the R&D efforts and the economic performance. Consistent with cross-country empirical evidence, this causal mechanism suggests that, together with the profitability conditions of the economy, different 'cultural' attitudes towards ambiguity may help explain the different R&D efforts observed across countries.","[Giordani, Paolo E.] LUISS Guido Carli Univ, Dept Econ & Business, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Cozzi, Guido] Univ Durham, Durham DH1 3LB, England",Luiss Guido Carli University; Durham University,"Giordani, PE (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",guido.cozzi@durham.ac.uk; pgiordani@luiss.it,,"GIORDANI, PAOLO/0000-0002-2192-6350",,,,,26,9,10,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Our investigation confirms earlier results of imperfect competition in South African manufacturing where we find an average mark-up of 50% for the period 1970 to 2004 that is without consistent trend over time. The contribution of the paper is to provide a theoretically grounded means of linking output market conduct to labor market flexibility. We infer the proportion of labor associated with rigidities in the labor market from the mark-up, and find that two thirds of total labor employed in South African manufacturing is associated with rigidities. We find that this proportion falls during the 1980s and rises during the 1990s. suggesting an increase in labor flexibility followed by a decrease. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates the influence of product market competition on the size of the changeover-related prices hikes, showing that the price hikes were less prevalent in countries with a higher level of competition. For the countries that are to join the euro area in coming years, this means that fostering competition can help contain changeover-related price increases. This aspect is of particular importance for the most recent and next wave of euro adopters, because of their rather heavy product market regulation as measured by the OECD, which are likely to restrain competition. The results indicate that comprehensive reform efforts can be more beneficial in containing changeover-related price hikes than a selective easing of product market regulation in a subset of areas.","Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Dept Econ, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Koske, I (通讯作者)，Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Dept Econ, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",Isabell.Koske@oecd.org,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2011,38.0,2,,,,,223,230,,10.1007/s10663-010-9133-4,0.0,,,8,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022VU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309993100004,0

The main mechanism through which financial intermediaries affect the real economy is through the evaluation and provision of liquidity to R&D projects. We distinguish two scenarios. In the regime with information disclosure, banks are able to use the stock of information obtained by the banking industry from evaluating R&D projects. This information externality brings about efficiency improvements, thereby leading to a positive entry of banks, more bank-funded research and in turn positive economic growth. By contrast, in the regime with no information disclosure, it is not profitable for new banks to enter the industry. This implies that no more potential R&D projects can be evaluated and hence financed, thus leading the economy to a zero-growth equilibrium. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Where there is a sticky wage rate, the demand for labor at home will be constant. With a rising supply and constant demand, the rate of unemployment of educated workers in the domestic labor market will increase. Thus, the prospect of employment abroad causes involuntary educated unemployment at home. A government that is concerned about educated unemployment and might therefore be expected to encourage unemployed educated people to migrate will nevertheless, under certain conditions, elect to restrict the extent of the migration of educated individuals.","[Stark, Oded] Univ Bonn, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Stark, Oded] Univ Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Stark, Oded] Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Stark, Oded] Warsaw Univ, Warsaw, Poland; [Stark, Oded] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Fan, C.

We consider a policy framework in which firms in a given industry decide whether or not to sign a VA proposed by an environmental regulator. We identify the features that a VA should possess in order to provide firms with an incentive to participate in the VA and to enhance its economic and environmental effectiveness. Under very general conditions on the shape of the demand schedule, we obtain the following results. First, a VA does not belong to the equilibrium of the coalition game when benefits from voluntary emission abatement are a pure public good, unless an industry emission target is set by the regulator. Second, in the presence of partial spillovers-i.e. when signatories obtain more benefits from the VA than non-signatories-a VA can belong to the equilibrium only if a minimum participation rule is guaranteed. Third, a VA with a minimum participation rule and a minimum mandatory emission abatement may improve welfare (and even industry profits) compared to a VA in which firms are free to set their own profit maximizing abatement level.","[Brau, Rinaldo] Univ Cagliari, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Brau, Rinaldo] CRENoS, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Carraro, Carlo] Univ Venice, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Carraro, Carlo] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Milan, Italy; [Carraro, Carlo] CMCC, Venice, Italy",University of Cagliari; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"Brau, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Viale S Ignazio 17, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",brau@unica.it; ccarraro@unive.it,"Brau, Rinaldo/P-9157-2019; Carraro, Carlo/A-7071-2014","Brau, Rinaldo/0000-0002-6032-0773; Carraro, Carlo/0000-0002-8403-2231",,,,,56,11,12,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In the paper, we develop a natural extension of Benhabib and Farmer's (1994) model by introducing aggregation increasing returns to variety. It is shown that an increase in the degree of monopoly power can create increasing returns to an expansion in variety which decreases reliance on the degree of increasing returns-to-scale in production for generating local indeterminacy. As the degree of monopoly power increases, the required degree of increasing returns for local indeterminacy decreases monotonically. As a result, our numerical analysis indicates that the required degree of increasing returns for local indeterminacy can be easily located in the empirically plausible range. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a static applied general equilibrium model, and using a Social Accounting Matrix and Household Expenditure Survey, we calibrate it to match Slovenian data. We simulate the case of Slovenia joining the EU and quantify its welfare impact on households that differ in terms of age, income, and education. Additionally, we compare this benchmark case with two alternative scenarios: (1) a free trade agreement between Slovenia and the EU and (2) a custom union arrangement where tariff revenues are rebated proportionally to the households. We find that while trade liberalization leads to falling consumer prices, increased production in the export sectors, and aggregate welfare gains, the differentiated welfare impacts across heterogeneous households vary in their degrees.

We show a decline in Southern welfare and world welfare. We then assume there are cash constraints on Southern agents and show that the equity share chosen by foreign agents is higher than the efficient level, in which case some degree of ownership restriction may improve the world welfare. However, if there is no international discipline on ownership restrictions, the ownership restriction level chosen by the Southern government tends to be overacted and will deteriorate the world welfare.","Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Cui, F (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",cuifan@uibe.edu.cn,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,30,2,2,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The biologically micro-founded model allows us to address empirical criticism of the original nutrition-based efficiency wage model. By extending the model with respect to heterogeneity in worker body size and a physiologically founded impact of body size on productivity, we demonstrate that the nutrition-based efficiency wage model is compatible with the empirical regularity that taller workers simultaneously earn higher wages and are less likely to be unemployed in less developed economies. The theory also provides an answer to the question of why the height-unemployment association may disappear in the process of development.","[Dalgaard, Carl-Johan] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Strulik, Holger] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Wirtschaftswissensch Fak, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",University of Copenhagen; Leibniz University Hannover,"Dalgaard, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",carl.johan.dalgaard@econ.ku.dk; strulik@vwl.uni-hannover.de,,"Strulik, Holger/0000-0002-5615-2412",,,,,49,9,9,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

A number of researchers have suggested that loose monetary policy during the first half of the 2000s was a primary cause of the substantial run-up in house prices in many countries. However, using a common statistical approach, we find that monetary policy was not the main factor. That should not be surprising: Although low interest rates raise house prices, the increase in prices during the mid-2000s was much larger than the historical relationship between the two variables would suggest. Instead, we investigate further the link between the marked loosening in terms and standards for mortgage credit and the most rapid increases in house prices. This link provides some evidence for a story where credit provision and the demand for housing fed on each other and helped spur the housing boom. Our work suggests a greater role for macroprudential regulation rather than monetary policy in managing asset price booms. - Jane Dokko, Brian M. Doyle, Michael T.

This study examines the impact of multi-state regulation on life insurer cost, revenue and profit efficiency. The main findings suggest that insurer cost efficiency is inversely related to the number of states licensed and directly related to total assets, after controlling for geographic concentration, insolvency risk and other firm-specific characteristics. Further, the results support the expectation that insurer expansion into additional states is optimal in that the additional regulatory and other costs associated with operating in more states are offset by higher revenues to the extent that insurer profit efficiency is not affected. A robustness test is conducted using an indicator variable for New York licensed insurers to examine the relation between regulatory stringency and insurer efficiency. This test confirms the results, even in the presence of the more stringent regulation of New York. These findings are consistent with the expectation that any regulatory cost savings that result from an optional federal charter, or single regulator, will be passed along to insurance consumers in a competitive insurance market.","Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Pottier, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",spottier@terry.uga.edu,,,,,,,28,9,11,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

For example, contemporaries complained of recurrent shortages of small change and argued that an abundance/dearth of money had real effects on exchange, especially for the poor. To confront these facts, we build a random-matching monetary model with two indivisible coins with different intrinsic values. The model shows that small change shortages can exist, in the sense that adding small coins to an economy with only large coins is welfare-improving. This effect is amplified by increases in trading opportunities. Further, changes in the quantity of monetary metals affect the real economy and the amount of exchange as well as the optimal denomination size. Finally, the model shows that replacing full-bodied small coins with tokens is not necessarily welfare-improving.","[Weber, Warren E.] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Res Dept, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA; [Redish, Angela] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Weber, Warren E.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; University of British Columbia; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Weber, WE (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Res Dept, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA.",wew@minneapolisfed.org,,,,,,,19,5,5,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

In particular, if, consistently with empirical evidence, parental human capital complements investment in a child's education and yields increasing returns in the intergenerational production of human capital, income redistribution may have an adverse impact on the growth rate of average human capital. Redistribution shifts resources towards the less educationally-productive families and thus in the presence of credit markets imperfections and increasing returns, it reduces the aggregate level of investment in human capital. Moreover, if the degree of increasing returns is sufficiently large to produce sustained growth, this adverse effect on human capital formation may outweigh the conventional beneficial effects of redistribution that arises from the interaction between a production technology exhibiting diminishing returns and credit market imperfections.","[Bandyopadhyay, Debasis] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland, New Zealand; [Tang, Xueli] Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Burwood E, Vic 3125, Australia",University of Auckland; Deakin University,"Bandyopadhyay, D (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, OGGB Level 6,12 Grafton Rd,Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand.",,"Bandyopadhyay, Debasis/R-9997-2019","Bandyopadhyay, Debasis/0000-0002-4404-5935; Tang, Xueli/0000-0002-7408-4054",,,,,50,7,7,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Modigliani and Cao (2004) concluded that most of the huge increase in the household saving rate in China since 1975, the 'Chinese saving puzzle', can be explained by the life-cycle hypothesis. Their analysis is based on the estimation of reduced form equations. However, a structural model of their hypothesis would impose constraints on these equations. For not taking them into account, their test of the life-cycle hypothesis lacks power. In this paper, we develop a structural model of household saving behavior based on the life-cycle hypothesis for the Chinese economy. We find that the life-cycle hypothesis can explain only 35% of the surge of the Chinese household saving. We then add to the model the strong motivation of young adults for buying a home and the financial support they receive from their parent for that. In this way, the model can reproduce the high and increasing level of saving since the mid-nineties. Nonetheless the increase in household saving, which took place during the eighties, may not be explained by the life-cycle hypothesis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Our main result states that for symmetric congestion games in which the cost function associated with each resource satisfies a bounded jump condition, convergence to an epsilon-Nash equilibrium occurs within a number of steps that is polynomial in the number of players and epsilon(-1). We show moreover that this result holds under a variety of conventions governing the move orders among the players, including the minimal liveness assumption that no player is indefinitely blocked from moving. We also prove that in the generalized setting where players have different tolerances epsilon(i), the number of moves a player makes before equilibrium is reached depends only on his associated si, and not on those of other players. Finally, we show that polynomial time convergence holds even when a constant number of resources have arbitrary cost functions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

But our view on oil has remarkably changed. We now also worry about too much oil because of climate change damages associated with oil and other fossil fuel use. In this climate change debate, economists have pointed to a green paradox: when policy makers stimulate the development of low carbon energy sources to (partly) replace fossil fuels in the future, oil markets may anticipate a future reduction in demand and increase current supply. The availability of 'green' technologies may increase damages. The insight comes from the basic exhaustible resource model. We reproduce the green paradox, and to facilitate discussion, differentiate between a weak and a strong version, related to short-term and long-term effects, respectively. Then we analyze the green paradox in two standard modifications of the exhaustible resource model. We find that increasing fossil fuel extraction costs counteracts the strong green paradox, while imperfect energy substitutes may make both the weak and strong green paradox vanish.

If we apply game theory to the socioeconomic context of post-communist evolution, this difference reflects the two main models of cooperation, namely the prisoner's dilemma and the stag hunter. The prisoner's dilemma, which becomes the dominant strategy under the conditions of high social heterogeneity and broken informational channels, implies that it is profitable not to cooperate. Under the stag hunter model - a model involving a common goal and a common project - cooperative strategies are more advantageous. The various post-communist countries in different transition phases can be approximated to either one of those two games - the prisoner's dilemma or the stag hunter.

Tony Lawson seems concerned that critics of standard models now will fill academic journals with contributions that make the same methodological mistakes, albeit in a slightly different guise. In particular, he is rather sceptical of the usefulness of mathematical statistical models, such as the Cointegrated VAR model, as a way of learning about economic mechanisms. In this paper I discuss whether this is a relevant claim and argue that it is likely to be based on a misunderstanding of what a proper statistical analysis is and can offer. In particular, I argue that the strong evidence of (near) unit roots and (structural) breaks in economic variables suggests that standard economic models need to be modified or changed to incorporate these strong features of the data.

Using a sample of NYMEX and ICE futures contracts, we establish the existence of a regime process and link this process to market fundamentals. This formulation results in two distinct states: a highly persistent conditional volatility process, characterised by long memory and low sensitivity to market shocks, and a relatively short-lived nonstationary process with less memory but higher sensitivity to shocks. Moreover, to investigate the relationship between disequilibrium and volatility of oil futures across high and low volatility regimes we use augmented regime GARCH models to address in a realistic way the potential diverse response of volatility to forward curve shocks. The performance of these models is compared to benchmarks, using both statistical tests and risk management loss functions. To test the robustness of the forecasting strategies, we also perform a reality check employing the stationary bootstrap approach. The findings of this paper have important implications for decision making concerning trading and risk management, as well as energy market operations, such as refining and budget planning, by providing valuable information on the oil price volatility dynamics and the ability to predict risk.

Poland, one of the poorest and least environmentally friendly member countries of the European Union, has to reconcile conflicting objectives and contradictory interests that due to the imperatives of both fast economic growth and ecological sustain ability manifest themselves at different scales. Thus, drawing on dynamic and interactive conceptualizations of scale, the study argues that the two cases can be seen as an illustration of interscalar conflicts. In doing so, the paper demonstrates why a scalar interpretation is preferable to other explanations. It also sheds light on the question of the privileged status of the local scale, suggesting that it is problematic to uncritically regard any scale as superior to other scales. By exploring sociospatial processes in the east European context, the study aims to expand the existing body of knowledge.","Univ Gdansk, Fac Econ, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Zientara, P (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Fac Econ, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland.",,,"Zientara, Piotr/0000-0001-6089-7313",,,,,72,2,2,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

In the model, firms offer insurance contracts to consumers who are initially uninformed of their risk type but can obtain such information by performing a costless genetic test. A crucial ingredient of our analysis is that information has decision-making value since it allows for the optimal choice of a self-insurance action (secondary prevention). We focus on the welfare properties of market equilibria obtained under the different regulatory schemes and, by using an intuitive graphical analysis, we rank them unambiguously.

First, the agreements exerted significant positive effects on goods trade between the EU15 incumbents and the CEEC and, at the same time, they induced trade redirection from other countries. Second, EU15 GDP responded by an increase of much less than 1% while that in the 10 CEEC increased by several percent in response to the agreements.

But private pensions are part of the long term compensation package, and altering pensions not only affects retirement incentives, but also wages. A key factor in determining whether retirement occurs at the appropriate age is the relation of productivity to alternatives. When wages, coupled with public and private pension accrual, deviate from worker productivity, private retirement incentives are distorted. Sometimes this results in too much early retirement, creating fiscal difficulties. Sometimes, it results in a desire for delayed retirement, which argues for mandatory retirement rules. Pay compression, where wages do not vary across individuals as much as productivity, exacerbate distortions. Defined benefit pension plans tend to create incentives to retire after a certain number of years of work. Defined contribution plans do not have this feature. Public plans should be designed noting their interaction with incentives that are already inherent in the private wage and pension schemes.","[Lazear, Edward P.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lazear, Edward P.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Lazear, EP (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, 518 Mem Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",Lazear_Edward@gsb.stanford.edu,,,,,,,24,4,7,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

J,"Abbott, P; de Battisti, AB",,,,"Abbott, Philip; de Battisti, Adeline Borot",,,"Recent Global Food Price Shocks: Causes, Consequences and Lessons for African Governments and Donors",JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Dramatic increases in international agricultural commodity prices began in 2006 and peaked in July 2008. An equally remarkable and rapid decline of those prices then ensued, accompanied by extreme volatility in those prices. The trend in food prices lagged the rapid increases in other commodity prices, including oil and metals, but accompanied those other prices in the downward part of the cycle. Not all agricultural commodities increased to the same extent-grains and oilseed prices increased the most, with rice among the most expensive at the peak and rising as much as crude oil, while prices of some African exports (cocoa, coffee and cotton) increased to a much smaller extent than the grains. High commodity prices quickly raised farmgate prices in developed countries. In developing countries, poor market integration and border barriers may have limited pass-through of these prices to the farmgate, but there was more rapid food price and general inflation than occurred in many developed countries. Countries were impacted to differing extents, and food riots occurred in the most affected cases. It has been noted that underlying fundamentals of food price inflation differ by the extent of development, as poor countries have smaller distribution costs but higher budget shares in basic staples. Import dependence, tradable versus non-tradable status of grains and whether there were home goods substitutes influenced the extent of price transmission. Many developing countries reacted by altering trade and domestic agricultural policies and attempted to stabilise domestic markets. Importing countries reduced tariffs and taxes in many cases, and food subsidies were increased in some cases. Export taxes were enacted to protect domestic users, and bans of exports were applied in some extreme cases-explaining the especially large increase in rice prices. While impacts on domestic prices vary across country cases, disentangling the role of policy response from market integration would require further work. Policy responses were complicated by disagreement at the time that prices were rising as to whether the increases would be permanent or short lived, which in turn depends on the root causes of the increases-over which there has been considerable debate. Consensus has emerged on some factors, while controversy over macroeconomic relationships persists. They were also complicated by dynamic adjustments of related prices, which were not instantaneous. For example, fertiliser prices did not fall until several months after grain prices fell. Policy responses of national governments in Africa and elsewhere in the developing world contrast sharply with initiatives recommended by the international community. International organisations, development banks and donors emphasise emergency relief and longer term agricultural development, whereas national governments heavily utilised market interventions through trade and domestic policy. In this paper, we will first explore the factors that have been offered to explain the run-up and subsequent down-turn in agricultural commodity prices. Explanations have included supply and utilisation events, competition for grains and oilseeds as food versus fuel, and financial factors such as currency changes that exaggerated prices measured in dollars. Interactions between these factors will matter to the resulting outcomes, so specific contributions cannot be assigned. Moreover, debate persists on the exogenous mechanisms driving these changes, which are often interrelated (e. g. , worldwide economic boom and then globl recession, speculation in commodities). The goal will be to identify factors likely to drive commodity prices in the future and to provide some understanding of the dynamics and persistence of the observed global price changes. The next part of the paper will explore how those global price changes were transmitted to developing country markets. The extent of farmgate price changes and retail food price adjustments will be documented to the extent feasible. The roles of border policy, domestic agricultural policy, market integration and retail food margins will be considered. Special emphasis will be placed on what actual policy adjustments were taken and how well they worked. Given the presumed underlying causes of high and then low food prices, and the uncertainty of future global commodity prices, policy options now available to developing countries will be explored. These will include short-run safety nets, market interventions and long-run incentives to agricultural development. In this part, special emphasis will be put on what happened in Africa and how it should respond in the future. Some of the key issues in the current debate on expanding African agricultural sectors, including price stabilisation and fertiliser subsidisation, will be explored. In the process, we will evaluate how far various methodologies have taken us in providing an understanding of the consequences of these recent events, and providing a sound basis for policy recommendations.","[Abbott, Philip] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [de Battisti, Adeline Borot] OECD, Trade & Agr Directorate, Paris, France",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Abbott, P (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",abbottpc@purdue.edu,,,,,,,52,50,57,1,104,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Our results show that ECHP attrition is characterized by a certain degree of selectivity but only affecting some variables and countries. Different probability models corroborate the existence of a certain nonrandom attrition. The model chosen to construct the longitudinal weights to correct attrition offers up rather different results than those obtained when Eurostat's longitudinal weights are used.

Therefore the quality of municipal websites has a significant impact on the quality of services provided by municipalities. The presented paper aims to determine the factors that affect the quality of websites in municipalities up to 2000, inhabitants. To meet the outlined objective, following four hypotheses were examined. H1: The quality of the municipal website increases with lower age of municipality's mayor; H2: The quality of the municipal website increases with higher assets of the municipality; H3: The quality of the municipal website increases with the volume of subsidies attracted by the municipality; H4: The quality of the municipal website increases with higher population of the municipality. The research was realized on the sample gathered on the basis of systematic selection in the Kralovehradecky region municipalities (n=80). The data analysis subject was focused on Finding how independent variables (age of the mayor, volume of the assets, volume of attracted subsidies and municipality population) affect the dependent variable (quality of website score). The data analysis was conducted through multiple regression analysis to avoid problems with interdependencies among independent variables. Findings confirmed statistical importance of hypothesis H4: The quality of the municipal website increases with higher population of the municipality. The validity of the other hypotheses was not proved. Research results thus show that the quality of municipal website is not so much dependent on personality of the manager, or the disposable financial situation of the municipality, but rather on how many citizens benefit from the service - in our case from the municipal website.","[Bachmann, Pavel] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Management, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,,pavel.bachmann@uhk.cz,"Bachmann, Pavel/H-6835-2012","Bachmann, Pavel/0000-0002-2823-8497",,,,,17,0,0,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,24,+,,,,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200003,0

Second, we reveal that the competition between a conventional insurer and a Managed Care Organization (MCO) leads to a similar equilibrium than the competition between two MCOs characterized by a different objective, i.e. private versus mutual. Third, we point out that the ex ante providers' horizontal differentiation leads to an exclusionary equilibrium in which both insurers select one distinct provider. This result is in sharp contrast with frameworks that introduce the concept of option value to model the (ex post) horizontal differentiation between providers.","[Bardey, David] Univ Rosario Bogota, Bogota, Colombia; [Bardey, David] Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, Toulouse, France; [Bourgeon, Jean-Marc] INRA & Ecole Polytech, Paris, France",Universidad del Rosario; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE,"Bardey, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rosario Bogota, Bogota, Colombia.",david.bardey@gmail.com; bourgeon@inapg.fr,,,,,,,23,2,3,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is adopted to investigate productivity change in a sample of higher education leavers over the period 1999 and 2004. In a first step, the Luenberger Productivity Indicator (LPI) is used to estimate and to decompose productivity change. Following LPI a better productivity is found for the workers in Paris and the well-qualified occupations in France. In analysing the nature of the technical change by the concept of parallel neutrality, technical progress seems to have influenced all professions. In particular, biased inputs of human capital component benefit more for the well qualified professions with an upper increase of the efficiency scores for executives and teachers. Furthermore, some evidences show the key role of learning by doing in the worker's adaptation to technical change. Policy implications are then derived from our results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This approach, however, does not allow us to study the effect of antitrust fines on the incentives to form cartels in the first place. In this paper, we adopt a coalitional game approach to modeling collusive agreements, showing that antitrust fines may drive firms from partial cartels to a monopolistic cartel. Moreover, by introducing uncertainty on market demand, we show that the socially optimal competition policy can call for a finite or even zero antitrust penalty, even if there are no enforcement costs. We provide a sufficient condition for these results to apply to any coalitional game of cartel formation with symmetric firms. Then, we discuss the extension to asymmetric firms and dynamic collusion.","[Bartolini, David; Zazzaro, Alberto] Univ Politecn Marche, Marche, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Bartolini, D (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Marche, Italy.",d.bartolini@univpm.it; a.zazzaro@univpm.it,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We argue that the conventional wisdom that belief heterogeneity generates continuous trade and significant fluctuations in individual portfolios may be correct but it needs some qualifications. We consider an infinite horizon stochastic endowment economy populated by many Bayesian agents with heterogeneous priors over the stochastic process of the states of nature. Our approach hinges on studying the portfolios that decentralize Pareto optimal allocations. Since these allocations are typically history dependent, we propose a methodology to provide a complete recursive characterization when agents believe that the process of states of nature is i.i.d. but disagree about the probability of the states. We show that even though heterogeneous priors within that class can indeed generate. genuine changes in the portfolios of any dynamically complete markets equilibrium, these changes vanish with probability one if the true process consists of i.i.d. draws from a common distribution and the support of some agent's prior belief contains the true distribution. Finally, we provide examples in which asset trading does not vanish because either (i) no agent learns the true conditional probability of the states or (ii) some agent does not know the true process generating the data is i.i.d.

Many recent sticky-price models, however, grossly underpredict this persistence. We assess whether adding inventories to a standard sticky-price model raises the persistence of output and inflation. For this addition, we consider a shopping-cost model. In the model, consumers find shopping activities costly, and the cost of shopping depends on the stock of goods available. In this context, producers manage inventories to smooth production and to affect the cost of shopping. We find that the shopping-cost model generates a persistence for output and inflation that matches the persistence observed in the post-1985 US data.","[Letendre, Marc-Andre] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada; [Boileau, Martin] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",McMaster University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Letendre, MA (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",letendre@mcmaster.ca,"Letendre, Marc-Andre/L-3591-2019",,,,,,41,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We utilize an approach where net external-debt positions dampen the widening of the current account balances. In a simple accounting framework, we find supportive evidence of the adjustment role of the net external-debt positions on the current account balances. Our findings show that net external-debt holdings affect current account imbalances through their effect on private consumption. Government expenditure and domestic investment, on the other hand, are not negatively affected by net external-debt holdings. We show that, on average, developing countries in the sample would have run a 2.7 percentage points wider current account deficit in the absence of the negative impact of net external debts. Net external-debt positions, therefore, reduce the dispersions of current account imbalances and thus increase the correlation of investment and saving ratios.","Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Bulut, L (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",bulut@gsu.edu,"Bulut, Levent/K-4471-2019","Bulut, Levent/0000-0003-1662-2050",,,,,35,3,4,1,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Empirical results indicate that state dependence between current and past modes plays an important role in determining entry mode choice. However, the impact of state dependence will be reduced significantly if the mode adopted in the previous period is associated with poor performance of the parent firm. There is strong linkage between mode performance and future mode choice. Evidence also shows that the hypothesized influences of transaction cost factors on entry mode choice gain support in the dynamic choice process. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It analyses whether financial sector reform is urgent and thus should be sequenced from the very outset of transition or, alternatively, is important rather than urgent. If the latter is the case - and in view of the technical sophistication of the task - it should be sequenced later but by no means dodged. The basic questions of the current analysis are that there seems to be a trade-off between the two, and whether or not underdeveloped financial markets are bound to have an unfavourable impact on long-term growth. We then analyse, one by one, the role of monetary and fiscal institutions, exchange rate and tax regimes, as well as capital markets and special SME agencies across the region.

The first part of the paper examines the structure of supplies provided to the agricultural sector and the structure of demand for agricultural products in the light of input-output tables for the years 1995, 2000 and 2005 (the only three input-output tables for the Polish economy elaborated after 1990). The second part includes the analysis of economic rents created in agriculture and their allocation, including transfers to other sectors of the economy; on this basis, an attempt is made to assess the level of market failure in the agri-food sector before and after EU accession. The authors conclude that structural changes caused by the integration tend to decrease market failure in agri-food sector in Poland and reduce the outflow of rents. Thus, these changes are justified not only by social, environmental and political reasons, but also by economic reasoning, since they improve the efficiency of allocation. Nevertheless, the corrective influence of the CAP is insufficient because the distribution of rents between the agricultural sector and the rest of the economy is still disadvantageous to the agriculture.","[Czyzewski, Bazyli] Uniwersytet Ekon Poznaniu, KMiGZ, Poznan, Poland; [Mrowczynska-Kaminska, Aldona] Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy Poznaniu, Katedra Ekon & Polityki Gospodarczej Agrobiznesie, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business; Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Czyzewski, B (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekon Poznaniu, KMiGZ, Poznan, Poland.",b.czyzewski@ue.poznan.pl; aldonam@up.poznan.pl,"Czyżewski, Bazyli/Y-4679-2019","Czyzewski, Bazyli/0000-0002-6324-2723",,,,,78,4,4,0,11,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2011,,2,,,,,203,233,,,,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,774XB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291419000003,0

On theoretical grounds, social exclusion and income poverty are seen as different processes, but with closely interrelated dynamics. However, our empirical understanding of the way these two processes dynamically interact at the individual level is still very limited. To shed some light on the issue, we use a dynamic bivariate probit model, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and Wooldridge (2005)-type initial conditions. Both the first-and second-order Markov dynamics are examined. We estimate the model using the Italian sample of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP), waves 1-8, and find a sizable extent of state dependence in both poverty and social exclusion. Moreover, there are dynamic cross-effects implying that poverty and social exclusion are mutually reinforcing. Social policies aimed at eradicating poverty and avoiding individuals' social and economic marginalization should take these interaction effects explicitly into account.","[Devicienti, Francesco] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Finanziarie G Prato, I-10134 Turin, Italy; [Poggi, Ambra] Univ Milano Bicocca, Turin, Italy; [Poggi, Ambra] Coll Carlo Alberto, Lab R Revelli, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; University of Milano-Bicocca; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Devicienti, F (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Finanziarie G Prato, Corso Unione Sovietica 218Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy.",devicienti@econ.unito.it,"Devicienti, Francesco/HTP-9783-2023",,,,,,40,57,60,4,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A great number of information has been published within the field of the company crisis prediction and various models have been created. The Altman's Z-Score model may be one of the best known examples. This model has been exposed to a lot of criticism as it is not suitable for the Czech companies. That is why the so called IN index was created by the marital couple Inka and Ivan Neumaiers and it was first published in the year 1995. The model has then come through some modifications. Its version labelled IN01, originating in the year 2001, has found its use in industry. The parameters of the indicators vary from industry to industry. According to the authors the index has been verified on a sample of thousands of Czech companies and therefore its informative value is relatively high. The article aims at analysing chemical industry and testing the IN model on the accounting figures of some selected chemical companies in the Czech Republic and at assessing those results.","[Divisova, Pavla] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,,divisova@kem.zcu.cz,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,100,109,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200011,0

One might wonder what prevents these sellers from always exaggerating their customer's needs. In this paper, we offer a simple explanation, namely, consumers may spurn sellers who have a reputation for such demand inducement. We test this explanation by examining patient choice of obstetrician in Florida. In most of the counties that we study, we find that maternity patients are significantly less likely to choose obstetricians who perform more than the expected number of cesarean sections. We address simultaneity by instrumenting for inducement propensity using information about the obstetrician's training. Although the instrument is weak, a series of robustness tests suggests that our findings are plausible while ruling out alternative explanations.","[Dranove, David] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Ramanarayanan, Subramaniam] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Sfekas, Andrew] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Northwestern University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Dranove, D (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",d-dranove@kellogg.northwestern.edu; subbu@anderson.ucla.edu; sfekas@temple.edu,,,,,,,31,4,7,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We trace the timing of this so-called Great Moderation across many subsectors of the economy in order to better understand its root cause. We find that the interest rate sensitive sectors generally experience a much earlier volatility decline than other large sectors of the economy. The changes in Federal Reserve stabilization policies that occurred during the early 19805 support the view that an improved monetary policy played an important role in stabilizing real economic activity. We find only mild evidence that good luck was important and little evidence to support the claim that improved inventory management was important. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

An integro-differential equation is a mathematical expression that contains derivatives of the required function and its integral transforms. The technique is applied to two different dynamic models in terrorism: terrorism and tourism, and terrorist innovations. In the first model the number of tourists that appears in an integral term and also in a derivative term is impacted by the number of terrorists. In the second model the integro-differential equation for terrorist innovations relates them to terrorist attacks. The article shows how to solve, analyze, interpret, and deal with integro-differential equations. Integro-differential equations shed light on aspects of the models ignored when other techniques are used. This is particularly important for the evaluation of current counterterrorist policies, as well as to the formulation of new ones.","Univ Texas El Paso, MPA Program, El Paso, TX 79968 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso,"Faria, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas El Paso, MPA Program, 500 W Univ Ave,KEH 410, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",rfaria2@utep.edu,"Faria, João Ricardo/AAG-5304-2021","FARIA, JOAO RICARDO/0000-0001-6484-3566",,,,,36,4,4,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Amable's work was regarded as the starting point of this study, which underpinned the existence of the four models with statistical analysis. As for the new member states, our cluster analysis indicated that a new, fifth model of Central and Eastern Europe could be determined. The characteristics of the Central and Eastern European model may be derived from three main factors: the lack of capital, weak civil society and the impact of the European Union and other international organisations influencing the new member states. Also owing to these factors, a special division of labour has developed between the old and the new, post-communist member states since the systemic change two decades ago, in which the present asymmetric interdependency can be long-lasting. This could also make the Lisbon-type strategies, which aim to develop the European integration into a set of innovation-driven economies, illusory in the long run.","Univ Szeged, Szeged, Hungary",Szeged University,"Farkas, B (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Szeged, Hungary.",bfarkas@eco.u-szeged.hu,,,,,,,56,68,72,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,1,,,,,15,34,PII 933636655,10.1080/14631377.2011.546972,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,723GF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287493900002,0

In this paper, we examine whether language barriers and network effects can explain disparities in insurance Medicaid participation. Using the 2008 and 2009 American Community Survey, we show that linguistic networks facilitate Medicaid enrollment among non-English speaking adults. Our identification method follows Bertrand et al. (2000) and employs local variation in the density of immigrant populations and nationwide variation in Medicaid participation among ethnic groups. Given a hypothetical policy to increase Medicaid enrollment, for every 1 percentage point of direct increase, networks generate a multiplier effect that boosts participation by an additional 0.26 percentage points. Networks have greatest influence on individuals who are not proficient in English or who arrived in the United States more recently. Our results are robust to alternative specifications, including using an ex ante indicator of group-level participation. We also find that the availability of foreign-language Medicaid information online is associated with significantly higher participation.","[Gee, Emily R.; Giuntella, G.

The agency theory suggests that better corporate governance will reduce agency costs and improve investor confidence, which in turn will enhance the ability of a firm to gain access to equity finance, reducing dependence on debt finance. Conversely, the controlling shareholders of poorly governed firms are likely to prefer debt, in order to retain absolute ownership and control rights.

An alternative test,APPLIED ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNIT-ROOT; COINTEGRATION; GDP; STATIONARITY; STATES,"In a recent paper, I argued that Baumol's model of 'unbalanced growth' offers a ready explanation for the observed secular rise in Health Care Expenditure (HCE) in rich countries. Baumol's model implies that HCE is driven by wage increases in excess of productivity growth. I tested this hypothesis empirically, using data from a panel of 19 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and found robust evidence in favour of Baumol's theory. An alternative way to test Baumol's theory is to check whether its implication that variations in the relative price of medical care contribute significantly to explaining variations in health expenditure in the same direction has an empirical grounding. Earlier studies, although mostly not in an explicit attempt to test Baumol's theory, have occasionally rejected this hypothesis. Despite poor data quality of the available medical price indices, I perform the alternative test using data for nine OECD countries. My findings suggest that the relative price of medical care is in fact a statistically significant explanatory variable for health expenditure, thus lending support to Baumol's theory.","ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Hartwig, J (通讯作者)，ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland.",hartwig@kof.ethz.ch,,"Hartwig, Jochen/0000-0002-8138-5920",,,,,36,19,19,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Assessments have mostly focused on understanding household consumption, but there is an increasing interest in understanding government consumption, as well as in the treatment of gross capital formation and trade. National economic and environmental accounts are the most frequently used data source for such studies and input-output techniques are usually applied. For many OECD countries and a few developing countries, assessments address only energy or greenhouse gas emissions. Few studies address a broader range of emissions-related environmental impacts. There is a lack of consideration for important pressures on ecosystems such as habitat change and overexploitation of fisheries and forests. In all countries, housing and food are important. In poor countries, public services can contribute substantially, while in rich countries, mobility and the consumption of manufactured goods is important. In rapidly developing economies, investments, especially in infrastructure and buildings, are important causes of environmental pressure as well. Differences in production conditions and pollution intensities across countries are substantial, so explicitly modelling the production of internationally traded goods using multi-regional input-output analysis is necessary to account correctly for the environmental impacts arising from the consumption of imported goods.","[Hertwich, Edgar G.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Hertwich, Edgar G.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Hertwich, EG (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",edgar.hertwich@ntnu.no,"feng, tingting/A-9545-2012","Hertwich, Edgar/0000-0002-4934-3421",,,,,87,94,96,2,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

This paper develops a broad measure of social capital, incorporating four major components: social trust, norms, social networks, and social structure. We constructed an index of social capital for 72 countries by extracting the principal components from 44 variables. Consistent with the social capital literature, the index of social capital is significantly associated with various social and economic indicators, such as income per capita, education, infant mortality, regulatory quality and even happiness. We compare the levels of social capital between East Asia and other world regions. The results suggest that although the level of social capital varies widely across countries, East Asia has markedly less social capital than Western Europe or North America.","[Lee, Dan] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea; [Jeong, Kap-Young] Yonsei Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Chae, Sean] Samsung Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Yonsei University; Samsung,"Lee, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 53 Myeongnyun Dong 3Ga, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",danlee200@skku.edu,,"Lee, Dongwon/0000-0003-4568-5982",,,,,42,29,37,2,72,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

We use a stochastic frontier methodology to estimate inefficiency and TFP. We find that TFP fell by an average rate of 7.5% across provinces due to the decrease in technical efficiency. In fact, the majority of output growth within Indonesia is explained by the accumulation of inputs.

Methodological bases of the research are listed in the first part of the paper. The second part shows the results of two researches among companies which have been carried out in 2006 and 2008. The research was aimed at studying the gaining of public support for innovative activities of companies, given costs of external and internal research and development in the range of small, medium-sized and large enterprises. From the research results can be seen that large companies are not more successful in gaining the support from public resources than small and medium-sized enterprises. It was found that the differences in public support are not statistically significant between the group of SMEs and the group of large companies. As well the hypothesis that small and medium-sized enterprises spend higher cost proportion to obtain the results from external research and development than large companies was not confirmed. The share of costs to obtain results from external R&D in the category of SMEs was about 7% from total costs of R&D in both analysed periods. In the case of large companies the share was cca. 10 %. Next hypothesis which was confirmed only in the first period under consideration says that in the group of large companies the costs for internal research and development are higher than in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises. From comparison of both analysed periods results different trend in particular enterprise categories because the share of costs of internal R&D in SMEs has increased by about 3 % whereas in large companies this share has decreased by about 4 %.

We aim at investigating in depth what main drivers may be responsible for such a phenomenon. We exploit a rich panel dataset covering all the 103 Italian provinces. The case study on Italy is worth being considered provided that Italy is a main country in the EU, thus offering important pieces of information on the evaluation of policies. Evidence shows that the observed decoupling between economic growth and landfilling is driven by a mix of structural factors, as population density and waste management strategies. If on the one hand, the landfill tax is not arising as a significant driver of the phenomenon, other waste management instruments are associated with high significant negative effect on landfilled waste. In association to the features of the tariff system, we also underline the key role played by the share of separated collection in driving down landfilling of waste. Both the evolution of collection and tariff system are joint factors that may drive a wedge between the comparative waste performances of northern and southern regions.","[Mazzanti, Massimiliano; Nicolli, Francesco] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ Inst & Terr, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Montini, Anna] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy",University of Ferrara; University of Bologna,"Mazzanti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ Inst & Terr, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy.",mzzmsm@unife.it,,"mazzanti, massimiliano/0000-0002-6538-7942; MONTINI, ANNA/0000-0003-1557-2768; nicolli, francesco/0000-0001-8109-5969",,,,,51,29,29,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We stress that firms can credibly agree on retaliation schemes that maximally punish even the most efficient firm. This implies that whenever collusion is sustainable under cost symmetry, some collusion is also sustainable under cost asymmetry; efficient collusion, however, remains more difficult to sustain when costs are asymmetric.

Our framework uses the Petrin and Levinsohn (2010) definition of aggregate productivity growth, which aggregates plant-level changes to changes in aggregate final demand in the presence of imperfect competition and other distortions/frictions. We decompose these contributions into plant-level resource reallocations and plant-level technical efficiency changes while allowing in the estimation for 459 different production technologies, one for each 4-digit SIC code. On average we find positive aggregate productivity growth of 2.2% in this sector during this period of declining share in U.S. GDP. We find that aggregate reallocation made a larger contribution to growth than aggregate technical efficiency. Our estimates of the contribution of reallocation range from 1.7% to 2.1% per year, while our estimates of the average contribution of aggregate technical efficiency growth range from 0.2% to 0.6% per year. In terms of cyclicality, the aggregate technical efficiency component has a standard deviation that is roughly from 50% to 100% larger than that of aggregate total reallocation, pointing to an important role for technical efficiency in macroeconomic fluctuations. Aggregate reallocation is negative in only 3 of the 20 years of our sample, suggesting that the movement of inputs to more highly valued activities on average plays a stabilizing role in manufacturing growth. Our results have implications for both the theoretical literature on growth and alternative indexes of aggregate productivity growth based only on technical efficiency.

This approach results in direct tests of the inducement hypothesis, which are applied to agricultural data for the United Kingdom from 1953 to 2000. The time series properties of the variables are checked, cointegration is established and an Error Correction Model (ECM) constructed, which attempts to separate factor substitution from technological change. Finally, the ECM formulation is subjected to causality tests, which show that the factor price ratio for chemicals and land is Granger-prior to the factor-saving bias of technological change. However, long-run relative prices are not causally prior to the machinery/labour ratio. This results from perturbations in the user cost of machinery, caused by oil price shocks. Thus, the Induced Innovation Hypothesis (IIH) may explain long-run transformations like the mechanical and fertilizer revolutions that dominated the twentieth century, but not reflect short-run price volatility.","[Piesse, Jenifer; Thirtle, Colin] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Piesse, Jenifer] Kings Coll London, Dept Management, London SE1 9HN, England; [Schimmelpfennig, David] ERS, United States Dept Agr Prod Econ & Technol, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Thirtle, Colin] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AZ, England",Stellenbosch University; University of London; King's College London; Imperial College London,"Thirtle, C (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",c.thirtle@ic.ac.uk,"Schimmelpfennig, David/IWM-6630-2023",,,,,,33,7,7,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In addition, we show that this measure is intrinsically related to the importance of aggregate shocks for fluctuations in job flows at the firm level. Using data for the Portuguese economy, we conclude that the coefficient of variation is a more robust measure for the underlying volatility of gross job flows. We also find that large and old firms exhibit higher relative sensitivity to aggregate shocks than small and young firms, and have a disproportional influence over the dynamics of aggregate job reallocation. In particular, since large and old firms tend to reallocate jobs less procyclically than small and young firms, job reallocation is less procyclical than if all firm classes were equally sensitive to aggregate shocks.

Using a translog specification, our econometric analysis reveals a decelerating trend in total factor productivity growth resulting in negative impact of economic reforms on the Indian fertilizer industry. The study also indicates a declining trend of economic capacity utilization suggesting the adverse impact of liberalization after the mid 90's, due to slow increases in actual output; this probably results from stagnated demand and rapid expansion of capacity as a result of the abolition of the licensing rule consequent to economic reforms. Total output growth in the Indian fertilizer industry is found to be mainly as a result of input-accumulation rather than productivity driven. The analysis reveals that a correction for capacity utilization mitigates the variations in total factor productivity growth.","[Sarbapriya, Ray] Univ Calcutta, Shyampur Siddheswari Mahavidyalaya, Dept Commerce, Howrah, W Bengal, India; [Mihir, Kumar Pal] Vidyasagar Univ, Dept Econ, Paschim Medinipur, W Bengal, India",University of Calcutta; Vidyasagar University,"Sarbapriya, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calcutta, Shyampur Siddheswari Mahavidyalaya, Dept Commerce, Howrah, W Bengal, India.",sarbapriyaray@yahoo.com; mihirpal@yahoo.com,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,6,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

To establish a causal effect we rely on fixed-effects methods and plant closures as exogenous entries into unemployment. Although unemployment is negatively correlated with health, we do not find a negative effect of unemployment due to plant closure on health across several health measures (health satisfaction, mental health, and hospital visits). For this subgroup of the unemployed, unemployment does not seem to be harmful and selection effects of ill individuals into unemployment are likely to contribute to the observed overall correlation between poor health and unemployment.

Therefore, venture capital through financing and providing value added services is considered to be an effective tool in increasing regions innovation capacity, fostering economic growth as well as job creation. Thus, financing such promising young ventures, especially those with technological background, is encouraged in many countries through various Governments' initiatives. A wide range of research explores public programmes in enhancing venture capital markets development in various countries either through direct (when Government invest directly in fund) or indirect (for instance, tax relief, etc.) measures. Therefore the present paper focuses on the direct Government intervention in venture capital market development, through investing in venture capital funds (as the co-investor or limited partner) in order to facilitate SMEs through financing its early stage of development. Venture capital funds, pooled by Governments' sources, private and institutional investors, aiming to boost investments in early stage innovative companies, are considered as hybrid venture capital funds in this paper. The article deals with the development of hybrid venture capital funds in Lithuania, which were forced by the European Union (EU) initiative Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) seeking to increase access to finance the development of SMEs through facilitation of venture capital markets development in various EU regions. There is lack of research focusing on the factors for efficient public policy intervention in the developing hybrid venture capital funds in order to facilitate early stage SMEs. Thus, the problem of the paper covers the question: what are the motives, factors and present state of development of hybrid venture capital funds in Lithuania. The present paper will explore the Government's initiative in Lithuania in terms of JEREMIE initiative. Therefore the paper aims to contribute to research dealing with hybrid venture capital funds' role in boosting regional economies through the financing the SMEs in their early stage of development. The paper finds that Lithuanian venture capital market is in its infant stage, and the Governments' initiative towards creation hybrid venture capital funds definitely will increase the investments in SMEs. Moreover, supply-side, demand-side and macroeconomic factors should be taken into account in the venture capital markets development. And still cautious actions should be set along with the public initiative in order to overcome the negative aspects of venture capital investments, such as lack of transparency, money laundering, etc.","[Snieska, Vytautas; Venckuviene, Vitalija] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Snieska, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55-506, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vytautas.snieska@ktu.lt; vitalija.venckuviene@stud.ktu.lt,"Snieska, Vytautas/S-2053-2017","Snieska, Vytautas/0000-0001-8777-273X",,,,,46,11,11,3,37,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In the presence of capital market constraints affecting workers, defined-benefit pensions bias the economy towards risk-free production. Leveraging the risky technology relaxes the constraints and results in more risky production and a fall in the aggregate risk premium. This effect holds with risky debt and low pension shortfall risk but breaks down with high pension shortfall risk. A key prediction is that as Lazear contracts become less common, risky production will increase and the aggregate risk premium will fall.","London Sch Econ, London WC2 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Webb, DC (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London WC2 2AE, England.",d.c.webb@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

First, temporary disequilibria and capital flows must be incorporated into the balance-of-payments-constrained growth models. Second, the role of relative prices must be made explicit, since it can be relevant even in an external constraint framework. This study is aimed at developing a model that incorporates both possibilities: temporary external disequilibria and the impact of relative prices.

We focus on the role of direct externalities caused by the P2P file-sharing technology rather than the indirect consumption externalities studied previously in the literature. In our model the market structure is endogenous and we characterize three possible scenarios where the firm uses monopoly pricing, network-deterring pricing, and network-accommodating pricing, respectively. We make a full comparative-static analysis of prices, quantities, profits, consumer surplus and total surplus for each of the scenarios as well as a comparison across scenarios. We show that in the case of network-accommodating pricing, the firm sets a higher price when facing a lower generic cost factor of downloading. Furthermore, in all scenarios, profits for the firm unambiguously decrease when the generic cost factor of downloading declines; total welfare unambiguously increases, however, a result that has implications for intellectual property rights enforcement policy.

Households in financial sectors receive money transfers from the central bank and have access to the bond market, while others outside financial sectors do not receive money transfers and have no access to the bond market. Also, a shock that causes households to relocate between financial sectors leads to more consumption expenditure for both types of households. This goods market effect then causes a money injection to diffuse through the economy over time, generating persistent liquidity effects even when the money growth shock is transitory. This is empirically important because persistent liquidity effects have been observed in many countries with a relatively low persistence of money growth.","[Lee, Manjong] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Young Sik] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Kim, Young Sik] Seoul Natl Univ, SIREF, Seoul 151, South Korea",Korea University; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, M (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",Kimy@snu.ac.kr; manjong@korea.ac.kr,"Kim, Young-Sik/AFC-8873-2022","Kim, Young-Sik/0000-0003-4114-4935",,,,,20,0,0,0,10,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

This paper aims to assess the empirical importance of global output in determining domestic inflation rates by estimating a structural model for a sample of G-7 economies. The model can capture the potential effects of global output fluctuations on both the aggregate supply and the aggregate demand relations in the economy and it is estimated using full-information Bayesian methods. The empirical results reveal a significant effect of global output on aggregate demand in most countries. Through this channel, global economic conditions can indirectly affect inflation. The results, instead, do not seem to provide evidence in favor of altering domestic Phillips curves to include global slack as an additional driving variable for inflation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A comparative assessment foregrounds the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches. Kaldor inappropriately clubbed together several very different types of scale economies and failed to explain the dispersion of manufacturing activities in a satisfactory way. NEG sidesteps distributional issues, makes questionable predictions, analyses development and structural change as movements between static equilibria and ignores or caricatures history. Some seemingly fundamental methodological differences, involving Kaldor's dynamic perspective and his disdain for equilibrium analysis based on optimising 'microfoundations', are not irreconcilable in light of his later writings and recent extensions of NEG.","Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, Delhi 110007, India",Delhi School of Economics; University of Delhi,"Bhattacharjea, A (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, Delhi 110007, India.",aditya@econdse.org,,,,,,,40,15,16,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

There are four major benchmarks in the international oil market, namely West Texas Intermediate (USA), Brent (North Sea), Dubai/Oman (Middle East), and Tapis (Asia-Pacific), which are likely to be highly correlated. This paper analyses the volatility spillover and asymmetric effects across and within the four markets, using three multivariate GARCH models, namely the constant conditional correlation (CCC), vector ARMA-GARCH (VARMA-GARCH) and vector ARMA-asymmetric GARCH (VARMA-AGARCH) models. A rolling window approach is used to forecast the 1-day ahead conditional correlations. The paper presents evidence of volatility spillovers and asymmetric effects on the conditional variances for most pairs of series. In addition, the forecast conditional correlations between pairs of crude oil returns have both positive and negative trends. Moreover, the optimal hedge ratios and optimal portfolio weights of crude oil across different assets and market portfolios are evaluated in order to provide important policy implications for risk management in crude oil markets.

Two main approaches can be distinguished: one in which the object of interest is some index of income inequality or poverty, the other based on notions of stochastic dominance. From the statistical point of view, many techniques are common to both approaches, although of course some are specific to one of them. I assume throughout that inference about population quantities is to be based on a sample or samples, and, formally, all randomness is due to that of the sampling process. Inference can be either asymptotic or bootstrap based. In principle, the bootstrap is an ideal tool, since in this paper I ignore issues of complex sampling schemes and suppose that observations are IID. However, both bootstrap inference and, to a considerably greater extent, asymptotic inference can fall foul of difficulties associated with the heavy right-hand tails observed with many income distributions. I mention some recent attempts to circumvent these difficulties.Ce memoire tente de fournir une vue synthetique des diverses techniques disponibles pour faire des inferences a partir des repartitions de revenus. On peut distinguer deux approches principales: l'une dans laquelle l'objet vise est un indice d'inegalite de revenus ou de pauvrete; l'autre est construite sur des notions de dominance stochastique. D'un point de vue statistique, plusieurs techniques sont utilisees par les deux approches, mais certaines techniques sont specifiques a l'une ou a l'autre approche. L'auteur postule que l'inference a propos de quantites demographiques est fondee sur un echantillon ou des echantillons, et que formellement tout le caractere aleatoire est attribuable au processus d'echantillonnage. L'inference est soit asymptotique, soit derivee par des technique de bootstrap. En principe, la seconde facon de proceder est un outil ideal, puisque dans ce memoire l'auteur ignore les problemes de procedures d'echantillonnage complexes et presume que les observations sont IDD. Cependant, la seconde facon de proceder, et encore plus la premiere, peuvent rencontrer des difficultes associees au fait que l'on observe des queues de distribution epaisses vers la droite dans plusieurs profils de repartition des revenus.

The equilibrium point of the growth-cycle model is the same as the steady state of the Solow-Swan growth model. Unlike in the Solow-Swan growth model, the representative household in the growth-cycle model, however, adaptively estimates his/her average income and determines his/her consumption in proportion to average income. We prove that if the steady state is unstable, any non-equilibrium path converges to a limit cycle. However, even if the steady state is stable, growth cycles can emerge. In fact, we prove that the growth-cycle model generates corridor stability. As a result, we prove that there exists an unstable cyclic path such that any path in the interior of the cyclic path converges to the steady state and any path in the exterior of the cyclic path tends toward a limit cycle (growth cycle). We also prove that a high economic growth rate is not compatible with a stable economy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Several solution concepts have been proposed to extend the core to all roommate markets (including those with an empty core).

Existing literature usually ascribes the labor share decline in developed countries to biased technological progress. However, our investigation shows that China's case is different. Using a simultaneous equation model estimated with three-stage least squares, we find that FDI, levels of economic development and privatization have negative effects on the labor share. The negative influence of FIN on labor share results from regional competition for FDI, which weakens labor forces bargaining power. A U-shoped relationship exists between labor share and the level of economic development, and China is now on the declining part of the curve. The negative effects of privatization on the labor share stem from, the elimination of the so-called wage costs eroding profit situation and the positive supply shock on the labor market.","[Zhang, Jun] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Luo, Changyuan] Fudan Univ, Ctr European Studies, Inst World Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",chyluo@fudan.edu.cn; junzh_2000@fudan.edu,,,,,,,37,20,22,8,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2010,18.0,6,,,,,1,18,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01217.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,681MK,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284319600001,0

I then consider the implications of allowing the government to trade capital.","[Farhi, Emmanuel] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Farhi, Emmanuel] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Harvard University; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Farhi, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,22,16,21,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

All the policy coefficients, the target levels of inflation and the budget deficit, the firms' frequency of price setting, and the standard deviations of the structural shocks are allowed to depend on political regimes: a preelection versus postelection regime, a regime that depends on whether the president (or the Fed chairman) is a Democrat or a Republican, and a regime under which the president and the Fed chairman share party affiliation in preelection quarters or not. The results provide evidence that several coefficients are influenced by political variables. The best-fitting specification, in fact, is one that allows coefficients to vary according to a regime that depends on whether the economy is in the few quarters before a presidential election or not. Monetary policy becomes considerably more inertial before elections and fiscal policy deviations from a simple rule are more common. There is some evidence that policies become more expansionary before elections, but this evidence disappears for monetary policy in the post-1985 sample.

Considering SVAR models in which either the interest rate is predetermined for money or money and the interest rate are simultaneously determined, two DSGE models are estimated by minimum distance estimation. The estimation results reveal that real balance effects are necessary to replicate the high persistence implied by the simultaneity assumption. In addition, the estimated monetary policy rule is sensitive to the identification scheme. This suggests that the way money is introduced in the identification scheme is not neutral for the estimation of DSGE models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We distinguish between early state of the art search conducted before R&D investment, and novelty search conducted right before applying for a patent. We identify conditions in which innovators have no incentive to search for prior art. Search intensity increases with R&D cost, the examiners' expected search effort, and with patenting fees.

In the recent crisis the Fed under Bernanke had well learned the lesson from the banking panics of the 1930s of conducting expansionary monetary policy to meet demands for liquidity. However, unlike in the 1930s, the deeper problem of the recent crisis was not illiquidity but insolvency and especially the fear of insolvency of counterparties.

On the basis of some studies in developed countries, critics have complained that a fuel tax would be regressive. This paper uses data from a representative household survey covering more than 124 thousand Indian households to examine this claim. It finds that a fuel tax would be progressive as would a carbon tax. Using an input-output approach, it is found that the progressivity results holds good even when one considers indirect consumption of fuel through its use as an intermediate input. Sensitivity checks allowing for differing price elasticities of demand between rich and poor confirm this result for most of fuels. A tax on kerosene is the only fuel tax that is regressive in all situations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We employ the model to investigate the properties of macroeconomic dynamics and the impact of public polices on supply, demand and the fundamentals of the economy. We find profound complementarities between factors influencing aggregate demand and drivers of technological change that affect both short-run fluctuations and long-term growth patterns. From a normative point of view, simulations show a corresponding complementarity between Keynesian and Schumpeterian policies in sustaining long-run growth paths characterized by milder fluctuations and relatively lower unemployment levels. The matching or mismatching between innovative exploration of new technologies and the conditions of demand generation appear to suggest the presence of two distinct regimes of growth (or absence thereof) characterized by different short-run fluctuations and unemployment levels.

Marcus - Culture, agency costs, and dividends This paper presents a culturally rooted agency explanation for differences in dividend payout policies around the world. We conjecture that the social normative nature of culture influences the character of agency relations and determines the acceptance and legitimacy of different dividend payout strategies across different countries. By linking dividends to cultural differences across 5797 firms in 41 countries, our analysis shows that high individualism, low power distance, and low uncertainty avoidance are significantly associated with higher dividend payouts. A comprehensive set of robustness tests in which we control for legal institutions, share repurchases, corporate debt ratios, and ownership structures confirms that culture is a relevant factor when analyzing dividend distributions. Our results further show that legal institutions and culture as a social institution have complementary effects on dividend payouts. Overall, our finding that culture matters suggests important implications for a wide range of agency-based economic and capital market phenomena.

Charnes et al. (1978) advocated Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a valuable mathematical programming technique, which is used to measure the technical, pure and scale efficiencies of decision making units. The general form of DEA is the CCR model that depends on the assumption of constant returns to scale. Subsequently, Banker et al. (1984) developed an alternative DEA model which includes a variable returns to scale approach. The aim of this study is to measure and compare the financial efficiencies of Turkish securities and pension funds in the 2006-2007 period. In this respect, 36 securities mutual funds (SMFs) and 41 pension mutual funds (PMFs) have been evaluated comparatively according to classical portfolio performance measures and DEA models. Results from performance indices and DEA models reveal that PMFs have higher portfolio performances and financial efficiencies than SMFs in the 2006-2007 period. However, SMFs and PMFs have shown considerable increases in efficiency in the 2006-2007 period according to CCR and BCC models. Of the 77 funds studied, 23 funds in 2007 and 20 funds in 2006 demonstrated scale efficiency. Furthermore, the input ratios should be considerably improved for 2006 and 2007. But, mostly the output values of the funds were found to have remained unchanged in the case of PMFs and SMFs in 2007. The output ratios for 2006 should be considerably improved, especially in the case of SMFs. Finally, the DEA method is evaluated as a substantial quantitative tool for investors in analysing the financial efficiencies of funds in the capital markets.","Ankara Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Dept Management, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Ankara University,"Gokgoz, F (通讯作者)，Ankara Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Dept Management, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",fgokgoz@politics.ankara.edu.tr,"GOKGOZ, FAZIL/D-3095-2018","GOKGOZ, FAZIL/0000-0002-9228-7699",,,,,32,15,15,0,35,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

It is shown that an increase in the number of firms in the producer services sector increases wage inequality in the short run even if the income shares of capital in the industrial and agricultural sectors were identical. A decrease in the services sector's fixed cost decreases wage inequality in the short run if the income share of capital in the agricultural sector is relatively large. Owing to the presence of external economies, a decrease in the services sector's fixed cost increases wage inequality in the long run. A decrease in import duty on the agricultural good increases wage inequality in the short as well as the long run but its effect in the long run is stronger due to the presence of external economies in the industrial sector.","[Anwar, Sajid] Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Business, Maroochydore, Qld 4556, Australia; [Anwar, Sajid] Univ S Australia, IGSB, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast; University of South Australia,"Anwar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Business, Maroochydore, Qld 4556, Australia.",sanwar@usc.edu.au,"Anwar, Sajid/F-4401-2013; Anwar, Sajid/JBJ-1127-2023","Anwar, Sajid/0000-0001-9087-1309;",,,,,31,18,20,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

If countries cooperatively determine their environmental policies, autarky and free trade in the absence of trade costs generate the same optimal solution. By contrast, if environmental policies are determined noncooperatively, the effects of trade on global pollution and welfare are ambiguous because policy games can result in multiple equilibria. Although trade increases both the lower and upper bounds of the pollution stock, whether trade expands the range of possible steady-state pollution levels is ambiguous. The analysis then extends to consider trade costs.","Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Int Cultural Studies, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808576, Japan",Tohoku University,"Yanase, A (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Int Cultural Studies, Aoba Ku, 41 Kawauchi, Sendai, Miyagi 9808576, Japan.",yanase@intcul.tohoku.ac.jp,,,,,,,19,17,17,1,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Important innovations include considering a wide set of historical, geographical and government determinants of corruption and examining some of the previously considered determinants at a finer level of detail. Two key questions addressed are: What are the effects of the size and scope of government on the incidence of corruption across countries? How important are historical and geographic influences in affecting corruption? Overall, the answer to the first question is that government does matter in important ways in its impact on corruption. Both the size and scope of government matter. Regarding the second question, the historical inertia of institutions that induce corruption persists, as do rent-seeking opportunities in new countries. Some geographic factors, on the other hand, can mitigate corruption. Policy implications are discussed.

In particular, we prove that it can match the conditional and unconditional mean and variance, and the first-order autocorrelation of any stationary AR(1) process. These properties make the Rouwenhorst method more reliable than others in approximating highly persistent processes and generating accurate model solutions. To illustrate this, we compare the performances of the Rouwenhorst method and four others in solving the stochastic growth model and an income fluctuation problem. We find that (i) the choice of approximation method can have a large impact on the computed model solutions, and (ii) the Rouwenhorst method is more robust than others with respect to variation in the persistence of the process, the number of points used in the discrete approximation and the procedure used to generate model statistics.

We empirically analyse the determinants of incomplete pass-through in the coffee industry. The observed pass-through in this industry replicates key features of pass-through documented in aggregate data: prices respond sluggishly and incompletely to changes in costs. We use microdata on sales and prices to uncover the role of markup adjustment, local costs and barriers to price adjustment in determining incomplete pass-through using a structural oligopoly model that nests all three potential factors. The implied pricing model explains the main dynamic features of short and long-run pass-through. Local costs reduce long-run pass-through (after six quarters) by 59% relative to a Constant Elasticity of Substitution benchmark. Markup adjustment reduces pass-through by an additional 33%, where the extent of markup adjustment depends on the estimated super-elasticity of demand. The estimated menu costs are small (0.23% of revenue) and have a negligible effect on long-run pass-through but are quantitatively successful in explaining the delayed response of prices to costs. We find that delayed pass-through in the coffee industry occurs almost entirely at the wholesale rather than the retail level.","[Nakamura, Emi] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zerom, Dawit] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA",Columbia University; California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Nakamura, E (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,69,179,207,1,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The simple model predicts a negative effect of HP on the number of children for a representative household not only through the income effect but also through the compensated substitution effect. The prediction is confirmed by a cointegration analysis applied to the annual data at the aggregate level covering the period from 1971 to 2005 in Hong Kong. It is found that a 1% increase in HP is significantly related to a 0.45% decrease in total fertility rates (TFRs), which is robust in sensitivity tests with an alternative model specification and alternative measures of TFRs. This implies that high HP inflation can account for about 65% of the fertility decrease in Hong Kong in the past four decades.

When there are private endowments, the main requirement is individual rationality; however, the eating algorithm fails to deliver this property. Our contribution is the natural generalization of the eating algorithm for this general class of problems. The family of this generalized eating algorithm characterizes the set of individually rational and ordinally efficient random assignments. A special solution in this family, the individually rational probabilistic serial (PS(IR)), also achieves a new fairness axiom, no justified-envy. However, it is not immune to strategic manipulation.

Discount rates declined over time but less so than previously observed under the assumption of linear utility. For approximately 40% of our subjects constant discounting provided the best fit. The remaining 60% were most consistent with Harvey's (1986) power discounting. Our data provide little support for the popular quasi-hyperbolic model, which is widely used in economics today.

Using multivariate cointegration techniques, we find that per capita government spending, per capita income, the tax share and the wage rate are cointegrated, a result that supports the notion that government spending is associated not only with per capita income and the true cost of government service provision as given by the wage rate but also with the fiscal illusion caused by budget deficits. We also find evidence that per capita government spending was positively affected by external shocks.

The Viking age is interesting because throughout the time period, the scale of conflict increased-small scale raiding behaviour eventually evolved into large scale clashes between armies. With this observation in mind, we present a theoretical model describing the incentives both the defending population and the invading population had to agglomerate into larger groups to better defend against attacks, and engage in attacks, respectively.

We investigate this link for the US, the UK, and Sweden, using multivariate time series analysis that explicitly allows for feedback effects between wealth inequality and real interest rates. Our estimates yield that, over the course of the twentieth century, decreases in wealth inequality led to significant declines in real interest rates. Our results therefore point to the importance of capital market imperfections that arise from moral hazard. They put to question the empirical relevance of a negative interest rate effect of inequality that may arise in variants of these models with high inequality, heterogeneous agents or adverse selection.","[Gruener, Hans Peter] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Brueckner, Markus] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Gerling, Kerstin] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Gruener, Hans Peter] CEPR, London, England",University of Mannheim; Pompeu Fabra University; International Monetary Fund; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Grüner, HP (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7 3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",,,,,,,,54,7,8,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

We elaborate it by using a fitted production function for the construction of TFP and by decomposing TFP into a scale effect, a technical change effect and an efficiency effect for total food processing and its selected branches. The results suggest that despite more than one decade of transition, serious adjustment problems exist, including problems on the capital market. Furthermore, contrary to the large differences among firms in the whole sample, the various sectors are rather homogeneous. TFP shows that although individual sectors have a few frontrunners, the majority of companies perform quite poorly. The scale effect is relatively small in food processing. Technical change has contributed positively to TFP in recent years, and the efficiency effect varies rather strongly. Whereas scale effect and technical change have a similar pattern across industries, the efficiency effect differs significantly. There is also some indication that the efficiency effect is affected by different sources. Finally, in addition to systemic effects, industry developments are characterized by idiosyncratic factors, especially in the Dairy industry.","[Cechura, Lukas] Czech Univ Live Sci, Dept Agr Econ, CZ-16521 Prague 6, Czech Republic; [Hockmann, Heinrich] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Germany",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Cechura, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Live Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Kamycka 129, CZ-16521 Prague 6, Czech Republic.",cechura@pef.czu.cz; hockmann@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Cechura, Lukas/H-6694-2018","Cechura, Lukas/0000-0003-2727-1874",,,,,12,15,15,0,11,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The study highlights differences in inflation formation and shows that the NKPC provides a reasonable description of the inflation process only for the coastal provinces.

We re-examine the evidence using the vector autoregressive framework and likelihood based methods, paying particular attention to the stationary and nonstationary, and possibly cointegrated, nature of variables involved. Our results show that the exact as well as the inexact form of the hybrid NKPC are clearly at odds with the European data. On the other hand, Gall and Gertler (1999) finding that the inexact hybrid NKPC is a good first approximation to the US inflation dynamics seems less at odds with the data. However, the assumption of the model that the stochastic term forms a sequence of innovations may be problematic as we find indication of autocorrelation in the estimated residuals. The exact form of the hybrid NKPC is firmly rejected by the US data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We apply a traditional industrial organisation framework to model the behaviour of this industry. This tells us that an important factor determining the equilibrium price and hence, the level of non-compliance, is the convexity of the demand schedule. We show that in this context, this convexity is affected by the distribution of pre-tax income, the progressivity of the tax-schedule and the way in which monitoring and penalties vary with income. It is shown that lower pre-tax income inequality as well as a less progressive tax code may cause more tax minimisation activities. Therefore, the frequently advocated policy of reducing the highest tax rate may fail as a policy directed at improving tax discipline. One way of offsetting the possible harm to tax compliance from a less progressive tax could be an adjustment of the penalty and monitoring functions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Human capital is a private, stochastic state variable that drives the skill process of each individual. Building on the findings of the labor literature, we construct a tractable life-cycle model of human capital evolution with risky investment and stochastic depreciation. In this setting, we demonstrate the optimality of (a) a human capital premium, i.e., an excess return on human capital relative to physical capital, (b) a large intertemporal wedge early in the life-cycle, and (c) a non-zero intratemporal wedge even at the top of the skill distribution at all dates except the last date in the life-cycle. The main implication for the structure of optimal linear capital taxes is the necessity of deferred taxation of physical capital. The average marginal tax rate on physical capital held in every period is zero in present value. However, expected capital tax payments do not equal zero in every period. Necessarily, agents face negative expected capital tax payments early in the life-cycle and positive expected capital tax payments late in the life-cycle. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Besides the endogenous longevity which depends on the complimentarity of private and public health expenditures, the growth process is endogenized by allowing for a productive rule of government, expenditure on infrastructure. Following the huge existing literature, money is introduced by assuming that banks are obligated to hold a fraction of the deposits as cash reserve requirements. Given this framework, we show that multiple equilibria emerges, with the low-growth (high-growth) equilibrium being unstable (stable) and locally determinate (locally indeterminate). In addition, we show that, under certain conditions, endogenous fluctuations and even chaos could emerge around the high-growth equilibrium.","[Gupta, Rangan; Vermeulen, Cobus] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",Rangan.Gupta@up.ac.za; vermejc@unisa.ac.za,,"Vermeulen, Cobus/0000-0002-1385-1838",,,,,33,5,6,1,9,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

The paper investigates the determinants of representative voting and shows that Congress members are more likely to support trade liberalization if the President is a member of their own party. The estimation allows a prediction to be made of the likely House trade votes under alternative presidential election outcomes. The model predicts that the probability of NAFTA being approved would have been greatly reduced by a victory for President Bush (41) in the 1992 election.

By applying a cross-country and industry-specific approach, it is possible to control for unobserved heterogeneity at both country and industry levels. We also differentiate between intra and inter-industry trade and we try to assess the relative importance of foreign wages versus domestic productivity developments in an open environment. We find that trade is not an important driver of wages, since the wage response to trade is small. Moreover, in line with the Stolper-Samuelson reasoning, the overall wage impact is always positive if significant in central and eastern Europe, while in western Europe we often observe a negative response, particularly in resource-based industries. Nevertheless, increased trade reinforces the productivity-wage link and weakens the co-movement of wages in eastern Europe, while there is less evidence of a similar wage-disciplining effect of trade in the west.","[Woerz, Julia] Oesterre Natl Bank, Foreign Res Div, Vienna, Austria; European Cent Bank, EU Neighbouring Reg Div, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Wörz, J (通讯作者)，Oesterre Natl Bank, Foreign Res Div, Vienna, Austria.",eva-katalin.polgar@ecb.int; julia.woerz@oenb.at,,,,,,,57,6,7,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2010,37.0,2,,,SI,,127,163,,10.1007/s10663-010-9131-6,0.0,,,37,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V25OF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208486600003,0

With labor/leisure choice, and money introduced through a cash-in-advance (CIA) constraint on consumption expenditure, it is demonstrated that higher inflation reduces the steady state level of employment, investment, output and consumption. The country runs a current account surplus, despite the fall in output. Consistent with empirical evidence, durable consumption exhibits initial excess volatility. Numerical calibration shows that the steady state real effects of inflation are very significant in this model.","[Mansoorian, Arman] York Univ, Dept Econ, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Mohsin, Mohammed] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",York University - Canada; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Mansoorian, A (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Econ, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",arman@dept.econ.yorku.ca,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We identify a new source of central bank opacity, which refers to the lack of information about the central bank's preference for robustness in the sense of Hansen and Sargent. We find closed-form solutions for the robust control problem, analysing the impact of the lack of transparency about the central bank's preferences for robustness. We show that an increased transparency about the central bank's preference for robustness makes monetary policy respond less aggressively to cost-push shocks, thus reducing the inflation and output gap variability. As a consequence, inflation and output gap are less volatile than under central bank opacity about its preference for robustness.","[Qin, Li; Sidiropoulos, Moise; Spyromitros, Eleftherios] Univ Strasbourg, BETA Theme, Strasbourg, France; [Sidiropoulos, Moise] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Sidiropoulos, M (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",msidiro@econ.auth.gr,"Spyromitros, Eleftherios/AAK-6252-2021",,,,,,17,4,4,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

In response to the 1980s and early 1990s crisis, and the more recent mortgage market meltdown that began in the summer of 2007, the banking industry and regulations governing banks changed profoundly and rapidly with even more changes likely to take place. It is therefore important to delineate the nature of these changes, particularly in comparison to the pre-crisis character of the US banking system and regulatory environment. In particular, this article discusses the regulatory changes that have emerged in response to the decline in the role of banks in firms' external financing, and the rise in noninterest-generating activities; the blurring of distinctions between banks and other depository institutions, and between banking companies and other financial intermediaries; the growing complexity of banking organizations, both in a corporate hierarchy sense, and with respect to the range of activities in which they can engage; the more intense globalization of banking; and the subprime mortgage market meltdown that triggered a credit crunch and liquidity freeze that led to the worst recession in the USA since the Great Depression.

We intend to address this question. In developed countries, the fertility rate has declined since WWII. This may cause a slowdown in the growth of GDP in developed countries. However, important factors for the well-being of individuals are per capita variables, like per capita growth and per capita consumption. In turn, the rate of technological progress determines the growth rates of per capita variables. If the population size is increasing, the labour inputs for R&D activity increase, and thus speed up technological progress. As individuals do not take account of this positive effect when deciding on the number of their own children, the number of children may become smaller than the socially optimal number of children. However, an increase in the number of children reduces the assets any one child owns: that is, there is a capital dilution effect. This works in the opposite direction. We examine this issue using an endogenous growth model where the head of a dynastic family decides the number of children.","[Futagami, Koichi] Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan; [Hori, Takeo] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Osaka University; Hitotsubashi University,"Futagami, K (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan.",,,,,,,,7,2,2,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1352-4739,,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

Plant locations may not be uniquely determined. In particular, a small change in trade costs may reverse plant location.

Posner applies 'the principles of organization economics' to the study of diverse types of organizations. His study comparing the FBI to other types of police organization is important and compatible with the study of urban policing in American metropolitan areas. Many policy prescriptions are based on an inadequate understanding of the diversity of urban public good production functions and a lumping together of every type of police service. A brief review of research related to the concept of polycentricity as related to urban services in metropolitan areas is provided as a way of further illustrating Posner's concern that finer distinctions need to be made in the way scholars analyze organizational economics.","[Ostrom, Elinor] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Ostrom, Elinor] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Ostrom, E (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",ostrom@indiana.edu,,,,,,,21,7,8,1,31,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

But in so doing, they miss an important part of the story: a second research strand aimed at developing tools for inference that are robust to subsidiary modeling assumptions. My first aim in these remarks therefore is to highlight some key developments in this area. I then turn to Angrist and Pischke's call for adopting experiments and quasi-experiments in macroeconometrics; while sympathetic, I suspect the scope for such studies is limited.

Using the linear-quadratic approach described by Benigno and Woodford (2008), we derive a utility-based loss function that indicates that the goals of policymakers can be represented by the stabilization of inflation, output, employment, and labor-market tightness. We characterize the policy that is optimal from a timeless perspective. Complete inflation stabilization is optimal if the distortions caused by monopolistic competition and search externalities are eliminated. In cases where search externalities prevail, either in or out of the steady state, complete inflation stabilization is no longer optimal, and the optimal responses of inflation to aggregate shocks may depend on labor-market fundamentals.

This paper analyzes the role of on-the-job search in the propagation of monetary shocks in a sticky price model with labor market search frictions. Such frictions induce long-term employment relationships, such that the real marginal cost is determined by real wages and the cost of an employment relationship. On-the-job search opens up an extra channel of employment growth that dampens the response of these two components. Because real marginal cost rigidity induces small price adjustments, on-the-job search gives rise to a strong propagation of monetary shocks that increases output persistence. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the ability to build successful group reputations depends on group size with trust breaking down in larger groups. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from French firm-level data,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MULTINATIONAL FIRMS; LOCATION; INVESTMENT; EUROPE; CHINA,"This paper uses a large French firm-level data set to evaluate the determinants of location choices in services. In a first step, estimates for four broad services sectors are compared with the estimates for the manufacturing sector. Using a discrete choice model, we find that this framework does fairly well in explaining location choices in services and that the parameter estimates for services are close to the ones for manufacturing. We then investigate whether the similarity in estimated parameters is due to a complementarity between location choices in manufacturing and in services, in the sense that manufacturing location choices may cause the location of services. A particularly appropriate services sector, for this purpose is the business services sector, for which input-output linkages with the manufacturing sector are particularly strong. It is found that the downstream demand of French manufacturing firms has a positive effect on the location choice probabilities of French business services firms. This effect is robust.","[Schwellnus, Cyrille] OECD, Dept Econ, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),,benjamin.nefussi@dgtpe.fr; cyrille.schwellnus@oecd.org,,,,,,,17,24,26,0,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The protocols are a consensus model, where a supermajority is required for a policy change; an agenda-setting model, where the chairman controls the agenda; a dictator model, where the chairman has absolute power over the committee; and a simple majority model, where policy is determined by the median member. These protocols give preeminence to different aspects of the actual decision-making process and capture the observed heterogeneity in formal procedures across central banks. The models are estimated by maximum likelihood using interest rate decisions by the committees of five central banks, namely the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Swedish Riksbank, and the US. Federal Reserve. For all central banks, results indicate that the consensus model fits actual policy decisions better than the alternative models. This suggests that despite institutional differences, committees share unwritten rules and informal procedures that deliver observationally equivalent policy decisions.","[Riboni, Alessandro; Ruge-Murcia, Francisco J.] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Universite de Montreal,"Riboni, A (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",,,,,,,,74,56,56,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The integration between the models is carried out by calibrating the growth module, which incorporates energetic inputs (renewable and nonrenewable) in the production function, and implementing shocks by the Supply side (capital, labor, renewable and nonrenewable energy) in the input-output model. This allows us to verify the pattern of energy consumption for each sector in the input-output matrix. We apply this methodology to study the energy consumption of eleven economic sectors in Brazil, using data from the Brazilian National Accounts and Input-Output Matrix (IBGE) and the National Energy Report (BEN). We conduct experiments involving changes in technological progress growth rate, extraction and regeneration rates of both renewable and nonrenewable resources and population growth to analyze the impact of changes in the parameters of the model on the sectoral output growth rate and, consequently, on the consumption of energy in each economic sector.

The first method lrsnash is based on the known vertex enumeration program lrs, for lexicographic reverse search. It enumerates the vertices of only one best-response polytope, and the vertices of the complementary faces that correspond to these vertices (if they are not empty) in the other polytope. The second method is a modification of the known EEE algorithm, for enumeration of extreme equilibria. We also describe a second, as yet not implemented, variant that is space efficient.

We extend this analysis to consider the strength and timing of research incentives, the costs of implementation delay and the impact of anticipated future technologies on current carbon prices. We study a variety of issues related to the valuation of climate investments, including uncertainty as to the future timing and distribution of climate impacts and the appropriate social rate of discount for valuing policies. Under reasonable circumstances the insurance properties of climate investments may warrant unusually low discount rates. We use the same framework to argue that policy makers in developing countries will discount the expected returns from climate investments more heavily, because such investments have weaker insurance value in the developing world.","[Becker, Gary S.; Murphy, Kevin M.; Topel, Robert H.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Becker, Gary S.; Murphy, Kevin M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Becker, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",gbecker@uchicago.edu; kevin.murphy@chicagobooth.edu; robert.topel@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,16,17,18,0,24,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The results of the study suggest that Slovene managers are not aggressive initiative-takers but do not resist opportunities when they arise.

This would result in the effect of health being overestimated if health were treated as exogenous. The paper employs a simultaneous equation model to explore the relationship between health and labour force status, allowing for the endogeneity of health. In addition, the paper takes advantage of panel data to control for unobserved heterogeneity so that more efficient estimation results can be obtained than using cross-sectional data. The results confirm the finding in the literature that health has a positive and significant effect on labour force participation for both males and females. As for the reverse effect, it is found that labour force participation has a negative effect on male health but a positive effect on female health, implying that the justification hypothesis is rejected for males but not for females. The exogeneity hypothesis on the health variable is rejected for both samples based on a joint test. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The plans are inherently dynamic They evolve due to situational constraints and contextual factors, experience, inertia, or changing preferences. As a result, the chosen actions might be different from those initially planned. In this paper, we present the methodology to model the dynamics of choices using a two-layer decision hierarchy (choice of a plan and choice of action conditional on the plan) and its dynamics This framework, based on Hidden Markov Model principles, assumes that the plan at every time period depends on the plan at the previous time period and the actions taken in the previous time periods as well as other variables including the characteristics of the decision maker. The dynamics in the observed actions are explained by the dynamics in the underlying latent (unobserved) plans. The methodology is demonstrated by modelling the dynamics associated with the driving decisions as the drivers enter a freeway.

The paper provides a new explanation and emphasizes that it is neither technology nor trade alone but both that have contributed to the widening wage inequality. It argues, using a two-country occupational choice model, that any technological improvement in North results in a rise in the skilled-unskilled wage gap in North via an increase in the productivity of skilled labor followed by a rise in the same in South via trade or the Outsourcing activities of the northern firms. The extent of outsourcing or the number of northern firms that outsource jobs to South is endogenously determined in the model. The paper also analyzes some major economic impacts of such a technological upgradation in North on the southern economy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Main changes are related to the processes of external openness and internal modification of ownership structures and major manufacturing firms. The main output is a strong process of industrial growth that, moreover, is associated to a strong increasement of industrial employment. However, some of the structural traits of the previous industrial model were maintained for a long time. The most clear would be the diversity among domestic market oriented industries and exporting ones. This article also analyzes how, after the crisis of the late nineties, most of the manufacturing sectors, which were still oriented to the domestic market, developed important export competencies. The structural model outlined in the seventies would be culminated after this change. However, the overall transformation of the manufacturing model required more than 35 years.","[Coq Huelva, Daniel] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Rios Nunez, Sandra] Univ Los Lagos, Osorno, Chile",University of Sevilla; Universidad de Los Lagos,"Huelva, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",dcoq@us.es; sandra.rios@ulagos.cl,,,,,,,32,2,3,0,11,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Both demand-side and supply-side barriers contribute tot he lack of adoption of mobile payments. We contrast mobile payments at the retail point of sale in the U.S. with other countries' experiences and with examples of successful payment innovation in the U.S. Conditions that have facilitated some success in other countries and in other U.S. innovations are not present in the mobile payments market. On the demand side, consumers and merchants are well served by the current card system and face a low expected benefit-cost ratio, at least in the short run. On the supply side, low market concentration and strong competitive forces of banks and mobile carriers make coordination of standards difficult. Furthermore, mobile payments are characterized by a network effects problem: consumers will not demand them until they know that enough merchants accept them, and merchants will not implement the technology until a critical mass of consumers justifies the cost of doing so.

Three options are investigated: stay in the host country, go back to the origin country and adopt a mobile strategy, sharing time between the host and the origin country (defined as 'back and forth'). For this purpose, we analyse a cross section of non-French nationals aged above 45 who are not yet retired. The impacts of several potential determinants of such intentions are investigated, with particular focus on the effect of the actual location of the respondents' children. The estimation is conducted using a multinomial Logit model. Instrumental variable technique is used to address the issue of endogenous children's location with respect to parents' location intention. Results suggest that the immigrants prefer to return rather than stay in the host country when their children live in the country of origin. However, children's location does not seem to affect the 'back and forth' strategy with respect to staying in the host country.","[de Coulon, Augustin] Kings Coll London, Dept Management, London WC2R 2LS, England; [de Coulon, Augustin] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Wolff, Francois-Charles] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, F-52231 Nantes 3, France; [Wolff, Francois-Charles] CNAV, Paris, France; [Wolff, Francois-Charles] INED, Paris, France",University of London; King's College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Nantes Universite,"de Coulon, A (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Management, London WC2R 2LS, England.",a.de-coulon@lse.ac.uk,,"de Coulon, Augustin/0000-0003-4426-203X",,,,,30,20,25,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper tests various hypotheses and finds that standard portfolio allocation models and diversification motives are poor predictors of foreign holdings of U.S. liabilities. Instead, foreigners hold greater shares of their investment portfolios in the United States if they have less developed financial markets. The magnitude of this effect decreases with income per capita. Countries that trade more with the United States also have greater portfolio shares in U.S. equity and bond markets. These results support recent theoretical work on the role of financial development in sustaining global imbalances and have important implications for whether the United States can continue to attract sufficient financing from abroad without major changes in asset prices and returns, especially in bond markets.

When choosing which secondary school they wish their children to attend, parents will be aware of the school's performance in Key Stage 3, GCSE and A- level examinations. We suggest that GCSE examination results will be the measure of school performance that parental choice will be most closely correlated with. Therefore, secondary schools with good GCSE examination results will be oversubscribed in that more students will wish to attend these schools than there are places available. Schools will then have to develop mechanisms for rationing the available places - central to rationing strategies in English schools at the moment is geographical proximity of the family home to the school of choice. Parents will thus have a strong incentive to purchase houses in the catchment area of high performing schools. Our results suggest that this is the case, with high performing schools stimulating a price premium in local residential property markets of between 1% and 3% for each additional 10% point improvement in the pass rate in GCSE examinations.","[Glen, John; Nellis, Joseph G.] Cranfield Univ, Sch Management, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Cranfield University,"Glen, J (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Sch Management, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",John.glen@cranfield.ac.uk; J.g.nellis@cranfield.ac.uk,,"Glen, John/0000-0002-8529-4794",,,,,43,6,8,0,15,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2010,57.0,4,,,,,405,428,,10.2298/PAN1004405G,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,701IR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285812100002,0

We find a significantly lower degree of money accommodation in the 1979-1982 period, which hints at money targeting during that period rather than interest rate targeting. We identify the path of money demand and money supply shocks and comment on their effects on the dynamic behavior of money, interest rates, output and inflation: the monetary policy intermediate target seems not to be the key determinant of macro-dynamics. Our results allow us to offer comments on the implications for monetary policy of both the degree of money demand accommodation - thus, of the intermediate monetary policy target - and the evolution (reduction) of macroeconomic volatility between 1984 and 2007.

In our opinion, a synchronism between public and business management is a must in order to find proper solutions, especially in crisis time. On the other hand, there should be differences regarding the main components' importance and the attention paid to them. We consider that illustrative of a future development of integrated mechanisms is to analyze if there is convergence of opinions regarding the role of four main coordinates for the achievement of an effective management: (1) The mission of the institution; (2) The knowledge effects (competence/proficiency); (3) The desired change; (4) The managerial decision basis. The study focused on the six possible connections that can be established between these coordinates, the accumulated junction of the subjects' opinions pointing out the similarities and differences between the two studied groups (the public and the private environment). The work aims at building up a matrix of contingency and searching for some maximum or minimum zone within the matrix. The conclusion is that in the first instance importance is given to prognosis and ways of responsibility and meantime the diagnose-analysis and systems balancing basically are not taken into consideration.

We compare the results of an analysis of the program's participation rates using US Census data for the general population of Florida to the results of the exact same model using a dataset that includes only the population of Florida that is actually eligible for the program. We find that while generally signs of effects remain the same, they do not always remain the same; moreover, significance differs, and the marginal effects of various demographic and socio-economic factors on program participation rates vary greatly.

Since business is under jurisdiction of government's laws, business mission and polices, guidelines and other documents, these business restrictions should be implemented in a business supporting IS and effectively managed. A business rule approach is widely accepted in IS community as a way to express different types of business restrictions and constrain operation of components of an IS. Nowadays, there are number of methods and approaches to extract, define and implement business rules. However, there is no a commonly accepted standard for their modelling. In this paper an ontology-based method for business rules modelling and implementation in the software of IS is presented. It allows to automate the transformation of rules from ontology to the software level and to reduce the cost of rules implementation and likelihood of errors.

Choosing the correct discount rate has proved to be controversial and highly consequential. To clarify past analysis and guide future work, we decompose discounting along two dimensions. First, we distinguish discounting by individuals, an empirical matter that determines their behavior in models, and discounting by an outside evaluator, an ethical matter involving the choice of a social welfare function. Second, for each type of discounting, we distinguish it due to pure time preference from that attributable to curvature of the pertinent function: utility functions (of consumption) for individuals and the social welfare function (of utilities) for the evaluator. We apply our analysis to leading integrated assessment models used to evaluate climate policies. We find that past work often confounds different sources of discounting, and we offer suggestions for avoiding these difficulties. Finally, we relate the standard intergenerational framework that combines considerations of efficiency and distribution to more familiar modes of analysis that assess most policies in terms of efficiency, leaving distributive concerns to the tax and transfer system.","[Weisbach, David A.] Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Kaplow, Louis] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kaplow, Louis] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Weisbach, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Sch Law, 1111 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",meskridge@law.harvard.edu; moyer@uchicago.edu; d-weisbach@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,51,16,18,1,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Intuitively we would expect the degree of spatial concentration of activities to have a strong link with transport fuel consumption. The present paper addresses this theme by estimating a fuel demand model for urban areas to provide a direct estimate of the elasticity of demand with respect to urban density. Fuel demand per capita is decomposed into car stock per capita, fuel consumption per kilometre and annual distance driven per car per year. Urban density is found to affect fuel consumption, mostly through variations in the car stock and in the distances travelled, rather than through fuel consumption per kilometre.

A rule that has played a central role in the previous analysis of the problem is the so-called uniform rule. Thomson (1995b) proved that the uniform rule is the only rule satisfying Pareto optimality, no-envy, one-sided population-monotonicity, and replication-invariance. Replacing one-sided population-monotonicity by one-sided replacement-domination yields another characterization of the uniform rule (Thomson, 1997a). Until now, the independence of replication-invariance from the other properties in these characterizations was an open problem. In this note we prove this independence by means of a single example.","[Klaus, Bettina] Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Klaus, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",bettina.klaus@unil.ch,"Klaus, Bettina E/H-8223-2012","Klaus, Bettina/0000-0001-9140-4729",,,,,10,1,1,0,4,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The variance gamma model can be regarded as a subordinated (geometric) Brownian motion driven by a random time with gamma distribution. In the normal inverse Gaussian model, Brownian motion is driven by the inverse Gaussian distribution. Both of these models have four parameters, which need to be estimated. In the application part parameters for both models are estimated by means of a method of moments and a maximum likelihood method for five stock indices and five foreign exchange rates. Thereafter modeling quality of these estimated models is compared. Comparison is made on the basis of a log-likelihood function and errors of the basic descriptive statistics and quantile measures VaR a cVaR.

Signs of significant problems in the US economy first occurred in late 2006 and the second quarter of 2007 when home prices plummeted and defaults by subprime mortgage borrowers began to affect the mortgage-lending sector entirely, as well as other parts of the economy noticeably. These events sent equity markets, consumer confidence, and overall economic health lower. As. the US government debated over the rescue plan, the crisis spread worldwide. As we approached the end of 2009, the world financial system and the economies were still in crisis. firms paper examines the fiscal stimulus and countercyclical monetary policies in the US during the current financial tsunami and the economic downturn. It is fair to say that current recession is a combination of financial crisis in the banking system?: and economic downturn. Hence, there is a requirement for implementation of both fiscal stimulus and countercyclical monetary policy to stimulate the economy.","[Masud, Omar] Univ E London, Sch Business, London E16 2RD, England; [Aktan, Bora] Yasar Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Bus Admin, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey",University of East London; Yasar University,"Masud, O (通讯作者)，Univ E London, Sch Business, Docklands Campus,Univ Way, London E16 2RD, England.",,"Aktan, Bora/S-6019-2017","Aktan, Bora/0000-0002-1334-3542",,,,,32,1,1,1,6,NATIONAL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

This is possible because in 1086, William the Conqueror carried out a comprehensive survey (the Domesday Survey) of lands he invaded 20 years earlier. The survey provides high-quality data on the inputs and outputs of most manors in England. A previous analysis of the data for Essex estates indicated that the average efficiency of the Domesday agricultural economy was comparable to, if not higher than that for more modern economies, that some tenants-in-chief displayed significantly more entrepreneurial flair than others, and that the geographical location, the size of the estate and the arable/livestock mix all significantly affected estate efficiency. In this article, analysis of a second Domesday county, Wiltshire, confirms the general results for Essex, but indicates some differences in the factors affecting estate efficiency.","[McDonald, John] Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Business Sch, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"McDonald, J (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Business Sch, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",john.mcdonald@flinders.edu.au,,,,,,,31,7,7,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

J,"Mele, M",,,,"Mele, Marco",,,A TIME SERIES APPROACH ON THE CHINESE EXCHANGE RATE REGIME,ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Exchange Rate; China; Econometric ARMA model,,"This paper deals with the issue of the exchange rate regime that China has established since 2005, when it announced a move away from the US dollar peg. In fact, from that date, the RMB was managed with reference to a basket of currencies rather than being pegged to the dollar; the exchange rate, therefore, became more flexible. But, though in the presence of basket peg, early econometric analysis (Shan-2005, Frankel & Wei-2006, Ogawa-2006, Yamazaky-2006) found that the assigned basket gave overwhelming weight to the dollar, and that the degree of flexibility had hardly increased at all. Almost all those studies used a technique introduced by Frankel in 1994 to estimate the weights in a currency basket: on one side regressed changes in the value of the local currency, in this case the RMB, while on the other one changes in the values of the dollar, the euro, the yen and other currencies that may be in the basket. Though there are numerous econometric techniques for estimating the exchange rate system, the technique proposed by Frankel is still the most widely used. However, in our opinion, this model has an error of autocorrelation among the variables, a factor that could lead the analysis to different results. Therefore, this work proposes a study on the Chinese exchange rate regime through an alternative econometric technique.","San Pio V Univ Rome, Rome, Italy",,"Mele, M (通讯作者)，San Pio V Univ Rome, Rome, Italy.",marco.mele@luspio.it,,"Mele, Marco/0000-0002-1477-1071",,,,,12,4,4,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

A simple theoretical model which considers the financing decision of a multinational company is used to obtain empirical implications. The empirical analysis, based on German inbound investment data from 1996 to 2004, confirms a significant impact of tax-rate differentials on the use of inter-company debt. The effectiveness of the German thin-capitalization rule is tested by using legal amendments as natural experiments. The results suggest that thin-capitalization rules induce significantly lower internal borrowing. Hence, tax planning via internal finance is effectively limited by thin-capitalization rules.","[Overesch, Michael] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68163 Mannheim, Germany; [Wamser, Georg] Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Ifo Institut,"Overesch, M (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L 7,1, D-68163 Mannheim, Germany.",overesch@zew.de,"Overesch, Michael/AAZ-6573-2021","Overesch, Michael/0000-0002-1531-0357",,,,,18,42,47,2,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Reliability and speed are important service characteristics: the representative household is willing to pay $20 per month for more reliable service; $45 for an improvement in speed from slow to fast; and $48 for an improvement in speed from slow to very fast. A representative household would be willing to pay $79 per month for a fast, reliable Internet service. Internet valuations increase with experience, and there has been an estimated two- to three-fold increase in consumer surplus per household between 2003 and 2010. If experience causes increased valuation, targeted programs that educate households about the benefits from broadband, expose households to the broadband experience and/or directly support the initial take-up of broadband have potential to increase overall penetration in the United States.","[Rosston, Gregory L.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Savage, Scott J.; Waldman, Donald M.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Stanford University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Rosston, GL (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",grosston@stanford.edu; scott.savage@colorado.edu; waldman@colorado.edu,,"Rosston, Gregory/0000-0002-2092-1881",,,,,37,44,50,1,11,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Because of the complexity and the enormous amount of relevant data, the decision makers need effective support for their decisions. The use of a knowledge-based approach is a solution for reducing this complexity. Nowadays the strategic and operational decisions are facing challenges of economic competition on a global perspective and realization of sustainable development that are the result of a new thinking and recognition of a competitive positioning, ecological and social consequences. Sustainable development is increasingly being seen as a major challenge in global terms. New information and communication systems build the bridge to on-line and just-in-time decision-making within supply chains and production and logistics networks. Operational Research has yet to be fully utilised in this area. To date, where it has been mostly used, it tends to deal with the relationships between environmental management and product supply chain and also focuses on the social dimension.

The core model is shown to be too restrictive to provide a good representation of the Italian economy. Broadening the view of the way in which firms take account of the costs of changing the labor force and investment achieves a more satisfactory representation of the dynamics of the productive sector of the economy while still retaining the spirit of the core model. Institutional or market structures, regulations, and other factors are incorporated in the system through modifications to the production function, the demand and supply functions for labor. A full-information, Gaussian estimator of a differential equation system is used throughout. As the constraints on the system arise from both macro-economic theory and the institutional structure of the Italian economy, this estimator provides a much more stringent test of all the hypotheses embedded in the model than many other studies. The model provides a foundation for a study of the extent to which, over time, changes in regulations or market structure might allow firms to reallocate resources to take better advantage of the skills available in the labor force within the context of a segmented labor market with varying efficiencies. The model lends itself to a policy analysis of the effects of these changes on the workings of the labor market as the ease with which firms may change their labor force determine the dynamics of the interaction between firms and labor and the path over time of labor and capital themselves.","[Saltari, Enrico; Wymer, Clifford R.] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, Rome, Italy; [Travaglini, Giuseppe] Univ Urbino, Dep Econ & Quantitat Meth, Via Saffi 42, I-61029 Urbino, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Urbino,"Saltari, E (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, Rome, Italy.",Enrico.Saltari@uniroma1.it; giuseppe.travaglini@uniurb.it; wymer@mail.com,"Travaglini, Giuseppe/HPC-2911-2023","Travaglini, Giuseppe/0000-0003-1943-096X",,,,,6,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,,CONTRIB ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,113,+,,10.1007/978-3-7908-2131-4_7,0.0,,,2,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNH32,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274558200007,0

J,"Stunguriene, S",,,,"Stunguriene, Stanislava",,,Optimization of the Ratio of the Bank Payment Cards Price and Quality,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,product price; quality costs; payment cards; optimization; limits of the optimal ratio,,"The present paper expands the price and quality ratio concept in respect of the consumer and producer expectation gap having generalized the findings and conclusions of the research conducted during past years. It has been noticed that when placing a new product on the market, most often the expectation gap is specifically wide and tends to considerably decrease in the course of time. For the purpose of the present research paper the author has chosen an unconventional product - the bank payment cards whose quality is defined in terms of the number of the elements embedded in the card, and the quality level of each element has been scored in points. From the consumer's point of view the price of a card corresponds to its quality although this assumption has not been confirmed by any actual data available. The sharp increase in the number and volumes of payment operations using payment cards is a direct representation of the need by the customers to use payment cards on a wider scale. In Lithuania this increase in the demand for payment cards is growing, so research in the area of price and quality of the payment card is topical. A number of empirical surveys have shown that the quality of the product may be efficiently enhanced without increasing its price, and, by applying optimization methods, even reducing its price. The increase or decrease in the price shall be interpreted as the product quality enhancement costs. The model developed to determine the product price-quality ratio is illustrated on the basis of the MasterCard payment card while identifying the specific limits of the costs incurred in relation to quality enhancement. The present paper is dedicated to the survey of the cards that after having attained their highest quality point acquires the same quality, as no further enhancement of the quality is possible in respect of such cards. The highest quality in respect of each individual card is related to different costs. Following a logical path of thinking, the price and quality ratio could be computed by working out an optimization problem, since, as a rule, it is the costs, rather than the quality that have to be limited. Most elements of the payment cards are not assigned the highest score which implies that any enhancement of their quality will require additional expenses the amount whereof shall be proportional to the quality sought. This, however, does not mean that quality costs in all cases. For instance, MasterCard issued by the bank in Lithuania currently costs LTL 25, and according to the calculations related to the highest quality of the card, it would cost LTL 24.75. This allows an assumption that without reducing the price of the card, the card may be considerably improved, since its initial quality was 0.90 points, and would result at 1.80 points when based on the calculations related to the highest quality. This is a double quality for a price LTL 0.25 less. This can be explained with reference to a high initial price of the Visa GOLD card, which only provides additional evidence that no significant investment is required in order to attain the highest quality. This conclusion, however, is valid only for the cards with high initial price, or the cards that contain just few elements requiring improvement. Any further increase in the costs is considered inexpedient in view of the absence of any quality enhancement reserve.

These studies are often conducted at a specific level of sector aggregation and the choice made to a large extent is dictated by economic and energy data availability. We investigate analytically the possible effects of sector aggregation on the study results. We conduct empirical studies using the data of China and Singapore where energy-related CO2 emissions embodied in their exports are estimated at different levels of sector aggregation. A finding from the studies is that levels around 40 sectors appear to be sufficient to capture the overall share of emissions embodied in a country's exports. Another finding is that in approximating the ideal situation the hybrid data treatment approach produces better results than the uniformly distributed data treatment approach.

Both areas of evaluation are assigned standard total scores different for senior assistant professors, associate professors, and professors. A partial evaluation of a member of academic staff in a specific area is determined as a multiple of the respective standard for his or her position. A linguistic fuzzy expert system is then used to aggregate both partial evaluations for pedagogical, and research and development areas of activities. The proposed model also takes into account the load of managerial activities for each member of academic staff (understood here as activities draining his or her time and thus reducing the performance in both areas of evaluation mentioned above). Another fuzzy expert system is used to adjust the evaluation according to the managerial activity load of a particular academic staff member.

Whereas modern studies of imperfect capital markets have greatly improved our understanding of capital market failures, their impact on macroeconomics has remained surprisingly limited. The macroeconomic consequences of saving-investment imbalances are still undeveloped in this literature. The most popular macroeconomic model to date - the so-called New Neoclassical Synthesis - dispenses with capital market imperfections altogether. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap. After an overview of the historical foundations and the current state of the macroeconomics of imperfect capital markets, the paper presents a competitive, flex-price model of saving-investment imbalances where deviations of the market interest rate from the Wicksellian natural rate generate (disequilibrium) business cycles. Then the model is extended to make the market interest rate endogenous and to allow preliminary considerations to be made about monetary policy and the control of the interest rate over the business cycle.","[Tamborini, Roberto] Univ Trent, Dept Econ, I-38100 Trento, Italy",University of Trento,,roberto.tamborini@economia.unitn.it,"Tamborini, Roberto/H-4183-2019",,,,,,65,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,,CONTRIB ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,137,166,,10.1007/978-3-7908-2131-4_8,0.0,,,30,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNH32,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274558200008,0

The partial identification approach to inference recognizes that this process should not result in a binary answer that consists of whether the parameter is point identified. Rather, given the data, the partial identification approach characterizes the informational content of various assumptions by providing a menu of estimates, each based on different sets of assumptions, some of which are-plausible and some of which are not. Of course, more assumptions beget more information, so stronger conclusions can be made at the expense of more assumptions. The partial identification approach advocates a more fluid view of identification and hence provides the empirical researcher with methods to help study the spectrum, of information that we can harness about a parameter of interest using a menu of assumptions. This approach links conclusions drawn from various empirical models to sets of assumptions made in a transparent way. It allows researchers to examine the informational content of their assumptions and their impacts on the inferences Made. Naturally, with finite sample sizes, this approach leads to statistical complications, as one needs to deal with characterizing sampling uncertainty in models that do not point identify a parameter. Therefore, new methods for inference are developed. These methods construct confidence sets for partially identified parameters, and confidence regions for sets of parameters, or identifiable sets.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Tamer, E (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",tamer@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,73,153,179,1,22,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4602-7,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Many previous studies insist that the Japanese experience of the 1990s supports this argument. However, many studies of small businesses are often insufficient since they depend on aggregate data, even though small businesses are likely to face difficult constraints in their activities when financial problems are severe. In this study, we use firm-level data on small businesses and investigate whether bank-dependent small businesses face severe constraints on their activities, which lowers performance. Our results differ from the findings of previous work in this area. First, we show that per the widely used TANKAN statistics, the focus of many existing studies, is misleading and that a majority of respondents in this survey (at least 71%) report no worsening in the lending attitude of financial institutions in the so-called credit crunch period of 1998-1999 (or even in the 2000-2001 period). Second, using detailed firm level panel data from the Credit Risk Database, we find no significant reductions in the loans for the majority of small businesses. Third, while we do find evidence that bank-dependent firms increased reliance on internal funds during the period of the credit crunch (1998-2001), we find no evidence that this negatively impacted firm performance (as reflected in firm growth and profitability measures).","Nihon Univ, Tokyo 102, Japan",Nihon University,"Tsuruta, D (通讯作者)，Nihon Univ, Tokyo 102, Japan.",tsuruta.daisuke@nihon-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,8,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Among these considerations is also quite a lively debate over when the Czech Republic to meet its commitment to take on entry into the European Union and which is linked to the performance of all the assumptions required for the adoption of a common European currency. From this discussion emerged two major questions: Is the Czech Republic is currently able to meet the criteria necessary for the adoption of a common European currency? And nominal convergence criteria are met well by existing member countries of the euro area?. The answer to these questions and looking for this essay, which focuses its attention, the desired range, only an analysis of the macroeconomic indicators that allow us to assess the degree of nominal convergence of the Czech economy to the euro-zone economy. Within the state coming to the conclusion that the Czech economy is currently in a position largely nominal convergence criteria met, and compared to the existing euro area countries, its position appears to be more than good. The conclusion also states that if the Czech Republic after 2016 to enter into farming, then in the years ahead, the Czech economy to go through quite a fierce process of change, linked at the reform of public finances in nominal and real convergence. At the same time it is necessary to say that this process is not currently linked only to the successful implementation of public finance reform, or approximation of the structure of the Czech economy with the euro area, but also with well-chosen economic policies which result in the elimination of the negative impact of the crisis on the real economy, the Czech economy.","[Tuleja, Pavel] Slezska Univ Opave, Obchodne Podnikatelska Fak Karvine, Katedra Ekon, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Tuleja, P (通讯作者)，Slezska Univ Opave, Obchodne Podnikatelska Fak Karvine, Katedra Ekon, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",tuleja@opf.slu.cz,"Tuleja, Pavel/J-4599-2018","Tuleja, Pavel/0000-0002-5841-8587",,,,,8,0,0,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-601-4,,,,2010,,,,,,,483,492,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9EP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000393151400058,0

Under very general assumptions, we show that the presence of non-price competition among firms dampens the overall degree of real rigidities in the economy, thereby increasing the sensitivity of inflation to movements in real marginal costs. Because of this property, our analysis provides additional insights to the existing theories on real rigidities, showing that the strong linkage between real rigidities and the sensitivity of inflation to real marginal costs that has been found in previous works is not robust across alternative assumptions about inter- firms competition.","[Turino, Francesco] Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain; [Turino, Francesco] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Universitat d'Alacant; University of Bologna,"Turino, F (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain.",fturino@merlin.fae.ua.es,"Turino, Francesco/H-6947-2015","Turino, Francesco/0000-0003-4816-2319",,,,,32,0,0,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

In this article we evaluate the sustainability of the contributory pension sub-system, taking into account the demographic projections by the Spanish Statistical Office (INE). A baseline scenario is projected as well as several reforms are simulated, focusing on: (i) an immigration policy, (ii) changes in the way of adjusting the pensions and (iii) increase of the legal age of retirement up to 68. The main results are the following. The current system will not incur deficits until 2022, from this point onwards deficits will begin to be accumulated. The expenditure on pensions in terms of GDP will increased from 8.3% in 2009 to 17.0% in 2049. An immigration policy -aimed at foreign young people-would help, but would not ensure the long-term sustainability of the current system. A policy that combines pension growth at a pace lower than productivity growth and extends the legal age of retirement up to 68 would give solvency to the system beyond 2028.","Univ Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona, Dpt Econ Polit & Hisenda Publ, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Grenno, JV (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona, Dpt Econ Polit & Hisenda Publ, Avda Diagonal 690,Torre 4,Planta 2A, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",jvazquezgrenno@ub.edu,,,,,,,32,2,4,1,6,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2010,,195,,,,,37,64,,,,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,791AY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292633400002,0

By putting an additive status term into the utility function, I show that the level of inequality in the initial wealth distribution affects individuals' saving and consumption behavior. The direction of the distortion in intertemporal choice relative to the standard model without a concern for status depends on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in the utility from absolute consumption. In particular, I prove that, for conventional parameter values of the elasticity (e.g. CES parameter larger than one), people save less than what they do without the status concern but the magnitude of this decrease is reduced by the concern for future status. It is also possible that people save more than what they do without the status concern. I also analyze how changes in the initial wealth distribution affect saving. For example, when wealth is Pareto distributed, for a reasonable parameterization, the rich save more and the poor save less when society gets more unequal, which implies that inequality is self-enforcing in this economy. Finally, the resulting allocation is Pareto inefficient due to the externalities generated by the concern for status.","Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Xia, BJ (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",bxia@sfu.ca,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Many of the large companies practised highly risky financial policies and experienced a decrease in efficiency before the crisis, and the managers and owners of some Russian firms have been engaging in opportunistic behaviour during the crisis; the forms and causes of this behaviour are analysed here.

Based on a simple economic model of the macro-scaled price formation, multivariate cointegration techniques have been applied to test whether the real data support the a priori model construction. The results reveal that all of the factors, related to the price determination, have a positive impact on the consumer prices as expected. We find that the most significant component contributing to the price setting is the nominal exchange rate depreciation. We also cannot reject the linear homogeneity of the sum of all the price data as to the domestic inflation.

We use a comprehensive panel data set that covers the entire population of cooperatives and their capitalist counterparts registered in the social security records in Uruguay from April 1996 to December 2005. We analyze the data to study the employment and wage decisions in both types of enterprises, the results of which suggests that their adjustment mechanisms to idiosyncratic price changes and macroeconomic shocks may differ greatly. The data set also allows us to estimate wage and employment variations for members and non-members of cooperatives separately, and provides an empirical test for the so-called degeneration hypothesis. Our findings are broadly consistent with previous studies for Italian cooperatives and plywood cooperatives in the United States. As studies of this kind are so few, Our research provides a significant contribution to the empirical literature on labor managed firms. Moreover, comparing worker cooperatives and capitalist firms offers an exceptional opportunity to determine how control by workers may lead to different organizational behavior.

It is argued in the lecture that in a number of ways central banks should have paid more attention to asset bubbles, which have high output costs. Asset prices, especially housing prices, should be identified as an explicit factor in the consideration of policy. More generally, central banks should adopt policies that 'lean against the wind'.","London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Davies, H (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-9018,,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

Clark developed the multiplier in dynamic terms and coupled it with the accelerator to provide the framework for business cycle theory. His analysis was not formalized and emphasized time lags and nonlinearities, similar to Harrod. In addition, Clark was concerned with the inflationary consequences of Keynesian policies and he was dissatisfied with those mechanical interpretations of the income flow analysis, which came to be known as hydraulic Keynesianism. Clark's policy conclusions emphasized the need of balance between employment creation and price stability, and the need of cooperation between social groups.","[Fiorito, Luca] Univ Palermo, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Vernengo, Matias] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",University of Palermo; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Fiorito, L (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,,,,,,,57,4,4,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

To address this challenge, a model of cartel creation and dissolution is developed to endogenously derive the populations of cartels and discovered cartels. With this theory, one can infer the impact of competition policy on the population of cartels by measuring its impact on the population of discovered cartels. In particular, changes in the duration of discovered cartels can be informative in assessing whether a new policy is reducing the latent rate of cartels.

However, it poses much greater difficulties to deal with the matter than either private monopolization or unjust restraint of trade. In recent years, ongoing economic globalization, advances in information communication technology and other factors have wrought major changes in the traditional supply chain: for example, in subcontracting structure. Given the role of small and medium enterprises in underpinning economic growth, lifting the basic quality and performance level of these firms and improving business conditions for them have emerged as key policy themes. New efforts are needed to establish fair trade as a business practice and to create a new business culture in corporation with competition policy, small and medium enterprise policy and business ethics, such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices.","Nihon Univ, Grad Sch Business, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1028275, Japan",Nihon University,"Ide, T (通讯作者)，Nihon Univ, Grad Sch Business, Chiyoda Ku, Kudan Minami 4-8-24, Tokyo 1028275, Japan.",ide.tsugio@nihon-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

We find that the optimal discriminatory contracts amplify differences in downstream firms' competitiveness. Firms that are larger-either because they are more efficient or because they sell a superior product-obtain a lower wholesale price than their rivals. This increases allocative efficiency by favoring the more productive firms. In contrast, we show that a ban on price discrimination reduces allocative efficiency and can lead to higher wholesale prices for all firms.

The Structural Adjustment Programme adopted in Nigeria in the 1980s, is one policy shift aimed at boosting agricultural production. This article aims at empirically verifying the effects of policy reform on agricultural exports in Nigeria by estimating a simple impact assessment model using a slope-dummy method.

While the details of the plan have not yet been completely announced, we offer a preliminary assessment of how well the reform is likely to achieve its stated goal of assuring every citizen equal access to affordable basic health care. The reform is based on three fundamental tenets: strong role of government in health, commitment to equity, and willingness to experiment with regulated market approaches. Within this framework, the reform offers a number Of laudable changes to the health system, including an increase in public health financing, an expansion of primary health facilities and ail increase in subsidies to achieve universal insurance coverage. However, it fails to address the root causes of the wastes and inefficiencies plaguing China's healthcare system. such as a fragmented delivery system and provider incentives to over-provide expensive tests and services. We Conclude that China should consider changing the provider payment method from fee-for-service to a prospective payment method such as DRG or capitation with pay-for-performance, and to develop purchasing agencies that represent the interests of the population so as to enhance competition.

Our main innovation relies on the introduction of parental altruism, whose intensity is variable. We first show that parental altruism and life expectancy do favor overaccumulation. Second, we give a condition that explains why the Ramsey model may only display dynamic efficiency. These theoretical results are illustrated by a parameterization from US data. Our numerical exercises suggest that the US economy is dynamically efficient, mainly because of the shortness of life expectancy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However many allocation problems are sequential. For example, a state trying to defend against a terrorist attack generally allocates some or all of its resources before the attacker decides where to Strike, This paper studies the allocation problem confronting a defender who must decide how to distribute limited resources across multiple sites before an attacker chooses where to strike. Unlike many Blotto games which only have very complicated mixed-strategy equilibria, the sequential, nonzero-sum Blotto game always has a very simple pure-strategy subgame perfect equilibrium. Further, the defender always plays the same Pure strategy in any equilibrium, and the attacker's equilibrium response is generically unique and entails no mixing. The defender minmaxes the attacker in equilibrium even though the game is nonzero-sum, and the attacker strikes the site among its best replies that minimizes the defender's expected losses.

We identify a number of channels through which resource rents will alter the incentives of a political leader. Some of these induce greater investment by the leader in assets that favour growth (infrastructure, rule of law, etc.), others lead to a potentially catastrophic drop in such activities. As a result, the effect of resource abundance can be highly non-monotonic. We argue that it is critical to understand how resources affect the leader's 'survival function', i.e. the reduced-form probability of retaining power. We also briefly survey decentralized mechanisms, in which rents induce a reallocation of labour by private agents, crowding out productive activity more than proportionately. We argue that these mechanisms cannot be fully understood without simultaneously studying leader behaviour.","[Caselli, Francesco] Natl Bur Econ Res, London Sch Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cunningham, Tom] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Caselli, F (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, London Sch Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",t.e.cunningham@lse.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-107-28-1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,24,96,105,2,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We show that in an oligarchy, the stronger elite appropriates the entire available surplus, whereas a democracy results in a more balanced surplus allocation between the two elites. In a democracy, the newly enfranchised non-elite organize to act collectively, so that the weaker elite can credibly threaten to form a coalition with the organized non-elite against the stronger elite. Such a threat ensures that the more balanced surplus sharing proposal chosen by majority voting is renegotiation-proof. Therefore, sufficiently risk-averse elites unanimously choose democracy as a form of insurance against future imbalances in relative power. We emphasize that franchise extension to, and low cost of organizing collective political activity for, the non-elite are both necessary features of a democracy.

J,"Klein, D; Orsborn, A",,,,"Klein, Daniel; Orsborn, Aaron",,,Concatenate coordination and mutual coordination,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Coordination; Concatenation; Planning; Coordination equilibrium; Focal point,,"We tell of the evolving meaning of the term coordination as used by economists. The paper is based on systematic electronic searches (on coord, etc.) of major works and leading journals. The term coordination first emerged in professional economics around 1880, to describe the directed productive concatenation of factors or activities within a firm. Also, transportation economists used the term to describe the concatenation of routes and trips of a transportation system. These usages represent what we term concatenate coordination. The next major development came in the 1930s from several LSE economists (Hayek, Plant, Hutt, and Coase), who extended that concept beyond the eye of any actual coordinator. That is. they wrote of the concatenate coordination of a system of polycentric or spontaneous activities, These various applications of concatenate coordination prevailed until the next major development. namely, Thomas Schelling and game models. Here coordination referred to a mutual meshing of actions. Game theorists developed crisp ideas of coordination games (like battle of the sexes). coordination equilibria, convention. and path dependence. This coordination was not a refashioning, but rather a distinct concept, one we distinguish as mutual coordination. As game models became more familiar to economists, it was mutual coordination that economists increasingly had in mind when they spoke of coordination. Economists switched, so to speak, to a new semantic equilibrium. Now, mutual coordination overshadows the older notion of concatenate coordination. The two senses of coordination are conceptually distinct and correspond neatly to the two dictionary definitions of the verb to coordinate. Both are crucial to economics. We suggest that distinguishing between the two senses can help to clarify coordination talk. Also, compared to talk of efficiency and optimality, concatenate coordination allows for a richer, more humanistic, and more openly aesthetic discussion of social affairs. The narrative is backed up by Excel worksheets that report on systematic content searches of the writings of economics using the worldwide web and, using JSTOR, of Quarterly journal of Economics, Economic Journal, Journal of Political Economy.

Our entry and bidding models provide several interesting implications. For the first time, we show that even within an independent private value paradigm, as the number of potential bidders increases, bidders' equilibrium bidding behaviour can become less aggressive, and the expected procurement cost may rise because the entry effect is always positive and may dominate the negative competition effect. We then develop structural models of entry and bidding corresponding to the three models under consideration, controlling for unobserved auction heterogeneity, and use the recently developed semi-parametric Bayesian estimation method to analyse the data. We select the model that best fits the data, and use the corresponding structural estimates to quantify the entry effect and the competition effect with regard to the individual bids and the procurement cost.","[Li, Tong] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN USA; [Zheng, Xiaoyong] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",Vanderbilt University; North Carolina State University,"Li, T (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN USA.",,,,,,,,47,109,143,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The investment smoothing by the MNE is studied for cases of both vertical and horizontal FDI. The results suggest FDI is used as a hedging tool, mitigating the effects of inflation taxes even if there are no formal hedging mechanisms. The investment-smoothing reaction of MNEs depends on the reason for investment, the financing sources of FDI, and the substitutability between factors of production.

The higher non-tradable prices serve as incentive for an expansion of that sector, culminating in reallocation of labor away from the tradable sector - a phenomenon known as the Dutch disease.

This paper develops a theoretical framework that links advantages in R&D and variable costs with firm's ability to expand its portfolio of products. The framework is then applied to explain systematic differences in product introduction by affiliates of multinationals and firms that only operate domestically. Using firm-level data for the Chinese manufacturing sector during 1998-2000, I compare the performance of foreign and domestic firms in terms of the new varieties that they introduce and I estimate the quantitative relevance of technological factors as a determinant. I find that firms with more than 50% of foreign ownership introduce on average more than twice as many more new varieties of goods as private domestic firms. Advantages in productivity account for 32 to 62% of the difference in the number and sales of new varieties, while advantages in the cost of development account for 3 to 6% of these differences.

The possession of initial silent toeholds in rivals unambiguously encourages further partial acquisitions, both controlling and silent. However, a higher initial controlling share generally stimulates controlling acquisitions, but always discourages silent ones.

However, recent reforms aimed at improving the performance of these sectors have had limited success. Evidence suggests that, in many instances, this was because the traditional regulatory theory relied on, by policymakers was not suitable for the institutional context in developing countries. This article surveys more, recent theoretical work focusing on problems with regulation in these countries. At the heart of the survey is the work of Jean-Jacques Laffont, who, in the last decade of his life, set about developing a theoretical framework for regulation in developing countries. We consider the implications of his work, which, focused on the key institutional limitations faced in developing countries. We then discuss where experience suggests that there, are important omissions from this modeling, bringing in extensions and alternative approaches pursued by other authors. We conclude by summarizing the key ways in which regulatory policy will be different when institutions are weak. Overall, we find that an understanding of the institutional context and its implications arc, crucial when designing a regulatory framework for developing countries.","[Estache, Antonio] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Wren-Lewis, Liam] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; University of Oxford,"Estache, A (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.",,"Wren-Lewis, Liam/L-6316-2014","Wren-Lewis, Liam/0000-0003-3739-5328",,,,,187,104,115,1,45,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

We describe trends in aggregate health spending in the United States and how private insurance markets and public insurance programs have changed over time. We then present evidence from Consumer Expenditure Survey microdata on how the distribution of household spending on health - that is, out-of-pocket payments for medical care plus the household's share of health insurance premiums - has changed over time. This distribution has shifted up over time - households spend more on medical care and insurance than they used to - but for the purposes of measuring change in risk, it is not the mean but the dispersion of this distribution that is of interest. We consider two measures of dispersion that serve as proxies for household risk: the standard deviation of the distribution of household health spending and the ratio of the 90th percentile of spending to the median (the so-called 90/50 gap). We find, surprisingly, that neither has increased despite the rapid rise in aggregate health spending. This conclusion holds true for broad subgroups of the population (for example, the nonelderly as a group) but not for some narrowly-defined subgroups (for example, low-income families with children). We next consider how much risk households should face, from the perspective of economic efficiency. Household risk may not have changed much over the past several decades, but do we have any evidence that this level represents either too much or too little risk? Finally, we discuss implications for public policy - in particular, for current debates over expanding health insurance coverage to the uninsured.","[Gruber, Jonathan] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Levy, Helen] Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Levy, Helen] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Gruber, Jonathan; Levy, Helen] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gruber, J (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",gruberj@mit.edu; hlevy@umich.edu,,,,,,,65,21,24,0,15,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We give particular emphasis to the construction of price indexes at the basic heading level, because we believe it is here that the biggest problems lie. For example, the apparently anomalous results obtained for China and India in ICP 2005 can be traced back to problems at the basic heading level.

Xiao [Macroeconomic Dynamics 12 (2008), 22-49] claims that with capital and mild increasing returns the Taylor principle cannot guarantee either determinacy or E-stability with any of the four rules. In this paper we show that in the Calvo-type sticky price models a second-order condition for profit maximization must be satisfied in firms pricing decision problem, and we point out that the examples given in Mao's paper to support his conclusion violate this condition. After imposing this condition. we find that increasing returns have little effect on determinacy and E-stability under two of the policy rules but significant effects under the other two.

The estimated output elasticity is approximately 0.1. While social capital positively affects economic growth, the magnitude is much smaller than that of other production inputs. The estimated depreciation rate is at least 10% per annum, which is higher than that of physical capital. The median value of the implied aggregate return of social capital is approximately 19.11% at the global level. In OECD countries, it is likely to be considerably smaller than the individual returns, suggesting the fallacy of composition. While there is no systematic relationship between GDP per capita and returns to physical or human capital, the aggregate returns to social capital seem to be negatively related to the level of development.

An empirical illustration with myopic agents is run using scanner databases for three different product categories; fabric softener, saltine cracker, and catsup.

The analysis considers the pre- and post-Euro introduction periods. In general, the results suggest a breakdown in the relationship between real economic activity and real stock returns during the post-Euro period. Second, impulse response analyses reveal that (shocks by) fundamental variables still influence somewhat real stock returns for some countries but the extent and nature of their impact differ among countries in the post-Euro period. Finally, an examination of equity risk premiums corroborates the above findings and, overall, they may be interpreted as the equity markets having a mind of their own, disconnected from the fundamentals and that they are significantly affected by foreign rather than country-specific forces.

On the aggregate level, although Hong Kong's total factor productivity (TFP) growth rate is amongst the best performers in East Asia in the recent years, it has been adversely affected by the continuing relocation of Hong Kong's manufacturing production to the Mainland China.

It shows from a game theoretical perspective how the combination of setting up a cluster and implementing policy reforms will be a key engine for attracting FDI. Based on agglomeration externalities, the paper shows that the very emergence of clusters can make investment so profitable that investors can even afford to tolerate more policy-induced distortions than otherwise. With perfect information, it shows the existence of multiple equilibria, in which some countries attract FDI while others do not. An extension to the context of imperfect information refines the analysis to a unique equilibrium, in which some investors respond to reforms, while others do not.

This good is valued by a single principal, and there is a verifiable measure of the agent's performance. Crucially, the agent is intrinsically motivated due to 'warm glow altruism'. In addition, the agent's budget, which is controlled by the principal, must not be less than the monetary performance-cost faced by the agent. This gives rise to a limited-liability constraint. It also restricts the agent's ability to under-report costs. In such environment, we determine the link between the agent's budget and performance.

We develop a quantitative equilibrium theory of mortgage choice where households can choose from a menu of long-term (nominal) mortgage loans. The model accounts for observed patterns in housing consumption, ownership, and portfolio allocations. We find that the loan structure is a quantitatively significant factor in a household's housing finance decision. The model suggests that the mortgage structure preferred by a household is dependent on age and income and that loan products with low initial payments offer an alternative to mortgages with no downpayment. These effects are more important when inflation is low. The presence of inflation reduces the real value of the mortgage payment and the outstanding loan over time reducing mobility. Changes in the structure of mortgages have implications for risk sharing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We find that two cointegrating relations affect the changes in prices: one refers to OPEC's behavior. attempting to control prices using its market power and quotas; the other to the coverage rate of OECD expected future demand using inventory behaviors. We derive a forecasting equation for the change in oil prices which we use to assess the speculative elements of the price increases of the period 2000-05.

This paper develops a DSGE model of the interaction between an emerging market economy and an advanced economy which incorporates two-way capital flows between the economies. The novel aspect of the paper is to make use of new methods for analyzing portfolio choice in DSGE models. We compare a range of alternative financial market structures, in each case computing equilibrium portfolios. We find that an asymmetric configuration where the emerging economy holds nominal bonds and issues claims on capital (FDI) can achieve a considerable degree of international risk-sharing.

In 1960, West Bengal's per capita income exceeded that of Maharashtra, the third richest state at the time. By 1993, it had fallen to just 69 percent of Maharashtra's per capita income. We employ a wedge methodology based on the first order conditions of a multi-sector neoclassical growth model to ascertain the output and factor market sources of the divergent economic performances. Our diagnostic analysis reveals that a large part of West Bengal's development woes can be attributed to: (a) low sectoral productivity, especially in manufacturing and services; and (b) sectoral misallocation in labor markets between the manufacturing sector and the other sectors of the economy.

The same holds true across demographic groups within a given economy. We argue that the interaction between labor force participation decisions and labor market frictions can help us understand these patterns. This interaction highlights dynamic aspects of the participation decision, in contrast to standard textbook treatments that emphasize static costs and benefits of participation. We extend the standard labor market search problem to allow for a third state-non-participation and assumes that stochastic participation costs precipitate flows into and out of non-participation. We fully characterize the worker's decision problem and use numerical simulations to demonstrate how participation patterns vary with individual characteristics and with labor market conditions.

Pollution stock accumulates with emissions but is partially assimilated by nature at each period. The assimilation capacity of nature is limited and vanishes beyond a critical level of pollution. We first show that multiple equilibria exist. More importantly, some exhibit irreversible pollution levels although an abatement activity is operative. Thus, the simple engagement of maintenance does not necessarily suffice to protect an economy against convergence toward a steady state having the properties of an ecological and economic poverty trap. In contrast with earlier related studies, the emergence of the environmental Kuznets curve is no longer the rule. Instead, we detect a sort of degenerated environmental Kuznets curve that corresponds to the equilibrium trajectory leading to the irreversible solution.","[Prieur, Fabien] Univ Savoie, IREGE, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France; [Prieur, Fabien] LAMETA, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France",Universite Savoie Mont Blanc; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier,"Prieur, F (通讯作者)，Univ Savoie, IREGE, 4 Chemin Bellevue, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France.",fabien.prieur@univ-savoie.fr,"PRIEUR, Fabien/AAT-9498-2020","Prieur, Fabien/0000-0002-6651-304X",,,,,53,54,58,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

It is shown that outcomes are almost optimal when three or more competitors are in the market. In light of this, a laissez-faire policy should be adopted.

During this time period, the FCC has experimented with a variety of auctions rules including click box bidding and anonymous bidding. These rule changes make the actions of bidders less visible during the auction and also limit the set of bids that can be submitted during a particular round. Economic theory suggests that tacit collusion may be more difficult as a result. We examine this proposition using data from four auctions: the PCS-C Block, the PCS-C&F Block Reauction, the Advanced Wireless Service auction and the 700 MHz auction. We examine the frequency of jump bids, retaliatory bids and straightforward bids across these auctions. While this simple descriptive exercise has a number of limitations, the data suggest that these rule changes have limited firms' ability to tacitly collude. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Taking account of revenue recycling, the impact of a 25-cent gasoline tax increase on the average household is about $30 per Year (2001 dollars).

Evidence from Belgium,LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Wages; Employment flows; Matched employer-employee data,JOB CREATION; LABOR; CONTRACTS,"This paper decomposes wage bill changes at the firm level into components due to wage changes, and components due to flows of employment. It relies on an administrative matched employer-employee dataset of individual earnings merged with firms' annual accounts for Belgium over the period 1997-2001. The results are in line with what one would expect in a downward wage rigidity environment. On average, wage bill contractions result essentially from employment cuts in spite of wage increases. Wage growth of job stayers is moderated but positive; and wages of entrants compared with those of incumbents are no lower. The labour force cuts are achieved through both reduced entries and increased exits, due to more layoffs, especially in smaller firms, and wider use of early retirement, especially in manufacturing. In addition, the paper points out the role of overtime hours, temporary unemployment and interim workers in adapting hours worked to economic circumstances. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However randomization implies some uncertainty about treatment condition. and individuals differ in their preferences towards taking on risk. Since human subjects often volunteer for experiments or are allowed to drop out of the experiment at any time if they want to, it is possible that the sample observed in an experiment might be biased because of the risk of randomization. On the other hand, the widespread use of a guaranteed show-up fee that is non-stochastic may generate sample selection biases of the opposite direction, encouraging more risk averse samples into experiments. We directly test these hypotheses that risk attitudes play a role in sample selection. Our results suggest that randomization bias does affect the overall level of risk aversion in the sample we observe. but that it does not affect the demographic mix of risk attitudes in the sample. We show that the common use of non-stochastic show-up fees can generate samples that are more risk averse than would otherwise have been observed.

A present value test of habits and the current account. journal of Monetary Economics 51, 1495-1507) claims that habit formation in consumption plays an important role in current account fluctuations in selected developed countries, extending the present-value model of the current account (PVM) with consumption habits. In this paper, however, I show that the habit-forming PVM is observationally equivalent to the PVM augmented with persistent transitory consumption, which is induced by world real interest rate shocks. Based on a small open-economy real business cycle (SCE-RBC) model endowed with consumption habits as well as persistent world real interest rate shocks, this paper resolves the inherent identification problem of the habit-forming PVM by Bayesian methods to seek effects of habit formation on current account fluctuations in typical small open economies, Canada and the United Kingdom.

This zero-price rule may prove desirable for several reasons. Using a two-sided market analysis, we suggest that it subsidizes creativity and innovation in new content creation - goals shared by copyright and patent laws. The rule also helps to solve a coordination problem: since Internet service providers do not completely internalize the effects of their own pricing decisions, lack of regulation may lead to even higher fees charged by all. Finally, allowing for such fees runs the risk of creating horizontally differentiated Internet service providers with different libraries of accessible content, thereby foreclosing consumers and leading to Internet fragmentation.","[Lee, Robin S.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Lee, Robin S.] Yahoo Res Microecon, New York, NY USA; [Wu, Tim] Columbia Univ, Sch Law, New York, NY 10027 USA",New York University; Yahoo!

We consider how the frequency of negative emotional terms and the frequency of negative economic terms increase from the period of no-crisis to the period of the crisis. Increasing incidence lowers levels of consumer confidence. We predict that as the crisis evolves the nature of the terminology used to describe it will change, and that the present crisis will receive a special name, like the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Off-farm employment can play an important role in the transition towards more sustainable sources of energy by increasing rural household incomes and reducing the amount of labor available for biomass collection. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of off-farm employment on rural household energy consumption choices, and to disentangle the various causal relationships that play a role in this respect. To this end, a hybrid farm household/village computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is used that has been calibrated for a remote village in Northeast Jiangxi Province where fuelwood is the main source of energy. The model takes into account nonseparability of farm household production and consumption decisions as well as linkages within the village between households involved in off-farm employment and households with no members working off-farm. Contrary to previous research for a richer region in rural China. we find that fuelwood is not an inferior good. The positive impact of more food consumption on fuelwood collection more than compensates the higher leisure demand associated with higher incomes. Shifts in production activities and in prices on village factor markets caused by increased labour scarcity (the lost-labour effect of off-farm employment), on the other hand. cause a reduction in fuelwood collection and consumption. This lost-labour effect is much stronger for migration than for local off-farm employment, because the latter can more easily be combined with on-farm work and fuelwood collection. For local off-farm employment the income effect dominates the lost-labour effect, resulting in a positive overall impact of higher off-farm participation on fuelwood consumption. For migration, on the other hand, the income effect and the lost-labour effect are almost equal in size. Hence, the amount of fuelwood collected and consumed does not change much when households participate in migration. The final conclusion is therefore that increased off-farm employment opportunities do not promote the transition of rural energy use in the poorer regions of rural China. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The existence of a predictability smile has been well documented: spreads between long rates and short rates are able to forecast subsequent movements in interest rates well, provided the horizon is three months or less or two years or more. The predictive power of the spread at the shortest maturities, however, has not been adequately investigated. This is a potential shortcoming of the existing literature as a projection of the predictability smile to the shorter maturities is not a guarantee that the expectations hypothesis holds. In Japan, a positive spread between the forward and the spot rates has insufficient predictive power for the future spot rate innovations, while a negative spread has near-perfect predictive ability. Further, we provide evidence that this result is not unique to Japan, as we find this asymmetric predictability to be a feature of the very short-term money markets of the U.S., U.K. and Italy.","[Uesugi, Iichiro] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo 1868603, Japan; [Yamashiro, Guy M.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Econ, Long Beach, CA 90266 USA",Hitotsubashi University; California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"Uesugi, I (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo 1868603, Japan.",iuesugi@ier.hit-u.ac.jp; gyamashi@csulb.edu,"Uesugi, Iichiro/R-1019-2019",,,,,,17,0,0,0,4,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

These were initiated in Bali in December 2007 and are scheduled to conclude by the end of 2009 in Copenhagen. As such, this negotiation is effectively the second round in ongoing global negotiations on climate change and further rounds will almost certainly follow. We highlight both the vast scope and vagueness of the negotiating mandate, the many outstanding major issues to be accommodated between negotiating parties, the lack of a mechanism to force collective decision making in the negotiation, and their short time frame. The likely lack of compliance with prior Kyoto commitments by several OECD countries (some to a major degree), the effective absence in Kyoto of compliance/enforcement mechanisms, and growing linkage to non-climate change areas (principally trade) all further complicate the task of bringing the negotiation to conclusion. The major clearage we see that needs to be bridged in the negotiations is between OECD countries on the one hand, and lower wage, large population, rapidly growing countries (China, India, Russia, Brazil) on the other.

To this end, it compares the likely power production cost for a set of renewable energy sources, and compares them to the likely long-run cost of traditional energy. Costs from global and local externalities through the use of traditional energy sources are also factored into the analysis. The key conclusion of the article is that while solar PV will likely remain uncompetitive under any future cost scenario, cost paths for small hydro, modern biomass or geothermal are already close enough to being competitive, so that appropriate government intervention may make the decisive difference in making these technologies competitive with conventional energy technologies.

The question whether to conduct a review once at the end, or additionally at points midway through the tournament, is a strategic decision. If the latter course is chosen, then the designer must establish both a rule for aggregating the results of the different reviews and a rule for determining compensations. We first study the case of a fixed, exogenously given prize and then extend the analysis to the case where the prize is not fixed but may vary with the tournament's outcome. It is shown that (1) it is always optimal to assign a higher weight to the final review; (2) this weight increases with the dominance of the first-stage effort in determining the final review's outcome. When the prize is not fixed, the optimal design generates an asymmetric tournament in the second stage that favors the winner of the midterm review. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Subjects can repeatedly choose between two groups that differ in the defector gain in the associated prisoner's dilemma. Choosing into the group with the smaller defector-gain can signal one's willingness to cooperate. We find that viscosity produces an endogenous sorting of cooperators and defectors and persistently high rates of cooperation. Higher viscosity leads to a sharp increase in overall cooperation rates and in addition positively affects the subjects' preferences for cooperation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This has the potential to put high-wage workers in direct competition with much lower paid Indian workers. Service trade, however, like goods trade, is subject to strong distance effects, implying that the remote supply of services remains limited. We investigate this proposition by deriving a gravity-like equation for service trade and estimating it for a large sample of countries and different categories of service trade. We find that distance costs are high but are declining over time.

The existing literature typically takes the agents' characteristics as given and known to the researcher. In contrast, this paper compares collective action provision across groups of agents with resources and valuations for the public good drawn from different known joint distributions. Specifically, I characterize the expected equilibrium public good level as function of various distributional properties and moments. A resource-valuation distribution that first-order stochastically dominates another distribution always results in higher expected public good provision level, independent of the production technology. With decreasing returns to scale in the public good production, higher resource inequality results in higher expected provision. With increasing returns the same result holds when the mean resource level is relatively low, but expected provision decreases in inequality when the mean resource level is high. A parallel result holds for agents' valuations.","Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Karaivanov, A (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",akaraiva@sfu.ca,"Karaivanov, Alexander/AAX-4761-2021","Karaivanov, Alexander/0000-0002-5184-3126",,,,,36,8,8,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

We do this using a heterogeneous agents model in which fundamentalist and chartist beliefs of the exchange rate co-exist and are allowed to be either uncertainty neutral or uncertainty averse. Uncertainty aversion is modelled using the maxmin expected utility approach. We find significant evidence of uncertainty aversion in the FX market where in particular fundamentalists are found to be largely uncertainty neutral while chartists are mainly uncertainty averse. Inclusion of uncertainty averse agents significantly improves the empirical performance of the model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Information has value in itself (for example, to facilitate a more efficient allocation of resources), but it could also perhaps be seen as a signal of the degree of political and institutional transparency. In order to evaluate the potential association between the release of information and the institutional and economic circumstances across countries, a new index is developed that has extensive coverage across countries (175) and time (1960-2000), and is based on the quantity of reported socio- economic data contained in the World Development Indicators and the International Finance Statistics databases. Using a series of Granger-causality regressions, the release of information by governments is shown to have a significant effect on investment and financial sector development. In terms of reverse causality, the evidence shows that the degree of constraints on the executive branch of government and education both have a positive effect on the quantity of data released by governments.

If human capital depreciation due to family related career breaks is lower in female than in male occupations, this can explain occupational sex segregation because women will take the costs of future breaks into account when optimizing their lifetime earnings. We find that short-run depreciation rates in high-skilled occupations are significantly lower in female than in male occupations. In low-skilled occupations, there is no evidence of this difference. Our findings support the self-selection hypothesis with respect to occupational sex segregation in the more skilled jobs, i.e. high-skilled women might deliberately choose female occupations because of the lower short-term wage penalties for family-related career interruptions.","[Gorlich, Dennis] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24100 Kiel, Germany; [de Grip, Andries] Maastricht Univ, Res Ctr Educ & Labor Market, ROA, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Maastricht, Netherlands; [de Grip, Andries] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Maastricht University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Görlich, D (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24100 Kiel, Germany.",a.degrip@roa.unimaas.nl,"De Grip, Andries/A-6021-2009",,,,,,43,45,50,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In each period, an opportunity to collaborate arrives stochastically but whether this opportunity has arrived is the agents' private information. The principal thus cannot simply tell them when to collaborate: she must instead guide them through incentives. The optimal contract in the repeated setting can drastically be different from that in the static setting and is often characterized as high powered team incentives complemented with inefficiently low-powered individual incentives, which endogenously raise the cost of shirking.

It then goes on to analyse the characteristics of the production structure in the Chilean economy, as these are believed to be a determinant of inequality.

Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005a) presented evidence that funds rate increases lowered long-term expected inflation. To choose between these hypotheses, we examine how monetary policy surprises affect daily traded commodity prices, term interest rates, and forward interest rates. We find that funds rate increases in the 1970s raised gold and silver prices and that increases after 1989 lowered gold and silver prices. We also find that funds rate hikes over both sample periods primarily affected short-term interest rates and near-term forward rates. For the 1970s, these results suggest that Romer and Romer's explanation is correct. For recent years, they indicate that funds rate increases affect real rates and may also be consistent with the findings of Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson.","[Thorbecke, Willem] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Zhang, Hanjiang] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Dept Finance, Austin, TX 78712 USA",George Mason University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Thorbecke, W (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",wthorbec@gmu.edu; Hanjiang.Zhang@mccombs.utexas.edu,"Thorbecke, Willem/I-1963-2019","Thorbecke, Willem/0000-0003-2688-7044",,,,,18,4,5,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

To this end, we use money supply shocks after filtering out the expected component of the money supply. Our findings provide evidence supporting the asymmetric effect of positive and negative money supply shocks on real output and inflation in China. That is, real GDP growth in China responds to negative money supply shocks but not positive money supply shocks. In addition, inflation responds to positive money supply shocks but not negative money supply shocks.

Our results show that reforms are more likely during the tenure of former entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs belonging to a left-wing party are more successful in inducing reforms than a member of a right-wing party with the same previous profession. Former professional scientists also promote reforms, the more so, the longer they stay in office. The impact of politicians' education is not robust and depends on the method of estimation.

The recession is especially penalising economies they have followed risky policies. The course of the recession is currently impossible to predict.

A substantial body of literature has shown that our behavior is often guided by habits. The existence of habits - not fully conscious forms of behavior is important as it contradicts rational choice theory. Their presence thus calls for the setting of new instruments as it is difficult to expect consumers to be capable of exercising control over their consumption of energy in reaction to given incentives. This is further increased in our perspective where the current carbon-based Socio-Technical System constrains and shapes consumers' choices through structural, cultural, social and institutional forces. Habits being potentially counterintentional, can be considered as a form of behavioral lock-in that may explain continued increase of energy consumption. Policies should thus specifically address the performance context of habits.","Univ Libre Brussels, Ctr Econ & Social Studies Environm, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Maréchal, K (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Brussels, Ctr Econ & Social Studies Environm, Brussels, Belgium.",,,,,,,,93,58,61,1,28,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Given that the presence of outliers in a time series-unless detected and adjusted often render wrong impression on the persistence properties and their implications for long-run growth. Darne's contribution in this regard is significant, Outliers of varied types assume varying persistence profiles, therefore detection of them in the GNP growth is a prerequisite for characterizing the series in a stochastic or deterministic setting. To further intuition on the exact nature of persistence, I applied fractional integration test of the four real GNP series and Found that outlier adjusted GNP series are mean-reverting and are more persistent than original.

This paper shows that even before the launch of the European Monetary Union, European markets were not showing visible progress in capital market integration, and that the degree of integration was below the degree of U.S.-Canadian market integration, The results suggest that monetary integration is not necessarily motivated by capital market integration.","Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Seoul 137747, South Korea",Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP),"Oh, Y (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, 300-4 Yomgok Dong, Seoul 137747, South Korea.",yho@kiep.go.kr,"Oh, Y/G-7620-2018",,,,,,14,2,2,1,9,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

The model captures the multistage nature of the wool production system, and the heterogeneous nature of raw wool, processed wool and wool garments. It also captures the important wool producing and consuming regions of the world. We illustrate the utility of the model by estimating the effects of tariff barriers on wool products using partial-and general-equilibrium solutions. We find that either solution generates similar wool industry results, whereas the macroeconomic effects differ significantly with the partial-equilibrium estimates significantly overestimating the benefits of the tariff changes.

Prices of heavier (more voluminous) goods deviate further before becoming mean-reverting. Moreover, after becoming mean-reverting, prices of heavier goods converge more slowly. Together with measures of pricing power, market size, distance, and exchange rate volatility, these factors explain up to 43% of variation in no-adjustment threshold estimates across 52 goods in US-Canada post-Bretton Woods monthly CPI data and are robust in a broader five-country dataset.

If the former dominates, the government runs expansionary policies, precipitating a crisis. For some parameters, self-fulfilling speculation affects when the crisis happens, but not whether it happens.

We find that, on average, a company's stock price declines when there is news about its involvement in tax shelters. We find some limited evidence for cross-sectional variation in the reaction. For example, the reaction is more negative for firms in the retail sector, suggesting that part of the reaction may be a consumer/taxpayer backlash. In addition, the reaction is less negative for firms that are viewed to be generally less tax aggressive, as proxied by the firm's cash effective tax rate. We interpret this as being consistent with the market reacting positively to evidence that a firm is trying to reduce taxes when their financial reports would lead one to believe the firm is not tax aggressive.

Evidence from mandatory and recommended arrest laws,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Domestic violence; Mandatory arrest; Spousal homicide; Crime policy,HOMICIDE; FAMILY; WOMEN,"Domestic violence remains a major public policy concern despite two decades of policy intervention. To eliminate police inaction in response to domestic violence, many states have passed mandatory arrest laws, which require the police to arrest abusers when a domestic violence incident is reported. Using the FBI Supplementary Homicide Reports, I find that mandatory arrest laws actually increased intimate partner homicides. I discuss two potential mechanisms for this increase in homicides: decreased reporting by victims and increased reprisal by abusers. I investigate validity of these hypotheses by examining the effect of mandatory arrest laws on different sub-groups and by analyzing family homicides where the victim is less often responsible for reporting. There appears to be consistent evidence for the reporting mechanisms. For family homicides, mandatory arrest laws appear to reduce the number of homicides. This study therefore provides evidence that these laws may have perverse effects on intimate partner violence, harming the very people they seek to help. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Our paper complements this literature by examining passthrough from the other side of the transaction; that is, we assess the exchange rate sensitivity of export prices (denominated in the exporter's currency). We find that the prices charged on exports to the United States are more responsive to the exchange rate than are export prices to other destinations, which is consistent with results in the literature that import price passthrough in the US market is relatively low. In addition, the exchange rate sensitivity of export prices over time has been significantly affected by country- and region-specific factors, including the Asian financial crisis (for emerging Asia), deepening integration with the United States (for Canada), and the effects of the 1992 ERM crisis (for the United Kingdom).","[Vigfusson, Robert J.; Sheets, Nathan; Gagnon, Joseph] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Vigfusson, RJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, 20th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",robert.j.vigfusson@frb.gov,,,,,,,19,13,15,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Often, analysts have used approximations to a full global MRIO model; however, without access to a full MRIO model the approximation errors are unknown. In this paper we use an MRIO model based on the dataset provided by the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) to quantify the errors introduced by various approximations of the full MRIO model. We find that emissions embodied in imports contribute an average 40% of the total emissions embodied in countries' final demands. For the emissions embodied in imports, we find: (a) that the unidirectional trade model gives a good approximation to the full MRIO model when the number of regions in the model is small; (b) that including only the most important trade partner in terms of emissions embodied in imports can substantially improve the accuracy of estimates; and (c) that a world-average input-output table often provides a good representation of the aggregate 'rest of world' economy. Finally, assuming that imports are produced with domestic technology (Domestic Technology Assumption, DTA) in an MRIO model can introduce significant errors and requires careful validation before results are used. However, the DTA generally produces better estimates than ignoring imports altogether.","[Andrew, Robbie] Landcare Res NZ Ltd, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Peters, Glen P.] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo CICERO, Oslo, Norway; [Lennox, James] Landcare Res NZ Ltd, Lincoln, New Zealand",Landcare Research - New Zealand; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Andrew, R (通讯作者)，Landcare Res NZ Ltd, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",andrewr@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Peters, Glen P/B-1012-2008; Andrew, Robbie/B-4204-2008","Peters, Glen P/0000-0001-7889-8568; Andrew, Robbie/0000-0001-8590-6431",,,,,26,147,149,1,78,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

De-icing salts directly or indirectly contaminate the road environment and have a negative effect on the components of road environment. The analysis of the situation raises a question: how to ensure traffic safety in wintertime applying salts and achieve sustainable development. The article presents the investigations of chloride concentrations on the roadsides of a highway. In 5 recent years, complex environmental laboratory investigations and investigations under natural conditions of the effect of salts on the components of the road environment have been carried out proving their toxic effect. Consequently, to reduce a negative effect of salts on the road environment, measures of sustainable ecological development have to be taken. To achieve a balanced use of salts, the proposal is to apply alternative materials (formiates, molasses-based material). The introduction of biotechnical measures (an infiltration-grassy ditch, biological and chemical indication on roadsides) is expedient to eliminate the consequences but not the reasons of salt use.","[Baltrenas, Pranas; Kazlauskiene, Agne] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Environm Protect, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Baltrénas, P (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Environm Protect, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",pbalt@ap.vgtu.lt; agne.kazlauskiene@ap.vgtu.lt,,,,,,,33,22,22,1,63,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Credits for banks are not only the source of income but also they can be the main reason of loss. The main risk that banks meet with lending money is credit risk. It is risk that debtor will not be able to repay his obligations due to certain reasons. Seeking to reduce potential loss due to crediting not reliable clients banks must be able to measure credit risk of each client properly. One of possible methods is using of internal credit risk estimation models. Due to the importance of credit risk analysis, many methods were widely applied to credit risk measurement tasks: linear discriminant analysis, logit analysis, probit analysis, linear programming, integer programming, k-nearest neighbour, classification tree, artificial neural networks (ANN), genetic algorithm, support vector machine, some hybrid models ant other. An increasing field of research in artificial neural networks is the one mainly concerned with interactions between economics and computer science, studying their potential applications to economics. Artificial neural networks represent an easily customizable tool for modelling learning behaviour of agents and for studying a lot of problems very difficult to analyze with standard economic models (Gallo, 2006). ANN have many advantages over conventional methods of analysis. According to Shachmurove (2002), they have the ability to analyze complex patterns quickly and with a high degree of accuracy. Artificial neural networks make no assumptions about the nature of the distribution of the data Since time-series data are dynamic in nature, it is necessary to have non-linear tools in order to discern relationships among time-series. ANY are best at discovering these types of relationships. Also neural networks perform well with missing or incomplete data. Compared with an econometric model, it is easier to use ANN where a forecast needs to be obtained in a shorter Period of time. The purpose of this research is to define the rates of classification accuracy and to measure the classification accuracy of artificial neural networks credit risk estimation models. The methods of the research are analysis of scientific publications about credit risk estimation models and analysis of artificial neural networks credit risk estimation models classification accuracy. One important component needed to accomplish credit risk evaluation is to seek an accurate classifier in order to categorize new applicants or existing customers as good or bad (Lai, Yu, Wang, Zhou, 2006). In this paper rates of credit risk estimation models accuracy and their calculation were described: correct classification and misclassification rates, false negative and false positive rates, model sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values, F-measure, ROC analysis. Analysis of scientific publications about credit risk estimation models has shown that the most efficient of the most commonly used methods are logistic regression and artificial neural networks. Less reliable methods are decision trees and discriminant analysis. Also artificial neural networks models (multilayer perceptrons) were constructed for the analysis of Lithuanian enterprises credit risk Calculation of models-accuracy rates has shown that the most efficient model analyses data about clients is of 3 years. Experiments have shown that analyzing data of 4 and 5 years classification accuracy decreases due to high quantity of input information and neural network's overlearning. Models accuracy rates allowed to estimate risk of client misclassfication and other characteristics. Also they helped to make the decision which model is to be used in practice in order to measure credit risk successfully.","[Boguslauskas, Vytautas; Mileris, Ricardas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Boguslauskas, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vytautas.boguslauskas@ktu.lt; ricardas.mileris@klu.lt,,,,,,,40,11,13,0,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The results show that the MD estimator performs very poorly; overall the full information maximum likelihood estimator performs better than the other two estimators.","Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Cai, LX (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",cail@unimelb.edu.au,,"Cai, Lixin/0000-0002-5527-9390",,,,,6,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

From the perspective of the real minimum wage, it is shown that free trade would result in a rise or a decline in the country's urban unemployment rate, depending on its trade pattern. While the effect of labour mobility on a country's urban unemployment rate is determined by the difference between the ratio of would-be farmers to incoming workers and that of farm leavers to outgoing workers, the result of capital mobility will depend on a comparison of the initial urban unemployment rates of two countries.","Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taipei 111, Taiwan",Ming Chuan University,"Chen, YT (通讯作者)，Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, 250 Chung Shan N Rd,Sec 5, Taipei 111, Taiwan.",yaotc@mcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In order to meet customers' requirements and ensure the growth of activity and finance results, organizations are interested in quality improvement, in the increase of the quality of work as well as in the implementation of new technologies and modern working methods. The meeting of the above mentioned interests could be reached only by organizations having necessary competences, which are created by the workers of enterprises. The most important thing is that every employee should to the maximum open up his potential as well as effectively use personal and professional competences when striving to coordinate the objectives of an organization. At present, the importance of employee (as the most important factor of the activity of an organization) showed up in the development of management theory. Only properly motivated and able to meet his interests, an employee strives for better working results. Organizations face a number of problems connected with human resources management, they are as follows: how to attract necessary competitive employees and what measures should be taken in order to hold these employees; how to properly stimulate employees and what measures should be predicted for the meeting of employees' interests. The limited resources and possibilities of organizations handicap the situation. In order to obtain optimal results the coordination of interests should be striven for. One of the possible interests of coordination measures can be the modern career system allowing clearing up personnel's interests and integrating various possibilities, which coordinate interests. It is not so easy for organizations to evaluate employees' interests. Employees' interests are defined by a number of personal and demographical characteristics. Employees' interests constantly change subjected to the social economic changes occurring in the environment. Interests expressed by the employees are determined by common orientations of individual and attitude towards work. The article considers the actual problem of the management science - formation of modern career on the ground of interest coordination. The question of the employee's interests in modern career is analysed in the article written by Ciutiene, Sakalas and Neverauskas Influence of personnel interests on formation of modern career (2007). In this article interests are analysed in the aspect of the attitude towards work i.e. it was solved how interests forming employee's career vary subject to the employee's sacrifice in the name of his work. The carried out empirical research showed that employees, expressing different attitudes, motivate their main interests with different priorities. It only confirms that every employee is unique and an organization should create possibilities for the realization of individual interests. It should be noted that the differences of employees' interests determined during the investigation should not be considered as typical in the context of today's Lithuania subject to the indicated attitude towards work. The research should be carried out to a larger extent.","[Ciutiene, Ruta] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Qual Management, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Adamoniene, Ruta] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology,"Ciutiene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Qual Management, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ruta.ciutiene@ktu.lt; ruta.adamoniene@ktu.lt,"Adamonienė, Rūta/V-6784-2019",,,,,,34,3,3,1,8,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The model is estimated for postwar U.S. data with a break in 1981:3, allowing for changes in the policy rule, shock processes and financial frictions across subsamples. There is some evidence that changed monetary policy is more important to explain inflation stabilization, while 'good luck' helps explain the increased stability in output. However, the results are most consistent with a decline in shock variances which was reinforced by a decrease in financial frictions, making the economy less vulnerable to shocks.","Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria & Hist Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"de Blas, B (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria & Hist Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",beatriz.deblas@uam.es,"de Blas, Beatriz/H-8223-2015",,,,,,42,3,4,0,7,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We find that depression is a significant predictor of lower GPA and higher probability of dropping out, particularly among students who also have a positive screen for an anxiety disorder. In within-person estimates using our longitudinal sample, we find again that co-occurring depression and anxiety are associated with lower GPA, and we find that symptoms of eating disorders are also associated with lower GPA.

The econometric learning approach models economic agents as forming expectations by estimating and updating forecasting models in real time. The learning approach provides a stability test for rational expectations and a selection criterion in models with multiple equilibria. In addition, learning provides new dynamics if older data are discounted, if models are misspecified, or if agents choose between competing models. This paper describes the expectational stability (E-stability) principle and the stochastic approximation tools used to assess equilibria under learning. Applications of learning to a number of areas are reviewed, including the design of monetary and fiscal policy, business cycles, self-fulfilling prophecies, hyperinflation, liquidity traps, and asset prices.","[Evans, George W.] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Evans, George W.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland; [Honkapohja, Seppo] Bank Finland, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland",University of Oregon; University of St Andrews; Bank of Finland,"Evans, GW (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",gevans@uoregon.edu; seppo.honkapohja@bof.fi,"Evans, George W/H-8051-2012",,,,,,96,52,60,1,31,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1383,,,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

We highlight how inertia in labor supply choices influences responses to policy changes. We do this in two ways. First, we show that taking account of last year's employment status is important in estimating responses to current earnings test changes, a step that has not always been taken in the literature. Second, we test the effect of not only actual but also anticipated earnings test parameters that cohorts faced at earlier ages. This approach demonstrates that past and anticipated future rules influence current employment and earnings. Thus we identify an impact of earnings test changes on employment at ages that are Younger than those directly affected and in years that follow the direct change. Finally, we show that earnings test changes that were initiated in 1996 had an effect, in addition to the changes in 2000 that have been recently studied by others. Overall, we predict that the elimination of the earnings test in 2000 raised employment among Health and Retirement Study respondents by around 2 percentage points at ages 66-69 and 3.5 points at age 65, with gains persisting as exposed cohorts aged and also arising at younger ages due to the shock to anticipated earnings test rules.","[Friedberg, Leora] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,,,,,,,,,31,9,12,0,1,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60 ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0892-8649,,978-0-226-07654-6,TAX POL EC,,,2009,23.0,,,,,,1,35,,,,,,35,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BKM84,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268600700001,0

This paper studies the effects of monetary uncertainty on output in a competitive search environment where there is asymmetric information about monetary shocks. In such an environment, sellers post prices that are contingent on the realization of the shock, and buyers then direct their search towards the most attractive price. The paper proposes a new mechanism for real output effects of monetary shocks: when the realization of the monetary shock is privately observed by buyers, to induce truth-telling behavior, sellers offer more output when the economy experiences a positive monetary shock; otherwise, buyers have an incentive to lie about the state of the world in order to pay low prices. This contrasts with the centralized Walrasian market environment, where nominal shocks by themselves have no real effects.","Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Huangfu, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",s.huangfu@econ.usyd.edu.au,,"Huangfu, Stella/0000-0003-4783-4881",,,,,21,2,2,0,2,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

J,"Jones, BF",,,,"Jones, Benjamin F.",,,The Burden of Knowledge and the Death of the Renaissance Man: Is Innovation Getting Harder?,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; SCALE; DEBT,"This paper investigates a possibly fundamental aspect of technological progress. If knowledge accumulates as technology advances, then successive generations of innovators may face an increasing educational burden. Innovators can compensate through lengthening educational phases and narrowing expertise, but these responses come at the cost of reducing individual innovative capacities, with implications for the organization of innovative activity-a greater reliance on teamwork-and negative implications for growth. Building on this burden of knowledge mechanism, this paper first presents six facts about innovator behaviour. I show that age at first invention, specialization, and teamwork increase over time in a large micro-data set of inventors. Furthermore, in cross-section, specialization and teamwork appear greater in deeper areas of knowledge, while, surprisingly, age at first invention shows little variation across fields. A model then demonstrates how these facts can emerge in tandem. The theory further develops explicit implications for economic growth, providing an explanation for why productivity growth rates did not accelerate through the 20th century despite an enormous expansion in collective research effort. Upward trends in academic collaboration and lengthening doctorates, which have been noted in other research, can also be explained in this framework. The knowledge burden mechanism suggests that the nature of innovation is changing, with negative implications for long-run economic growth.","[Jones, Benjamin F.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Jones, Benjamin F.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Jones, BF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"McBee, David J/F-3968-2012",,,,,,31,392,395,7,118,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We investigate changes in visitor composition associated with an introduction of an entrance fee to a state funded museum, and the validity of the Contingent Valuation (CV) method. We conducted two surveys to collect information about the visitors' socio-economic backgrounds, one before and one after the fee was in effect. While entrance was still free, we also asked visitors about their willingness to pay for a visit, using the CV method. We then compare the results of the CV survey with the actual change in visitor composition caused by the fee. We thus have a unique opportunity to test the validity of the CV, which, as far as we know, has never been done in a similar way before. The results of the CV indicate that several target group visitors are less likely to visit the museum after an implementation of a relatively low fee. Consequently, charging for entrance does affect who visits the museum. The validity test of the CV method shows that a majority of the changes in visitor composition were correctly predicted.

Our main findings are summarized as follows: first, cash-flow news is the main driver of stock return and excess stock return in stock market. Second, the dividend payout ratio is able to predict stock return and excess stock return. Third, under the model of stock return variance, unexpected market liquidity and unexpected liquidity risk are negatively related to expected stock return news, but not related to cash-flow news.

Regional approaches usually reflect current problems and constraints within economy but also different contributions of particular theoreticians. The author used the OLS model in the paper to investigate the multidimensional nature of regional policy on the example of the Istrian county. Using the OLS model, the correlation between gross domestic product and influential variables for the Istrian county has been investigated. The model is limited because of the available data, so the variable selection is needed. The model presented in the paper can serve as an analytic framework for the regional policy optimisation and structural changes measurement.","Univ Juraj Dobrila Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Prziklas, R (通讯作者)，Univ Juraj Dobrila Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",rprzik@efpu.hr,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Accordingly, when accurately measured revenue decentralization appears to have had no negative impact on fiscal discipline.","Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Thornton, J (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",jthornton@imf.org,,,,,,,16,8,8,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The methodology is used to measure the relative size of Korean gender wage gaps, from 1994 to 2000 across industries, differentiated by industrial knowledge intensity, where knowledge intensity is the extent to which industries produce or employ high-technology products. Korea represents an important case study, since it possesses one of the fastest growing knowledge-intensive economies among industrialized countries. Empirical results indicate that over this period, discrimination (the unexplained portion of the gender wage gaps) in Korea was statistically smaller in knowledge-intensive industries than in industries with low knowledge intensity. Also, discrimination was declining on average over the period. This suggests that continued growth in knowledge-intensive industries in Korea may lead to further declines in the overall gender gap.","[Horrace, William C.] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Ural Marchand, Beyza] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Jung, Jin Hwa] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Seoul 151742, South Korea",Syracuse University; Syracuse University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Horrace, WC (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",whorrace@maxwell.syr.edu,"Marchand, Beyza Ural/L-7610-2015; Horrace, William/I-6279-2015","Marchand, Beyza Ural/0000-0002-7164-591X; Horrace, William/0000-0003-1325-5320",,,,,23,8,8,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

These policies rely on the basic understanding that savings trigger growth and investments. However there are alternative theoretical discussions and empirical findings related to the interaction among these variables. In this study, while one of the purposes is to analyse the interaction among these variables for the Turkish case, the other is to try to bring an insight for other developing countries for the issues such as data production, econometric analysis, and as well as making policy suggestions in line with the evidence from the Turkish case. The findings of this study show that, it is the growth that induces both savings and investments. Hence, it is necessary to question policies that assume it is the savings triggering growth and investments.","[Cimenoglu, Ahmet] PhD Yapi Kredi Bank, Istanbul, Turkey; [Yenturk, Nurhan] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ulengin, Burc] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Fac Management, Istanbul, Turkey",Yapi Kredi Bank; Istanbul Bilgi University; Istanbul Bilgi University,"Cimenoglu, A (通讯作者)，PhD Yapi Kredi Bank, Istanbul, Turkey.",acimenoglu@ykb.com,"ULENGIN, BURC/ABD-2845-2020","ULENGIN, BURC/0000-0001-5276-8861",,,,,61,4,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The seller holds the second auction only when the remaining demand is strong enough to cover her opportunity cost. Bidding in anticipation of such a contingent future auction is characterized, including a sufficient condition for existence of an invertible (increasing symmetric pure-strategy) bidding equilibrium that facilitates the seller's learning. A unique invertible bidding equilibrium exists for the Dutch auction format, but only when the second auction is sufficiently discounted by the bidders. In the equilibrium, high-valuation bidders shade their bids down as if the second auction were guaranteed. To counter such strategic bidding, the seller would value ex-ante commitment to hold the second auction less often. Three forms of such commitment are analyzed: commitment to list future auctions in advance, commitment to not hold the second auction unless the first price exceeds a publicly announced threshold, and commitment to a reserve-price in the second auction.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Zeithammer, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",rzeitham@alum.mit.edu,,,,,,,17,8,8,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Using a model of family decision making with home production and individual earnings heterogeneity, we subject two prominent explanations for this aggregate change, namely, the evolution of the gender earnings gap and the cost of home appliances, to quantitative tests with respect to changes in participation for disaggregated groups of couples and trends in time spent in leisure and home production activities. We find that both forces are needed to understand the evolution of married female time allocation over time, although the falling cost of home appliances is a dominant explanation for the time allocation outside of workplace, while the gender earnings gap is the dominant explanation for the workforce participation decision.

This conflict is largely explained by variations in definitions and the countries studied. An alternative approach - of limiting the focus to studies of the relationship in rich countries, measuring government size as total taxes or total expenditure relative to GDP and relying on panel data estimations with variation over - time reveals a more consistent picture. The most recent studies find a significant negative correlation: an increase in government size by 10 percentage points is associated with a 0.5% to 1% lower annual growth rate. We discuss efforts to make sense of this correlation, and note several pitfalls involved in giving it a causal interpretation. Against this background, we discuss two explanations of why several countries with high taxes seem able to enjoy above average growth. One hypothesis is that countries with higher social trust levels are able to develop larger government sectors without harming the economy. Another explanation is that countries with large governments compensate for high taxes and spending by implementing market-friendly policies in other areas. Both explanations are supported by ongoing research.","[Bergh, Andreas; Henrekson, Magnus] Lund Univ, Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Bergh, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",,"Henrekson, Magnus/JXL-1358-2024; Bergh, Andreas/E-9962-2018; Bergh, Andreas/AAM-2478-2020","Henrekson, Magnus/0000-0002-1640-7126; Bergh, Andreas/0000-0003-2621-6769",,,,,90,104,113,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

This paper uses a Parente and Prescott (J Polit Econ 102(2), 298-321, 1994; 2000) type model to investigate the recent transformations in each of these countries and quantify the extent to which barriers to technological adoption may have played for these two development experiences.

Second, I point out that the supposed evidence showing the superiority of 'liberalized' institutions relies too much on cross-section econometric studies, which suffer from defective concepts, flawed measurements and heterogeneous samples.

The raw gender wage gap shows a tendency to increase across the distribution with a glass ceiling effect indicated. A strong relationship between high skilled, white-collar occupations and carrying out managerial duties with the glass ceiling effect is indicated in the data. After allowing for positive selection into full-time employment by British women, a substantially larger gentler earning gap is found: the selection corrected gender wage gap is close to twice the raw gap across most of the earnings distribution. This selection corrected gap is found to be predominantly related to women receiving lower rewards for their characteristics than men. Indeed, the results suggest the gender earnings gap would all but disappear across the earnings distribution if women working full-time received the same returns to their characteristics as men working full-time in Britain do.

J,"Hanson, SG; Kashyap, AK; Stein, JC",,,,"Hanson, Samuel G.; Kashyap, Anil K.; Stein, Jeremy C.",,,A Macroprudential Approach to Financial Regulation,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,"Many observers have argued that the regulatory framework in place prior to the global financial crisis was deficient because it was largely microprudential in nature. A microprudential approach is one in which regulation is partial equilibrium in its conception and aimed at preventing the costly failure of individual financial institutions. By contrast, a macroprudential approach recognizes the importance of general equilibrium effects, and seeks to safeguard the financial system as a whole. In the aftermath of the crisis, there seems to be agreement among both academics and policymakers that financial regulation needs to move in a macroprudential direction. In this paper, we offer a detailed vision for how a macroprudential regime might be designed. Our prescriptions follow from a specific theory of how modern financial crises unfold and why both an unregulated financial system, as well as one based on capital rules that only apply to traditional banks, is likely to be fragile.

There is also now a rapidly growing literature on the economics of happiness. Another quite distinctive position of social importance on these issues is provided by Joseph Ratzinger, also known as Pope Benedict XVI. It offers an alternative conception of ontology and teleology, and reflects conceptions of freedom, happiness, man and rationality different from those found in orthodox economics, and different too from those found in the above-mentioned critiques. It intersects with recent writings of Lawson (2003), Nelson (2010) and Tilman (2008). In order to promote critical scrutiny of the a priori positions embedded in contending schools of economic thought, it follows that the implications of this Ratzinger critique should be consciously confronted by economists, including institutionalists, with whom various starting points are shared.","[Hodge, Andrew] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Hodge, Andrew; Dubs, Alan] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Hodge, A (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",,"Hodge, Andrew/C-4779-2014","Hodge, Andrew/0000-0002-7203-9233",,,,,57,4,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

It is shown that a comparative advantage in a shift-working commodity is held by pairs of countries in different time zones and connected through a good communication network. Concerning factor prices, if the shift-working commodity is capital (respectively, labour) intensive, the wage rate for day-shift labour will decrease (respectively, increase) as a result of trade in labour services. It is also demonstrated that this labour service utilization is mutual: some of Home's day-shift labour will be utilized for the Foreign night shift, and vice versa.

However, the economic literature - an overview of which is given here - does not provide an unambiguous answer, either theoretically or empirically, to the question of the relationship between (the smoothing of) cyclical fluctuations and long-term growth. In this context, two main contrasting explanatory paradigms can be identified: Schumpeter's concept of creative destruction and the learning by doing hypothesis. Even if it were possible to identify the relationship more clearly on this basis, it is important not to lose sight of the problems associated with the real-time assessment of the current economic situation, time lags and political economic incentives even in difficult times.","[Priesmeier, Christoph] Humboldt Univ, D-1086 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,,,,,,,,,66,7,7,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We find that (a) the relatively vulnerable and cooperative thin-skins cannot evolve under purely random matching, (b) with some assortment thin-skins evolve and can take over the entire population, (c) vulnerability to greater pain makes it easier for thin-skins to evolve, and (d) proximate pain which merely feels bad but does not lower fitness helps thin-skins evolve even more than pain which accurately reflects fitness consequences.

Together with optimal tax rules, the paper therefore also derives conditions for the optimal use of resources on abatement. After brief discussions of the dimensions of time and uncertainty, tax reform and the double dividend, and taxes vs. quotas, the optimal tax model is applied to the problem of global warming with a discussion of the particular incentive problems that arise in designing and implementing global climate policy.

These algorithms, commonly referred to as genetic algorithms, are popular in agent-based computational economics research. In many studies, however, there is no clear reason for the use of a binary encoding of strategies. We therefore examine to what extent the use of such an encoding may influence the results produced by an evolutionary algorithm. It turns out that the use of a binary encoding can have quite significant effects. Since these effects do not have a meaningful economic interpretation, they should be regarded as artifacts. Our findings indicate that in general the use of a binary encoding is undesirable.

We focus on 2002-2007 and perform a number of counterfactual simulations to investigate two central elements of the story, namely: (a) an over-expansionary US monetary policy and the absence of effective macro-prudential supervision, which permitted a prolonged expansion of debt-financed consumer spending and (b) the choice by China and other emerging countries to pursue an export-led growth strategy supported by pegging their currencies to the US dollar, in conjunction with sluggish domestic demand in major advanced economies characterized by low potential output growth. The results of the simulations lend support to the view that if substantial, globally coordinated demand rebalancing had been undertaken early on, the macroeconomic and financial imbalances would not have accumulated to the extent that they did and the financial turmoil might have had less drastic global consequences.

In addition, compared to exports to other countries, exports to the region are highly concentrated.

We do this by analysing a panel sample of 145 countries from 1960 to 2007. The results of our paper suggest that government spending produces important crowding-out effects, by negatively affecting both private consumption and investment. The result is broadly robust to both country and time effects, and different econometric specifications. In addition, we show that the effect of government consumption on private consumption and investment does not depend on the phase of the business cycle, but differs substantially among regions. The differentiated effects of government consumption on private consumption and investment among geographical areas are extremely important and need to be further investigated. In particular, it would be interesting to assess to which extent the effect of government spending on consumption and investment depends on political and institutional variables (e. g. democracy, corruption, political stability) as well as macroeconomic variables (income, interest rates, degree of openness).

In this paper, we look at the factors determining sales of individual DVDs in the United States. Using data on new motion pictures released on DVD between 2006 and 2008, we find the demand for new DVDs is price-inelastic and that DVD sales are counter-cyclical. We find that previous box office success has strong positive effects on DVD sales. Production budget also has a positive effect on DVD sales, albeit indirectly through its effect on box office revenues. Critical acclaim has significant positive effects on both box office revenue and DVD sales, but the effect is smaller in regard to DVDs. There is some evidence to suggest that DVD sales are higher for movies with more sexual content and more violent content and lower for movies with more profanity, but these effects are indirect through the changes in the box office of these movies. We find that sales of R-rated DVDs are not as dependent upon critical acclaim as movies of other ratings, and are thus less risky for movie studios to produce. Our findings provide another explanation for the R-rating puzzle.","[Switzer, David M.; Swartz, Brandon J.] St Cloud State Univ, Dept Econ, St Cloud, MN 56301 USA; [Lang, David M.] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Econ, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA",Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Saint Cloud State University; California State University System; California State University Sacramento,"Switzer, DM (通讯作者)，St Cloud State Univ, Dept Econ, St Cloud, MN 56301 USA.",dmswitzer@stcloudstate.edu,,,,,,,20,5,7,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,,,J CULT ECON,J.

They are usually medium to large-scale companies competing with the profit-maximizing firms in the retail sector. This paper describes this situation as a mixed oligopoly in which consumer cooperatives maximize the utility of consumer-members and, in return, refund them with a share of the profits corresponding to the ratio of their individual spending to the cooperative's total sales. We show that when consumers possess quasi-linear preferences over a bundle of symmetrically differentiated goods, and companies operate using a linear technology, the presence of consumer cooperatives positively affects total industry output, as well as welfare. The effect of cooperatives on welfare proves to be even more significant when goods are either complements or highly differentiated, and when competition is a la Cournot rather than a la Bertrand.","[Marini, Marco A.] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dipartimento Econ Soc & Polit, I-60129 Urbino, Italy; [Marini, Marco A.] Univ Roma III, CREI, Rome, Italy; [Zevi, Alberto] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Fac Sci Comunicaz, I-00198 Rome, Italy",University of Urbino; Roma Tre University; Sapienza University Rome,"Marini, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dipartimento Econ Soc & Polit, Via Saffi 42, I-60129 Urbino, Italy.",marco.marini@uniurb.it; alberto.zevi@uniroma1.it,"Marini, Marco/P-7052-2019","Marini, Marco/0000-0002-7452-614X",,,,,47,8,8,0,10,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

Institutional reform, however, increases the diversity of exports in complex goods markets.

We estimate the output gap using the Bayesian multivariate Beveridge-Nelson decomposition method. based on a multivariate dynamic model featuring distinct interactions among inflation, money, and real output in China. The empirical results using quarterly data spanning 1979-2010 show that the new measure of the output gap outperforms the traditional measures in fitting the New Keynesian Phillips curve.

When mutations are excluded, we provide sufficient conditions for selection to favor one strategy over the other and necessary conditions for selection to favor or oppose change, respectively.

I use panel data from professional golf tournaments and find that the presence of a superstar is associated with lower performance. On average, golfers' first-round scores are approximately 0.2 strokes worse when Tiger Woods participates relative to when Woods is absent. The overall tournament effect is 0.8 strokes. The adverse superstar effect varies with the quality of Woods's play.

A theoretical model demonstrates that, under reasonable assumptions about the nature of demand in a market with strong competition, the bookmaker will offer lower prices for bets with comparatively stronger demand. Using a sample of more than 16,000 English soccer matches we find evidence that more favorable odds are extended to bets on more popular clubs and that this effect is amplified on weekends when sentimental bettors face lower opportunity costs to wager. Our findings help to explain why the market for sports gambling operates as a hybrid structure with bookmakers able to attract a considerable share of the betting volume, although identical contracts are traded on exchange markets at lower costs: the organizational design of a quote-driven market enables the dealer to take advantage of sentimental bettor preferences.","[Franck, Egon; Verbeek, Erwin; Nueesch, Stephan] Univ Zurich, Inst Strategy & Business Econ, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Franck, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Strategy & Business Econ, Plattenstr 14, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",egon.franck@business.uzh.ch; erwin.verbeek@business.uzh.ch; stephan.nuesch@business.uzh.ch,,,,,,,34,28,30,1,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

With this in mind, we consider the externalities imposed by entrants on the achievements of incumbent pupils in English primary schools. We find that immobile pupils who experience high pupil entry rates in their yeargroups (a la US grades) progress less well academically between ages 7 and 11 than pupils who experience low mobility in the same school. The disruptive externalities of mobility are statistically significant, but quite small in terms of their educational impact. An increase in annual entry rates from 0 to 10% (a 4 standard deviation change) would set the average incumbent pupil back by between 1 and 2 weeks, or about 5% of one standard deviation of the gain in pupil achievement between ages 7 and 11.

The empirical implication of the model is that both the effects of the shares of public investment and the tax rate on the long-run growth rate are non-linear, following an inverse U-shaped pattern.
