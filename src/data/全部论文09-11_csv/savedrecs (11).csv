It is shown that the usually reported effects on growth of tax-rate variables related to GDP the ratio of public to total investment and that of redistributive transfers to GDP would generally be biased downwards. The signed biases provide a theory-based lens through which some empirical, yet theoretically puzzling, results can be viewed and subsequently discussed.

Specifically, we find that moving students from elementary to middle school in 6th or 7th grade causes significant drops in academic achievement. These effects are large (about 0.15 standard deviations), present for both math and English, and persist through grade 8, the last year for which we have achievement data. The effects are similar for boys and girls, but stronger for students with low levels of initial achievement. We instrument for middle school attendance using the grade range of the school students attended in grade 3, and employ specifications that control for student fixed effects. This leaves only one potential source of bias-correlation between grade range of a student's grade 3 school and unobservable characteristics that cause decreases in achievement precisely when students are due to switch schools-which we view as highly unlikely. We find little evidence that placing public school students into middle schools during adolescence is cost-effective. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the proportion of transferred patents is large and differs across technology fields and especially type of patentees. We also find that the probability of a patent being traded depends on a number of factors-the age of the patent, the number of citations received by a given age, the patent generality, and whether the patent has been previously traded or not. These findings are consistent with the predictions of a model of patent transfers and renewals.","[Serrano, Carlos J.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Serrano, Carlos J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Toronto; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Serrano, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",carlos.serrano@utoronto.ca,"Serrano, Carlos/R-9871-2018","Serrano, Carlos/0000-0002-5792-5210",,,,,44,149,178,6,73,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

The impact of broadband Internet penetration on DVD sales,INFORMATION ECONOMICS AND POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Information goods; Internet penetration; Movie promotion; DVD sales,,"The Internet provides copyright holders with new sales and promotional channels for their content, while also providing consumers with new opportunities to illegally obtain free copies of this content. Unfortunately, disentangling these two effects is extremely difficult. In this paper we attempt to disentangle these two effects by applying fixed effects and first difference models to a new dataset quantifying changes in broadband Internet penetration and DVD sales at a local level from 2000 to 2003. We then compare our results to those reported in Liebowitz (2008), who uses similar models in a similar time period on a similar product category: music CDs. Unlike Liebowitz, who finds a strong negative impact of broadband penetration on music sales, our results show that increased broadband penetration leads to a significant increase in DVD sales. Using the most conservative results, 9.3% of the $14.1 billion increase in DVD sales during our study period can be attributed to increased broadband penetration. One interpretation of these results is that the difference arises from differences in the ability to pirate these two types of content: while Internet music piracy was easy and rampant from 2000 to 2003. Internet movie piracy was difficult and of generally low quality in this time period. If this interpretation is true it would suggest that, in the absence of piracy, the Internet has an overall strong positive impact on media sales. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Dependence on this new form of international specialisation is proportionately larger in East Asia, in particular in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, than in North America and Europe. In this regard, an important recent development has been the rapid integration of China into regional production networks. This development is a counterpoint to the popular belief that China's global integration would crowd out other countries' opportunities for international specialisation. The rise of product fragmentation has strengthened the case for a global, rather than a regional, approach to trade and investment policymaking. Given the global orientation of the region's economies, we question whether there would be a significant benefit from current efforts to promote regional cooperation, unless the principle of 'open regionalism' is recognised.

Our model successfully replicates the patterns routinely found in well-being data - particularly the empirical regularity of an approximately stable level of well-being and the adaptive tendency to return towards that level. The formal model provides a number of testable empirical predictions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the elimination of currency risks, trade flows within the eurozone hardly increased (Bun and Klaassen in Oxf Bull Econ Stat 69:473-496, 2007, Santos Silva and Tenreyro, 2009). Using a standard gravity model, we find that nominal exchange rate volatility has had a negative effect on trade before 1985 but that this effect disappeared in later years, coinciding with the introduction and rapid diffusion of over-the-counter currency swaps. The estimated coefficient for the euro dummy does not change when we include nominal exchange rate volatility as an additional regressor. This confirms our finding that the impact of exchange rate volatility on trade has been small in more recent years.","[Hudson, Alexandra; Straathof, Bas] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Hudson, A (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",lexi.hudson@gmail.com; s.m.straathof@cpb.nl,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,NOV,2010,158.0,4,,,,,361,372,,10.1007/s10645-010-9149-y,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,667CV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283171100002,0

(ii) What drives the regional ethylene prices? The paper is motivated by the recent and growing debate on the lead-lag relationship between crude oil and ethylene prices. Our findings, based on the long-run structural modelling approach of Pesaran and Shin, and subject to the limitations of the study, tend to suggest: (i) crude oil (WTI) price is cointegrated with the regional ethylene prices (ii) our within-sample error-correction model results tend to indicate that although the ethylene prices in North West Europe and the Mediterranean were weakly endogenous, the Far East ethylene price was weakly exogenous both in the short and long term. These results are consistent, during most of the period under review (2000.1-2006.4) with the surge in demand for ethylene throughout the Far East, particularly in China and South Korea. However, during the post-sample forecast period as evidenced in our variance decompositions analysis, the emergence of WTI as a leading player as well, is consistent with the recent surge in WTI price (fuelled mainly, among others, by the strong hedging activities in the WTI futures/options and refining tightness) reflecting the growing importance of input cost in determining the dynamic interactions of input and product prices.

The model predicts that strengthening patent protection increases (a) economic growth by stimulating spending on research and development and (b) income inequality by raising the return on assets. Elastic labor supply creates an additional effect on income inequality. As for consumption inequality, the effect is ambiguous and depends on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Calibrating the model to the U.S. data shows that strengthening patent protection increases income inequality by more than consumption inequality, and this pattern is consistent with the data.","[Chu, Angus C.] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chu, Angus C.] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chu, AC (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",angusccc@gmail.com,"Chu, Angus/GNH-3700-2022",,,,,,41,29,31,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Calls to attract the economy's best and brightest managers to the public sector abound. This paper studies self-selection into managerial positions in the public and private sector, using a model of a perfectly competitive economy where people differ in managerial ability and in public service motivation. We find that, if demand for public sector output is not too high, the equilibrium return to managerial ability is always higher in the private sector. As a result, relatively many of the more able managers self-select into the private sector. Since this outcome is efficient, our analysis implies that attracting a more able managerial workforce to the public sector by increasing remuneration to private-sector levels is not cost-efficient.

Our main results are in stark contrast to the prescriptions of earlier flexible-price Ramsey models. Two especially important findings emerge from our work: the Friedman Rule is typically not optimal and inflation is stable over time. Inflation is not a substitute instrument for a missing tax, as is sometimes the case in standard Ramsey models. Rather, the inflation tax is exactly the right tax to use because the use of money has a rent associated with it. Regarding the optimal dynamic policy, realized (ex-post) inflation is quite stable over time, in contrast to the very volatile ex-post inflation rates that arise in standard flexible-price Ramsey models. We also find that because capital is underaccumulated, optimal policy includes a subsidy on capital income. Taken together, these findings turn conventional wisdom from traditional Ramsey monetary models on its head. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Aruoba, S.

The study uses unit root, cointegration and error-correction models. The long-run demand elasticities of income, own price and price of kerosene oil (substitute) were estimated to be 0.78, -0.62. and 0.14 respectively. The short-run elasticities for the same variables were estimated to be 0.32, -0.16 and 0.10 respectively. Liquefied petroleum (LP) gas is a substitute for electricity only in the short-run with an elasticity of 0.09. The main findings of the paper support the following (1) increasing the price of electricity is not the most effective tool to reduce electricity consumption (2) existing subsidies on electricity consumption can be removed without reducing government revenue (3) the long-run income elasticity of demand shows that any future increase in household incomes is likely to significantly increase the demand for electricity and (4) any power generation plans which consider only current per capita consumption and population growth should be revised taking into account the potential future income increases in order to avoid power shortages in the country.

In this paper, we use a new set of yearly panel data from a large number of countries to evaluate empirically the relationship between unemployment benefits and job reallocation. Unlike previous work assessing the effects of UBs on labor market stocks, we focus on flows and rely on policy experiments, notably the introduction from scratch of unemployment benefits in many countries. We exploit the longitudinal nature of our data to lessen the potentially important selection, endogeneity, and omitted variable problems. We find a positive, sizable, and significant effect of the introduction of UBs on job reallocation, arising mainly from the job destruction margin although this effect fades away over time. These findings appear to be robust to changes in the countries in the sample, control variables or estimation methods. We discuss to what extent our results are consistent with equilibrium matching models with or without endogenous sorting of workers into jobs providing entitlement to UBs and stochastic job matching.

Second, it is hard for ordinary workers, as opposed to optimal planners, to make sensible choices about portfolio allocation.

J,"Gechert, S",,,,"Gechert, Sebastian",,,Supplementary Private Health Insurance in Selected Countries: Lessons for EU Governments?,CESIFO ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,private health insurance; supplementary; country survey,REGULATED COMPETITION; MANAGED CARE; SYSTEMS; POLICY,"A famous idea to maintain affordable health expenditures is to cut back statutory health insurance (SHI) to a basic insurance and to widen the field for supplementary private health insurance (PHI), permitted to cover the remaining benefits and to apply managed care mechanisms. This is supposed to lower public health expenditures and to enhance cost containment and quality of service. To test these reasonings, the article draws empirical evidence from health insurance markets of Australia (AUS), Canada (CAN), and Switzerland (CH) applying a structure, conduct, and performance (SCP) framework. Irrespective of good preconditions for competition, PHI fails to meet the claims in these countries. Quality improvements cannot be expected, as managed care mechanisms are actually not applied. Expensive cream skimming arises instead. Particularly, the unregulated PHI markets (CAN and CH) perform worse compared to their SHI counterparts concerning total expenses and administrative expenses per insuree, while the more regulated PHI market (AUS) can keep up with its SHI pendant. Neither a regulation-to-cost-containment trade-off nor an equality-to-cost-containment trade-off occurs. However, since strong regulation encourages adverse selection, additional incentives are necessary, but they might counteract the aim of lowering public health expenditures.

Panel data estimators are applied on the emigration data from EU-18 into Germany in order to construct possible future scenarios of Turkish migration to the EU. Eventual migration flows from Turkey into the EU are forecasted based on the estimated results. We find that seemingly unrelated regressor is the most efficient estimator that can be applied in Turkey-EU migration framework. Our results reveal that both the network effect and target country labour market conditions represent the strongest determinants for migration, whilst the effect of per capita income is actually relatively low. In particular, Turkish per capita income does not have nearly any effect on migration, because it enters the model in two variables that work against each other. Furthermore, a very low importance of opening the German labour market for Turkish migrants is found. Estimated coefficients are used to predict migrations to Germany, and through appropriate extrapolations to the whole European Union (EU). Three scenarios of migration are created and the sensitivity of estimated coefficients on migration from Turkey into the Germany during next 25 years is further discussed in detail.","[Glazar, Ondrej; Strielkowski, Wadim] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Strielkowski, Wadim] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Charles University Prague; University of Nottingham,"Glazar, O (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",ondra.glazar@seznam.cz; strielkowski@fsv.cuni.cz,"Strielkowski, Wadim/I-4374-2019; Strielkowski, Wadim/J-6112-2017","Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841; Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841",,,,,35,27,27,0,8,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In the framework of Lucas (1982) economy, state-uncertainty preferences amount to assuming that a given level of consumption will yield a higher level of utility the lower is the level of uncertainty perceived by consumers. Under these preferences we can distinguish between two factors driving the exchange rate risk premium: macroeconomic risk and the risk associated with variation in the private agents' perception on the level of uncertainty. Empirical evidence from three main European economies in the transition period to the euro provides empirical support for the model. The model is more successful in accounting for the observed currency risk premium than models with more standard preferences, and the general perception of risk by private agents is shown to be a more important determinant of risk premium than macroeconomic uncertainty.

These changes are significant enough to require corrections to the earlier understanding of Estonia's potential economic growth rate. In this paper the latest data vintage from 2009 is used to estimate Estonia's potential output growth and output gap. The production function approach that has been used shows that the gap varies quite extensively, ranging from -8% in 1999 to +8% in 2007, while the average potential growth rate in 1997-2009 was around 6%. The macro model simulations expect the potential growth rate to fall in the future. The fall in the marginal productivity of production inputs makes growth slow to about 4-5% in the next five years, if there are no additional shocks to the economy.","Eesti Pank, Res Dept, Tallinn, Estonia",Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank),"Kattai, R (通讯作者)，Eesti Pank, Res Dept, Tallinn, Estonia.",rasmus.kattai@eestipank.ee,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,5,EUROBALTIC CENTRES EXCELLENCE,RIGA,"RAINA BLVD 19, RIGA, LV-1586, LATVIA",1406-099X,,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

Putting the new approach of normalized production functions at the heart of a Monte Carlo analysis we identify the conditions under which identification is feasible and robust. The key result is that jointly modeling the production function and first-order conditions is superior to single-equation approaches especially when merged with normalization. Our results will have fundamental implications for production-function estimation under non-neutral technical change, for understanding the empirical relevance of normalization and variability underlying past empirical studies.

We show that although illegal immigration is a boon to a country as a whole, there are distributional effects, whose sign is in general ambiguous. This is because all sources of income of both groups are affected and some of these changes tend to move income in opposite directions. Nevertheless, calibration exercises show that the wealth distribution is likely to become more unequal as the number of illegal immigrants increases. We confirm most of our calibration results analytically in a small open economy version of the basic model. Finally, our results remain robust when we extend the model to allow for endogenous skill acquisition.","[Yip, Chong K.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Peoples R China; [Palivos, Theodore] Univ Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Macedonia,"Yip, CK (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Peoples R China.",tpalivos@uom.gr; chongkeeyip@cuhk.edu.hk,"YIP, Chong/AAU-7049-2020; Palivos, Theodore/A-9807-2009","Yip, CHONG KEE/0000-0003-2950-2461; Palivos, Theodore/0000-0003-2576-7796",,,,,39,6,7,0,20,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

Moreover, we compare Germany to many other European countries and investigate the impact of tax reforms on poverty and richness.

The stability of the long-run relationships is studied using recursive cointegration analysis. The results reveal that the financial linkages between the CEE markets and the world markets increased with the beginning of the EU accession process. Furthermore, the application of the Gonzalo and Granger (J Bus Econ Stat 13:27-35, 1995) methodology indicates that the examined stock markets are partially integrated, while there is also evidence that the emerging stock markets of Central and Eastern Europe except for Estonia together with the German and the US stock markets, have a significant common permanent component, which drives this system of stock exchanges in the long run. Finally, it is worthwhile to note that the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 caused a slowdown in the convergence process. In addition we find evidence that the Slovenian stock market exhibits a moderate increase in the transitory component and this may be attributed to the Slovenian full membership in the euro area.","[Syllignakis, Manolis N.; Kouretas, Georgios P.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Business Adm, GR-10434 Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Kouretas, GP (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Business Adm, 76 Patission St, GR-10434 Athens, Greece.",msyllign@aueb.gr; kouretas@aueb.gr,"Kouretas, Georgios/AAM-7045-2021","Kouretas, Georgios/0000-0001-5459-7824",,,,,38,31,33,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The monopoly may be induced to deliver the good if consumers expect that the monopoly will not deliver in the future if it does not deliver today. If the good is nondurable and consumers are anonymous, the monopoly's optimal strategy is to set a price equal to the static monopoly price each period if the discount factor is high enough, and otherwise to set the lowest price at which it can credibly promise to deliver the good. If the good is durable, we derive an intuitive lower bound on the monopoly's optimal profit for any discount factor and show that it converges to the optimal static monopoly profit as the discount factor converges to 1, in contrast to the Coase conjecture. We also show that rationing the good is never optimal for the monopoly if there is an efficient resale market and that the best equilibrium in which the monopoly always delivers involves a strictly decreasing price path that asymptotes to a level strictly above the ratio of the monopoly's marginal cost to the discount factor.","MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Wolitzky, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",wolitzky@mit.edu,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,20,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

In this paper, we present a model with frictions in the labor market and explore the contribution of these shocks to the volatility of labor market variables, namely, unemployment, vacancies, tightness and the job-finding rate. Thus, our paper contributes to a recent body of literature assessing the ability of the search-and-matching model to account for the large volatility observed in labor market variables. To this aim, we solve a neoclassical economy with search and matching, where neutral and investment-specific technologies are subject to shocks. The three key features of our model economy are: (i) Firms are large, in the sense that they employ many workers. (ii) Adjusting capital and labor is costly. (iii) Wages are the outcome of an intra-firm Nash-bargaining problem between the firm and its workers. In our calibrated economy, we find that shocks to investment-specific technology explain 40% of the observed volatility in U.S. labor productivity. Moreover, these shocks generate relative volatilities in vacancies and the workers' job finding rate which match those observed in U.S. data. Relative volatilities in unemployment and labor market tightness are 55% and 75% of their empirical values, respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We study the issue by developing an on-the-job search model of the US labor market that allows for wage and employment mobility as a result of optimal individual behavior. We estimate its structural parameters on PSID data at different points in time to clarify the sources of the evolution of earnings inequality and instability between 1987 and 1996. This procedure allows to: compute lifetime measure of inequality on top of the usual cross-sectional measure of inequality and provide counterfactual experiments that evaluate the contribution of different parameters to changes over time by taking into account some equilibrium effects. We find that the increase in lifetime inequality and in cross-sectional inequality have been generated by different sources and that these sources are different by skills: changes in the wage offer distribution are the main determinant of the increase in inequality for skilled workers while both mobility changes and wage offer distribution changes are needed to explain changes for the unskilled.

Instead, our estimation strategy follows an event-study approach based on monthly releases in import prices. Projections from a dynamic common factor model with daily panels before and after monthly releases of import prices define the innovation for import prices. We apply our identification procedure to Swiss prices and find strong evidence that the median of the monthly pass-through ratio is around 0.3.

Such areas continue to retain a greater political presence of socially and economically dominant classes. Future research should examine the success of policies that attempt to break such persistence through empowerment of nonelite groups.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate small firms' financing obstacles due to the presence of foreign banks in a transition environment. We use the data set from the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey 2005, conducted by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and World Bank, together with macroeconomic data from EBRD. Our sample contains more than 7,500 firms in twenty-five transition economies. We employ a logit estimation method; to check the robustness of the results, we also employ the ordered logit estimation method. We find that a higher asset share of foreign-owned banks tends to increase firms' financing obstacles, but that foreign banks do not appear to discriminate among the different sizes of the firms. However, small and medium-size firms are more likely to report higher financing obstacles than large firms, regardless of bank ownership.","Grp Legal & Polit Studies, Prishtina, Kosova, Serbia",,"Rraci, O (通讯作者)，Grp Legal & Polit Studies, Prishtina, Kosova, Serbia.",,,,,,,,46,4,4,0,8,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

The floor was tied to depreciation on capital, itself the cumulative sum of past net investments, for which the principle of acceleration provided an explanation. Hence no alien elements were needed to include capital, and so close the system. The resulting model created a growth trend along with growth rate cycles, which could be periodic or quasiperioclic. In the current paper, the ceiling, using capital stock as a capacity limit for production, is added. It then turns out that pure growth no longer exists, and chaos and multistability become possible, which they were not in the previous model.

To this end, we compare and ultimately combine Bayesian and worst-case analysis using four reference models estimated with pre-European Monetary Union (EMU) synthetic data. We start by computing the cost of insurance against model uncertainty, that is, the relative performance of worst-case or minimax policy versus Bayesian policy. While maximum insurance comes at moderate costs, we highlight three shortcomings of this worst-case insurance policy: (i) prior beliefs that would rationalize it from a Bayesian perspective indicate that such insurance is strongly oriented towards the model with highest baseline losses; (ii) the minimax policy is not as tolerant towards small perturbations of policy parameters as the Bayesian policy; and (iii) the minimax policy offers no avenue for incorporating posterior model probabilities derived from data available since monetary union. Thus, we propose preferences for robust policy design that reflect a mixture of the Bayesian and minimax approaches. We show how the incoming EMU data may then be used to update model probabilities, and investigate the implications for policy.

Although laissez-faire capitalism is intrinsically unstable, the lessons from the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression of the 1930s were transformed into theories and institutions or regulations that led to the 30 glorious years of capitalism (1948-77) and that could have avoided a financial crisis as profound as the present one. It did not because a coalition of rentiers and financists achieved hegemony and, while deregulating the existing financial operations, refused to regulate the financial innovations that made these markets even more risky Neoclassical economics played the role of a meta-ideology as it legitimized, mathematically and scientifically neoliberal ideology and deregulation. From this crisis a new democratic capitalist system will emerge, though its character is difficult to predict.

I discuss three lines of work that have elucidated mechanisms that are relevant for development: 1) connections between saving and growth; 2) the determinants of commodity prices, which are a key source of income for many developing countries; and 3) some unexpected puzzles that arise in considering the linkages between income and food consumption. In each case, my discussion illustrates the positivist approach to the hypotheticodeductive method. In this approach, mechanisms are proposed, key predictions derived and tested, and if falsified, the mechanisms are rejected or modified. If the predictions of a mechanism are confirmed, if they are sufficiently specific, and if they are hard to explain in other ways, we attach additional credence to the mechanism, albeit provisionally since later evidence may undermine it. Sometimes the falsifications can be repaired by changing supplementary assumptions, and sometimes they involve long steps backwards where the model is abandoned; and often there is disagreement about which is the correct response.

Using variance decomposition and impulse analyses, we investigated whether the selected EA economies - Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore - are heavily segmented or instead integrated by focusing on the three different shocks, namely global-, regional-, and country-specific shocks. This paper finds that most economies could be described as heavily segmented, especially during the pre-crisis period (before July 1997). However, over time, the degree of segmentation experienced by some of these economies has declined significantly, particularly that of Hong Kong, Korea, and Singapore. The analyses also indicate that few economies, especially Indonesia and the Philippines, are being influenced by the performance of the Japanese economic growth to a greater extent than they were previously.","[Choong, Chee-Keong] Jalan Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Finance, Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Bandar Barat 31900, Kampar Perak Da, Malaysia; [Soo, Siew-Choo] Monash Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor De, Malaysia",Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR); Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Choong, CK (通讯作者)，Jalan Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Finance, Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Perak Campus, Bandar Barat 31900, Kampar Perak Da, Malaysia.",Soo.Siew.Choo@buseco.monash.edu.my; choongck@utar.edu.my,"CHOONG, CHEE KEONG/D-7110-2011","CHOONG, CHEE KEONG/0000-0002-5241-4884",,,,,46,4,4,0,8,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Each player chooses effort, producing a stochastic output or score. Utilities depend on the ranking of all the scores. By clustering scores into grades, the ranking is coarsened, and the incentives to work are changed. We apply games of status to grading exams. Our main conclusion is that if students care primarily about their status (relative rank) in class, they are often best motivated to work not by revealing their exact numerical exam scores (100.99 1), but instead by clumping them into coarse categories (A. B. C). When student abilities are disparate, the optimal absolute grading scheme is always coarse. Furthermore, it awards fewer A's than there are alpha-quality students, creating small elites. When students are homogeneous, we characterize optimal absolute grading schemes in terms of the stochastic dominance between student performances (when they shirk or work) on subintervals of scores, showing again why coarse grading may be advantageous. In both cases, we prove that absolute grading is better than grading on a curve, provided student scores are independent. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The paper also compares the new and old EU members to check whether differences with respect to the determinants of net interest margins between these two groups of countries exist within the same time period. The results indicate that size and managerial efficiency are negatively and significantly related to net interest margins in the two sub-periods. Regulators should promote merger and acquisition and market entry in order to increase the scale and efficiency of banks operating in the sector. Exploitation of the scale economies seems to be important in decreasing the interest rate spread in the sampled banking sectors. The results further indicate that all macroeconomic variables are statistically insignificant in the second sub-period, suggesting that differences in macroeconomic fundamentals have decreased among the sampled countries due to the increased convergence process in recent years. As for the comparison of the new and old EU members, the results suggest that the financial and economic convergence between the new and old members has not been completed. Macroeconomic differences within the group and between the groups still exist. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The givens are a transboundary pollution problem involving two asymmetric countries in terms of benefits arising from global abatement. There is a single polluting firm in each country. We account for two types of IEAs: an agreement based on a uniform standard with transfers and an agreement based on differentiated standards without transfers. To carry out this study, we use a two-stage game where the private sector anticipates its irreversible investment given the expected level of abatement standards resulting from future negotiations. Our findings indicate that the implementation of the agreement based on a uniform standard with transfers may be preferable for the two countries, as it creates greater incentives for firms to invest in costly abatement technology. This result arises when this technology's level of the sunk cost of investment is low. If this level is sufficiently high, the implementation of the same agreement is not beneficial to countries, because it takes away the incentive of each firm to invest in new abatement technology. Moreover, this agreement is not able to generate any positive gains for either country through cooperation, thus no country is motivated to cooperate.","INRA, AgroParisTech, UMR Econ Publ, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France",INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech,"Bayramoglu, B (通讯作者)，INRA, AgroParisTech, UMR Econ Publ, Ave Lucien Bretignieres, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",Basak.Bayramoglu@grignon.inra.fr,"Bayramoglu, Basak/X-1281-2019","Bayramoglu, Basak/0000-0002-0847-5858",,,,,23,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We argue that a firm with a large clientele faces a more severe reputational backlash if it 'reneges', i.e., deviates from its earlier price offer. This allows the firm to effectively commit to its offers, leading to a unique equilibrium without delay. Interestingly, this equilibrium corresponds to the equilibrium of the related model that does not allow for reneging possibilities. For smaller firms, however, the reputational effects are much less intense, and consequently the equilibria may involve deviation possibilities. In this case, the equilibria are non-unique and may involve delays as well.","Indian Stat Inst, Planning Unit, Delhi Ctr 7, New Delhi 110016, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi,"Chowdhury, PR (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Planning Unit, Delhi Ctr 7, SJS Sansanwal Marg, New Delhi 110016, India.",prabalrc@isid.ac.in,,,,,,,5,2,2,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

The experiment highlights the trade-off between social identity concerns and maximization of monetary payoffs. Subjects belonging to two distinct natural groups are randomly assigned gross incomes and vote over alternative redistributive tax regimes, where the regime is chosen by majority rule. We find that a significant subset of the subjects systematically deviate from monetary payoff maximization towards the tax rate that benefits their group when the monetary cost of doing so is not too high. These deviations cannot be explained by efficiency concerns. inequality aversion, reciprocity, social learning or conformity. Finally, we show that behavior in the lab helps explain the relationship between reported income and stated preferences over redistribution observed in survey data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, I consider alternative theories parallel to dictator experiments that generate evidence on both allocation decisions and their effect on feelings. A number of new empirical findings as well as new interpretations for previously reported findings result. A novel test distinguishes warm glow from impure altruism and rules out the former as the sole motive for giving. Very generous donations to charities that aid the needy (with modal gifts of the entire dictator's stakes) cannot be attributed to familiarity with the charities. A charity that offers a matching grant increases its revenues by drawing donors and donations away from one that does not, although aggregate charitable donations do not rise. Additional results on emotions paint a picture of mixed feelings: generosity creates good feelings when the recipients are charities and bad feelings when they are fellow students. No group of dictators, however, feels better, on average, than a control group that is given no opportunity to donate. I propose a simple model that accounts for these results on allocation behavior and feelings by incorporating elements of two approaches, unconditional altruism and social preference theories, that to date have mostly evolved independently. A critical feature of this model is the social norm, and the results of the experiments corroborate the theory in the context of two norms of distributive justice that are important to real world giving: equity and need.

In particular we utilize the Lombardy region administrative archive 'Employment Centers of the Province of Milan', collecting information about careers of workers in the private sector of the Milan area, and administrative flows collecting mandatory workers' individual income tax returns, filed with the National Internal Revenue Service. First, we propose and empirically estimate HC scores in a static (referred to 2004) framework, by means of a realistic measurement model within causal relationships among endogenous and exogenous (investment) HC indicators. Furthermore, the model also specifies a set of (concomitant) indicators that, not belonging to HC investment indicators, have causal impact on endogenous variables and on HC scores, too. Second, we propose a longitudinal analysis (period 2000-2004) aimed to investigate how workers' earned income growth rates vary over workers' educational levels and other personal characteristics. The empirical results of both analyses confirm the characteristics of the Italian job market, denoted by marked inequalities, and knowledge regarding the process of school to work transition, characterized by a weak incidence of education on longitudinal trajectories of earned income.","[Lovaglio, Pietro Giorgio] CRISP, Milan, Italy; [Lovaglio, Pietro Giorgio] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Quantitat Methods Business Econ Sci, Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Lovaglio, PG (通讯作者)，CRISP, Milan, Italy.",,"Lovaglio, Pietro Giorgio/J-8839-2016","Lovaglio, Pietro Giorgio/0000-0002-2340-0547",,,,,61,5,5,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0950-0804,,,J ECON SURV,J.

This paper tries to provide further empirical support for this idea of positive duration dependence and, at the same time, control for the effects of other factors like leading indicators, the duration of the previous phase, investment, price of oil and external influences on the duration of expansions and contractions. This Study employs a discrete-time duration model to analyse the impact of those variables on the likelihood of an expansion and contraction ending in a panel of thirteen industrial countries over the last fifty years. The evidence provided in this paper suggests that the duration of expansions and contractions is not only dependent on their actual age: the duration of expansions is also positively dependent on the behaviour of the variables in the OECD composite leading indicator and on private investment, and negatively affected by the price of oil and by the occurrence of a peak in the US business cycle; the duration of a contraction is negatively affected by its actual age and by the duration of the previous expansion.

The four proposals for reform therein are evaluated. These are: (i) fostering the rental housing market; (ii) suppressing the subsidies to owner-occupied housing embedded in the personal income tax; (iii) eliminating owner-occupied public housing and reorientating it to rental housing; and (iv) suppressing or drastically reducing the tax levied on purchases of pre-existing housing units, using the property tax to offset any loss of tax revenues. Some non-desired effects of these measures are highlighted and some alternatives that would achieve the same objectives with fewer side effects are considered. In particular, it is argued that (ii) unnecessarily restricts the set of instruments available to the policy maker. In fact, an appropriate redesign of tax subsidies could achieve better results. Concerning (iv), it is suggested that its effects might not be those expected, and may even be the opposite.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"García, MAL (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Garcia, Miguel Angel/GXH-1021-2022","Garcia, Miguel Angel/0000-0002-0366-043X",,,,,0,3,3,0,9,UNIV ZARAGOZA,ZARAGOZA,"DEPT ESTRUCTURA ECONOMICA ECONOMIA PUBLICA, GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

To redress this lacuna, we first examine the evolution of conceptual and policy developments directed toward secondary spectrum markets. Then, we seek to move beyond those efforts to empirically document the development of secondary spectrum activity in the United States and the relationship of that development to the evolving policy toward such markets. We categorize and explore different types of secondary spectrum markets. Then, by drawing on a database of every spectrum license transaction since 1994, we explore the depth and breadth of spectrum trading in secondary markets. We find that the FCC has radically reduced the time it takes to approve trades, making the system more akin to notification than to approval. We also find that a large amount of spectrum changes hands each year. While these conclusions do not necessarily imply that secondary markets work efficiently, they do show that policy efforts to facilitate and energize the growth of secondary spectrum markets are bearing considerable fruit.

This paper presents a multiple bounded discrete choice (MBDC) survey model for collecting information about acceptability of different water prices by different types of households and estimating households' willingness to pay for water service improvement. The results obtained from MBDC surveys can be directly utilized in the development of water pricing and subsidy policies. An empirical MBDC study is conducted in Chongqing, China, where domestic water service quality was seriously inadequate, but financial resources were insufficient to improve the service quality. With a survey of 1500 households in five suburban districts in Chongqing Municipality, this study shows that a significant increase in water price is economically feasible as long as the poorest households are properly subsidized. The analysis also indicates that the order in which hypothetical prices are presented to the respondents with the MBDC method can systematically affect the answers and should be taken into account when designing such survey instruments.

Recent econometric literature focuses on testing whether Chinese growth depends on inward FDI rather than measuring the contribution. Foreign Invested Enterprises (FIEs), often (but not exclusively) are joint ventures between foreign companies and Chinese enterprises, and can be thought of as forming a distinctive subpart of the Chinese economy. These enterprises account for over 50% of China's exports and 60% of China's imports. Their share in Chinese GDP has been over 20% in the last two years, but they employ only 3% of the workforce, since their average labor productivity exceeds that of Non-FIEs by around 9:1. Their production is more heavily for export rather than the domestic market because FIEs provide access to both distribution systems abroad and product design for export markets. Our decomposition results indicate that China's FIEs may have contributed over 40% of China's economic growth in 2003 and 2004. and without this inward FDI, China's overall GDP growth rate could have been around 3.4 percentage points lower. We suggest that the sustainability of both China's export and overall economic growth may be questionable if inward FDI plateaus in the future. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Wage profiles steepened for cohorts entering after 1997, but not for cohorts entering in the 1980s - a period when start wages were relatively high. We argue that these patterns are consistent with a model of implicit contracts with recontracting in which a worker's current wage is determined by the best labour market conditions experienced during the current job spell.","[Green, David A.; Townsend, James] Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Green, DA (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",j.townsend@uwinnipeg.ca,,,,,,,17,9,9,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

To provide a setting for this new rationale, the present paper studies the socially optimal choice of living standards over time by social planners for countries that, from low levels of total factor productivity (TFP), experience a gradual catch-up of their TFP level with that of the leader country. In the TFP catch-up scenario, the socially optimal choice of consumption and saving based on time additive preferences leads to no catch-up of living standards. To generate living standard catch-up we propose other-regarding Uzawa preferences, in which the rate of time preference is influenced by the gap in living standards between follower country and leader country. This other-regarding specification is consistent with recent findings emphasized in behavioural economics. The other-regarding Uzawa preferences form is illustrated quantitatively by simulating a model of the world economy.","[McDonald, Ian M.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Guest, Ross S.] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",University of Melbourne; Griffith University,"McDonald, IM (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Level 5,Econ & Commerce Bldg, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",i.mcdonald@unimelb.edu.au,,"Guest, Ross/0000-0002-7171-3054",,,,,21,1,1,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

A model of variable costs and factor demand functions for different skill levels and imported as well as domestic materials are constructed. International outsourcing is treated directly as a substitution process between labour of different skills and imported inputs. The direct consequence of international outsourcing for labour is measured by the cross price elasticities. These cross price elasticities indicate a negative outsourcing impact on low- and medium-skilled labour in the three countries and on high-skilled labour in two out of the three countries. This outsourcing effect on labour is compared with the direct effect of embodied technical change and of the technical change bias. International outsourcing has a more unambigous and significant negative impact on labour than technical change. Technical change is either labour using (embodied technical change) or only slightly biased in favour of high-skilled labour. When the cost savings effect of international outsourcing is taken into account, an indirect positive stimulus for all skill categories arises from a greater demand for goods. It can be shown, that this indirect positive effect can compensate for a large part of the negative substitution impact of international outsourcing on labour.","Austrian Inst Econ Res, A-1103 Vienna, Austria",,"Kratena, K (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res, POB 91, A-1103 Vienna, Austria.",Kurt.Kratena@wifo.ac.at,,"Kratena, Kurt/0000-0003-2159-2108",,,,,25,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2010,37.0,1,,,SI,,65,85,,10.1007/s10663-009-9119-2,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V25OC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208486300005,0

Working Paper 5718, National Bureau of Economic Research, http://www.nber.org/papers/w5718, 1996) introduced an idealized model for pairing workers and managers with different skill levels into small teams selected to maximize productivity. They used it to analyze the impact of technological change and widening skill gaps on labor market segregation. The present paper extends their model to a workforce with multidimensional skill types, continuously distributed, and gives a mathematical analysis of the extension. Pure and mixed notions of optimal pairing are introduced, which play an important role in the formulation and analysis of the model. The existence and uniqueness of such pairings are established using techniques from the theory of optimal transportation and infinite-dimensional linear programming.","[McCann, Robert J.] Univ Toronto, Dept Math, Toronto, ON M5S 2E4, Canada; [Trokhimtchouk, Maxim] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Math, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Toronto; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"McCann, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Math, Toronto, ON M5S 2E4, Canada.",mccann@math.toronto.edu; trokhim@math.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,29,7,7,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The model allows for foreign direct investment in business services and endogenous productivity effects from additional varieties of business services and goods produced under imperfect competition. The authors then show that these features are crucial to the results, as the welfare gains are about 20 times greater than in a constant-returns-to-scale model. The results for the estimated gains vary considerably across the regions; this is principally explained by the ability of the different regions to benefit from a reduction in barriers against foreign direct investment.","[Rutherford, Thomas F.] ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tarr, David G.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; The World Bank,"Rutherford, TF (通讯作者)，ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",TRutherford@ethz.ch; dtarr@worldbank.org,,,,,,,18,13,17,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The analysis allows the buyer and seller to have possibly differing views as to how likely such a competition is. Hence the buyer and the seller disagree about their respective bargaining powers. These views adjust to market realizations as the parties learn. It is shown that there exists a unique subgame perfect equilibrium which can be explicitly constructed: hence, conditional on market conditions, equilibrium prices and optimal stall lengths (that is, delay) can be found. Bargaining delay can only occur if there is optimism (not pessimism) and only if the parties are open to learning as time elapses. This delay can occur even for very small levels of optimism and the delay can be for economically significant periods.

The candidate is hired if accepted by at least one player and not vetoed. The total number of vetoes available for each player are fixed in advance. We prove the existence of a subgame perfect equilibrium if there are a finite number of candidates types.

Obtained results are to some extent unexpected given spotted inefficiencies on Croatian equity market that should have been exploited by active stock pickers.","[Barbic, Tajana; Condic-Jurkic, Iva] Inst Econ, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb,"Barbic, T (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Trg JF Kennedya 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",tbarbic@eizg.hr; icondic@eizg.hr,,"Barbic, Tajana/0000-0002-3559-7893",,,,,44,1,1,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The peak in global oil production is likely to happen in the next ten to fifteen years, if it hasn't already happened, and decisions to be made in the near future are likely to have large impacts on our quality of life in the coming decades. This study presents an integrated tool for national energy planning customized to North America. The authors analyzed the impact of world oil production on economic, social and environmental indicators. Two cases of global ultimate recoverable oil reserves are considered, a low and medium estimate within current research. Three sets of policy directions were chosen: Business As Usual (Market Based), Maximum Push for Renewables, and Low Carbon Emissions. Results of the simulations show that without restrictions on emissions coal becomes the dominant energy in the longer term. On the other hand, if US policymakers are able to effectively implement the necessary polices. such as a 20% RPS by 2020 and increased CAFE Standards, along with increased energy conservation and efficiency, the medium to longer-term economic impacts of a global peak in oil production can be mitigated, while a sustained reduction in emissions would require a larger effort.

In most cases the deregulated market has lived up to expectations but there were situations when priority was again given to the regulated market. The aim of this article is to assess whether the deregulated electricity market is a good choice for the countries with a small and imperfect market. Electricity is completely homogenous and it might not be warehoused and its price depends on the fuel used, so the examples of other economic sectors (natural gas, water, telecommunications, etc.) sometimes cannot be applied for this market.. This paper analyses the advantages and disadvantages and the potential threats of the deregulated electricity market; moreover, the paper presents the main principles lying behind the electricity price setting and analyses whether the deregulated electricity market fits for Lithuania.","[Burinskiene, Marija] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Rudzkis, Paulius] Mykolas Romeris Univ, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Mykolas Romeris University,"Burinskiene, M (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",marija.burinskiene@vgtu.lt; paulius.rudzkis@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,4,4,0,8,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-8619,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Guided by this analysis, we then develop an empirical method to measure an individual's propensity to attend to attributes. As a proof of concept, we offer an empirical example of our method using a conjoint analysis of demand for programs to reduce health risks. Our results suggest that respondents differentially allocate attention across attributes as a function of the mix of attribute levels in a choice set. This behaviour can cause researchers who fail to model attention allocation to estimate incorrectly the marginal utilities derived from selected attributes. This illustrative example is a first attempt to implement an attention-corrected choice model with a sample of field data from a conjoint choice experiment.","[Cameron, Trudy Ann] Dept Econ, 435 PLC,1285 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [DeShazo, J.

The first-best solution is decentralized by a simple Pigouvian (paternalistic) consumption tax (along with suitable lump-sum taxes). In a second-best setting, when personalized lump-sum transfers are not available, consumption taxes may have conflicting paternalistic and redistributive effects. Taxes should discourage consumption of goods that entail negative externalities (unforeseen habits), but instead they discourage less the consumption of goods that are proportionately consumed by individuals with high net social marginal utility of income.

The results from previous papers show a strong negative effect for an entire area around a country suffering from conflict, but this paper reaches a different conclusion, by using more recent data and adjusting the methodology previously employed. Additionally, a new type of contiguity matrix is constructed and used in the actual analysis. The final analysis consists of a large number of regressions and concludes that conflict actually has two opposing effects. First, like conflict countries themselves, directly contiguous countries actually suffer from the negative effects of proximate conflict. Secondly, however, there is also a positive spillover of conflict, which affects non-contiguous countries and this effect is larger for countries that are closer to the conflict country. The results from the paper predominantly hold for the most violent kind of conflict.","German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"De Groot, OJ (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",odegroot@diw.de,,,,,,,25,33,42,2,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Our results differ from those of Mirman and Sharma (2008), who found that the Winter Games have a significantly negative announcement impact, whereas there is no effect for the Summer Games. Our results rely on a larger sample of 15 Olympic events and are obtained by assessing the abnormal returns after the announcement against a 'business-as-usual' situation (instead of testing the difference between winners and losers). Our findings are in line with economic intuition: the Summer Games represent a larger event and are thus more likely to make a significant impact.

While ostensibly protecting their citizens from the environmental and health side-effects of a particular product, countries could enact standards that are facially-neutral, but impose greater compliance costs on foreign producers. This paper examines the impact of trade liberalization on standard setting by using a two-country Cournot duopoly model in which the Domestic government imposes a standard to mitigate a consumption externality. The standard increases production costs for both Domestic and Foreign firms, especially for the latter. The paper finds that one cannot make an unequivocal connection between falling tariffs and subsidies and rising standards. If the initial tariffs or subsidies are prohibitive, reducing subsidies and tariffs to allow minimal import penetration will generally create incentives for the Domestic government to impose higher standards. If the ex ante tariffs are not prohibitive, however, it is only optimal for the government to raise standards following tariff cuts if (i) tariff revenues are an important component of the welfare calculus and the ex ante tariff rate is high, or (ii) the standard's effect on the per unit externality is large. Likewise, if the initial subsidies are small enough to allow imports the government should only raise standards following subsidy reductions if the per unit externality is substantial, or the standard's impact on the per unit externality is large.","Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Essaji, A (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",aessaji@wlu.ca,,,,,,,29,7,8,2,13,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Next we compare the effects of asymmetric foreign influence in a world with no WTO and no multilateral principles (most-favorednation principle, MFN, and the negotiation principle of reciprocity) to a situation with WTO and its associated non-discrimination principles.

A probability is evaluated based on the experienced relative frequencies of outcomes that had that stated probability, as well as outcomes of other lotteries that had similar stated probabilities. This process may result in distortion of probabilities as observed in the literature, and in particular, in overvaluing low probabilities and undervaluing high probabilities. If the decision maker uses a less permissive similarity function as the size of memory grows, she will learn the real value of the stated probabilities. If, however, the similarity function is independent of memory, biases persist even when data are accumulated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The development of Lithuanian, as well as of the other post-Soviet countries has caused sport system to go through the immense multimeaningful change. Structural changes inside the system, inside and outside judicial environment, the expansion of the market relations are an everyday success guarantee for every sport organisation. Dynamic development of sports requires timely and qualified decisions in a constantly changing environment of opportunities. The top sport manager plays an ideological role in the post-Soviet system. Top manager plays a crucial role in the modern sports world by putting his/her knowledge and capabilities to have the organisational goals met by striving for quality and meeting the needs of the members and market. The quest for higher performance by public organizations is a central and recurring theme in government policies and academic research (Boyne, Farrell, Law, Powell, Walker, 2003; Pollitt, Bouckaert, 2000). For complex and permanent modernization of public sector, a complex strategy of modernization is required (vision, mission, provisions, and concepts of modernization) (Skietrys, Raipa, Bartkus, 2008). An effective strategy formation capability is a complex organizational resource a dynamic capability that should lead to superior performance (Slater, Olson, Huh, 2006). Although the notion of strategy has its origins in the military arena, strategic planning in recent years has been primarily focused on private sector organizations and much of the theory assumes that those in executive control of an organization have the freedom to determine its direction. Strategic planning is a means to an end, a method used to position an organization, through prioritizing its use of resources according to identified goals, in an effort to guide its direction and development over a period of time (Wilkinson, Monkhouse, 1994). Research on the general topic of organizational performance in the public sector is limited in quantity and quality (Boyne, 2003), so it is hardly surprising that the reversal of organizational decline has received little serious academic attention. Interest in the subject has come largely from practitioners rather than researchers (Borins, 1998; Moore, 1995). It is important to stress at the outset that public and private management are significantly different in several respects. For example, public organizations are generally more bureaucratic, public managers have less discretion over organizational missions and personnel, and the staff in public organizations is less likely to be motivated by financial incentives (Nutt, Backoff 1993).","[Gedvilaite-Moan, Akvile] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Laskiene, Skaiste] Lithuanian Acad Phys Educ, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Lithuanian Sports University,"Gedvilaite-Moan, A (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Daukanto Str 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",a.gedvilaite@evf.vdu.lt; s.laskiene@lkka.lt,,,,,,,57,3,3,1,27,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We find that married individuals living in small households, with educated heads in urban areas are better equipped to smooth consumption. Investigating the impact of idiosyncratic shocks, we find that the labour market is an important transmission mechanism allowing households to smooth their consumption but also exposing them to risk, mainly through job loss. Outside of pension payments, the formal social safety net does not facilitate consumption smoothing, thus heightening the importance of informal coping institutions. It transpires that both support from relatives/friends and home production act as important insurance mechanisms for the most vulnerable. In contrast with previous findings, it would seem that regardless of its historical, political and social roots, the garden plots and dachas, often romanticized in Russian literature, do provide a means by which 'urban' Russians are able to cope with economic fluctuations.

The literature on strategic deficit and debt behaviour originates from the question whether or not incumbent policymakers run higher budget deficits than they would if they were confident of re-election. In this paper, we introduce a vote function to estimate the probability of electoral defeat and present evidence of strategic debt in line with Persson & Svensson (1989), but only for leftist governments with expected vote percentages below 49%.

Firm level evidence from manufacturing,POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DIVERSIFICATION,"After 20 years of transition, productivity in Eastern Germany is still considerably below the Western level. We study the development of the East-West productivity gap at the firm level and link it to firms' product policy. Redesigning their product range was a major challenge for Eastern enterprises as they sought their place in the international division of labour. Based on data from manufacturing we apply a non-parametric extension of the widely used Oaxaca-Blinder method to decompose the average East-West productivity difference. By running separate decompositions for modifiers and non-modifiers of the product range we study the impact of product policy on the productivity gap. We find that the time span 1995-2004 has two component periods: a period of adaptation from 1995 to 2001 and a period of branding from 2002 to 2004. The initial period is characterised by a smaller share of Eastern firms that modify their product range and by a large productivity gap between Eastern and Western non-modifiers of comparable size and sector. The evidence for the second period, however, points to a more active and established role of Eastern German manufacturers: more of them alter their product range and step up their productivity performance.","[Werwatz, Axel] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Voshage, Ramona] Res Data Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Goerzig, Bernd; Gornig, Martin] DIW, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Werwatz, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",axel.werwatz@tu-berlin.de,,,,,,,20,2,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,4,,,,,499,511,PII 929159679,10.1080/14631377.2010.518459,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,676AU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283883300005,0

To assess the robustness of our findings, we examine the forecasting performance of a non-linear, non-parametric model in the spirit of Francis Diebold and James Nason (1990) and find that it is able to significantly improve upon the random walk model, thus confirming the existence of foreign exchange market imperfections in a small transition economy such as Serbia.

In the repeated game all firms discount future profits using the same discount factor. Their payoffs are expressed as average discounted profits. A strict strong perfect equilibrium is a solution concept that we apply to the repeated game.

In dealing with the impacts of market imperfections on a financial theory, financial researchers often modify the theory by incorporating one type of market imperfections into the theory, one by one, and then derive a new modified formula. The major problem with this approach is that when considering a type of market imperfections, the new modified formula still ignores the effects of other types of market imperfections. Another problem is that the modified formula is often tedious. Following the concept of degree of market imperfection in Hsu and Wang (2004), this article aims to derive a more easy measurement of market imperfections between markets, discuss some useful applications and provide one of empirical tests. The degree of market imperfection between markets can be applied at least to the following areas: (1) theoretical model building for pricing derivatives in imperfect markets, (2) predicting the deviations of the actual derivative prices from their theoretical prices based on the model of perfect market assumptions and (3) showing the extent of arbitrage activities between markets.","[Hsu, Hsinan; Wu, Hsing-Chi] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Lee, Hsien-Yi] Cheng Shiu Univ, Dept Business Adm, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Wang, Janchung] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Financial Operat, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",Feng Chia University; Cheng Shiu University; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Hsu, HN (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.",hsinan@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,,22,1,3,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Results suggest that an increase in economic growth, inflation and terms of trade all have a significant positive impact on household and private saving rates. In contrast, the availability of bank credit tends to reduce household and private saving rates. While an increase in both old and young dependency has a negative impact on household and private saving rates, the magnitude of the impact on the former is far greater than that on the latter. Furthermore, public saving seems to crowd out household and private saving, but less than proportionately. This reflects a possible role of fiscal policy in increasing national savings in the economy. Over and above these variables, corporate saving is another important determinant of household saving. An increase in the former brings about a significant reduction in the latter.","Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Jongwanich, J (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines.",jjongwanich@adb.org,,,,,,,31,12,14,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis the enormous increase in sovereign debt has emerged as an important negative outcome, since public debt was dramatically increased in an effort by the US and the European governments to reduce the accumulated growth of private debt in the years preceding the recent financial turmoil. Although Greece is the country member of the eurozone that has been in the middle of this ongoing debt crisis, since November 2009 when it was made clear that its budget deficit and mainly its public debt were not sustainable, Greece's fiscal crisis is not directly linked to the 2007 US subprime mortgage loan market crisis. As a result of this negative downturn the Greek government happily accepted a rescue plan of 110 billion euros designed and financed by the European Union and the IMF. A lengthy austerity programme and a fiscal consolidation plan have been put forward and are to be implemented in the next three years.","[Kouretas, Georgios P.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Business Adm, Athens, Greece; [Kouretas, Georgios P.] Cambridge Judge Business Sch, CIBAM, Cambridge, England; [Vlamis, Prodromos] London Sch Econ, Hellen Observ, London, England",Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Cambridge; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kouretas, GP (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Business Adm, Athens, Greece.",kouretas@aueb.gr; vlamis@kepe.gr,"Kouretas, Georgios/AAM-7045-2021","Kouretas, Georgios/0000-0001-5459-7824; VLAMIS, PRODROMOS/0000-0002-4560-4321",,,,,25,74,83,1,119,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2010,57.0,4,,,,,391,404,,10.2298/PAN1004391K,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,701IR,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285812100001,0

Using data on Jumbo Pfandbriefe and German government bonds, the author derives an accurate estimate of the term structure of liquidity spreads in the period January 1999 to October 2008. On average, long maturity bonds exhibit a higher liquidity premium than short maturity bonds. In times of crisis, however, the term structure can invert. A principal components analysis shows that 78.70% of the total variation in liquidity spread changes can be explained by a single component and augmented Dickey-Fuller tests reject the hypothesis of a unit root for liquidity spread changes in all maturity classes under examination. Therefore, an affine one-factor model of the term structure of liquidity spread changes is presented and a factor time series is extracted by the use of a Kalman filter in combination with Maximum Likelihood estimation of the model parameters. Subsequently, the models' empirical performance is analysed using differences between real and model spread changes as well as one-step-ahead prediction errors generated by the Kalman filter. On average the model provides an adequate fit of the term structure of liquidity spreads for medium term maturities.","Univ Appl Sci Wiesbaden, Sch Business, Wiesbaden, Germany",,"Lange, D (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Wiesbaden, Sch Business, Wiesbaden, Germany.",,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,6,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

This article presents a unifying approach for calculating indicators of tourism linkages and leakages, derives these multipliers for a large sample of more than 150 countries and statistically assesses the relationship among the multipliers, along with several other economic indicators. Contrary to widely held views, the multipliers for tourism linkages and leakages are noncomplementary, as they are based on different economic concepts, so that no particular correlation is to be expected. This independence is confirmed in the empirical cross-country analysis. Moreover, the analysis finds a positive association between the degree of linkages and per-capita income, trade openness and the friendliness of the business climate.","[Walkenhorst, Peter] World Bank, Int Trade Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Lejarraga, Iza] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",The World Bank; Harvard University,"Walkenhorst, P (通讯作者)，World Bank, Int Trade Dept, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",peter.walkenhorst@stanfordalumni.org,,,,,,,6,22,24,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The forecast error variance decompositions and impulse-response functions are obtained via simulating the VAR model. Our results indicate why previous studies, in which abnormal volatilities were not taken into account, confronted biased and inconsistent results. Biased results from previous studies tend to be caused by not differentiating between normal and abnormal volatilities, and the results of this study provide a valuable reference for efforts to end conflicting arguments for whether destabilizing or stabilizing stock markets of foreign investor transactions.

Higher rates of interest lead to an increase in the financial burden of debt, and as a result to an increase in budget deficits. Also, high rates of interest attract capital inflows, leading to an appreciation and a reduction of the payments on debt in domestic currency. The net effect of higher rates of interest on public debt depends on the relative strength of both effects. Our analysis shows that, under specific conditions regarding the size of pass-through effects and the elasticity of public debt to changes in the rate of interest, the control of the exchange rate allows controlling both inflation and the debt-to-GDP ratio.","[Marquetti, Adalmir] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Econ, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Schonerwald da Silva, Carlos] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Dept Econ, Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil; [Vernengo, Matias] Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Pontificia Universidade Catolica Do Rio Grande Do Sul; Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos); Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Marquetti, A (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Econ, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",aam@pucrs.br; cschonerwald@unisinos.br; vernengo@economics.utah.edu,"Marquetti, Adalmir A./E-6207-2017",,,,,,13,1,1,0,11,UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO,COYOACAN C P,"CIUDAD UNIV, FAC ECONOMIA, CIRCUITO INTEROR S-N, 1ER PISO, EDIFICIO B, COYOACAN C P, 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

One such example is tax compliance where self-assessment (SA) has raised concerns that such transfers may place a particularly heavy burden on lower income and elderly taxpayers. This is the first study since its introduction into the UK in 1996 of the regulatory burden, which SA imposes on individuals. We identify both the total compliance burden and its components for individuals who might be expected to incur high compliance costs because they pay tax on nonbusiness employment income. We use a specially designed questionnaire and find that within this group the burden seems to have increased by less than 25%. Compliance costs are regressive, but do not impinge disproportionately on the elderly. The compliance burden is determined by income, occupation, education (but not specifically in accounting subjects) and difficulty in attending to tax affairs, indicating some possibilities for reducing these compliance costs.","[Mathieu, Laurence; Price, Catherine Waddams] Univ E Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Mathieu, Laurence; Price, Catherine Waddams; Antwi, Francis] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Price, CW (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",c.waddams@uea.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,26,8,8,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The importance of the sector results from the fact that with comparison to the whole country Podlaskie Voivodship ranks among the least developed regions of Poland and the European Union. That is mainly a consequence of a historically formed structure and a peripheral location. The manifestation of this backwardness is not only a low level of GDP per capita, but also agriculture and farm and food processing share prevailing in the economic structure. Taking that into consideration, the identification of factors determining development of this sector in Podlaskie Voivodship has a great significance has. Nowadays it is emphasised that development of enterprises is determined not only by the level of innovation and technology. An ability of enterprises to create relative capital becomes very important. The results of research show that relative capital, particularly in the context of creating long lasting relationships with customers and suppliers is a significant factor of food enterprises' development in Podlaskie Voivodship. It results mainly from the necessity to stand out in the market and create brands. The examined companies realize the essence of offer positioning, particularly when are confronted with domestic and foreign competition. It may be also concluded that the crisis strengthened the role of marketing, thus relative capital in creating a competitive position. However, on the other hand it should be emphasised that they are only some symptoms showing directions for development of food industry enterprises in Podlasie. It may prove a market maturity of examined enterprises, but also it allows to believe that marketing is treated rather as a category of traditional instruments, but not as a modem form of market activation. As it turns out not many of examined enterprises intend to extend their activity into other market segments. Also the fact that small companies of the sector pay little attention to recognition of an enterprise in the market argues for such conclusions. It may be a result of their strong orientation on local markets, however such assessment may also prove unsatisfactory level of development in the marketing sphere of small enterprises and limited awareness within image creation. Thus, creating relative capital and consequences of this process are still an important strategic challenge for enterprises of food industry in Podlaskie Voivodship.","[Michalczuk, Grazyna] Fac Econ & Management Bialystok, Finance & Accounting Dept, Bialystok, Poland; [Widelska, Urszula] Univ Finance & Management Bialystok, Dept Mkt, Bialystok, Poland",,"Michalczuk, G (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Management Bialystok, Finance & Accounting Dept, Bialystok, Poland.",michal149@vp.pl,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-601-4,,,,2010,,,,,,,288,296,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9EP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000393151400035,0

In this article, we undertake direct, farm-level evaluation of the impact of ozone by estimating a multi-output profit function using a panel dataset of cereal farms in England and Wales. A system of equations, comprising the profit function, input and output share equations is estimated using a fixed-effects seemingly unrelated regression technique, with ozone as a quasi-fixed input. Estimated parameters are used to calculate tropospheric ozone-related profit and output supply elasticities. The main findings from the profit function show that a 10% increase in average ozone levels would decrease variable profits by 1.3% and wheat output supply by 1%.

This study examines the impact of releasing a film on DVD before the film ends its theatrical run. Based on a sample of the top 50 grossing films in the USA over the period 2001 to 2005, our results indicate that roughly a quarter of the films appear on DVD before exiting the theatres, and that studios release these films on DVD after they have been in the theatres for an average of 20 weeks. By delaying the DVD release until the twentieth week, studios minimize the impact on box office revenues, as the average films take in 95% of its total box office growth by the seventh week in distribution. Regression results indicate that an early DVD release reduces box office revenues by 46%, or $303 989, which represents an average of 0.21% of a film's total box office revenue.","[Nelson, Randy A.; Rutherford, Patrick] Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04091 USA",Colby College,"Nelson, RA (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04091 USA.",ranelson@colby.edu,,,,,,,10,2,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

There were two cointegrating vectors and six common stochastic trends in the model. The cointegrating vectors were estimated by the same approach used by Pesaran et al. (2000). The first cointegrating vector is interpreted as G-PPP, and the second one is interpreted as the extended G-PPP. According to G-PPP, these countries could form a single currency area. The first stochastic trend is primarily driven by Japan's real money supply; the second, third and fourth by the real exchange rates of the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, respectively; the fifth by Japan's output; and the sixth by Japan's government bond yields.","[Rangkakulnuwat, Poomthan] Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Sch Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Ahn, Sung] Washington State Univ, Dept Management & Operat, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Wang, Holly; He, Susan] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",University Thai Chamber Commerce; Washington State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Washington State University,"Rangkakulnuwat, P (通讯作者)，Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Sch Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",poomthan_ran@utcc.ac.th,"Wang, H.

In this game, decision makers face uncertainty about the consequences of their choice, but can rely on recommendations from advisors. Financial incentives between alternatives are not aligned for the two players, which produces an incentive to lie. While many advisors tell the truth against their monetary self-interest, the propensity to tell the truth is unaffected by the contextual variation. In contrast, decision makers show less trust in a competitive context, but only when they have no explicit information about the payoff alignment. The context seems to shape their belief about the situation. The data of this study is largely in line with Subjective Equilibrium Analysis [Kalai, E., Lehrer, E., 1995.

The posted prices depend on time and have the desirable property of being step functions. When the optimal mechanisms are stochastic, it is optimal for the monopolist to price discriminate over time, contrary to the conventional wisdom that a single-good monopolist committed to an ex-ante price strategy will not price discriminate.","Auburn Univ, Montgomery, AL USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University Montgomery; Auburn University,"Runco, MG (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Montgomery, AL USA.",mrunco@aum.edu,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,5,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

When an agent receives a revision opportunity, he chooses a new strategy using a noisy best response rule that satisfies mild regularity conditions; best response with mutations, logit choice, and probit choice are all permitted. We study the long run behavior of the resulting Markov process when the noise level eta is small and the population size N is large. We obtain a precise characterization of the asymptotics of the stationary distributions mu(N,eta) as eta approaches zero and N approaches infinity, and we establish that these asymptotics are the same for either order of limits and for all simultaneous limits. In general, different noisy best response rules can generate different stochastically stable states. To obtain a robust selection result, we introduce a refinement of risk dominance called stochastic dominance, and we prove that coordination on a given strategy is stochastically stable under every noisy best response rule if and only if that strategy is stochastically dominant.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Sandholm, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",whs@ssc.wisc.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0851580] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,35,32,36,0,7,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

The general findings tend to invalidate the REH: a finite time horizon and the presence of liquidity-constrained individuals are the sources of deviation from the REH. Empirical results reveal that real per-capita private consumption (C) under various specifications is cointegrated generally at the 5% level with real per-capita income (Y), government expenditure before and after interest rate repayments (G and G2), taxes (T) and the interest rate (r). Results reveal that an increase in G, G2, T and r reduces C and that an increase in budget deficits raises trade deficits.

Two breaks in interest rates are found to coincide with the 1982/83 and 1990/91 recessions or the 1993 inflation targeting period. We further investigate the implications of these structural breaks on the cointegrating relationship implied by the single, linear expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates. While there is evidence that the data are consistent with the expectations hypothesis at the shorter end of the term structure, breaks in interest rates generate a shift in the cointegrating relationship, thus altering the information content of the term structure. Failing to account for a regime shift in the cointegration regression, the data erroneously supports the expectations hypothesis at the longer end of the term structure. These results have profound implications for policy makers who may inadequately exploit the information content of the term structure to predict future changes in inflation.","Bundoora La Trobe Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",La Trobe University,"Suardi, S (通讯作者)，Bundoora La Trobe Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",s.suardi@latrobe.edu.au,"suardi, sandy/JXY-3445-2024","suardi, sandy/0000-0002-0491-8957",,,,,43,2,3,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, these studies have been confined to the conventional banking sector. On the other hand, virtually nothing has been published in respect to the impact of foreign banks entry on the Islamic banking sector. The purpose of the present paper is to provide new empirical evidence on the impact of foreign banks entry on the efficiency of the incumbent domestic and foreign Islamic banks. Although there exist several other studies which have examined the performance of the Malaysian Islamic banking sector (e. g. Samad, 1999; Samad and Hassan, 2000; Sufian, 2007; Mokhtar et al. 2008, Majid et al. 2009, and others), the focus of these studies have not been the impact of foreign banks entry. The present study therefore attempts to fill in the gap and add insights to the present literature in several respects as follows: First, by employing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method, we examine whether the De Novo foreign Islamic banks are relatively more efficient than the incumbent domestic and foreign Islamic banks. To date, empirical evidence form the contemporary banking industry has mainly suggested that foreign banks in developing countries outperform their domestic bank counterparts. It is therefore interesting to examine whether the same is applicable to the Islamic banking sector. Second, we compute a battery of DEA-based parametric and non-parametric tests to examine the difference in the efficiency of the Malaysian Islamic banking sector between the pre and post-entry periods. During both periods, the efficiency scores of the De Novo and the incumbent banks will be compared. By doing so, we would be able to shed some light on the sources of inefficiency in the Malaysian Islamic banking sector in general, differentiate between the De Novo and the incumbent banks' efficiency scores, and assess the impact of foreign banks entry on the efficiency of the incumbent banks. In undertaking the study, we have gathered information from the yearly financial statements of the two full-fledged domestic Islamic banks, three full-fledged foreign Islamic banks, 11 domestic IBS (Islamic banking scheme) banks, and four foreign IBS banks for the period 2001 to 2008. The empirical findings from this study suggest that the domestic banks have been relatively more efficient than their foreign and De Novo bank counterparts, while the De Novo banks have been the least efficient banking groups. The results indicate that the Malaysian Islamic banking sector has exhibited a lower level of efficiency during the post-entry of the De Novo banks period. The findings from the study should interest not only the managers of the banks, but numerous stakeholders such as the central banks, bankers associations, governments, and other financial authorities.","[Sufian, Fadzlan; Habibullah, Muzafar Shah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,,fadzlan.sufian@khazanah.com.my; muzafar@econ.upm.edu.my,"Sufian, Fadzlan/AAY-6856-2020",,,,,,64,7,7,1,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It is documented that while the (linear) dependency structure is of a short memory, in order to estimate the higher moments (skewness and kurtosis) of the underlying distribution well, longer time series is required.

When the results are compared at the international level, findings suggest that: a) there is a higher incidence of co-innovation on productivity in U.S. and Australian firms, as it also happens in the European context; b) there is no relevant impact of ICT use in Spanish firms' productivity; and c) related to that, there is a significant delay in the implementation of the co-innovative productivity sources in the Catalan firms.","[Torrent-Sellens, Joan; Ficapal-Cusi, Pilar] Univ Oberta Cataluna UOC, Barcelona, Spain",UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,"Torrent-Sellens, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oberta Cataluna UOC, Barcelona, Spain.",jtorrent@uoc.edu; pficapal@uoc.edu,"Ficapal-Cusí, Pilar/AAO-5025-2020; Torrent-Sellens, Joan/AAO-5016-2020","Ficapal-Cusí, Pilar/0000-0003-0020-1796; Torrent-Sellens, Joan/0000-0002-6071-422X",,,,,49,1,2,0,8,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

In particular we are interested in the effects on perceived burden and job performance. We analyse data from a survey among workers who care for a person in their social circle for longer than two weeks. The caring workers with a high perceived burden and intention to participate in the programme were asked questions regarding the expected effects on burden. An econometric model in which we account for these two potentially nonrandom selection mechanisms is set up to analyse the expected reduction in burden due to the intended take-up of care leave. As a result of the introduction of the programme about 60% of the intended participants who perceive a high burden expect a reduction in their burden. The relation between burden and job performance shows that the programme would reduce the number of caring workers who perform less precise in their job by one-third. A modified version of the programme with more stringent requirements than analysed in this article was introduced in The Netherlands in 2005.,"[Van Gameren, Edwin] Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudies Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Woittiez, Isolde B.] Netherlands Inst Social Research SCP, The Hague, Netherlands",Colegio de Mexico,"Van Gameren, E (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudies Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",egameren@colmex.mx,,"van Gameren, Edwin/0000-0002-5403-5351",,,,,57,0,0,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the paper we study an extended GERT setting, which provides for uncertainty in both the project structure and task durations. If we stick to the strictly probabilistic approach to uncertainty, we express task durations in terms of random variables. In this case, there exists a probability distribution of the project's duration; however, it's hardly possible to calculate this distribution analytically. Still, we can obtain a fair approximation using Monte Carlo methods. Another way to incorporate task duration uncertainty is to use fuzzy numbers (as an alternative to random variables). In recent years, several different approaches to applying fuzzy numbers in the PERT and GERT analysis emerged. In the paper, we discuss the implementation of both the probabilistic and the fuzzy concepts for GERT networks with loops, and compare their results using a real-world case study.","[Zouhar, Jan; Sladkova, Ivana] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,,zouharj@vse.cz; xslai06@vse.cz,"Zouhar, Jan/E-9659-2013","Zouhar, Jan/0000-0002-1164-7948",,,,,14,0,0,0,4,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,694,699,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900117,0

In the case of independent countries, each national government chooses the level of government-funded research non-cooperatively and fails to internalize the spillover effects across countries. Consequently, government-funded research is underprovided. In an economic union, the central government budget causes the common-pool problem and leads to an overprovision of govern m ent-funded research. Within this framework, we find that although an economic union dominates independent countries in economic growth, the welfare domination is ambiguous. In particular, there is a critical degree of cross-country spillover above (below) which an economic union dominates (is dominated by) independent countries in social welfare. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Winner-picking, i.e., the efficient reallocation of scarce resources in an internal capital market, adds an extra layer of noise to the moral-hazard problem of incentivizing division managers to produce the resources that can then be redistributed. In particular, division managers with strong future investment opportunities anticipate that headquarters will bail them out should they fail to produce enough resources themselves. This reduces incentives to create the resources in the first place, with possible consequences for the optimal investment policy.","[Heider, Florian] European Cent Bank, Financial Res Div, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Gautier, Axel] Univ Liege, CREPP, HEC, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Gautier, Axel] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",European Central Bank; University of Liege; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Heider, F (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Financial Res Div, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",agautier@ulg.ac.be; florian.heider@ecb.int,"Gautier, Axel/AAM-4182-2020","Gautier, Axel/0000-0001-7700-3814",,,,,34,3,4,1,19,J C B MOHR,TUBINGEN,"POSTFACH 2040, W-7400 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0932-4569,1614-0559,,J INST THEOR ECON,J.

In particular, the concepts of 'autopoiesis system' and 'observation of observations' can be extremely useful for the analysis of a far-reaching constellation of various economic concepts. This study develops the elementary terminology of metaeconomics and economic systems theory, and emphasizes the significance of the 'observation of observations'. In most cases when several fundamental concepts need to be logically constructed, the corresponding mathematical symbols and notions may often be utilized as the means for representing their formal functions. Amongst others, 'category' is the most important, because it can formalize the structure of economic systems and meta-observations from the viewpoint of logical foundations.","Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Kamitake, Y (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",kamitake@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,4,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

We argue that in such a situation, in comparing economic institutions, one should employ the concept of ex-post optimality rather than that of Pareto optimality.

We show that, at low levels of accumulation, weak contracting institutions strongly favor the economic elite: By preventing market entry, such institutions provide the oligarchs with cheap access to credit-which is highly beneficial as long as capital is scarce. At the same time, a broad cross-section of society faces only low returns so that capital accumulation is slowed down and the capital stock gets concentrated in the hands of the elite. At higher levels of development, however, weak contracting institutions are harmful to all segments of society and institutional reform becomes unanimously supported. So the model helps to explain the pervasiveness of weak contracting institutions in less-advanced economies.","Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Oechslin, M (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,48,10,10,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

In theory, providing collateral to the bank can have a mitigating effect on these informational asymmetries and thus solve the credit-rationing problem. Even though collateral is already a widespread debt contract feature, recent trends predict that, in the future, collateral will become even more important for informationally opaque firms. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a review of the recently growing empirical research on collateral as a remedy for credit rationing. Second, we would like to pinpoint gaps and limitations in current empirical research. Most studies contend with a flawed research design by not distinguishing between business and personal collateral and excluding other information opaqueness reducing tools such as the strength of the relationship between borrower and lender, loan maturity and covenants. We also discuss the limitations of using a single equation estimation method and the usefulness of incorporating interaction effects into the estimation models. Finally, we provide suggestions for fruitful research avenues that would fill these gaps and enrich the empirical knowledge in this research domain.","[Steijvers, Tensie; Voordeckers, Wim] Hasselt Univ, Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat KIZOK, Diepenbeek, Belgium",Hasselt University,"Steijvers, T (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat KIZOK, Diepenbeek, Belgium.",,"Voordeckers, Wim/C-2239-2018; Steijvers, Tensie/E-6253-2017","Voordeckers, Wim/0000-0001-7041-3933; Steijvers, Tensie/0000-0001-6947-4421",,,,,69,54,75,1,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

China's economy is lowly leveraged in its banking, household, public and external sectors and, therefore, is less plagued by the global deleveraging than most developed economies. Chinese domestic sectors have improved significantly over the past decade, giving them larger capacity to cope with external shocks than during the Asian financial crisis a decade ago. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that China's economic growth is highly dependent on exports, we find that the main growth engine for China is domestic demand. Destocking, rather than falling exports, was the main cause of the sharp economic slowdown in China in late 2008 and early 2009. Therefore, the global economic slowdown should have limited impact on China's economy. We forecast a sustained economic recovery in China in 2009-2011, with real GDP growth exceeding 10 percent in 2010.","Nomura Int HK Ltd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,"Sun, MC (通讯作者)，Nomura Int HK Ltd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",mingchun.sun@nomura.com,,,,,,,12,16,17,1,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,DEC,2009,17.0,6,,,,,24,42,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01172.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,519PC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271778100002,0

Interest rate derivatives involving Libor or swap rates in arrears, i.e. rates paid at wrong time, are a typical example. It is generally tempting to replace the future unknown interest rates with the forward rates. We show rigorously that indeed this is not possible in the case of Libor or swap rates in arrears. We introduce formally the notion of linear plain vanilla derivatives as those that can be replicated by a finite set of elementary operations and show that derivatives involving the rates in arrears are not (linear) plain vanilla. We also study the issue of valuation of such derivatives. Beside the popular convexity adjustment formula, we develop an improved two or more variable adjustment formula applicable in particular on swap rates in arrears. Finally, we get a precise fully analytical formula based on the usual assumption of log-normality of the relevant tradable underlying assets applicable to a wide class of convexity related derivatives. We illustrate the techniques and different results on a case study of a real life controversial exotic swap.","Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Witzany, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Witzany, Jiri/ABF-4362-2020","Witzany, Jiri/0000-0001-6886-5236",,,,,19,1,1,0,2,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The foreign exporting firm, being risk averse, has incentives to hedge its exchange rate risk exposure. In a two-stage setting, we show that hedging via an unbiased currency futures market acts as a strategic device. In particular, under either constant or decreasing absolute risk aversion, an increase in the hedging volume of the foreign firm promotes its exports and deters the home firm's output. In contrast to the well-known full-hedging result in a perfectly competitive environment, we find that the foreign firm over-hedges for strategic reasons. Furthermore, the separation result from the hedging literature under perfect competition no longer holds in our duopoly framework, i.e., equilibrium output levels depend on the risk attitude of the foreign firm as well as the probability distribution of the spot exchange rate.","[Broll, Udo] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Welzel, Peter] Univ Augsburg, Dept Econ, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany; [Wong, Kit Pong] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Augsburg; University of Hong Kong,"Broll, U (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",Udo.Broll@tu-dresden.de; Peter.Welzel@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de; kpwong@econ.hku.hk,"Welzel, Peter/I-7572-2015","Welzel, Peter/0000-0002-8298-8256",,,,,24,4,4,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Due to the fact that Brazil represents a potential laboratory experiment in which the effects of an adoption of inflation targeting after more than a half decade can be observed, an analysis through several indices and its relation with the basic interest rate is made. The findings denote that the credibility indices based on reputation represent an alternative in the cases where the series of inflation expectation are not available. Furthermore, the empirical evidence confirms the hypothesis that higher credibility implies lower variations in the interest rate for controlling inflation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the neutrality of the consumption tax does not hold in the money-in-the-utility-function model, because a change in consumption taxation induces the substitution of money holdings for consumption, and the money is the net wealth within the OLG structure. An increase in the consumption tax rate lowers (raises) the growth rate under a low (high) monetary expansion rate. On the other hand, in the cash-in-advance model and the money-in-the-production-function model, the neutrality of consumption taxation holds even within the OLG structure, because in these models there is no substitution of consumption and money holdings.","[Matsuzaki, Daisuke] Okinawa Int Univ, Dept Econ, Ginowan City, Okinawa 9012701, Japan; [Kaneko, Akihiko] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Social Engn, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan",Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Matsuzaki, D (通讯作者)，Okinawa Int Univ, Dept Econ, Ginowan 2-6-1, Ginowan City, Okinawa 9012701, Japan.",kaneko.a.aa@m.titech.ac.jp; daisuke@okiu.ac.jp,"Kaneko, Akihko/AAI-9938-2020",,,,,,19,6,6,0,15,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

If the social choice rule can depend only on the number of votes that each alternative receives, those rules satisfying full sincerity are convex combinations of the rule that chooses each alternative with probability equal to the proportion of the vote it receives and an arbitrary rule that ignores voters' preferences.

In a more specific setting of informative advertising, we show that such overinvestment incentives are always present and that more generous patent protection implies that a larger share of the patent rent is spent on marketing, relative to R&D.","[Brekke, Kurt R.] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ & Hlth Econ Bergen, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Straume, Odd Rune] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Straume, Odd Rune] Univ Bergen, Dept Econ HEB, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Universidade do Minho; University of Bergen,"Brekke, KR (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ & Hlth Econ Bergen, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",kurt.brekke@nhh.no; o.r.straume@eeg.uminho.pt,"Straume, Odd Rune/B-6090-2009","Straume, Odd Rune/0000-0002-6889-2717",,,,,35,7,7,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

However, productivity dispersion is widely observed in the real economy. Search theory allegedly fills this gap by encompassing apparent disequilibrium phenomena in the neoclassical equilibrium framework. Taking up Lucas and Prescott (1974) as a primary example, we show that the neoclassical search theory cannot explain the observed pattern of productivity dispersion. Non-self-averaging, a concept little known to economists, plays the major role. Empirical observation suggests strongly the presence of disturbing forces which dominate equilibrating forces due to optimizing behavior of economic agents. We must seek a new concept of equilibrium different from the standard Walrasian equilibrium in macroeconomics.","[Aoki, Masanao] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Yoshikawa, Hiroshi] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Tokyo,"Aoki, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, 405 Hilgard Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",aoki@econ.ucla.edu; yoshikawa@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,3,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,SEP 30,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200937,,,,,10,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20MR,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208144600001,0

Thereto, a gravity equation is derived, which accounts for the risk of financial losses in case firms contract defaulting foreign buyers. Empirical results suggest that OECD countries issuing trade credits with generous state-guarantees did not, during the 1999 to 2005 period, witness more exports towards politically and commercially more unstable low-income countries. Rather, publicly indemnified trade finance has promoted exports, to a modest degree, towards high and middle-income countries, where financial intermediaries and markets provide viable alternatives to hedge against payment risks.","[Baltensperger, Ernst; Herger, Nils] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Herger, N (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Schanzeneckstr 1,Postfach 8573, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland.",ernst.baltensperger@vwi.unibe.ch; nils.herger@vwi.unibe.ch,,"Herger, Nils/0000-0003-2641-3412",,,,,17,14,15,3,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We report about a laboratory experiment whose participants judgmentally forecast three time series subject to regime switches. The participants make forecasts without context knowledge and without support from statistical software. Their forecasts are only based on the previous realizations of the time series. Our interest is the explanation of the average forecasts with a simple model, the bounds & likelihood heuristic. In previous studies it was shown that this model can explain average forecasting behavior very well given stable and stationary time series. We find that the forecasts after a structural break are characterized by a higher variance and less accuracy over several periods. Considering this transition phase in the model, the heuristic performs even slightly better than the Rational Expectations Hypothesis.","[Becker, Otwin; Leitner, Johannes; Leopold-Wildburger, Ulrike] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Stat & Operat Res, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Leopold-Wildburger, U (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Univ Str 15-E3, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",ulrike.leopold@uni-graz.at,,,,,,,23,10,10,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

We consider the level of consumption as the source of pollution. Government allocates its tax revenue between pollution abatement expenditure and productive public expenditure. Optimum ratio of productive public expenditure to national income is equal to the competitive output share of the public input, when productive public expenditure is depicted as tax revenue minus abatement expenditure. However, the proportional income tax rate exceeds the competitive output share of the public input. There is no conflict between the social welfare maximizing solution and the growth rate maximizing solution in the steady state growth equilibrium. The unique steady state growth equilibrium appears to be a saddle-point when the growth rate is above a critical level and the steady state equilibrium growth rate in the market economy is not necessarily lower than the socially efficient growth rate.

But today's super recipient is a relatively larger economy than its investors and many of these investors are not classified as developed economies. A simple Ak type model implies that a small and more developed country investing in a large and less developed country will experience decreases in both employment and income disparity (compared to the recipient country) as the less-developed recipient country gains the higher technology of production through FDI inflows. The empirical results for the Four Tigers (source countries) and China (recipient country) are consistent with our theoretical model of FDI outflows. We also find that FDI outflows to China decrease the ratio of exports to GDP only for small source countries, even though a higher investment in China raises the share of these countries' exports-to-China to China's total imports.

Unlike previous research using Canadian data, our data set allows us to control for ability selection into higher education. We find strong evidence of positive ability selection into all levels of post-secondary education for men and weaker positive selection for women. Since the ability selection is stronger for higher levels of education, particularly for university, the difference in returns between university and college or trades education decreases slightly after accounting for ability bias.

We show, for intermediate levels of knowledge transferability, clustering occurs in geographical space and a few agents sustain distant connections. Such networks exhibit the small world property (high clustering and short average relational distances). When the costs of link formation are normally distributed across agents, asymmetric degree distributions are also obtained. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

First, excess kurtosis drops substantially or disappears in the GARCH or exponential GARCH model that corrects for an additive outlier. Second, using the outlier-corrected data, the integrated GARCH effect or high volatility persistence remains in the specification once we introduce intercept-shift dummies into the mean equation. Third, the time-varying variance falls sharply, only when we incorporate the break in the variance equation. Fourth, the ARCH in mean model finds no effects of our more correct measure of output volatility on output growth or of output growth on its volatility. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A failure to reach an agreement leads to output loss. Because the disagreement points depend upon the worker's productivity, productive workers separate themselves from less productive workers and signal their ability through wages. In existing models of asymmetric learning, wages are attached to publicly observable characteristics and wage growth occurs only when there is a change in observable characteristics.

The Lindahl mechanism is efficient but not incentive compatible. We analyze the outcome of the manipulated Lindahl mechanism. When the demand announcements of participants are unrestricted the Lindahl mechanism suffers from multiple equilibria. If the government removes the multiplicity by restricting the functional form of announcements the resulting Lindahl equilibrium can be made approximately efficient. Approximate efficiency is achieved by announcements that are one-dimensional regardless of the number of participants in the mechanism. This is in contrast to mechanisms that achieve exact efficiency but require announcements whose dimensionality increases at the same rate as the number of participants. The mechanism we describe benefits from simplicity at the cost of approximate efficiency. We demonstrate that mechanisms in which a linear demand function is announced are supermodular so play will converge to the Nash equilibrium for a range of learning dynamics.,"[Hashimzade, Nigar] Univ Reading, Sch Econ, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England; [Myles, Gareth D.] Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",University of Reading; University of Exeter,"Hashimzade, N (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Econ, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England.",n.hashimzade@henley.reading.ac.uk; g.d.myles@exeter.ac.uk,"Hashimzade, Nigar/AAB-6977-2021; Hashimzade, Nigar/AAC-2436-2019; Myles, Gareth/R-2976-2019","Hashimzade, Nigar/0000-0003-2035-5020;",,,,,25,0,0,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Trade between a North, where property rights can be enforced at relatively low cost, and an otherwise identical South, yields trade patterns and welfare results nearly identical to those previously shown to arise if North and South differ exogenously in the extent of control over resources. Both nations respond optimally to world prices, and the opening of trade leads to the development of property rights in the South. Nonetheless, for a set of world prices bounded by the South's autarky price, the South is better off under autarky and is made worse off by each increase in its export price.","[Margolis, Michael] Gettysburg Coll, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA; [Shogren, Jason F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",Gettysburg College; University of Wyoming,"Margolis, M (通讯作者)，Gettysburg Coll, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA.",margoli@gettysburg.edu; jramses@uwyo.edu,"Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019","Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X",,,,,19,2,4,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Time spent in the queue is an endogenously-determined transaction cost, which agents take as given and which adjusts so as to clear markets when prices are prevented from performing this function. When queuing is required, it enters the household's decision as a fixed cost, rather than increasing in proportion to the amount of good exchanged, as is far more common in the previous literature. Existence of competitive equilibrium is established for this general equilibrium model. Price controls are shown to cause notable inefficiencies, which differ from those of a proportional cost model.

When technical models produce trading signals almost all of them are either buying or selling, when they maintain open positions they are either long or short. A strong interaction prevails between exchange rate movements and the transactions triggered by technical models.

By the end of 2004, it comprised 97 econometric studies of three families of related effects. Each family has been analyzed in a separate meta-analysis. The AEL is an ideal subject for meta-analysis as it uses only a few formally similar models to estimate the same underlying effects. It is also an area with strong beliefs, often generated by altruism. When this whole literature is examined, a clear pattern emerges. After 40 years of development aid, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that aid has not been effective. We show that the distribution of results is significantly asymmetric reflecting the reluctance of the research community to publish negative results.

Using national household survey data, this study provides updated evidence on the participation rate, receipt amount, and anti-poverty effectiveness of MLSA. Families eligible for MLSA make up 2.3 percent of the urban population, but only about half of them are actual beneficiaries. City MLSA generosity and household entitled benefit amount both positively correlate with participation rate and household receipt amount. MLSA lowers the poverty rate somewhat, but substantially reduces the poverty gap and severity for its eligible participants. Nevertheless, the poverty reduction role of MLSA is restricted by its partial coverage and delivery. Consequentially, poverty remains a serious problem for MLSA's target population. The anti-poverty effectiveness of MLSA can be strengthened by full coverage and delivery of benefits and by paying special attention to disadvantaged subgroups.","[Gao, Qin] Fordham Univ, Grad Sch, Social Serv, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Garfinkel, Irwin] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zhai, Fuhua] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Fordham University; Columbia University; New York University,"Gao, Q (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Grad Sch, Social Serv, 113 W 60th St, New York, NY 10023 USA.",aqigao@fordham.edu,,,,,,,30,57,58,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In doing this, I introduce a state variable that can be interpreted as a measure Of reputation. This gives the optimization problem characterizing the LCSE a recursive Structure.

The Environmental Kuznets Curve states that pollution initially increases with economic growth. Once GDP per capita reaches a certain level, the relationship reverses. In the present paper, we provide an alternative hypothesis, where budget structure plays an important role in explaining the variations in pollution across the world: the lower the business-related taxes as a share of total tax revenue, the higher the property tax in total tax revenue and the higher the ratio of public health expenditure in total expenditure, then the stronger the incentive of pollution control and the lower the pollution level. Our empirical findings reveal that the budget structure does have an important impact on pollution control. The policy implication of this research is that effective control of environmental pollution requires changes in tax structure and expenditure assignment.

Despite the potential great risks of prolonged global warming, the success of an international climate stabilization agreement hinges to a great extent on its economic feasibility. This article makes precise the assumptions that underpin current mainstream estimates of the costs of controlling climate change and provides quantitative estimates of cost differentials under different scenarios. In particular, the article analyses the role of three utmost factors in the economic cost of a climate treaty: energy technology development; the participation rate of developing countries; and the timing of global action. We show that all three factors have a major impact on policy macroeconomic costs. Addressing them effectively is therefore indispensable in ensuring the feasibility of any international agreement to control global warming. Therefore, we propose a series of policy recommendations that can help addressing the issues of technology, timing and participation, and that represent key policy implications for a post-2012 climate policy.

Following the reforms, margins between FOB and farmgate prices have narrowed down, and the analysis of changes in poverty and inequality based on household surveys suggests a reduction in poverty and a muted supply response. A counterfactual analysis based on the observed reduction in intermediation margins shows that, however limited, increase in competition among intermediaries has contributed to raise purchase prices and the cash income of vanilla farmers. After taking into account the reduction in Madagascar's monopoly power on the world vanilla market implied by the elimination of the VMB, the induced rise in producer prices is estimated to have lifted about 20,000 individuals out of poverty.","[de Melo, Jaime] Univ Geneva, CERDI, Dept Econ, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Cadot, Olivier] HEC Lausanne, CERDI, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Geneva,"de Melo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, CERDI, Dept Econ, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",demelo@unige.ch,,,,,,,19,10,10,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In 1979, nine schools were chosen as Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools. After the call towards reforming the school system in the 1980s, the development of Independent schools evolved. In 1994, a new category - the autonomous school - was established. Besides reforming the school structure, in 1992, the ST Schools 100 (first published by The Straits Times on 19 August 1992) started to rank the top 50 schools in the Special/Express stream and the top 40 schools in the Normal stream, along with separate tables listing the top value-added schools in both streams. Until quite recently, this ranking scheme had been endorsed by the Ministry of Education since 1992 and published on their website annually since 1995. This paper looks at how these new initiatives have affected secondary school outcomes. Comprising a panel data set of 30 of the top 50 schools in Singapore over the 1991-2001 period, the study looks at the technical efficiency of schools as a response to the introduction of new initiatives using two methodologies. The first baseline approach is that of a Corrected Ordinary Least Squares (COLS) multiple-output distance function. The second methodology used is the technical efficiency frontier effects model as described by Battese and Coelli (1995) and Coelli and Perelman (1996) which is a maximum likelihood estimation technique.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 119260, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Cheo, RK (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, 10 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore 119260, Singapore.",roland_cheo@nus.edu.sg,,"Cheo, Roland/0000-0001-5654-2624",,,,,13,3,4,0,8,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Despite its reliance on the new consensus macroeconomic (NCM) framework, the FTPL concludes that fiscal policy may lead monetary policy without hampering macroeconomic stability. We show that an empirical model deriving from this theory gives very interesting results: in France and the United Kingdom, fiscal policy has positive long-run effects. This is at odds with the orthodox nature of FTPL promoters who usually advocate fiscal rules and sanctions. We interpret our results as being consistent with Post Keynesian economic thinking. We conclude that the move of some economists from the NCM school of thought in favor of discretionary fiscal policy has promoted the visibility of Post Keynesian ideas on this topic.","[Creel, Jerome] ESCP Europe, Paris, France",heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Creel, J (通讯作者)，ESCP Europe, Paris, France.",,,"Saraceno, Francesco/0000-0003-0121-4329",,,,,33,3,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

It argues that state capture is a profit-seeking capital investment activity, which is determined by a historically prevailing and continuously evolving institutional environment, and, thus, it is an open-ended evolutionary phenomenon. Therefore the methodological framework of original institutionalism that emphasizes uncertainty and non-equilibrium processes is considered to be a better device for realistic Study of state capture.

Panel data for a large number of banks over the period 1994-2003, and dynamic panel estimation techniques are employed. Looking at the experience of individual countries, there is evidence of a bank lending channel in all countries, though the strength of it varies across countries.

The correlation translates into the variation of outcomes within and across pairs of teams.","[Sausgruber, Rupert] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Econ, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Sausgruber, Rupert] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1455 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Innsbruck; University of Copenhagen,"Sausgruber, R (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Econ, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Rupert.Sausgruber@uibk.ac.at,"Sausgruber, Rupert/N-8478-2018","Sausgruber, Rupert/0000-0002-0769-862X",,,,,21,14,16,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Second, the one-sided Wald test provides support for PPP in more countries than standard tests, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies. Further, from individual t-ratio tests we find evidence for a two-regime threshold model in which real effective exchange rates are characterized by unit root behavior within a band of real appreciation or depreciation of about 10% and then outside this band, real effective exchange rates are mean reverting. Third, point forecasts generated by the threshold model are superior to those generated by a simple AR in terms of RMSE criteria.","[Chung, Sang-Kuck; Kang, Han-Gyoun] Inje Univ, Sch Econ & Int Trade, Gyeongnam, South Korea; [Kim, Jin-Sam] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Int Econ & Business, Taegu, South Korea",Inje University; Yeungnam University,"Kang, HG (通讯作者)，Inje Univ, Sch Econ & Int Trade, Gyeongnam, South Korea.",tradcsk@inje.ac.kr; jinskim@yumail.ac.kr; tradkhg@inje.ac.kr,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,2,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The increasing bilateral trade between Mexico and the United States after signing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was supposed to stem the illegal Mexican migration flow by contributing to economic growth and job creation in both countries. Twelve years after the treaty has come into effect, questions emerge about the extent to which NAFTA was able to reduce the migration pressure: are trade and migration substitutes like the policy-makers had assumed or are they complements? Using monthly data from 1968 until 2004, we estimate a distributed lag model with the number of apprehensions at the US-Mexican border as a proxy for illegal migration. The results indicate that increasing trade flows cause larger illegal migration from Mexico to the United States.","[Thorwarth, Susanne] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, ECOOM, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Del Rio, Amaranta Melchor] Heidelberg Univ, Fac Econ & Social Studies, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany",KU Leuven; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Thorwarth, S (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, ECOOM, Dekenstr 2, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",amelchor@web.de; Susanne.Thorwarth@econ.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,41,6,6,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

Whereas agents' heterogeneity is key in modern exchange rate models, evidence on determinants of heterogeneity is weak thus far. Our sample, covering expectations from about 300 forecasters over 15 years, shows remarkable time variation in dispersion. Determinants of dispersion are consistent with the chartist-fundamentalist approach: misalignments of the exchange rate and exchange rate changes explain heterogeneity. The risk premium influences heterogeneity as well, but possible impacts from macroeconomic variables and exchange rate's volatility are dominated by the other determinants. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The Korean economic and business environment has changed dramatically since the 1997 Asia crisis. Given the dramatic environmental changes, a key question is whether the main determinants of knowledge acquisition in IJVs have changed accordingly. We address this issue by examining IJVs that were formed. before the crisis, and those that were formed afterwards. Regression models indicate that the three most powerful explanatory variables for knowledge acquisition, both pre- and post-crisis, are the participation of foreign expatriates, willingness to share foreign techniques, and the level of trust between the foreign and local partners. However, several differences arc, also found in the determinants of knowledge acquisition depending on whether the IJV was formed before or after the Asia crisis.

Outsourcing has the advantage of providing better information about local preferences. The disadvantage is that producing in the host country also means using the inferior technology embodied in the local capital. The decision of whether to offer an outsourcing contract weighs these two effects against each other. The host country accepts the outsourcing contract if the higher price they pay for the outsourced good is worth the benefit of consuming a manufactured good closer to their ideal variety. These results suggest that as low-income countries develop they become a more attractive destination for outsourcing because their capital grows to meet production needs and the local market is more lucrative. In addition, the developing low-income country finds the outsourcing contract more attractive since their increased demand for the correct variety of the manufactured good increases. This suggests that preference-based outsourcing is more likely to occur with higher-income host countries.","[Riezman, Raymond] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Wang, Ping] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",University of Iowa; Washington University (WUSTL),"Riezman, R (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",raymond-riezman@uiowa.edu; pingwang@wustl.edu,,,,,,,8,4,4,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

CO(2) emissions and energy consumption from road transport have been increasing in the EU and as a result since 1999 the EU has attempted to implement a high profile policy strategy to address this problem at European level. Less prominent is the fact that Member States apply vehicle and fuel taxes, which may also be having an impact on the quantity of passenger cars sold and their CO(2) emissions intensity. Diesel vehicle sales have increased appreciably in many countries over the same period and this study makes a first attempt to examine whether Member State fiscal measures have influenced this phenomenon. This work uses a panel dataset to investigate the relationship between national vehicle and fuel taxes on new passenger car sales and the fleet CO(2) emissions intensity in EU15 over a 10-year period. Our results show that national vehicle and fuel taxes have had an impact on passenger car sales and fleet CO(2) emissions intensity and that different taxes have disparate effects.

Most existing proposals equate welfare with wellbeing. Some assume that well-being flows from the achievement of well-defined objectives, and that those objectives also guide choices; the trick is to formulate a framework in which less-than-completely coherent choice patterns reveal the unobserved objectives. Others are predicated on the contention that well-being, and hence welfare, is directly measurable. Both of those approaches encounter serious conceptual difficulties. An alternative approach, developed by Bernheim and Rangel (2009), defines welfare directly in terms of choice. It entails a generalized welfare criterion that respects choice directly, without requiring any rationalization involving potentially unverifiable assumptions concerning underlying objectives and their relationships to choice. Because useful behavioral theories generally envision a substantial degree of underlying coherence in behavior, that criterion leads to a rich and tractable normative framework.

It begins with a critical review of different perspectives and methods of investigation used in various streams of research that have previously analysed technical change in the health sector. After profiling and discussing their characteristics, the paper proposes an evolutionary approach to change in medicine constructed around the notion of a 'Health Innovation System'. Health innovation, it is argued, consists of complex bundles of new medical technologies and clinical services emerging from a highly distributed competence base. Health Innovation Systems are driven by the combination of (1) institutionally-bound interactions among agents ('gateways' of innovation) and (2) history-dependent trajectories of change ('pathways' of innovation) whose developments emerge from and feed back into the structure of the system through organised transfers of knowledge between research and clinical practice. After drawing examples from recent empirical work on clinical research in specific disease areas, the paper concludes by identifying implications for further research.","[Mina, Andrea] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Consoli, Davide] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9QH, Lancs, England",University of Cambridge; University of Manchester,"Mina, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Ctr Business Res, Top Floor,Judge Business Sch Bldg,Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.",davide.consoli@mbs.ac.uk; a.mina@cbr.cam.ac.uk,"Consoli, Davide/Q-7183-2019; Consoli, Davide/H-3313-2011","Consoli, Davide/0000-0002-7829-2838;",,,,,74,84,94,1,53,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The representative agent is assumed to behave as an econometrician, employing a time series model for inflation that allows for both permanent and temporary shocks. The near-unity coefficient on expected inflation in the Phillips curve causes the agent's perception of a unit root in inflation to become close to self-fulfilling. In a consistent expectations equilibrium, the value of the Kalman gain parameter in the agent's forecast rule is pinned down using the observed autocorrelation of inflation changes. The forecast errors observed by the agent are close to white noise, making it difficult for the agent to detect a misspecification of the forecast rule. I show that this simple model of inflation expectations can generate time-varying persistence and volatility that is broadly similar to that observed in long-run U.S. data. Model-based values for expected inflation track well with movements in survey-based measures of U.S. expected inflation. In numerical simulations, the model can generate pronounced low-frequency swings in the level of inflation that are driven solely by expectational feedback, not by changes in monetary policy.

We present a model of organisational innovation in which managers raise productive efficiency by identifying organisational architectures that more effectively integrate value-adding activities and administrative routines. As part of this process, managers can internally or externally source an activity. Simulations of the model show that large scale outsourcing restricts the scope for future organisational innovation, leading to lower productivity growth.

In other cases, umbrella branding leads to a harsher punishment of product failure, which allows for a reputational equilibrium that would otherwise be impossible. On the negative side, under umbrella branding one bad signal may kill two revenue streams, not one. Combining costs and benefits, I determine the set of parameter values such that umbrella branding is an optimal strategy. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We also prove that an endogenous sequence of play between a cartel and a fringe depends on the discount factor. If the discount factor is large enough, the cartel and the fringe simultaneously choose quantities since the stable cartel may contain more firms under simultaneous play than under cartel leadership. This is due to the fact that under simultaneous play cartel firms have incentives to participate in the cartel because otherwise no collusion is possible.","Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Palma de Mallorca Balear 07122, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Escrihuela-Villar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Edificio Jovellanos Ctra,Valldemossa Km 7-5, Palma de Mallorca Balear 07122, Spain.",marc.escrihuela@uib.es,"Escrihuela-Villar, Marc/H-6997-2015","Escrihuela-Villar, Marc/0000-0002-5119-2415",,,,,19,14,17,2,6,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

Given this situation, political circles and specialists have recurrently debated how to reform the electoral system. The last four elections to the lower house of parliament were conducted under two electoral systems. After the Constitutional Court rejected an electoral reform, another one is being prepared. Despite its importance for them, political parties have such widely divergent priorities that it is aid for them to reach an agreement. Previous reforms have failed or miscarried. Concentrating on the two electoral systems applied till now and on the reform invalidated by the Court, this article mainly investigates the effects on the representation and operation of political parties, as well as on the stability and effectiveness of the governments formed.

Two lines of opposite arguments have fueled the ongoing debate about the convenience of mandatory rotation. Its supporters argue that this rule safeguards auditor independence and, thus, increases audit quality. Its opponents claim that mandatory rotation impairs auditor specific knowledge and reduces audit firm incentives to compete in the market and, thus, decreases audit quality. Rotation of audit firms every nine years was mandatory in Spain from 1988 to 1995. Thus, the Spanish context provides a unique setting to obtain empirical evidence on this rule. We test two competing hypotheses about the impact of the removal of mandatory rotation on the likelihood of auditors issuing going concern modified audit opinions. The sample consists of Spanish quoted financially stressed companies observed in a regime with mandatory rotation (period 1991-1994) versus a regime without this rule (1995-2000). We find evidence to suggest that the removal of mandatory rotation led to an increase in the likelihood of auditors issuing going-concern opinions. Overall, our results provide empirical support for the arguments put forward by the opponents of mandatory rotation.","[Ruiz Barbadillo, Emiliano; Gomez Aguilar, Nieves] Univ Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain",Universidad de Cadiz,"Barbadillo, ER (通讯作者)，Univ Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain.",,"Barbadillo, Emiliano Ruiz/AAN-2688-2020; Gómez Aguilar, Nieves/G-5059-2016; , Nieves Carrera/HKF-5341-2023","Barbadillo, Emiliano Ruiz/0000-0001-7618-4131; Gómez Aguilar, Nieves/0000-0002-6287-0891;",,,,,65,0,0,2,28,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

If the countries have constant elasticity of substitution utility functions, some simple conditions can be used to prove uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium of the tariff retaliation game. The welfare effects of endowment changes are analyzed in terms of the standard terms of trade and volume of trade effects.

We wanted to determine to the Czech regions that are more threatened by delocalisation of manufacturing activities. The assessment of companies' localisation stability is based on 3 economic indicators representing internal keep-factors of delocalisation - capital intensity, complexity of value chain, and sophistication of production processes. We did not confirm the hypothesis on concentration of footloose firms in economically lagging districts with high unemployment and accessibility of investment incentives. These firms, which are considered to be the most predisposed for delocalisation, are geographically dispersed. Localisation of technologically intensive branches corresponds neither to the settlement hierarchy nor to the economic performance of districts. Regional differences of indicators of localisation stability exhibit a strong path dependency effect.","[Zenka, Jan] Czech Stat Off, CZ-10082 Prague 10, Czech Republic",,"Zenka, J (通讯作者)，Czech Stat Off, Na Padesatem 81, CZ-10082 Prague 10, Czech Republic.",janzenka@gmail.com; cadil@tc.cz,"Ženka, Jan/AAJ-5648-2021; Čadil, Vladislav/AAE-6957-2021",,,,,,65,8,8,1,12,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Using quarterly data for 27 developed and developing countries over the period 1990 2005, we find that the impact of a depreciation on exports will be less positive or even negative for a country if: (i) firms borrow in foreign currency; (ii) they are credit constrained; (iii) they are specialized in industries that require more external capital; (iv) the magnitude of depreciation or devaluation is large. This last result emphasizes the existence of a nonlinear relationship between an exchange rate depreciation and the reaction of a country's exports when financial imperfections are observed.

But what is less often recognized is that the anticipated introduction of a policy can introduce its own distortions. We study one such introduction effect, using evidence from a unique policy change in Australia. in 2004, the Australian government announced that children born on or after July 1, 2004 would receive a $3000 Baby Bonus. Although the policy was only announced seven weeks before its introduction, parents appear to have behaved strategically in order to receive the benefit, with the number of births dipping sharply before the policy commenced. On July 1, 2004, more Australian children were born than on any other single date in the past thirty years. We estimate that over 1000 births were moved so as to ensure that their parents were eligible for the Baby Bonus, with about one quarter being moved by more than one week. Most of the effect was due to changes in the timing of induction and cesarean section procedures. We find evidence to suggest that babies who were shifted into the eligibility period were more likely to be of high birth weight. Two years later, on July 1, 2006, the Baby Bonus was increased, and we find that this again caused births to be moved from June to July. These birth timing events represent an opportunity for health researchers to study the impact of planned birthdays and hospital management issues. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence a change in the degree of transparency affects the magnitude of information asymmetries, but at the same time it implies a rather arbitrary effect on the distribution of preferences. We present a clean framework without this problem. Second, using a very general specification of shocks to the central bank's preferences, we show that society prefers transparency if it sufficiently values the employment target, whereas it prefers opacity if it estimates inflation as sufficiently important.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Hahn, V (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",vhahn@ethz.ch,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I would like to thank Theresa Fahrenberger, Hans Gersbach, Henrik Jensen, Thomas Lanz, participants of the annual conference of the EEA in 2002 and an anonymous referee for their many valuable comments and suggestions.

We also find that shippers shifted toward more outsourcing of their trucking needs, but this occurred to an even greater extent in local and national road transport. We conclude that other factors beside the deregulation of international trucking affected the organization of the industry at the time.

We show, in a simple model, that economies with stronger civic virtues are more prone to provide insurance through unemployment benefits rather than through job protection.

At the heart of such failures is the emergence of a sub-optimal choice environment which, though derived from a large number of small individual optimising decisions, is not the choice environment that people would choose if they were able to choose the environment itself. This idea is claimed to be consistent with modern economic theories of freedom of choice and applicable particularly to choice environments that emerge in highly competitive market situations. The retail supply of food and consumer credit is discussed by way of example. Concluding, the paper develops the concept of a 'deliberative economy' as an alternative to liberal paternalism and explores conditions under which such an approach to social choice might deliver desirable outcomes.","[Gray, Alastair] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,,,,"Anand, Paul/0000-0002-7701-6903",,,,,26,22,22,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,,2009,62.0,2,,,,,182,190,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00430.x,0.0,,,9,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,433FA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265188500003,0

This paper develops a model of household formation and dissolution in which it may be rational for individuals to marry, fully anticipating that they will subsequently divorce. Economies of scale associated with living as a couple rather than in two separate households provide an incentive to marry; problems with free riding in the provision of household collective goods may lead to divorce. Marriages which involve partners who are similar, in tastes or in their productive capacities, and in which private goods are equally shared, are the most likely to be stable. In contrast, marriages which involve very disparate partners, or which share the fruits of market labor very unequally between the partners, are more likely to be shortlived and end in divorce.

TFP fell 3% after the Korean 1997 financial crisis. We find evidence that the large fall in TFP is mostly due to a sectoral reallocation of labor from the more productive manufacturing and construction sectors to the less productive wholesale trade sector, the public sector and agriculture. We construct a two-sector model that accounts for the labor reallocation. The model has a consumption sector and an investment sector. Firms face sector-specific working capital constraints, which we calibrate with data from financial statements. The rise in interest rates makes inputs more costly. The model accounts for 42% of the TFP fall. The model also accounts for 53% of the fall in GDP. It is broadly consistent with the post-crisis behavior of the Korean economy.","[Benjamin, David] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Meza, Felipe] Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Benjamin, D (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",db64@buffalo.edu; felipe.meza@itam.mx,,"Meza, Felipe/0000-0001-5427-358X",,,,,22,19,20,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Our study identifies a new facet of procedural utility and offers new insights about the motivations and goals of nascent entrepreneurs. Most importantly, we identify a group of nascent entrepreneurs that 'cannot get satisfaction' with their start-up-not because their start-up fails to deliver financial returns, but because they did not choose to become entrepreneurs in the first place. This group of unsatisfied entrepreneurs includes individuals starting a business after a period of long-term unemployment and those individuals with a lack of better employment alternatives (necessity entrepreneurs). In addition, we provide additional evidence for the importance of both financial and non-financial incentives of entrepreneurs. While financial success is the most important determinant of start-up satisfaction, achievement of independence and creativity is also highly important. Our results emphasize the relevance of procedural utility for understanding economic behavior. We show that the process leading to a decision has an impact on the later satisfaction with the outcome of that decision.","[Block, Joern] Tech Univ Munich, Scholler Chair Technol & Innovat Management, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Koellinger, Philipp] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Technical University of Munich; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Block, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Scholler Chair Technol & Innovat Management, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",block@wi.tum.de; koellinger@ese.eur.nl,"Block, Joern/K-2208-2016","Block, Joern/0000-0003-4564-0346; Koellinger, Philipp/0000-0001-7413-0412",,,,,54,143,162,1,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,,2009,62.0,2,,,,,191,209,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00431.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,433FA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265188500004,0

Furthermore, the EU has launched additional policy measures such as renewable energy subsidies in order to promote compliance with the climate policy target Basic economic reasoning suggests that emission market segmentation and overlapping regulation can create substantial excess costs if we focus only on the climate policy target.

This article examines whether the conclusions from several bank-specific studies, undertaken by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, are robust to changes in the link function adopted to model the probability of loan approval and to the approach used to approximate the finite sample null distribution for the disparate treatment hypothesis test. Our evidence, of discrimination findings that are reasonably robust to the range of examined link functions, suggests that regulators and researchers can be reasonably comfortable with their current use of the logit link.

It is concluded that the EU farming because of its specific character should still be supported and should not be fully subjected to market rules, while preserving its common character. The support reorientation from one market to single payments is assessed positively as a more efficient method of stabilising farm incomes. A step in the right direction is the strengthening the financing of rural areas via the modulation system, because II Pillar plays an important modernisation and pro-development role and meets social expectations.

Using firm-level data for six transition economies over the 1995-2002 period, we identify whether foreign ownership and propensity to trade with more advanced countries can bring about higher learning effects. We find that: (i) foreign ownership has helped restructure and enhance the productivity of local firms in four out of six countries; (ii) exporting to advanced markets has a larger impact on productivity growth in four countries, especially when the firm's absorptive capacity is taken into account; (iii) in contrast, exporting to the less competitive markets of the former Yugoslavia seems to negatively affect productivity growth in three countries; and (iv) learning effects from importing are similar to those from exporting. Our results suggest that trade liberalization is not uniformly beneficial. Regional composition of trade flows and absorptive capacity of local firms matter. Thus, trade liberalization within the SEE region may not provide a substitute for a general trade liberalization which includes access to the more competitive markets of countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.","[Damijan, Joze P.] Univ Ljubljana, Inst Ecol Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Damijan, Joze P.] Univ Vienna, Econ & Business Adm, Vienna, Austria; [Damijan, Joze P.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS, Louvain, Belgium; [de Sousa, Jose] Univ Rennes 1, CREM, Rennes, France; [de Sousa, Jose] Univ Rennes 2, CREM, F-35043 Rennes, France; [de Sousa, Jose] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Lamotte, Olivier] ESG, Paris, France",University of Ljubljana; University of Vienna; KU Leuven; Universite de Rennes; Universite de Rennes; Universite Rennes 2; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Damijan, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Inst Ecol Res, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",joze.damijan@ef.uni-lj.si; jdesousa@univ-paris1.fr; olamotte@esg.fr,"Lamotte, Olivier/ABF-8963-2022; de Sousa, Jose/A-1718-2010","Lamotte, Olivier/0000-0003-2050-3193; Damijan, Joze/0000-0001-9150-1174",,,,,39,21,21,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Using data on the diffusion of point-of-sale optical scanners between 1974 and 1985, we find that factors such as the stock of prior adopters, household income, family size, the four-firm concentration ratio and item-pricing laws had predictably different effects on the diffusion rate depending on the vintage of the technology.

Before the decision is made, each agent can privately acquire a costly and imperfect signal. We discuss how to design a mechanism for eliciting and aggregating the collected information so as to maximize ex-ante social welfare. We first show that, of all mechanisms, a sequential one is optimal and works as follows. At random, one agent at a time is selected to acquire information and report the resulting signal. Agents are informed of neither their position in the sequence nor of other reports. Acquiring information when called upon and reporting truthfully is an equilibrium. We next characterize the ex-ante optimal scheme among all ex-post efficient mechanisms. In this mechanism, a decision is made when the precision of the posterior exceeds a cut-off that decreases with each additional report. The restriction to ex-post efficiency is shown to be without loss when the available signals are sufficiently imprecise. On the other hand, ex-post efficient mechanisms are shown to be suboptimal when the cost of information acquisition is sufficiently small. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To determine which Master's degree programme directions satisfy the market needs better is possible only when all the above criteria are integrated into a single quantity. Multicriteria evaluation methods are most suitable for solving such problems. All the criteria significances or weights should be known in this case. In the present research, 6 directions of studies have been established, e.g. biomedicine, physical, social, technological sciences, humanities and art studies.

We found, using simulation, that choosing a deterministic trend when a deterministic level is true does not affect significantly the properties of the test.

In order to quantify the degree of distortion, a feasible reference is proposed: an ideal speculator.

This is mainly due to a number of organisational challenges and changes in operational requirements and priorities. Naval manpower planners need to consider appropriate measures to improve retention in the service. The evidence gathered from the empirical investigation shows that external (pull) factors exert a significant effect on the early exit/quit rates from the RN. Key economic factors such as pay and employment opportunities in the civilian employment markets play an important role in the decisions that individual ratings make with regard to remaining in naval employment or leaving altogether. In particular, it was found that quit rates from the Navy are negatively associated with the claimant count (unemployment) rate (i.e. as the unemployment rate in the civilian economy increases, the early exit rate from the Navy decreases), whilst the overall increase in civilian wages bears a positive relationship on quitting behaviour. The analysis provides further evidence to support the need for policies that are tailor-made to cater for different ratings' specialisations within the Royal Navy.","[Jaffry, Shabbar; Ghulam, Yaseen; Apostolakis, Alexandros] Univ Portsmouth, Dept Econ, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England",University of Portsmouth,"Jaffry, S (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Dept Econ, Portsmouth Business Sch, Richmond Bldg,Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England.",shabbar.jaffry@port.ac.uk,"Apostolakis, Alexandros/AAP-1442-2020","Jaffry, Shabbar/0000-0002-2234-9575; Ghulam, Yaseen/0000-0002-3206-1786; Apostolakis, Alexandros/0000-0003-0999-0752",,,,,30,2,2,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Despite the removal of capital controls, banks do not invest all excess reserves in a safe foreign asset because the central bank maintains an unofficial foreign currency constraint by accumulating international reserves. The findings suggest that commercial banks do not demand excess reserves for precautionary purpose - which is the conclusion of several other studies - but rather because of the maintained constraint. The estimated sterilization coefficient is consistent with the hypothesis of an enforced constraint. The results, moreover, suggest an alternative way of looking at the monetary transmission mechanism in developing countries. The central bank maintains price and exchange rate stability through the accumulation of foreign reserves.","Honours Coll Florida, New Coll Florida, Sarasota, FL USA",State University System of Florida; New College Florida,"Khemraj, T (通讯作者)，Honours Coll Florida, New Coll Florida, Sarasota, FL USA.",khemT73@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,10,12,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

J,"Klasen, S; Woolard, I",,,,"Klasen, Stephan; Woolard, Ingrid",,,Surviving Unemployment Without State Support: Unemployment and Household Formation in South Africa,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PUBLIC-POLICY; DETERMINANTS; TRANSFERS; PENSION,"While in many African countries open unemployment is largely confined to urban areas and thus overall rates are quite low, in South Africa open unemployment rates hover around 30%, with rural unemployment rates being even higher than that. This is despite the near complete absence of an unemployment insurance system and little labour market regulation that applies to rural labour markets. This paper examines how unemployment can persist without access to unemployment compensation. Analysing household surveys from 1993, 1995, 1998, 2004 and 2006, we find that the household formation response of the unemployed is the critical way in which the unemployed assure access to resources. In particular, unemployment delays the setting up of an individual household by young persons, in some cases by decades. It also sometimes leads to the dissolution of existing households and a return of constituent members to parents and other relatives and friends. Access to state transfers (in particular, non-contributory old age pensions) plays an important role in this private safety net. Some unemployed do not benefit from this safety net, and the presence of unemployed members pulls many households supporting them into poverty. We also show that the household formation response draws some of the unemployed away from employment opportunities, and thus lowers their employment prospects.","[Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Klasen, Stephan] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Woolard, Ingrid] Univ Cape Town, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Gottingen; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut; University of Cape Town,"Klasen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, IZA, Bonn, Germany.",sklasen@uni-goettingen.de,,"Woolard, Ingrid/0000-0003-4013-5797",,,,,63,106,138,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Using the Johansen cointegration methodology for a period that begins from the mid-1990s and allowing for a structural break for the countries that joined the EU on May 2004, it is found that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship among the nominal exchange rate, the domestic prices and the foreign prices, for all the new EU countries. The evidence also suggests that the PPP vector enters the cointegration space for Bulgaria, Cyprus, Romania and Slovenia, which means that only for these countries the long-run PPP vis-a-vis the Eurozone is verified. For the rest of the new EU countries the long-run PPP is violated, may due to the fact that the currencies of these countries have been pegged to the euro and cannot reflect the inflation differences vis-a-vis the Eurozone.","Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon 74100, Greece",University of Crete,"Koukouritakis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Rethimnon 74100, Greece.",minoas@econ.soc.uoc.gr,,,,,,,17,21,21,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Saudi Arabia is taken as a case study. The methods applied are the error correction and variance decompositions techniques including the most recently developed 'long-run structural modelling (LRSM)' (Pesaran and Shin, 2002), which by imposing exactly identifying and overidentifying restrictions on the cointegrating vector has taken care of a major limitation of the conventional cointegrating estimates in that they were atheoretical in nature. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any study on this issue with the application of the techniques that incorporate 'LRSM'. The stability of the functions has also been tested by Cumulative Sum (CUSUM), Cumulative Sum of Squares (CUSUMSQ) and Chow Test (CHOW) tests. Our findings, based on the above mentioned rigorous techniques, tend to suggest that the direction of causation between financial development and economic growth is supply-leading (rather than demand-following), as expected at the early stage of development. These findings have clear policy implications in that a pro-active policy of growth and reform of the financial sector will help enhance economic growth in an open developing economy like Saudi Arabia.","[Masih, Mansur; Al-Elg, Ali; Madani, Haider] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Coll Ind Management, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia",King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals,"Masih, M (通讯作者)，King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Coll Ind Management, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia.",masih@kfupm.edu.sa,"Madani, Haider/AAU-6787-2021","Madani, Haider/0000-0001-8866-7018; Masih, Mansur/0000-0002-9965-0091",,,,,26,28,31,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

First, its large saving (trade) surplus results in a currency mismatch because it is an immature creditor that cannot lend in its own currency. Instead, foreign currency claims (largely US dollars) build up within domestic financial institutions. Second, economists, both American and Chinese, mistakenly attribute the surpluses to an undervalued RMB. To placate the USA, the result was a gradual and predictable appreciation of the RMB against the dollar of 6 percent or more per year from July 2005 to July 2008. Together with the fall in US interest rates since mid-2007, this oneway bet in the foreign exchanges markets not only attracted hot money inflows but inhibited private capital outflows from financing China's huge trade surplus. Therefore, the People's Bank of China had to intervene heavily to prevent the RMB from ratcheting upwards, and so became the country's sole international financial intermediary as official exchange reserves exploded. Because of the currency mismatch, floating the RMB is neither feasible nor desirable, and a higher RMB would not reduce China's trade surplus. Instead, monetary control and normal private-sector finance for the trade surplus require a return to a credibly fixed nominal RMB/USD rate similar to that which existed between 1995 and 2004. However, for any newly reset RMB/USD rate to be credible as a monetary anchor, foreign China bashing to get the RMB up must end. Then the stage would be set for fiscal expansion to both stimulate the economy and reduce its trade surplus.","[McKinnon, Ronald] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Schnabl, Gunther] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany",Stanford University; Leipzig University,"McKinnon, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mckinnon@stanford.edu; schnabl@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,14,54,57,1,38,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2009,17.0,1,,,,,1,32,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01128.x,0.0,,,32,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,400PH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262880100001,0

As a result, provision of ecosystem services is sub-optimal and estimation of their values is complicated. We examine how econometric estimation can feed computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling to estimate health-related ecosystem values. Against a back drop of climate change, we analyze the Brazilian policy to expand National Forests (FLONAS) by 50 million hectares. Because these major environmental changes can generate spillovers in other sectors, we develop and use a CGE model that focuses on land and labor markets. Compared to climate change and deforestation in the baseline, the FLONAS scenario suggests relatively small declines in GDP, output (including agriculture) and other macro indicators. Urban households will experience declines in their welfare because they own most of the capital and land, which allows them to capture most of the deforestation benefits. In contrast, even though rural households have fewer opportunities for subsistence agriculture and face additional competition with other rural agricultural workers for more limited employment, their welfare improves due to health benefits from conservation of nearby forests. The efficiency vs. equity tradeoffs implied by the FLONAS scenario suggests that health-related ecosystem services will be underprovided if the rural poor are politically weaker than the urban rich. In conclusion, we briefly discuss the pros and cons of the CGE strategy for valuing ecosystem-mediated health benefits and evaluating contemporary policies on climate change mitigation.","[Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.; Timmins, Christopher] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Ross, Martin T.; Depro, Brooks M.] RTI Int, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Bauch, Simone C.] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Wendland, Kelly J.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Duke University; Research Triangle Institute; North Carolina State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Pattanayak, SK (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",subhrendu.pattanayak@duke.edu; mross@rti.org; bmd@rti.org; scbauch@ncsu.edu; christopher.timmins@duke.edu; kwendland@wisc.edu; kalger@rareconservation.org,,,,,,,87,20,24,1,37,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Numerous methods have been developed in this field and new methods are continuously being created. In the light of a great number of methods currently proposed, it is difficult to gain a profound overview. Comparisons on the performance of various methods are done to a small extent only. When applying the methods, in some cases many mathematical operations are performed, which renders it impossible to sufficiently assess their effect with such a complexity. It is therefore aimed at analysing the peculiarities of several methods in a critical review and to give hints for possible consequences. The analysis is primarily concentrated on the normalisation of indices in the mapping to the interval [1; 01 or [1; similar to 0]. This includes linear functions (the relative difference and the calculation with interval boundaries) and non-linear functions (the hyperbolic function, the quadratic and cubic function, the square root and the logarithmic function). With the critical review, the possibility is offered to the decision maker to better assess the quality of his solution.","Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Peldschus, F (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",friedel@peldschus.net,,,,,,,39,45,45,0,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The main goal is to explore the factors driving the rise of house prices in transition countries. Because house price increases in the last two decades are not peculiar to transition countries, the analysis is extended to three EU-15 countries that have recorded house price rises. The similarities and differences between the two groups of countries in terms of house price determinants can thus be explored. In the first part of the empirical analysis VAR is employed to detect how GDP, housing loans, interest rates and construction contribute to real house price variance. In the second part of the analysis multiple regression models are estimated. The results of both methods suggest that the driving forces behind house price inflation in both groups of countries are very similar and encompass the combined influence of house price persistence, income and interest rates.","[Vizek, Maruska] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia; [Posedel, Petra] Grad Sch Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Vizek, M (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia.",mvizek@eizg.hr,"Posedel Šimović, Petra/HMD-2428-2023","Posedel Šimović, Petra/0000-0002-4447-1643",,,,,21,21,22,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,3,,,,,327,343,,10.1080/14631370903090640,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,596GR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277673700004,0

In this paper, different participation schemes to meet different levels of radiative forcing are analysed. The focus is oil scenarios that are in line with the 2 degrees C target. Typical stylised participation schemes are based either on a perfect global carbon market or delayed participation with targets only for developed countries, no actions by developing countries and no access to credits from offsetting mechanisms in developing countries. This paper adds an intermediate policy scenario assuming a gradual incorporation of all countries, including a gradually developing carbon market, and taking into account the ability to contribute of different parties. Perfect participation by all parties would be optimal, but it is shown that participation schemes involving a gradual and differentiated participation by all parties can substantially decrease global costs and still meet the 2 degrees C target. Carbon markets can compensate in part for those costs incurred by developing countries' own, autonomous mitigation actions that do not generate tradable emission credits. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence of a similar reduction in volatility in the other G-7 countries and Australia. However, the timing and nature of the moderation varies considerably across countries. We also assess whether and how business cycles have changed in the period since the Great Moderation. Our results suggest that in most of these countries, the major change in business cycles has been a noticeably slower rate of GDP growth in expansions. We find little evidence of milder recessions in the post-Moderation period. Although a lower variance of growth will result in longer expansions and rarer recessions, the evidence presented here suggests that recessions have been just as severe, on average, when they do occur.","[Smith, Penelope] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Summers, Peter M.] Texas Tech Univ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",University of Melbourne; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Smith, P (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",pennysmith@westpac.com.au; peter.summers@ttu.edu,,"Summers, Peter/0000-0002-2200-4155",,,,,20,5,5,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

A dry bulk carrier is replaced with a tanker when the expected net present value of such a switch is optimal from a real options based decision rule. Depending on the development of the markets a reversal may take place later. The cost and demand parameters upon which the decisions to switch are made, including the stochastic characteristics of freight rates, are estimated from an empirical analysis that is updated every week throughout a 12-year time period from 1993 to 2005. The second-hand market for bulk ships seems to have been efficient most of these years in the sense that market switching usually did not pay off, with one major exception: it seemed profitable in expectation to leave the dry bulk market and enter the tanker market over a significant period of time shortly after the millennium shift, and to return to the dry bulk market about three years later. These points in time corresponded with an unprecedented boom period in the tanker and dry bulk freight markets, respectively, and the result suggest that agents in the second-hand market were slow to adjust their expectations. In retrospect, such an investment policy also happened to be profitable compared to staying put in the tanker market, even after accounting for transaction costs.","[Sodal, Sigbjorn; Koekebakker, Steen; Adland, Roar] Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway; [Adland, Roar] Clarkson Fund Management Ltd, London, England",University of Agder,"Sodal, S (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway.",sigbjorn.sodal@hia.no,"Koekebakker, Steen/HJY-0883-2023",,,,,,32,27,27,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Results using multinomial logit and ordered probit models suggest that households are motivated to participate in the informal sector when members spend little time in formal sector activity, believe that taxes are too high and their incomes are too low, have dependents to support and believe that the resulting tax evasion will go undetected. Their perception of the risk of detection by the tax authority is determined largely by the income they earn in the formal sector and the extent of government bureaucracy prevailing there.","[Sookram, S.; Watson, P.

For that purpose we use a novel approach in modeling a social accounting matrix (SAM)-based CGE model by combining an original data set containing rich, highly-disaggregated household budget suveys with detailed macro-level data for Georgia. A distinctive contribution of this study is the attention paid to regional differences in terms of market access and transaction costs, in addition to households' factor endowments and consumption patterns. The main questions of interest are whether and to what extent remittance flows contribute to the production and consumption pattern of the poor. Two aspects of poverty reduction are emphasised: (1) the impact of remittances on aggregate and sectoral economic growth and (2) the impact of remittances on poor households, their production and consumption patterns across regions. The study concludes that, while having a strong macroeconomic growth effect at the aggregate level, emigration and inward remittance flows do not affect all sectors and residents symmetrically. Moreover, they have a rather limited impact in terms of poverty and income inequality.","[Uzagalieva, Ainura] Univ Azores, Dept Econ & Management, Ctr Appl Econ Studies Atlantic, CEEApeA, Prague, Czech Republic; [Uzagalieva, Ainura] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Uzagalieva, A (通讯作者)，Univ Azores, Dept Econ & Management, Ctr Appl Econ Studies Atlantic, CEEApeA, Prague, Czech Republic.",uzagali@uac.pt,"Uzagalieva, Ainura/H-2950-2014; Menezes, António/AAU-5257-2021","Menezes, António/0000-0002-2001-1589",,,,,28,4,4,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,4,,,,,453,474,,10.1080/14631370903339856,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,596GT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277673900005,0

We find a significant decrease in post-PDL Medicaid prescription shares of drugs excluded from the PDL. Spillovers onto third parties and the cash market are also statistically significant. Moreover, a more restrictive prior authorization procedure has a greater impact on prescription shares. There is evidence of gradual adjustment in prescription shares.

Having experienced both benefits and costs, it is essential for Asia to identify its role in the global economy and the international financial system, so as to stand at a better position in the following globalization process. In this chapter, we focus on Asia's role in two scenerios. First, we look at the possibility of Asia in negotiating for a greater role in the international institutions such as international Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. As a result of its rising economic weight in the world economy, Asia needs to negotiate for greater responsibilities and representations in these institutions, so that the region has a larger role to play in the construction of world economic and financial system as well its regional crisis management. Second, in the event where such negotiation for greater responsibilities failed, we suggest the idea of forming Asia's own independent regional institutions so that the region is responsible for its own economic destiny. We then focus on Asia's role in the new era of world's economy - it tripartite arrangement, in which the world consists of three major regional blocks, namely, the US, EU and Asia. We identify a few areas in which Asian countries should work on in the process of forming the block, and also discuss the challenges and obstacles ahead.",,,,,"BO, YANG/S-8752-2018",,,,,,0,0,0,0,2,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-281-557-6,,,,2009,,,,,,,141,154,,,,,,14,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BIS32,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262422300008,0

We consider two sources of product-specific consumer skill acquisition: learning by consuming and consumer socialization. Consumers utilize these two sources in order to derive higher valuations for products they consume. In this framework, we discuss the behavior of returns to advertising relative to changes in product characteristics, such as quality and user-friendliness. The main finding is that, in the case of duopoly, dependence of returns to advertising on product quality is not monotonic as had been suggested by earlier studies. Rather, returns have an inverted U shape, given the quality of the competing product.","Maastricht Univ, MERIT, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Babutsidze, Z (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, MERIT, Keizer Karelpl 19, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands.",babutsidze@merit.unu.edu,,"Babutsidze, Zakaria/0000-0001-8734-8429",,,,,34,6,6,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Overall. Bertrand markets tend to converge to Nash equilibrium predictions more quickly and more completely than Cournot markets. Further, when products are close substitutes Bertrand markets respond more quickly to an announced nominal shock. As products become weaker substitutes, however, an increased tendency for tacit collusion degrades convergence in Bertrand markets. This effect is particularly pronounced following a nominal shock. Our results suggest that in an oligopoly context variations in decision error costs dominate a 'Strategic Substitutes Effect' isolated in previous experimental research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses an experiment to explore whether the self-relevance of information influences information processing. The experiment implements two information processing tasks that are identical from a theoretical perspective, but differ in the type of information provided: performance feedback versus information within the context of a purely statistical updating problem. The results suggest that information processing differs significantly across self-relevant and self-irrelevant contexts. In the self-relevant context, except in cases where initial self-confidence is high, subjects overweigh unfavorable performance feedback, leading to overly pessimistic beliefs. This is in contrast to the corresponding self-irrelevant setup, where departures from Bayes' rule do not follow a consistent pattern in terms of direction, and are smaller in magnitude. In addition, I find that women may interpret positive feedback more conservatively than men, leading to more pessimistic posteriors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The Australian Workplace Relations Act 1996 (WRA) provides a natural experiment in which union bargaining power was decreased. We estimate productivity growth before and after the WRA. While the WRA did not increase productivity growth in union firms compared with non-union firms, in industries with more extensive unionisation, productivity growth in union firms was greater post-WRA compared with pre-WRA growth for non-union firms.

Individual countries research has been conducted for twelve EU countries for which enough data were available, while panel analysis has been performed both for EU-27 and for some sub-groups, distinguished by their different socio-economic and monetary structures, and per capita GDP. BARS curves were generally found, and the shares of actual public expenditures generally exceed substantially those related to the maximization of GDP growth. However, great differences emerge. For the 12 countries examined by time-series techniques, the difference between the actual level and the peak of the BARS curve ranges from 2.3 points for Ireland and 18.1 points for Belgium. Similar situations were found in the panel analysis, with a smaller gap for the Anglo-Saxon countries in comparison to the Western Continental countries. For low per capita GDP countries the peak is higher than for the mature economies. Moreover, we found a long-run relationship between real GDP and public expenditure for six countries, while Granger-causality tests suggest different flows of direction for each country. So, further research may prove useful to shed light on the disparities emerging in the empirical analysis of individual countries, as well as within panel sub-groups. Results in the paper highlight that European countries are very heterogeneous in terms of the peak of the BARS curve. This evidence leads to an interesting question, i.e. if the fiscal adjustment should he the same for all the states or it should depend on the weight of the public sector on GDP in each country.",,,,,"Magazzino, Cosimo/K-5030-2015","Magazzino, Cosimo/0000-0002-3176-9838",,,,,82,39,41,0,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

By contrast, the level and structure of executive compensation have been largely unresponsive to tax incentives since the 19805. However, the relative tax advantage of different forms of pay was small during this period. Using a sample of top executives in large firms from 1946 to 2005, we also find a small short run response of salaries, qualified stock options, and bonuses paid after retirement to changes in tax rates on labor income even though tax rates were significantly higher and more heterogeneous across individuals in the first several decades following WWII. We explore several potential explanations for the conflicting impressions given by the long-run and short-run correlations between taxes and pay, including changes in social norms and concerns about pay equality.

Lescohier, a prominent member of the Wisconsin Institutional School, put the labor market in the center of his investigations and tried to examine many of the factors that determine its efficient functioning, differentiating his study from the labor studies that focused on the individual - mainly union - worker. His analysis was essentially influenced by the progressive political climate of his time, the heterodox thought of some non-Marshallian British economists like Beveridge, and the newly emergent field of personnel management. Lescohier ardently proposed the creation of a federal-state centralized system of employment offices, which would undertake the difficult task of organizing the American labor market after the end of World War I. His work constituted both an interesting and significant case study, and thus deserves a higher position in the history of labor economics.","Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Katselidis, IA (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece.",,,,,,,,49,2,3,0,10,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

As different as these funds are in different countries with regards to their regulation, their ownership structure and operation, none were immune to the sub-prime led financial crisis. The Hungarian private pension funds are unique amongst the defined contribution (DC) funds. With their decade old recent history, they are maturing to the payout period in a few years' time; however, their demise appears ever more realistic by means of political decision. This makes uncovering their investment policy during the crises very timely. Examining such a period is of importance in shedding light on the behaviour of traditional financial concepts in periods of stress. In this paper, we assess the optimality of diversification, hedging and short sales decision possibilities of the Hungarian pension funds in the equity investments environment. Was the net asset value (NAV) erosion suffered by the Hungarian private pension funds a result of their investment decision? We examine this question of diversification through a hypothetical simulation of model investment portfolios. Our results show that international diversification yields better risk-adjusted returns only in case of perfect hindsight of future market movements. The high correlation of the stock indices globally in times of crises limits the benefits of diversification.","[Naffa, H.] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Finance, Fac Business Adm, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Naffa, H (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Finance, Fac Business Adm, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",erzsebet.kovacs@uni-corvinus.hu; barbara.domotor@uni-corvinus.hu; helena.naffa@uni-corvinus.hu,"Naffa, Helena/ABE-3227-2021","Naffa, Helena/0000-0003-4284-1601; Domotor, Barbara/0000-0001-6265-4323",,,,,28,5,4,1,27,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

The process is a team problem in which the principal rewards successful sharing by optimally rewarding performance. In this setting we compare two modes of knowledge transfer with regard to efficiency. The first is sequential in which the sender precommits to teaching and the receiver acts as a follower. The second is simultaneous where each agent simultaneously exerts effort. A key result is that the sequential mode dominates when teaching and learning are complements, but the simultaneous mode dominates if teaching and learning are substitutes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Graduate taxes transfer the volatility in future income from risk-averse students to the risk-neutral state. However, a double moral-hazard problem arises when graduates' work effort and universities' teaching quality are endogenized. Graduate taxes reduce work incentives, but induce universities to improve teaching quality. Yet if revenues are distributed evenly among universities, there is free riding. This is solved by allocating each university the tax revenue from its own alumni. We also demonstrate how a budget-balancing graduate tax would encourage higher university participation than the equivalent tuition fee.

The paper systematically builds an integrated model that includes quality as well as sustainable performance of the built environment and accompanying construction processes. This model for the Integrated Quality and Sustainability Performance Assessment in Construction presents a three-level arrangement, namely: the structure, process/project, and construction product. We propose a holistic sustainability assessment methodology based on the authors' previous research work for structures. The strict implementation of quality and environmental management systems in the participating organisations and in the whole construction project guarantees quality and environmental performance at project/process level. On the construction product level, we complement the existing requirement of providing a statement of conformity for each product of the structure with the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for all construction products. We use the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to obtain the EPDs for specific construction products; in this way, we can evaluate their environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of a product or structure. On the structure level, a model for the integrated sustainability and quality assessment, which was previously proposed by the authors, is employed. Integration of all three levels ensures that the desired plateau of quality and sustainability performance is achieved for structures, processes and products. In the present version, the model is tailored to the specific features of buildings, and the sustainability aspect is limited to the environmental performance. An investigation of measures required to implement the proposed model into practice shows that clients have a major influence upon the procurement rules. Consequently, the targeted audience of potential users is that of clients procuring buildings.","[Srdic, Aleksander; Selih, Jana] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Srdic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Jamova 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",aleksander.srdic@fgg.uni-lj.si; jana.selih@fgg.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,57,26,31,4,38,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We construct a measure of total volatility that encompasses both permanent and transitory instability, and that admits employment transitions and losses from self employment. We also present a detailed decomposition of earnings volatility to account for changing shares in employment probabilities, conditional variances of continuous workers, and conditional mean variances from employment entry and exit. Our results show that earnings volatility among men increased by 15% from the early 1970s to mid 1980s, while women's volatility fell, and each stabilized thereafter. However, this pooled series masks important heterogeneity in volatility levels and trends across education groups and marital status. We find that men's earnings volatility is increasingly accounted for by employment transitions, especially exits, while the share of women's volatility accounted for by continuous workers rose, each of which highlights the importance of allowing for periods of non-work in volatility studies.

This article evaluates the long-term impacts of STAR by linking the experimental data to administrative records. We first demonstrate that kindergarten test scores are highly correlated with outcomes such as earnings at age 27, college attendance, home ownership, and retirement savings. We then document four sets of experimental impacts. First, students in small classes are significantly more likely to attend college and exhibit improvements on other outcomes. Class size does not have a significant effect on earnings at age 27, but this effect is imprecisely estimated. Second, students who had a more experienced teacher in kindergarten have higher earnings. Third, an analysis of variance reveals significant classroom effects on earnings. Students who were randomly assigned to higher quality classrooms in grades K-3-as measured by classmates' end-of-class test scores-have higher earnings, college attendance rates, and other outcomes. Finally, the effects of class quality fade out on test scores in later grades, but gains in noncognitive measures persist.","[Chetty, Raj] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Northwestern University,"Chetty, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,44,573,785,4,175,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Hamilton [in the Palgrave Dictionary of Macroeconomics (2008)] noted that nine of the last ten recessions in the United States were preceded by a substantial increases in the price of oil. In this paper, we consider whether oil price shocks significantly increase the probability of recessions in a number of countries. Because business cycle turning points generally are not available for other countries, we estimate the turning points together with oil's effect in a Markov-switching model with time-varying transition probabilities. We find that, for most countries, oil shocks do affect the likelihood of entering a recession. In particular, for a constant, zero-term spread, an average-sized shock to WTI oil prices increases the probability of recession in the United States by nearly 50 percentage points after one year and nearly 90 percentage points after two years.","[Engemann, Kristie M.; Kliesen, Kevin L.; Owyang, Michael T.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63166 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Kliesen, KL (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, POB 442, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",kliesen@stls.frb.org,"Kliesen, Kevin L/I-5746-2016; Owyang, Michael T/I-5750-2016","Kliesen, Kevin L/0000-0002-7166-6016; Owyang, Michael T/0000-0002-2109-3432",,,,,31,28,32,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

On average, 60% of the Iranian government revenues and 90% of export revenues originate from oil and gas resources. Current international sanctions on Iran have mainly targeted the oil production capacity of Iran and its exports to the global markets. In this study, we analyze the dynamic effects of oil shocks on different categories of the Iranian government expenditures from 1959 to 2007, using impulse response functions (IRF) and variance decomposition analysis (VDC) techniques. The main results show that Iran's military and security expenditures significantly respond to a shock in oil revenues (or oil prices), while social spending components do not show significant reactions to such shocks.

It extends the standard analysis of tacit collusion by allowing firms to make their strategic choices either simultaneously or sequentially. It is shown that price leadership indeed facilitates collusion by making it easier to punish deviations by the leader. In case of pure Bertrand competition, price leadership restores the scope for (perfect) collusion in markets where collusion would not be sustainable otherwise. When firms face asymmetric costs or offer differentiated products, price leadership can also enhance the profitability of collusion in case of asymmetric costs, the less efficient firm must act as the leader. Finally, such leadership is less effective in case of Cournot competition since, following an aggressive deviation by the leader, the follower would rather limit its own output, making it more difficult to punish the deviation. Still, quantity leadership may enhance collusion when it is already somewhat effective in a simultaneous move setting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The model is then used to estimate the outcomes resulting from a possible strategy of fiscal consolidation in the base case. The exercise shows that it is possible to have fiscal consolidation while at the same time maintaining high GDP growth of around 8% or so. The strategy is to gradually bring down the revenue deficit to zero by 2014-15, while allowing a combined fiscal deficit for centre plus states of about 6% of GDP. This provides the space for substantial government capital expenditure. which translates to a significant public investment program. This in turn leads to high overall investment directly and indirectly, via the crowding in effect on private investment, which drives the high GDP growth.

Now that evidence suggests that regulation is not always a barrier to good employment performance, recent contributions have focused on its impact in exacerbating within-workforce inequalities, including gender inequality. This article reveals that the evidence supporting this proposition is thin and inconclusive and questions the search for a cross national relationship between regulations and gender. This approach leaves out of consideration the differences in institutional interactions in specific national contexts and the differences in the institution of gender across time and space. This critique is developed through more detailed and context specific analyses of interactions between gender and six areas of labour market regulation. The article concludes by arguing that simply introducing a general gender variable into non gendered analyses of labour markets misleads more than informs and distracts from the development of regulations to promote gender equality.","Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Rubery, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Booth St W, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",Jill.Rubery@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,92,20,22,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Results show cigarette demand to be near unit elastic, the income effects to be generally insignificant and border price effects and habit effects to be significant. Regarding advertising effects, aggregate cigarette advertising has a negative effect on smoking. Important differences across advertising media emerge when cigarette advertising is disaggregated. The effects of public entertainment and Internet cigarette advertising are stronger than those of other media. Anti-smoking messages accompanying print cigarette advertising seem relatively more effective.

How, if at all, should economists use and combine molecular genetic and economic data from these surveys? What challenges arise when analyzing genetically informative data? To illustrate, we present results from a genome-wide association study of educational attainment. We use a sample of 7,500 individuals from the Framingham Heart Study; our dataset contains over 360,000 genetic markers per person. We get some initially promising results linking genetic markers to educational attainment, but these fail to replicate in a second large sample of 9,500 people from the Rotterdam Study. Unfortunately such failure is typical in molecular genetic studies of this type, so the example is also cautionary. We discuss a number of methodological challenges that face researchers who use molecular genetics to reliably identify genetic associates of economic traits. Our overall assessment is cautiously optimistic: this new data source has potential in economics.

Current results are enhanced in this paper through a series of improvement as follows: new models are proposed for describing the return and dividend processes, especially the trader's behavior with the adaptive expectation belief and the bounded rational expectation belief, respectively; with these models, we establish dynamical systems in terms of the price-to-earnings ratio and the forecast-to-earnings ratio; the detailed solution and asymptotic analysis of these equations provide new, elaborate and quantitative explanations for both the formation and disappearance of different price bubbles; inspired by the herd behavior framework, a new random belief evolutionary mechanism is devised to model the belief change between two beliefs; a specific genetic algorithm is designed to efficiently estimate model parameters; simulation and empirical studies are carried out to illustrate the application of new methods.

Using the panel data of bilateral cross-country stock market correlations of 23 countries, it is found that the correlations are negatively associated with the Great Circular Distance (GCD) between the financial centres of these countries and positively associated with the duration of overlapping trading hours among stock exchanges and the colonial links between countries.

Our results provide little evidence that healthy households or couples are responding to the incentives embedded in the means tests determining pension eligibility by reallocating assets. While there are some differences in asset portfolios associated with having an income near the income threshold, being of pensionable age, and being in poor health, these differences are often only marginally significant and are not clearly consistent with the incentives inherent in the Australian age pension eligibility rules.

This paper argues that, in the context of recent theoretical developments in anthropology and cognitive psychology, Thorstein Veblen's work on the place of science in modern societies can provide a theoretical framework to study public misgiving toward embryology in the United States. It is argued that combining insights regarding human cognitive predisposition toward ritualization offered by Veblen with evolutionary theory on hazard-precaution systems and religious cognition may shed some light on the peculiarity of the initial public responses to embryology. Ultimately, this paper contends that understanding that initial reactions to embryology may follow a cognitive path of least resistance signifies that assessing the legitimacy of embryology will necessitate a deliberate effort toward instrumental thinking that may go against human cognitive predispositions.","Denison Univ, Dept Econ, Granville, OH 43023 USA",University System of Ohio; Denison University,"Duroy, Q (通讯作者)，Denison Univ, Dept Econ, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",,,,,,,,57,1,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Due to Taiwan's unique international political status, its present government believes that closer economic integration with China would enhance Taiwan's economic prosperity and prevent Taiwan from being marginalized in East Asia. Taiwan hence signed the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China in 2010. This paper summarizes arguments opposed to the ECFA from economic and political perspectives. Despite the fact that Taiwan is expected to reap greater benefits from deeper integration with China, simulation analyses show that the welfare-enhancing effect brought about by the ECFA is quite limited, because the ECFA contains no definite content or timeline other than an early harvest list.","[Hong, Tsai-Lung] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Ctr Contemporary China, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; [Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Jhongli 320, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University; National Central University,"Hong, TL (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Ctr Contemporary China, 101,Sect 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",Honigmann_tw@hotmail.com; chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,14,10,12,1,31,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1535-3516,,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

They provide immediate access to a large and diverse subject pool, and allow researchers to control the experimental context. Online experiments, we show, can be just as valid-both internally and externally-as laboratory and field experiments, while often requiring far less money and time to design and conduct. To demonstrate their value, we use an online labor market to replicate three classic experiments. The first finds quantitative agreement between levels of cooperation in a prisoner's dilemma played online and in the physical laboratory. The second shows-consistent with behavior in the traditional laboratory-that online subjects respond to priming by altering their choices. The third demonstrates that when an identical decision is framed differently, individuals reverse their choice, thus replicating a famed Tversky-Kahneman result. Then we conduct a field experiment showing that workers have upward-sloping labor supply curves. Finally, we analyze the challenges to online experiments, proposing methods to cope with the unique threats to validity in an online setting, and examining the conceptual issues surrounding the external validity of online results. We conclude by presenting our views on the potential role that online experiments can play within the social sciences, and then recommend software development priorities and best practices.","[Horton, John J.; Rand, David G.; Zeckhauser, Richard J.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Zeckhauser, RJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",richard_zeckhauser@harvard.edu,"Rand, David G./B-3716-2009","Rand, David/0000-0002-2821-468X",,,,,45,909,1141,4,148,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Using household level data on fertility from South Africa and relying on between cohort variations in country level HIV infection, he estimates a large negative effect of HIV prevalence on fertility. However, the studies that utilize the recent rounds of Demographic Health Surveys, where fertility outcomes are linked to HIV status based on testing, find no effect of the disease on the fertility behavior. This paper tries to bridge this gap by revisiting Young's findings. Young (2005) includes data before 1990, when no data are available on HIV prevalence rates. He assigns all the fertility observations before 1990 with HIV prevalence rates of zero, and this appears to drive the significant negative effect found in his study. When one restricts the sample to the period 1990-1998, where actual HIV data are available, the effect of HIV prevalence on fertility turns out to be positive for South Africa. Simulating Young's model utilizing these new estimates shows that the future generations of South Africa are worse off.

At the same time, international investors come from different countries whose home markets are characterized by varying degrees of control-ownership disparity. This paper studies whether this difference in investors' home countries affects their portfolio choice in an emerging market. It combines two unique data sets on ownership and control in business groups, and investor-stock level foreign investment in Korea. A key finding is that investors from low-disparity countries disfavor high-disparity stocks in Korea, but investors from high-disparity countries are indifferent. Moreover, investors from low-disparity countries became averse to disparity only after the Asian financial crisis. These results suggest that the nature of corporate governance in international investors' home countries affects their portfolio choice abroad, and therefore these investors should not be lumped together in the analyses of their portfolio choice.

This paper aims to provide further insights into long-run determinants of Spanish FDI by considering not only bilateral but also spatially weighted third-country determinants. The few studies carried out so far have focused on FDI flows in a limited number of countries. However, Spanish FDI outflows have risen dramatically since 1995 and today account for a substantial part of global FDI. Therefore, we estimate recently developed spatial panel data models by maximum likelihood (ML) procedures for Spanish outflows (1993-2004) to top-50 host countries. After controlling for unobservable effects, we find that spatial interdependence matters and provide evidence consistent with new economic geography theories of agglomeration, mainly due to complex (vertical) FDI motivations. Spatial error models estimations also provide illuminating results regarding the transmission mechanism of shocks.","[Martinez-Martin, Jaime] Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA Res Grp, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Martinez-Martin, Jaime] BBVA Res, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Martínez-Martín, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA Res Grp, Torre 4,Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",Jaime.martinezmartin@ub.edu,,,,,,,46,4,4,0,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Agents willing to set up a firm abroad incur a learning cost that depends on how different the foreign and domestic entrepreneurial environments are. In this context, we show that globalization fosters FDI and raises wages, output and productivity. However, not everybody wins. The steady state relationship between globalization and income is U-shaped: high- and low-income agents are better off in a globalized world, while middle-income agents (domestic entrepreneurs) are worse off. Thus, consistently with recent empirical evidence, the model predicts globalization to increase inequality at the top of the income distribution while decreasing it at the bottom.

We consider the use of second-price auctions for selling these objects, and show that there exists a unique symmetric Markov equilibrium in this market. In equilibrium, buyers shad their bids down by their continuation value, which is the (endogenous) option value c participating in future auctions.

This is defined in terms of the movement from employment to self-employment on receipt of a financial windfall. A theoretical framework developing Evans and Jovanovic (1989) is set up and tested with panel data from German households. The results show that financial constraints do exist given that individuals are more likely to start a personal business after receiving a windfall gain. The value of windfall gains has a significant but non linear effect on the decision to become self employed. The data reveal that differences in ability and income affect the change in employment status. We also report that there is no evidence that becoming self-employed involves the anticipation of windfall gains. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We examine income convergence via endogenous growth model for countries in which the scale factor stemming from learning-by-doing is a prevailing feature. We illustrate a clear connection between externalities and trade among EU countries. Empirical evidence based on a panel of industries shows that learning from export and import related scale effect do significantly affect the convergence process. We find that there is a low speed of convergence across the EU manufacturing. This implies that the degree of cross-manufacturing productivity inequality disappears in the very long-run.

Sometimes it is better to commit to complete secrecy within the team of the various participants' interim progress as it mitigates the negative effect of failures. In some other situations, commitment to full disclosure is better as players are then encouraged to be proactive by exerting efforts in the early rounds and motivate other team members into continued activities by way of interim progress.

Among the main results, it is found that the likelihood of the LRBC holding is high for Germany and Japan, and thus the current account deficits are most likely to be sustainable.

In this study, we attempt to illuminate the intraday behavioural aspects of noise traders in the Turkish stock market using a novel approach. The diagnostic results in the initial phase of the analysis reveal that residual volume is a suitable proxy to identify noise traders' activities. The second phase of the analysis manifests that the noise traders significantly contribute to the volatility in spreads and that the duration of the volatility impact is short lived. These results are consistent with our prior conjectures and affirm the validity of our approach and propositions. The approach and findings, when generalized to other emerging markets, carry some implications for policy markers. In Turkey, revival of capital gain taxes abolished after the inception of global crisis might be a resolution to alleviate noise trader activities.","[Baklaci, H.

The supply side of the economy is composed of two sectors: a modern sector that produces a homogeneous good using skilled labor and physical capital; and an agrarian sector that produces a traditional good using unskilled adult labor, child labor, and land. An increase in foreign direct investment and improvements in education reduce the incidence of child labor. Emigration of skilled (unskilled) workers reduces (raises) the supply of child labor, while trade sanctions reduce the demand for child labor. Child wage subsidies have an ambiguous effect on the incidence of child labor while education subsidies are effective in reducing the incidence of child labor.

These results are obtained for data that is generated by a simulation-model of a collusive industry. Using such data leaves little room for debate about the quality of these methods because estimates of, e.g., overcharges can be compared to their true underlying values.

The results show that the degree of competition in domestic markets and the independence of national regulatory authorities are the main factors to explain the increase in efficiency in the postal sector.

We find for the Premier League (the highest level of competition) that, other things being equal, managers who themselves played at a higher level raise the productivity of less-skilled teams by more than that of highly skilled teams. This is consistent with the hypothesis that one function of a top manager is to communicate to subordinates the skills needed to succeed, since less skilled players have more to learn. However, we also find that managers with more accumulated professional managing experience raise the productivity of talented players by more than that of less-talented players.

Trade processing data were collected for European countries for the period 1995-2000. In addition to finding that market- and cost-related determinants exert the expected influence on trade processing flows, our results suggest that TU bargaining power had a negative effect on delocalization strategies in the period considered.

To start closing this gap, we study transfers of income to real-world poor people in dictator games. Our dictators can purchase signals about why the recipients are poor. We find that a third of the dictators are willing to pay money to learn more about their recipient. Dictators who acquire information mostly use it to withhold resources from less-preferred types, leading to a drastic decline in aggregate transfers.

We show that the optimal allocation depends on technological factors, the parties' valuations of the goods produced, and the degree of impurity of these goods. When the degree of impurity is large, control rights should be given to the main investor, irrespective of preference considerations. There are some situations in which this allocation is optimal even if the degree of impurity is very low as long as one party's investment is more important than the other party's. If the parties' investments are of similar importance and the degree of impurity is large, shared authority is optimal with a greater share going to the low-valuation party. If the importance of the parties' investments is similar but the degree of impurity is neither large nor small, the low-valuation party should receive sole authority. We analyze an extension in which side payments are infeasible. We check for robustness of our results in several dimensions, such as allowing for multiple parties or for joint authority, and apply our results to interpret a number of complex partnerships, including those involving schools and child custody.","[Francesconi, Marco] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Muthoo, Abhinay] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Essex; University of Warwick,"Francesconi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",mfranc@essex.ac.uk; a.muthoo@warwick.ac.uk,"Muthoo, Abhinay/ABB-9001-2020; Francesconi, Marco/G-2719-2016",,,,,,52,24,25,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We use a public data set of daily option prices to compute this index and show that daily changes in VIBEX-NEW display a negative, tight contemporaneous relationship with IBEX daily returns, contrary to other common volatility indicators, as an implied volatility indicator or a GARCH(1,1) conditional volatility model. This relationship is approximately symmetric to the sign on VIBEX-NEW changes and asymmetric to the IBEX-35 returns sign, which make it clearly a suitable volatility index for the Spanish stock market. We also examine the relationship between current VIBEX-NEW and future IBEX-35 volatility. Our results suggest that VIBEX-NEW can be used to produce IBEX-35 volatility forecasts at least as good as historical and conditional volatility measures.

In the light of above mentioned criticism, of great number of researches and ongoing debates over the FVA issue, in the center of the world accounting and financial community currently are requirements for a deep reform and even withdrawal of FVA standards. In this work we analyze the correctness of such statements and the impact of fair value accounting on the EU and USA banks financial results before and during the crisis. We will try to answer the questions - Whether the use of fair value accounting contributed to originating and strengthening of the current financial crisis?

A self-interested legislature choosing between the direct exercise of its legislative authority and delegation to an administrative agency must therefore trade off the value of bureaucratic competence against bureaucratic drift and, importantly, loss of control over bargaining. Our analysis, first, clarifies when the legislature's choice between delegation and no delegation is socially efficient or socially inefficient; second, highlights the role of political bargaining and shows that precluding interest group influence through bargaining may actually increase the scope for socially inefficient outcomes; and, third, illustrates the model's predictions in light of selected stylized facts and the practice of scant empirical work on legislative delegation.","Washington & Lee Univ, Lexington, VA 24450 USA",Washington & Lee University,"Grajzl, P (通讯作者)，Washington & Lee Univ, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.",grajzlp@wlu.edu,,,,,,,73,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Recipients were randomly assigned to treatments designed to explore behavioral responses to linear matching schemes, as well as the mere existence of a substantial lead donor. We use the exogenous variation in match rates across treatments to estimate the price elasticities of charitable giving. We find that straight linear matching schemes raise the total donations received including the match value, but partially crowd out the actual donations given excluding the match. If charitable organizations can use lead gifts as they wish, our results show that they maximize donations given by simply announcing the presence of a lead gift.

The null hypothesis - which tests for normality of asset returns - is rejected due to asymmetry of these returns. We assume that the asymmetric behaviour and volatility of the returns are captured by the shape and scale parameters, respectively, of a GEV distribution. The data set includes stock indices for the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and South Africa, and the South African rand exchange rates against the US dollar observed from 3 January 2005 to 30 December 2009. In addition, we divide this sample period into two periods: the pre-crisis period, from 3 January 2005 to 31 December 2007 and the crisis period, from 1 January 2008 to 30 December 2009. We compared the estimates of value at risk (VaR) using an extreme value theory (EVT) model, with the estimates derived from the traditional variance-covariance method and found that during the crisis the 99% extreme VaR estimates are more reliable as they lie within the Basel II green zone. These results suggest that, at higher quintiles, the VaR estimates based on EVT are reliable and more accurate than estimates from the traditional method.","[Kabundi, Alain; Muteba, John Mwamba] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Kabundi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ, Cnr Kingsway & Univ Rd,Auckland Pk,POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa.",akabundi@uj.ac.za; johnmu@uj.ac.za,"Mwamba, John Weirstrass Muteba/I-5479-2014","Mwamba, John Weirstrass Muteba/0000-0002-8002-1156",,,,,16,0,3,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The experience of suspension of the gold standard in World War I and resumption in the 1920s (for some countries at a different parity) is reviewed. It suggests that, in practice, PT might operate with an escape clause that would allow rebasing of the price target in the face of large shocks. Using a calibrated general equilibrium model, we show that such an escape clause can produce multiple equilibria. For some parameterizations, there is a low credibility equilibrium (with high expectation of a reset) associated with high output volatility and frequent resets. These problems reduce, or reverse, the expectational advantage PT has over inflation targeting. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We study the simplest possible extension of the stochastic two-period, one agent and one commodity OLG model, where we have added one more period, with only one potential activity, namely, trading of contingent commodities. We assume, however, that markets are incomplete. In this case the Monetary equilibrium is not Pareto Optimal and for an open set of economies an allocation where fluctuations in realized savings are removed, Pareto dominates the monetary equilibrium. This allocation may be implemented by means of a monetary/fiscal policy. The policy considered has a simple rationale, namely that it removes some of the uncertainty that agents face by reducing price, i.e interest rate volatility. We consider two fundamental sources of such volatility, namely, respectively an objective and a subjective signal about the distribution of future endowments. The first case is when agents have rational expectations while the second case is studied in the context of agents having rational beliefs, beliefs which are consistent with empirical observations but not (necessarily) correct.","Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Ist Polit Econ, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Nielsen, CK (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Ist Polit Econ, Via Necchi 5, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",carsten.nielsen@unicatt.it,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We depart from recent contributions on credit networks in two respects. In the first place, we constrain diversification with the out- and in-degree distribution of nodes, by adopting a suitable extension of the expected degree model for random weighted digraphs. In the second place, we focus on real networks by using this extension as null model for statistical analysis. With the help of statistical inference, we provide a rigorous answer to the following question: do real networks obey our null model? Further, we show that this answer is tightly connected to the existence of clusters or modules, as defined by Newman and Girvan (2004), within networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We use a framework that allows for goods trade and capital mobility and show that labour market imperfections exert opposite effects in the absence of capital mobility (the short run) and its presence (the long run), respectively. In the short run, a higher degree of labour market rigidity decreases the value of total trade, but increases the share of intra-industry trade for a country that is larger than its trading partner. The reverse effects are observed when capital is allowed to cross country borders. Using data on unemployment and income distribution for 23 OECD countries, we compute the central parameter in our theoretical model that describes the degree of labour market rigidity. We use this new empirical concept to provide evidence for our theoretical findings by means of reduced-form regressions as well as simulation results of a calibrated general equilibrium model.On developpe un modele a plusieurs pays avec des marches du travail imparfaits pour etudier l'effet des frictions dans les marches du travail sur les flux de commerce bilateraux. On utilise un cadre analytique qui permet le commerce des biens et la mobilite du capital, et on montre que les imperfections sur le marche du travail ont des effets opposes en l'absence de mobilite du capital (a court terme) et quand mobilite du capital il y a (a long terme). A court terme, un fort degre de rigidite dans le marche du travail reduit la valeur totale du commerce, mais accroit la part du commerce intra-industrie pour le pays qui a une taille plus grande que celle de son partenaire commercial. Les effets inverses sont observes quand on permet au capital de traverser les frontieres. A l'aide de donnees sur le chomage et la repartition du revenu pour 23 pays de l'OCDE, on calcule le parametre central du modele theorique qui decrit le degre de rigidite du marche du travail.

We deliver sufficient and necessary conditions for a function to be a follower function, and we describe the structure of the set of all influence functions that lead to a given follower function. In the command structure introduced by Hu and Shapley, for each player a simple game called the command game is built. One of the central concepts of this model is the concept of command function. We deliver sufficient and necessary conditions for a function to be a command function, and describe the minimal sets generating a normal command game.

Extremal QR, or QR applied to the tails, is of interest in many economic and financial applications, such as conditional value at risk, production efficiency, and adjustment bands in (S,s) models. This paper provides feasible inference tools for extremal conditional quantile models that rely on extreme value approximations to the distribution of self-normalized QR statistics. The methods are simple to implement and can be of independent interest even in the univariate (non-regression) case.

Although most of the attention in the literature is on the performance induced by high power incentives, there are many daily situations in which dropouts and quitting are a major concern. Using a field experiment in schools and a model of dynamic tournament we examine the effect of different levels of rewards on the rate of quitting. Our experiment indicates that there is a possible tradeoff between performance and quitting. Strong incentives tournaments induced participants to exert more effort and exhibit a better performance but, at the same time, it induces a higher rate of quitting.

As such, we are able to consider the interactions of public investment with inflation, taxation, and public debt. Our results indicate that a clear trade-off exists between the costs and benefits of public investment, as is the case in the existing literature. However, the use of a monetary-fiscal policy model rather than a real general equilibrium one enables us to trace the macroeconomic channels including monetary ones through which these costs and benefits are transmitted to the rest of the economy.

Empirically, we demonstrate that sovereign defaults are significantly associated with an increased probability of job loss by political leaders: after controlling for other determinants, the quantitative effect of a default on the probability of job loss is comparable to a 3.5 standard deviation fall in economic growth. Cross country regressions reveal that, as predicted by our model, higher indebtedness is associated with higher monetary, fiscal, and public investment policy volatility and with policies that increase output volatility at the expense of growth.","Univ Andes, Sch Management, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Malone, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Andes, Sch Management, Calle 21,1-20 Piso 9, Bogota, Colombia.",smalone@uniandes.edu.co,,,,,,,28,8,10,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Interchange fees are used by payment platforms to allocate the total cost of a payment card transaction between the cardholder's bank, the issuer, and the merchant's bank, the acquirer. Each time a consumer pays by card, its bank receives an interchange fee from the merchants' bank. Banks argue that interchange fees are needed to encourage the use of electronic payment instruments, whereas merchants claim that they artificially inflate the cost of accepting cards. This paper sheds light on the ongoing debate that opposes banks to the regulatory institutions or the competition authorities in various countries, by reviewing the theoretical results of the literature and highlighting some unanswered issues.","Univ Paris Quest Nanterre, Paris, France",,"Verdier, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Quest Nanterre, Paris, France.",,"Verdier, Marianne/HGB-7785-2022","Verdier, Marianne/0000-0002-9974-0708",,,,,30,30,33,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0950-0804,,,J ECON SURV,J.

In this paper, we examine China's economic cooperation related investment (ECI) over time. Our results suggest that the pattern of investment is indeed explained well by factors that are used in the stylised literature to explain directional patterns of outward FDI. They also demonstrate that the (positive) relationship between Chinese ECI and the recipient countries' natural resource richness is not economically meaningful. Finally, while there is some support for the popular wisdom that China is willing to do business with countries with weak political rights, the evidence suggests that, ceteris paribus, its ECI is more likely to flow to countries with low corruption levels and, by extension, better institutions.

The intent of the law is to provide partial consumption insurance by giving an individual a fresh start. However, the law obviously weakens incentives not to default, which can result in higher interest rates that in turn reduce intertemporal insurance. Because of this tradeoff, it is unclear how long is the optimal length of time that an adverse event remains on an individual's credit record. In this paper we assess the welfare consequences of varying the length of time that adverse events can be on one's credit record. We calibrate the model to US data where the exclusion parameter is set to be 10 years on average. Then we run a counterfactual to find the length that maximizes ex-post economywide welfare using a consumption equivalent measure. The model predicts agents prefer to remove the bankruptcy flag after one year, though the gains are small. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, fiscal reforms implemented in the first half of the 2000s, which to some extent followed scientific advice, make analysis of this case particularly interesting. We observe that postreform fiscal redistribution became more rational, and this resulted in fewer incentive distortions. We found no negative association between federal transfers and regional growth.

Overall, fiscal policy variables have become less important growth determinants than was the case in the 1990s.

One of these was the margin of truthfulness. False accounting for the value of production was apparently widespread in some branches of the economy and at some periods of time. A feature of accounting fraud was that cases commonly involved the aggravating element of conspiracy. The paper provides new evidence on the nature and extent of accounting fraud: the scale and optimal size of conspiratorial networks: the authorities' willingness to penalize it and the political and social factors that secured leniency: and inefficiency in the socialist market where managers competed for political credit.

On the basis that the measurement of well being through subjective measures provides a broader perspective than through objective economic variables, this paper first identifies the determinants of deprivation in Spain, in monetary terms, and in non-monetary terms using satisfaction variables. In addition to establishing that the more unequal the income distribution within a group, the less income-satisfied is the individual, we find that unemployment is one of the main determinants of deprivation and satisfaction. Accordingly, we propose a reform of unemployment benefit policy that maintains individuals at the same utility level as when employed, rather than applying the current benefit system. Our policy conclusions reveal that the public budget dedicated to paying benefits to restore satisfaction levels, during the period 1994-1999, would have increased by (sic)2,536,165.13 thousand on an average annually. It could be a desirable policy in good times but, since it increases public spending and thus public deficit, economic policy makers should decide whether it is adequate in rainy days.

Using data from the 2009 TNS Global Economic Crisis Study, we document that approximately one-quarter of U.S. respondents are certain they could not come up with that sum. If we include respondents who report being probably unable to do so, nearly half of respondents are financially fragile. Although financial fragility is more severe among low-income households, a sizable fraction of seemingly middle-class Americans are also at risk. Respondents with low educational attainment and no financial education, families with children, those who have suffered large wealth losses, and the unemployed are also more likely than others to report being unable to cope with a financial shock. Households' own savings are the resource used most often to deal with shocks, but resources of family and friends, formal and alternative credit, increased work hours, and sale of possessions are also used frequently, especially among some subgroups. These results indicate the need to look beyond precautionary savings to understand how families cope. We also find evidence suggestive of a pecking order of coping methods, with savings first in line. Comparing financial fragility and methods of coping among the United States and seven other industrialized countries, we find differences in coping ability but also general evidence of a consistent ordering of methods.","[Lusardi, Annamaria] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Schneider, Daniel] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Tufano, Peter] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",George Washington University; Princeton University; University of Oxford,"Lusardi, A (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",,"Lusardi, Annamaria/AEB-6291-2022","Schneider, Daniel/0000-0001-6786-0302",,,,,77,172,223,5,45,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Under fair value accounting, entities are obliged or permitted to measure particular assets and liabilities at their fair values as at the reporting dates. Fair value is a current market-based hypothetical value. This market value is not always directly observable. The debate on usefulness of fair value accounting has arisen in connection with the financial crunch and economic crisis in years 2007-2009. The opponents of fair value accounting insist on that financial reporting based on fair value measurement has accelerated the financial crisis and significantly worsened the impact on affected companies. On the other hand, there are several important opinions in favour of fair value accounting. The paper aim is to contribute to the actual debate whether fair value accounting played the role of a messenger or a mover in the recent financial crunch and subsequent economic recession and to analyse the characteristics of fair value accounting from the economic point of view.","Univ Econ, Dept Financial Accounting & Auditing, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Procházka, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Financial Accounting & Auditing, Prague, Czech Republic.",prochazd@vse.cz,"Procházka, David/H-4703-2011","Procházka, David/0000-0003-4340-8770",,,,,41,9,11,3,31,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Using data from U.S. municipal bond auctions, I find first-price and second-price auctions under optimal reserve prices lead to little improvement in revenues over existing first-price formats. The number of bidders has a more significant impact on revenues in optimal auctions. I also find invoking an incorrect assumption of private values in counterfactual analyses results in small errors in predicting revenues from optimal second-price auctions.","Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Tang, X (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",xuntang@econ.upenn.edu,,,,,,,26,14,24,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

In China, villagers' committee elections represent a major progress in China's development toward good governance. We develop a rational model to explain villagers' participation. Utilizing a national survey of rural residents in 2005, this paper tests the insights of the model. Two findings are of interest to the students of voting and elections. First, there is disagreement over the causal relationship between political trust and voting. This paper offers a rational interpretation of political trust by emphasizing the informational aspect of concept. Second, voting is generally theorized as a process of overcoming various costs. The prospect of benefits figures more prominently in Chinese village elections. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of township governments in China's rural politics and reveal the inner dilemma of democratization in China.

The nature of such contests can be determined by a designer who is driven by political considerations with a specific political culture. The main objective of this study is to analyze the effect of political culture and of valuation asymmetry on discrimination between the contestants. The weights assigned to the public well being and the contestants' efforts represent the political culture while discrimination is an endogenous variable that characterizes the mechanism allocating the prize. We consider situations under which the optimal bias of the designer is in favor of the contestant with the larger or smaller prize valuation and examine the effect of changes in the political culture and in valuation asymmetry on the designer's preferred discrimination between the contestants. Focusing on the two most widely studied types of contest success functions (deterministic all-pay-auctions and logit CSFs), we show that an all-pay-auction is always the preferred CSF from the point of view of the contest designer.

These same issues have relevance today, in the face of growing concern about the availability of fresh water worldwide. The central point of this article is that appropriative water rights and irrigation districts that emerged in the American West in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in response to aridity to facilitate agricultural water delivery, use, and trade raise the transaction costs today of water markets. These markets are vital for smooth reallocation of water to higher-valued uses elsewhere in the economy and for flexible response to greater hydrological uncertainty. This institutional path dependence illustrates how past arrangements to meet conditions of the time constrain contemporary economic opportunities.

In the first phase, a questionnaire was verified at sport organizations at Prague 6, where Department of Physical Education and Sport of Charles University is located. In the second phase of the research, sport organizations in the area of the capital city Prague were diagnosed. The third phase was realized at sport organizations in the whole area of the Czech Republic, excluding the capital city Prague. In this article, we present the results of the third phase. The questionnaire was conceived as an output of the key activity 1 Creation of methodology for data collection about working positions at sport organizations at HMP area according to the assignment of the project CZ.04.3.07/3.2.01.3/3345 Program of profession development in a field of sport services in interaction with requirements of labour market. Content validity of the questionnaire was ensured by the examination of two experts. Meritorious questions in the questionnaire were focused on characteristics of sport organizations from organization type aspects and labour employment characteristics. The second part is concerned with employers' specific requirements for workers qualification, including knowledge and skills base of job applicants. The third phase deals with workers motivation including evaluation and remuneration of workers and non-financial motivators. Outcomes of the third phase of the research show, that the organizations at this labour market demand especially traditional professions like instructors, coaches, trainers, businessmen and sporting goods sellers. This trend is identical in the capital city Prague and in the other regions of the Czech Republic as well. Majority of demanding organizations are small organizations according to the number of employees (1 - 50 employees). Majority of entrepreneurial subjects are focused on providing sport services and selling of sporting goods. In the areas outside the capital city Prague region, more business opportunities for physical entities are shown. Requirements for employees, who come from schools, include the level of theoretical knowledge, communication skills, adaptability, practical orientation in the field, performance and independency. Results of the research show, that the potential job candidate in the field of providing sport services has to be prepared for working during weekends, business trips and even to have a representative look. Same requirements are preferred in selling of sport goods. Organizations in sport field have significant interest in employing students as well as from disabled people. Traditional methods of taking people are interviews, references and recommendations, CVs and personal experiences during a test period help to select employees. Authorities use mainly financial benefits for the motivation of employees. Within non-financial motivators, the outcomes of the research showed a positive trend in possibility of further education of employees. 19 % of these organizations have a sophisticated education system and even 10 % of those organizations allow education in the selected field.","[Caslavova, Eva; Kraft, Jiri; Voracek, Josef] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Phys Educ & Sport, Prague 16252 6, Veleslavin, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Caslavova, E (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Phys Educ & Sport, Jose Martiho 31, Prague 16252 6, Veleslavin, Czech Republic.",caslavova@ftvs.cuni.cz; jiri.kraft@tul.cz; voracek@ftvs.cuni.cz,"Voráček, Josef/K-1771-2017; Čáslavová, Eva/AAE-9486-2019; Kraft, Jiri/P-2722-2017","Voráček, Josef/0000-0002-6551-4729; Čáslavová, Eva/0000-0003-3551-8312; Kraft, Jiri/0000-0002-4269-0009",,,,,26,3,4,1,33,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Since, the value creation of CG can be measured through the firm performance; the aim of this study is to answer this question: is there any relationship between CG and firm performance? Therefore, the four board characteristics that are of interest in this study are board independency, CEO duality, ownership structure, and board size. Based on a randomly selected sample of companies listed on Bursa Malaysia and applying the linear multiple regression as the underlying statistical tests, it is found that CEO duality has a negative relationship with firm performance (Return on Equity and Return on Asset) but there is no significant relationship between board independency, board size and ownership structure as independent variables and firm performance as dependent variable.","[Chaghadari, Masood Fooladi] Islamic Azad Univ, Mobarakeh Branch, Dept Accounting, Esfahan, Iran",Islamic Azad University,,foladim57@gmail.com,"fooladi, masood/AAP-2526-2020",,,,,,25,5,8,1,11,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9083-4,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,10.0,,,,,,484,489,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZY02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303284800091,0

The evidence also shows sizable cross-country differences in the quality of public capital. A general equilibrium growth model is introduced to explain both facts. The productivity of firms specializing in differentiated intermediate inputs depends on public capital whose provision is subject to bureaucratic corruption. Higher corruption lowers the quality of public capital and discourages specialization as well as development. Persistent difference in this quality results from multiple equilibrium levels of corruption. Simple calculations show that (i) relatively small micro-level productivity effects of public capital generate large macro-level effects, and (ii) quality differences in public capital can potentially explain a large fraction of the income gap between rich and poor nations.","[Chakraborty, Shankha] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Dabla-Norris, Era] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of Oregon; International Monetary Fund,"Chakraborty, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",shankhac@uoregon.edu; edablanorris@imf.org,,,,,,,39,17,18,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The fact that the unipolar US Dollar dominated international monetary system can be unstable in the presence of large shocks presents an opportunity for the Euro to promote systemic stability. The present study pursues this conjecture by exploring with cointegration and Error Correction Method techniques, the interdependence between the dynamics of the Dollar/Euro exchange rate and economic fundamentals in the context of a monetary exchange rate model. Our results suggest that both short-run (price stickiness) and long-run (secular growth) fundamentals affect the exchange rate path.

The fiscal limit is defined as the point where the government no longer has the ability to finance higher debt levels by increasing taxes, so either an adjustment to fiscal spending or monetary policy must occur to stabilize debt. We give households a joint probability distribution over the various policy adjustments that may occur, as well as over the timing of when the fiscal limit is hit. One policy option that stabilizes debt is a passive monetary policy, which generates a burst of inflation that devalues the existing nominal debt stock. The probability of this outcome places upward pressure on inflation expectations and poses a substantial challenge to a central bank pursuing an inflation target. The distribution of outcomes for the path of future inflation has a fat right tail, revealing that only a small set of outcomes imply dire inflationary scenarios. Avoiding these scenarios, however, requires the fiscal authority to renege on some share of future promised transfers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate that if South Africa were able to remove distortions in the labor market, the cost of carbon taxation would be negligible. We conclude that the welfare costs of taxing carbon emissions in developing countries depend more on other distortions than on the country's own carbon emissions.",,,,,,,,,,,36,49,53,0,36,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Using a structural VAR approach, we estimated the similarity between demand (both nominal and real) and supply shocks between NMS and the Eurozone, showing that the demand shocks are still negatively correlated with the Eurozone for some NMS, including Romania. Also, using a moving window, we estimated that the correlation of shocks increased over time, especially in the case of supply shocks. Even for some core members of the Eurozone, we find that the demand shocks seem to be idiosyncratic. The main conclusion of our paper is the fact that Romania, as well as some other NMS countries, still need time to become more synchronized and to avoid the occurrence of asymmetric shocks once they become members of the Eurozone.","[Dumitru, Ionut; Dumitru, Ionela] Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dumitru, I (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",ionela_jianu@yahoo.com; ionela_jianu@yahoo.com,"Dumitru, Ionela/AAP-1969-2021","Dumitru, Ionut/0000-0002-1930-4405",,,,,14,2,2,0,15,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

We use county-level data from 1999 to 2005 and employ a panel econometric approach that includes county-and year-fixed effects. We found that the mortality rates for whites and latinos are procyclical, i.e, that economic expansions (contractions) are associated with increases (decreases) in mortality. Moreover, the magnitude of this relationship is larger for latinos than for whites. However, we generally do not find a statistically significant relationship for blacks. Finally, the procyclical relationship for whites and latinos increases in magnitude as the county becomes less racially/ethnically diverse.

In those papers there were presented various types of random sampling - simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and also cluster sampling. Although, the estimates precision from the cluster sampling is not as good as in case of other types of random sampling, we always found the cluster sampling to be the best way how to take a random sample from the population of the Czech Republic with respect to all aspects of the random sampling. So, in this paper we focus on the problem how to carry out the cluster sampling to obtain as precise estimates as possible. The random samples are taken from the data files provided by the Czech Statistical Office again. We chose the indicator of the unemployment rate in all the municipalities of the Czech Republic on 31st December 2006. Subsequently, we took 520 units from all the municipalities of the Czech Republic by two-stage cluster sampling. We investigated how big is the influence of number of selected primary sampling units on the estimates precision and what is the difference between cluster sampling with equal and unequal probabilities. The estimates precision is also significantly influenced by the size of primary sampling units and the fact whether its size is respected when taking a random sample. The estimates precision was evaluated by both the standard error of estimation and the mean deviation of point estimations from their value in the population.","[Gurinova, Katerina; Valentova, Vladimira Hovorkova] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Stat, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,katerina.gurinova@tul.cz; vladimira.valentova@tul.cz,"Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/M-1370-2018","Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/0000-0001-5718-315X",,,,,9,1,1,0,5,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,139,146,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200015,0

Employing optimal credit decision models of profit maximizing banks, and utilizing a unique dataset of 2 million consumer loan obligors in Korea, we investigate the economic effects of sharing positive credit information in addition to negative credit information already exchanged. We find that the discriminatory power of the credit scoring model improves significantly. We proceed to investigate the economic effects of the information gap in a competitive credit market by assuming two representative banks that differ only in the level of credit information sharing. The bank that utilizes negative information only suffers from deterioration of the borrower pool and reduced profit, as high credit risk borrowers are more concentrated on this bank due to underpricing of risks. Our finding suggests that banks have incentives to voluntarily participate in the positive information sharing mechanism, since even a small difference in discriminatory power stemming from the information gap may lead to a significant fall in profitability as the distribution of borrower quality changes endogenously due to adverse selection problems.","[Hahm, Joon-Ho] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Lee, Sangche] Korea Inst Finance, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Hahm, JH (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",jhahm@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,19,5,5,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this view, the proximate goals of our psychological motivations are different in kind from the ultimate reasons why we have evolved these motivations. Sympathy was central to Smith's account of the moral sentiments and he discussed two principal forms of sympathy. Second-person sympathy is putting ourselves in another person's situation to see the world from their perspective. Third-person sympathy is viewing ourselves from the perspective of an impartial observer.

For men, the estimates of the long-run elasticity of income with respect to the net-of-tax rate hover in a range between 0.10 and 0.30. The estimates for women are statistically insignificant.

Primary cross-section data on organic olive enterprises from a Greek region is used in the application of the stochastic frontier profit function. Farmers are classified into groups according to their innovative 'profile'. TFP difference among consecutive innovation groups is decomposed into technical difference and adjustment in innovativeness effects. Results indicate that more innovative farmers perform better than less innovative ones regarding TFP scores. The rate of technical difference is always positive to the formation of TFP difference, whereas the adjustment in innovativeness effects varies among the innovation groups.

This study applies the panel data model and generalized least squares (GLS) techniques to estimate the predictive regressions in separated and combined models. The obtained results reveal that the financial ratios are able to empirically predict stock return, as the B/M has the higher predictive power than DY and EY respectively.

The empirical evidence shows that greater trade openness has strongly beneficial effects on growth and real income for the developed countries but significantly negative effects for the developing countries. The heterogeneity in the relationships suggests that greater international trade and integration may foster uneven development and hence contribute to more diverging economies. In addition, the link of trade to economic performance is found to work through both capital accumulation and productivity growth channels.

Economists have held different views on the role of government in industrialization. Some believed that the developing world was full of market failures and the only way in which poor countries could escape from their poverty traps was through the forceful government intervention. Others opposed to this view argued that government failure was by far the bigger evil and that it should allow the market to steer the economy. Reality has been different from expectation for either side. From a country dependent on agriculture and primary commodities in the sixties, Malaysia has today become an export-driven economy spurred by high technology, knowledge based and capital intensive industries. The market oriented economy and the government's strategic industrial policy that maintain a business environment with opportunities for growth and profits have made the country a highly competitive manufacturing and export base. Multinationals have been at the forefront in this process and working hand in hand with the government through a process known as hand holding. As firms move up the value chain their requirements change, and, to remain competitive in a global environment, the government has had to change its policies and approach to ensure that this objective is not compromised. In 2006 the government identified the service sector as the new driver for growth, which suggests a new era in industrialization. Based on this evidence we conclude that, for successful industrialization, developing countries will require flexible governments that facilitate the development of the private sector. This approach will generate greater benefits than would otherwise occur if developing countries were to adopt either government or market based development trajectories.","Leiden Univ, African Studies Ctr, Tracking Dev Project, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Kinuthia, BK (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, African Studies Ctr, Tracking Dev Project, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",bkinuthia@ascleiden.nl,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,11,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

By employing the 'true' random-effects model as originally proposed by Greene (2005a, 2005b), the unobserved heterogeneity that is typically associated with the complexity of the banking environment is additionally taken into account.

In regime 1, two broadcasters are financed only with subscription fees (i.e., fee-based or pay TV). In regime 2, the two broadcasters generate their revenues only from advertising (i.e., free TV). In regime 3, one pay TV broadcaster competes with one free TV broadcaster. We show that the broadcasters in regime 3 (but not in regimes 1 and 2) vertically differentiate their channel programs if, for a given level of advertising market profitability, viewers strongly or weakly dislike the presence of advertising. In such cases, although the two pay TV broadcasters in regime 1 will unambiguously offer higher or lower quality programming than the two free TV broadcasters under regime 2, it is not clear which broadcaster will provide higher or lower program quality in regime 3 because this depends on the degree of horizontal differentiation between the channel programs. However, the levels of quality offered under regimes 1 and 2 fall between the quality levels offered by the two broadcasters in regime 3.","Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Lin, PL (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",panlang.lin@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,13,15,0,19,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

By contrast, some economists pointed to alternative explanations for excess volatility, including liquidity constraints, lending cycles, search externalities, and zoning delays. Empirical work supports the role of these factors in explaining at least: some of the cyclical variation of house prices and inventories of homes for sale.

Scope economies and risk aversion are two forces that simultaneously determine diversification. We jointly estimate scope economies and determine risk preferences under price uncertainty. We reject risk neutrality in favour of Increasing Absolute Risk Aversion (IARA) and Increasing Relative Risk Aversion (IRRA). Scope economies are significant, but diminish with farm size. Increasing returns to scale exist in the production of multiple enterprises and diminish with size. Large farms operate under decreasing returns to scale. Ignoring risk preferences, a common practice in empirical work, results in an underestimate of the effect of scope economies for large farms.","[Melhim, Almuhanad] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Shumway, C.

So strategy of the organization should focus on its core competencies because they allow maximize value of the organization (Prahalad & Hamel, 1990). Therefore knowledge has become one of the most important intangible assets for the company (Nonaka, 1994; Scarborough et al., 1999; Storey & Barnett, 2000; Lee & Sukoco, 2007; Carbonara & Caizza, 2008; Li et al., 2009) and in particular the process of creation of knowledge within the organization (Nonaka, 1994, Nonaka & Konno, 1998). Similarly, consideration of a reverse flow in logistics amplify the company's competitive capabilities in the sense of increasing resources and capabilities on which to develop the potential of the organization and to achieve, in this way, the desired competitive advantage sustainable, because to meet the increasing needs of customers demanding, the product must be not only quality but also highly competitive, be available when and where appropriate and be respectful of the environment (Stock, 1992; Tibben-Lembke & Rogers, 2002). The study of all this product flow in the opposite way and how to deal with all things entailed for the organization is what has been called in recent years Reverse Logistics (Rogers & Tibben-Lembke, 1999, 2001; Dowlatshahi, 2000; Tibben-Lembke & Rogers, 2002; Council of Logistics Management, 2003; Krikke et al., 2003; Stock et al., 2002). Activities of Reverse Logistics require adequate knowledge management in all phases of return of the product that may help to solve problems it faces in all these processes (Wadhwa & Madaan, 2007), and also may approach the current goals of customer satisfaction and business benefit to the legislation for the environment. In this sense, it is fundamental for the organization to have ability to generate new knowledge to reduce the high uncertainty of Reverse Logistics activities (Arrow, 1962; Galbraith & Kazanjian, 1986; Murdick & Munson, 1988; Drucker, 1993). Even with growing importance of both variables, there is a lack of scientific literature that attempt to analyze the relationship between the creation of knowledge and Reverse Logistics and their possible implications. So it is very interesting to analyze the relationship between the creation of knowledge and the importance of Reverse Logistics, and their influence on organizational performance. Using Nonaka and Takeuchi's model of knowledge creation (SECI model, Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995), we develop and test hypotheses on such relationship using a sample of 284 Spanish firms by examining the direct and indirect effects of knowledge creation and Reverse Logistics upon firm performance. The rest of the paper is set out as follows. The next section considers the previous literature and sets out the hypotheses of this study. The following part is the methodology for the study. Then, the paper presents the results of the empirical study in achieving the goals as those set out above. Discussion and conclusions are provided in the last section.

In tourism its major effects could have been experienced a year later, i.e. in 2009. It was then when a drop in overnights visitor arrivals worldwide was registered, reaching the level of about 40 million (drop by 4.3%). It was accompanied by a drop in internal travel and tourism consumption of about $282.3 billion, which was translated into tourism consumption shrinking by 7.7% in 2009, as compared to 2008. Business travel and tourism spending dropped more than leisure travel and tourism spending. Similar downturn in the mentioned numbers referred also to Europe and its particular countries, including Poland. Due to the fact that more intense crisis phenomena were registered in business travel, their deeper consequences effected hotels in big cities. The objective of the presented article is to identify symptoms of global economic recession at tourism market, including hospitality business, and to identify ways of overcoming its influence on hotels in Poland. The research problem, defined in this way, required performing analyses in two directions. Firstly, the presentation of changes in tourism demand and consumption was undertaken and measured by means of tourism traffic volume and the level of visitor exports, domestic spending and government individual spending - government spending on individual non-market services for which beneficiaries can be separately identified, for example, it includes the provision of national parks and museums. Secondly, the analysis was conducted at different levels, i.e. referring to the whole world, Europe, the European Union, particular EU member states and European cities, including Polish ones. Starting from national level particular attention was paid to changes in basic indicators of operational activities performed by hotels. Hotels functioning in Wroclaw were selected for the purposes of detailed analysis. Apart from Warsaw and Cracow, Wroclaw is one on the most intensely developing hospitality business' markets in Poland. At present the town is included among the most important economic, scientific, social and cultural centers in the country. The policy followed by town authorities is focused on capturing investors, new inhabitants, students and tourists, which is reflected in the promotional slogan Wroclaw - the town of meetings. It stimulates the growth of demand for hospitality business services and, in consequence, results in hotels' number increase, mainly representing higher standards.","[Nawrocka, Elzbieta; Jaremen, Daria Elzbieta] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Reg Econ & Tourism Fac, Tourism Mkt & Management Dept, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,,elzbieta.nawrocka@ue.wroc.pl; daria.jaremen@ue.wroc.pl,"Jaremen, Daria Elżbieta/T-5633-2018; Carvalho dos Santos Claro, Jose Alberto/H-6147-2012","Carvalho dos Santos Claro, Jose Alberto/0000-0003-1319-2382",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,327,337,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200036,0

In this article, we aim at measuring both the effects of exports' diversification on growth in MENA countries and the way new exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) interact with each others in the process of growth. Although the effects of FDI on growth have been scrutinized by numerous studies up to now, the effects of diversification and discoveries in export have only very recently been assessed. But no one has made explicit the way FDI and export discoveries interact in the growth process. A model is estimated by the system-generalized method of moments and we provide robust evidence that export discovery and FDI stimulate gross domestic product (GDP) growth in our sample of countries, and that FDI does not necessarily have the same effect on growth according to the level of discovery of the country. We also show that the joint positive effect of new exports and of imports suggest that technological spillover from import but also from the integration to global value chains are likely to occur in our sample of countries.","[Nicet-Chenaf, Dalila; Rougier, Eric] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5113, GREThA, F-33608 Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Rougier, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5113, GREThA, F-33608 Pessac, France.",rougier@u-bordeaux4.fr,,,,,,,91,8,10,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This article is based on a theoretical framework in which the adoption of IBS is done in two stages. At the first stage, the firm decides to adopt or not a website; at the second stage, those who adopted a website decide on the level of IBS adoption. We considered that the determinants of the adoption decisions can be internal or external and that their effect may be different at the two adoption stages. Based on these assumptions, we develop and test an integrated model of IBS adoption allowing for sample selection. Our results show that the two adoption decisions are taken sequentially and that selectivity bias is not present in our sample. Our findings also suggest that the relevant drivers of website and the level of IBS adoption are not necessarily the same.","[Oliveira, Tiago; Martins, Maria Fraga O.] Univ Nova Lisboa, ISEGI, P-1070312 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Oliveira, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, ISEGI, Campus Campolide, P-1070312 Lisbon, Portugal.",toliveira@isegi.unl.pt,"Oliveira, Tiago/GSD-3675-2022; Oliveira, Tiago/B-4090-2011","Oliveira Martins, Maria do Rosario/0000-0002-7941-0285; Oliveira, Tiago/0000-0001-6523-0809",,,,,27,5,7,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This is because an efficient firm cannot reduce the vector of outputs holding the vector of inputs fixed while it still belongs to the frontier. In empirical studies dealing with the estimation of parametric distance functions, this hypothesis is often violated by observations with far from average characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach for allowing the easy imposition of monotonicity on outputs in this context. This methodology is tested in the educational sector using Spanish student level data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) database. The results indicate that a nonnegligible 8.33% of the production units break the monotonicity assumption. Furthermore, although there is no statistically significant difference in efficiency distribution by school ownership, our methodology helps to detect a slight worse mathematical performance for students attending public schools.","[Santin, Daniel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 6, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Perelman, Sergio] Univ Liege, CREPP, B-4000 Liege, Belgium",Complutense University of Madrid; University of Liege,"Santin, D (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 6, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",dsantin@ccee.ucm.es,"Perelman, Sergio/K-2135-2016; Santín, Daniel/I-7784-2016","Santín, Daniel/0000-0002-1654-1659",,,,,23,11,12,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The respondents consist of hotel employees in Malaysia. Results indicate that, overall, Malaysian hotel employees reacted positively in their ethical judgments. No significant differences were found between gender, department, age group, position or educational level in terms of 5 factors identified. Correlation analysis revealed that that there is a positive relationship between 5 factors and 6 general attitudinal statements used in the survey. Though Malaysian hotel employees have reasonably low tolerance towards unethical behaviours, the implications are that proper ethical education, training, and clearer ethical policy for hotel employees are still necessary in order to sustain a continuous high ethical environment. Hotel management can benefit from this by understanding those areas that need further improvement for their employees such as the identification of the behaviours that are viewed as no harm, passively benefiting from inequality act and actively benefiting.","Univ Malaya, Dept Business Policy & Strategy, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Ponnu, CH (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Dept Business Policy & Strategy, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",,,,,,,,12,1,1,1,5,NATIONAL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

This baseline path has to reflect the current failure in the market for carbon emissions. Because of a negative externality, private investment decisions are made without considering the climate damage they entail. Agents overinvest in conventional capital and underinvest in climate capital. Internalization of climate damage lowers the private return to capital, and agents reduce investment in favor of mitigation and consumption.

The empirical results, which are estimated based on the Johansen's multivariate cointegration tests and error-correction model, suggest that there is a unique long-run relationship among quantities of export, relative price, real foreign income and real exchange rate variability. The major finding of this article is that the variability of real exchange rate has some effect on semiconductor exports in both the long run and the short run. In the light of rapid advances in technology in the global markets for electronics products, the findings are useful to policy makers for the design and target of appropriate exchange rate and industrial policies to enhance the export competitiveness of semiconductor industry.","[Wong, Koi Nyen; Tang, Tuck Cheong] Monash Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Petaling Jaya 46150, Selangor Darul, Malaysia",Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Tang, TC (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Sunway Campus, Petaling Jaya 46150, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",tang.tuck.cheong@buseco.monash.edu.my,"Tang, Tuck Cheong/H-6636-2014; Wong, Koi Nyen/C-5711-2014","Tang, Tuck Cheong/0000-0001-7978-0684; Wong, Koi Nyen/0000-0001-9767-712X",,,,,61,8,9,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The article concludes by analysing the stability of input-output coefficients over time similar to work in Dietzenbacher and Hoen (2006).

Our purpose is threefold. First, instead of investigating high-profile and chiefly government-directed clusters, such as science parks, we focus on a small and medium enterprise (SME) cluster. Second, unlike most studies that usually show how clusters foster entrepreneurship, we emphasize the role of entrepreneurship in the formation of the cluster industry. We discuss how a skilled artisan turns into an entrepreneur and how an apprentice-based cluster is formed. Third, we show that what used to be the competitive advantages of Houli's saxophone cluster - a peculiar apprentice-based cluster and the supportive precision machine agglomeration in central Taiwan - turn into its weaknesses when globalization surged in the 1980s. A three-year stint in government support, attempting to revitalize Houli's saxophone cluster by organizing a functional network and improving the technology, was unable to overturn the challenges from globalization. Although entrepreneurs learn to adapt to the changing environment, the current lackluster performance of Houli's saxophone industry demonstrates that regardless of how much glory there was in the past, it is inevitable in a living economy that a cluster cannot avoid its own ebb and flow.","[Yan, Ho-Don; Kuo, Yu-Chen; Chen, Shan-Yu] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung 40724, Taiwan",Feng Chia University,"Chen, SY (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.",sychen@fcu.edu.tw,"liu, shanshan/JPA-0852-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023",,,,,,65,6,7,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

An error correction model of capital stock adjustment is estimated with data on U.S. manufacturing firms. Higher energy price uncertainty is found to make firms more cautious by reducing the responsiveness of investment to sales growth. The result is robust to consideration of energy intensity by industry. The effect is greater for high growth firms. It must be emphasized that the direct effect of uncertainty is not estimated. Conditional variance of energy price is obtained from a GARCH model. Findings suggest that stability in energy prices would be conducive to greater stability in firm-level investment.

But it is costly, and faces competing imperatives for public spending. Higher education finance is therefore a matter of discussions of academics, financial experts and politicians. This contribution aims to analyze one issue which seems to be very prospective for higher education institutions in the Czech Republic - tuition fees paid by foreign students. Fees give universities more resources to improve quality and, through competition, help improve the efficiency of higher education which those resources are used for. Furthermore, indirect financing becomes very important issue in a newly intended model of higher institutions funding. In order to outline the potential of foreign students a large international research was carried out to find out the incentives, barriers, preferences and other possible influences for foreign students to come to study in the Czech Republic (in terms of their self-funding). The research addressed more than thousand students in six countries. The main goal of the above mentioned research on foreign students' willingness to study in the Czech Republic on the self funding principle (or significant tuition fee) was to identify and classify the types of such people and to outline their main characteristics important for future effective contribution to indirect financing. For that purpose different methods of classification were chosen. Two of the algorithms for classification trees - CART and CHAID were used for its evaluation from the group of supervised learning methods. Research results are given both in theoretical and practical areas. The potential financial contribution of foreign students is also demonstrated.","[Zambochova, Marta; Tislerova, Kamila] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,,marta.zambochova@ujep.cz; kamila.tislerova@ujep.cz,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,4,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,604,613,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200065,0

We demonstrate that the spatial concentration of economic activity depends upon properties of risk preferences deeper than risk aversion. The degree of so-called relative prudence unambiguously decides whether or not the diversification of income risk favours the geographic dispersion of economic activity. In our framework we relate risk diversification with economic integration. Then there exists risk preferences so that spatial concentration of industry and capital is not affected by the degree of economic integration or segmentation of the regions.

In our theory, the latter is attributable to evolving corporate cultures coupled with changes in a firm's business environment. With the help of a formal model of evolving corporate cultures, we demonstrate how firms can establish a cooperative cultural regime that yields competitive advantages in an innovative, fast changing environment. Depending on within-firm social learning processes and cognitive constraints of human agents, organizations then reach a critical cognitive firm size in their development beyond which the level of cooperation deteriorates rapidly they systematically face a growth crisis. Organizations successful in such an environment and reaching a critical technological size may, however, reap economies of scale in a later, mature and stable business environment with altered corporate culture. Furthermore, we relate these findings to empirical evidence on firm survival and performance in different industries, the evolution of organizational structures, and technological advancements in production technologies, and we identify some determinants of market structures.

The empirical estimates have shown that, with regard to employment and unemployment rate, the EU Member States can be classified into two groups. The first group is characterized with high tax wedge, low employment and high unemployment rate, whereas the second group has the alternative characteristics. The negative tax wedge-employment relation was confirmed in the panel regression analysis, showing that an increase in tax wedge for one percentage point decreases the employment growth in the EU-27 by around 0.04 percentage points, ceteris paribus. The empirical estimates suggest that the EU-27 should continue with the trend of reducing tax wedge, as this would increase employment growth and employment rate and decrease unemployment, especially in Member States with high tax wedge.","[Dolenc, Primoz; Laporsek, Suzana] UP Fac Management Koper, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia",,"Dolenc, P (通讯作者)，UP Fac Management Koper, Cankarjeva 5, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia.",primoz.dolenc@fm-kp.si; suzana.laporsek@fm-kp.si,"Laporšek, Suzana/AAC-5278-2020","Laporsek, Suzana/0000-0002-7787-8749",,,,,42,13,13,3,12,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

We find that both the government and the incumbent have key roles in preventing the entry of pirates. We show that the government will not help the incumbent to become a pure monopolist, even if it installs an antipiracy system. It will let the pirate enter either as a follower or a leader, or encourage the incumbent to set a low enough price to successfully deter the pirate from entering the market, depending on its technology for monitoring commercial piracy.

This is a first rough estimate of the potential economic costs of policies designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. At this level one may conclude that uniform, across the board reductions in carbon emissions would have a clear negative effect on economic activity. Hence, at the aggregate level there is clear evidence for a trade-off between economic performance and a reduction in carbon emissions.

We employ an experimental design that first measures the level of effort exerted by student workers on a data entry task in an environment that elicits purely selfish behavior and we compare it to effort exerted in an environment that also induces warm glow altruism. We then compare the latter to effort exerted in an environment where both types of altruistic preferences are elicited. We find evidence that women increase effort due to warm glow altruism while we do not find any additional impact due to pure altruism.

Several specifications of Verdoorn's Law are put forward in this paper, which attribute the process of cumulative causation to a series of factors, including manufacturing agglomeration, spatial interaction, and responses to the problems of growth. The findings suggest that, although cumulative causation holds over this period, the slowdown of its pace is, nonetheless, apparent post 1992.

The optimal level of authority balances the value of the manager's decision-making expertise against the cost of ensuring that the manager uses his discretion productively. Reputational incentives reduce the necessary monetary incentives to discourage purely opportunistic behavior, but may cause the manager to pursue conservative courses of action to preserve his reputation. This undermines the benefits of delegating control, leading to decreased managerial authority and stronger monetary incentives. When the principal contracts with the manager repeatedly, she delegates additional authority early in the relationship in order to screen for managers of high ability. Decentralization of decision making may thus occur even if the static benefits from decentralization are negative. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Following Enders and Ludlow (2002), we use unit root and cointegration tests that do not assume a specific nonlinear adjustment. We find evidence of non-linear mean reversion in deviations from the PPP equilibrium in 11 out of 18 currencies. Additionally, to disentangle the respective contribution of exchange rate and prices to the adjustment toward the long run equilibrium, we estimate a Vector Error Correction Model. According to our empirical analysis, there exists a nonlinear mechanism to correct for deviation from the PPP equilibrium that comes mainly from the exchange rates. This is consistent with theoretical arguments on international goods markets under transaction costs as well as with an emerging strand of empirical literature. These results highlight the importance of neglecting the possibility of nonlinearity in the debate about the PPP and provide empirical evidence that supports the scenario of the PPP hypothesis as a reality.","[Jimenez-Martin, Juan A.; Dolores Robles-Fernandez, M.] Univ Complutense, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Robles-Fernandez, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",juanangel@ccee.ucm.es; mdrobles@ccee.ucm.es,"Robles, Maria Dolores/H-6471-2015; MARTIN, JUAN ANGEL JIMENEZ/H-7230-2015","Robles, Maria Dolores/0000-0001-6299-0300; MARTIN, JUAN ANGEL JIMENEZ/0000-0001-5608-3288",,,,,48,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Ang's (2007, 2008) papers are some of the exceptions that simultaneously study the relationship between emissions, growth and energy. With respect to Ang's research, we contribute on two important aspects. First, while Ang uses a particular country as the study and use time series techniques, we take advantage of a panel data set of 24 European countries between 1990 and 2006 and use a Dynamic Panel Data (DPD) framework. Second, the impact of energy consumption on emissions would depend on the primary energy mix and on the final use of this energy, and we consider both factors in the model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We model systemic risk with two main components: a random shock that weakens one or more financial institutions and a transmission mechanism which transmits and possibly exacerbates such negative effects to the rest of the system. Our model could be conceptually represented by a network already described in previous works. In this work we show how is possible to estimate the distribution of losses for the banking system with our model. Additionally, we show how it is possible to separate the distribution of losses into two components: the losses incurred by the initial shock and the losses resulting from the contagion process. Finally, once the distribution is estimated, we can derive standard risk measures for the system as a whole. Another important contribution of this work is that we can follow the evolution of certain risk measures like the expected loss or the CVaR in order to evaluate if the system is becoming more or less risky, in fact, more or less fragile. Additionally, we can decompose the distribution of losses of the whole banking system into the systemic and the contagion elements and we can determine if the system is more prone to experience contagious difficulties during a certain period of time.

Based on detailed linked employer employee data, we show that wage inequality is rising strongly - driven not only by real wage increases at the top of the wage distribution, but also by real wage losses below the median. Coverage by collective wage bargaining plummets by 16.5 (19.1) percentage points for male (female) employees. Despite these changes, the gender wage gap remains almost constant, with some small gains for women at the bottom and at the top of the wage distribution. A sequential decomposition analysis using quantile regression shows that all workplace related effects (firm effects and bargaining effects) and coefficients for personal characteristics contribute strongly to the rise in wage inequality. Among these, the firm coefficients effect dominates, which is almost exclusively driven by wage differences within and between different industries. Labor demand or firm wage policy related effects contribute to an increase in the gender wage gap. Personal characteristics tend to reduce wage inequality for both males and females, as well as the gender wage gap. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These two higher order risk effects also play key roles in aversion to negative skewness and to kurtosis, respectively. This article presents a laboratory experiment to determine whether subjects are prudent and/or temperate. The experiment is based upon preferences over lottery pairs in simple 50-50 gambles. Subjects are asked in which of two states of nature they would prefer to receive a zero-mean gamble. For prudence, the choices are between a lower and higher wealth outcome. For temperance, the choices are between a state with no other risk and a state with a second (independent) risk. The results show behavioural evidence for prudence, but they also show evidence of intemperate behaviour.

The model jointly accounts for the emergence of some well-known empirical observations. Specifically, it predicts a negative correlation between output growth and policy volatility. Furthermore, given that both the mean and the variance of the inflation rate are elevated by fluctuations in public spending, the model provides a novel theoretical justification for the simultaneous negative correlation of long-run growth with both average inflation and inflation variability. The model also supports the view that policy volatility reduces social welfare. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To help close this gap we investigate whether entrepreneurship education affects intentions to be entrepreneurial uniformly or whether it leads to greater sorting of students. The latter can reduce the average intention to be entrepreneurial and yet be socially beneficial. This paper provides a model of learning in which entrepreneurship education generates signals to students. Drawing on the signals, students evaluate their aptitude for entrepreneurial tasks. The model is tested using data from a compulsory entrepreneurship course. Using ex-ante and ex-post-survey responses from students, we find that intentions to found decline somewhat although the course has significant positive effects on students' self-assessed entrepreneurial skills. The empirical analysis supports the hypothesis that students receive informative signals and learn about their entrepreneurial aptitude. We outline implications for educators and public policy.

Differences in wage flexibility, market power and country sizes are allowed for in a setting with both country-specific and aggregate shocks. The implications of asymmetries for both the overall performance of the monetary union and the country-specific situation are analysed. It is shown that asymmetries are not only critical for country-specific performance but also for the overall performance of the monetary union. A striking finding is that aggregate output volatility is not strictly increasing in nominal rigidities but hump-shaped. Moreover, a disproportionate share of the consequences of wage inflexibility may fall on small countries. In the case of country-specific shocks, a country unambiguously benefits in terms of macroeconomic stability by becoming more flexible, while this is not necessarily the case for aggregate shocks. There may thus be a tension between the degree of flexibility considered optimal at the country level and at the aggregate level within the monetary union.","[Andersen, Torben M.] Univ Aarhus, Sch Econ & Management, Aarhus, Denmark; [Andersen, Torben M.] CEPR, London, England; [Andersen, Torben M.] EPRU, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Seneca, Martin] Cent Bank Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland",Aarhus University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Andersen, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Aarhus, Sch Econ & Management, Aarhus, Denmark.",tandersen@econ.au.dk,,,,,,,30,3,4,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The golden age for the model in Sweden began in the late 1950s and ended in the early 1970s. The following postwar period was characterized by obvious deviations from the Rehn-Meidner model but also by the survival of parts of the model. The rise and partial fall of the model in Sweden is explained by changes in political institutions, wage bargaining systems, trade union power, economic policy makers and economic thinking and by experiences of economic policy in the past. However, there is weak evidence that the departure from the Rehn-Meidner model is ultimately explained by globalization and new technologies.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Erixon, L (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,,,105,40,44,0,9,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Using GDP data disaggregated by state and sector for a twenty-year period, this paper finds considerable variation in the poverty-reducing effectiveness of growth across sectors, across space, and over time. Growth in the services sector was substantially more poverty-reducing than was growth in either agriculture or industry. Growth in industry had different effects on poverty across different states and its impact varied with initial conditions related to human development and worker empowerment. But because there was so little of it, economic growth actually played a relatively small role in accounting for Brazil's poverty reduction between 1985 and 2004. The taming of hyperinflation (in 1994) and a substantial expansion in social security and social assistance transfers, in large part mandated by the 1988 Constitution, accounted for the bulk of the overall reduction in poverty.

Risk-neutral (entrepreneurial) individuals can either produce alone, or - acting as employers/insurers - team up with risk-averse (non-entrepreneurial) individuals. Although the latter option has the potential to generate more surplus, when effort is unobservable and risk is high, the moral hazard problem in mixed matches may be too severe for mixing to be attractive to both risk-aversion types, leading to a segregated equilibrium in which risk-averse individuals select low-risk, low-yield activities. An increase in the profitability of the riskier sector can then trigger a switch from a mixed to a segregated equilibrium and cause aggregate output to fall. Evidence from a panel of non-OECD countries - showing that the presence of uninsured, small-scale mining firms has a negative impact on the relationship between natural resource exports and agrarian productivity - suggests that this 'high-yield sector curse' might be present in natural resource-rich, low-income countries.

If they differ, the MG estimator should be used only if the panel is sufficiently long say, twice as long as usually recommended in the dynamic panel data literature. If FE and MG estimates differ and the panel is not long enough, neither is generally a desirable alternative and other estimation techniques are needed. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

In addition to the learning capabilities, the proposed MAIS incorporates collaboration among agents. The proposed MAIS is applied to estimate a dynamic change of wholesale electricity price in PJM (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Mainland) and an artificial data set generated by a mean reverting model. Using such different types of data sets, the methodological validity of MAIS is confirmed by comparing it with other well-known alternatives in computer science. This study finds that the MAIS needs to incorporate both the mean reverting model and the collaboration behavior among agents in order to enhance its estimation capability.

A more progressive income tax policy could offer a stabilizing alternative. It could result in more revenue, more countercyclical policy, and more income equality and thus more stable demand growth. We test the effects of progressive taxes on stability using univariate and multivariate analyses based on panel data for emerging economies from 1982 to 2002 and compare those to the effects of a value added tax (VAT). We also consider possible constraints on tax policy design, such as government spending, international tax competition, and openness. Progressive taxes are associated with greater income equality and a higher likelihood of countercyclical fiscal policies. The potential benefits from progressive income taxation, though, are lower with VAT. Tax policy is also constrained by government expenditures and openness, but not by lower corporate taxes, suggesting that all income tax rates are constrained by openness.","[Weller, Christian E.; Rao, Manita] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Affairs, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Weller, Christian E.] Ctr Amer Progress, Washington, DC USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Weller, CE (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Affairs, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",,,,,,,,29,6,8,1,16,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In a closed economy representative agent model (the special case when the birth rate is zero, of the Yaari-Blanchard OLG model used in the paper), there is no pure wealth effect on consumption from a change in house prices if this represents a change in their fundamental value. When the birth rate is positive, higher fundamental house prices driven by the housing demand of future generations will boost current consumption. There is a pure wealth effect on consumption from a change in house prices even in the representative agent model, if this reflects a change in the speculative bubble component of house prices. Two other channels through which a fall in house prices can affect aggregate consumption are (1) redistribution effects if the marginal propensity to spend out of wealth differs between those long housing (the old, say) and those short housing (the young, say) and (2) collateral or credit effects due to the collateralisability of housing wealth and the non-collateralisability of human wealth. A decline in house prices reduces the scope for mortgage equity withdrawal. For given sequences of future after-tax labour income and interest rates, a fall in house prices will then depress consumption in the short run while boosting it in the long run.","Citigrp Ctr, Citigrp, London E14 5LB, England",,"Buiter, WH (通讯作者)，Citigrp Ctr, Citigrp, Canada Sq, London E14 5LB, England.",willembuiter@btinternet.com,,,,,,,30,14,14,1,20,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,AUG 5,2010,4.0,,,,,,,,201022,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2010-22,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865AV,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298283900001,0

At the same time, there has been recent work on tourism where it is complementary to aid in improving welfare. By combining these two strands, this paper concentrates on wage inequality in developing countries. We find that an increase in aid in the form of tied aid can lower the relative price of nontraded goods. The rent extracted from tourists declines, reducing welfare of domestic residents. In addition, the fall in the nontradable price can widen the wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Thus, increased foreign aid may have detrimental effects on national welfare and the distribution of income. Rising wage inequality is confirmed by numerical simulations.","[Chao, Chi-Chur] Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Laffargue, Jean-Pierre] Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Laffargue, Jean-Pierre] CEPREMAP, Paris, France; [Sgro, Pasquale M.] Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Burwood 3125, Australia",University of Hong Kong; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Deakin University,"Chao, CC (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ccchao@cuhk.edu.hk; jean-pierre.laffargue@orange.fr; pasquale.sgro@deakin.edu.au,"Sgro, Pasquale M/C-7629-2013","Sgro, Pasquale/0000-0002-1450-730X",,,,,25,12,13,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In another parameterization we again find that the distribution of contributions is not as predicted when the first mover is predicted to free ride, but we find strong support for equilibrium predictions when the second mover is predicted to free ride.

The task is the Race game. This game is played on a finite set of in possible positions occupied by a marker, which is initially in the first position. Two players alternate in the role of mover, and each one can move the marker forward by 1,2 ... , k places. The player who puts the marker in the final position wins. Learning follows a similar pattern for all subjects. The experience of losses in early rounds induces them to switch the mode of analysis to backward analysis, which proceeds from the final position. The game has a simple dominant strategy, so we can calculate the frequency of errors made by subjects in each of the positions. The hypothesis that players follow a backward analysis gives precise predictions on the pattern of errors: for example that errors are more frequent, the further the position is from the end. The experiment demonstrates that individuals are able to learn effective planning for future distant rewards, with a procedure of backward analysis. Their learning process may appear a pure insight, but is derived from evaluation of experience. Subjects are also able to transfer the knowledge they get from playing one game to a related game.

We discuss several sources of such inefficiency, focusing on one that has not been described in the literature: the underinvestment due to fear of hold-up. An inefficient hold-up occurs when a user of software must make complementary investments, when the return on such investments depends on future cooperation of the software vendor, and when contracting about a future relationship with the software vendor is not feasible. We also consider how the nature of the production function of software makes software cheaper to develop when the code is open to the end users. Our framework explains why open source dominates certain sectors of the software industry (e.g., programming languages), while being almost non existent in some other sectors (e.g., computer games). We then use our discussion of efficiency to examine the history of institutions for provision of public software from the early collaborative projects of the 1950s to the modern open source software institutions. We look at how such institutions have created a sustainable coalition for provision of software as a public good by organizing diverse individual incentives, both altruistic and profit-seeking, providing open source products of tremendous commercial importance, which have come to dominate certain segments of the software industry.","[Takhteyev, Yuri] Univ Toronto, Fac Informat, Toronto, ON M5S 3G6, Canada",University of Toronto,"Takhteyev, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Fac Informat, 140 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G6, Canada.",yuri.takhteyev@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,66,12,15,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Given the well-known controversy pertaining to plausible formulations for labor exploitation in joint production economies, we propose an axiom, Axiom for Labor Exploitation (LE), which every 'appropriate' formulation of labor exploitation should satisfy. Using this axiom, the necessary and sufficient condition for plausible formulations of labor exploitation is characterized to verify Class-Exploitation Correspondence Principle (CECP) (Roemer, 1982). According to this, CECP no longer holds in general convex cone economies if the well-known formulations of labor exploitation such as Morishima (1974) and Roemer (1982: Chapter 5) are applied.

This arises because the host country can play off the multinationals, which in turn stems from three factors: (a) oligopolistic rivalry; (b) quid pro quo FDI; (c) strategic outsourcing-FDI drives down the union wages at home if the host-country wage is sufficiently low. However, if the host-country wage is sufficiently high, the union wage increases under FDI. In such cases, FDI competition benefits the multinationals, the labor unions, as well as the host country.","[Zhao, Laixun] Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Okamura, Makoto] Hiroshima Univ, Dept Econ, Hiroshima 7398525, Japan",Kobe University; Hiroshima University,"Zhao, LX (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",zhao@rieb.kobe-u.ac.jp; okamuram@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,20,1,2,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We also provide axiomatic characterizations of obligation rules with two basic monotonicity properties, namely population monotonicity (if new agents join a society, no agent from the initial society can be worse off) and strong cost monotonicity (if a number of connection costs increase, no agent can be better off).

Therefore, risk aversion has a stabilizing affect on the macroeconomy. This result complements the existing explanations for unemployment persistence. It also raises a general point concerning the wide-spread assumption of risk-neutrality on the part of firms in the real business cycle and New Keynesian DSGE literatures. Our analysis suggests that this is not an innocuous assumption for assessing fluctuations and the appropriate policy response. Assuming firms to be risk-neutral understates their self-stabilization characteristics and therefore leads to an exaggerated stabilization role for monetary and fiscal policies.","[Choudhary, M.

Mercenier and Michel (1994a) provide a one-stage Runge-Kutta discretization of the above-mentioned models which preserves the steady state of the theoretical solution. They call this feature the steady-state invariance property. We generalize the result of their study by considering discrete models arising from the adoption of s-stage Runge-Kutta schemes. We show that the steady-state invariance property requires two different Runge-Kutta schemes for approximating the state variables and the exponential term in the objective function. This kind of discretization is well-known in literature as a partitioned symplectic Runge-Kutta scheme. Its main consequence is that it is possible to rely on the well-stated theory of order for considering more accurate methods which generalize the first order Mercenier and Michel algorithm. Numerical examples show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods up to the fourth order, when applied to test models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, when the data are disaggregated by commodity, the S-Curve is supported in almost 50% of the close to 100 industries considered. Furthermore, it appears that commodity types do not have any influence in determining the existence of an S-Curve pattern. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The transfer payment is then determined by the government's budget constraint. The optimal ratio of transfers to public good expenditure per person is expressed as a function of the ratio of the median to the arithmetic mean wage, and of the tax rate. Reductions in the skewness of the wage rate distribution are associated with reductions in transfer payments relative to public goods expenditure, at a decreasing rate. Furthermore, increases in the tax rate, from relatively low levels, are associated with increases in the relative importance of transfer payments. But beyond a certain level, further tax rate increases are associated with a lower ratio of transfers to public goods, because of adverse incentive effects.","[Creedy, John] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Creedy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",jcreedy@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

We start with a model in which industries are competitive and then successively allow for: monopoly pricing by export industries, revenue-replacement costs and cold-shower effects. The theoretical formulas accurately explain results from MONASH, a detailed computable general equilibrium model. A critical parameter in determining the optimal tariff is the export-demand elasticity. Modellers are often reluctant to adopt empirically justifiable values for export-demand elasticities because such values generate embarrassingly large optimal tariff rates. A way out of this dilemma is the adoption of a non-linear cold-shower specification.","[Dixon, Peter B.; Rimmer, Maureen T.] Monash Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Dixon, PB (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",peter.dixon@buseco.monash.edu.au,,"Rimmer, Maureen/0000-0002-7477-4565",,,,,28,10,10,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

We employ annual measures of inflation and industry input on an aggregated, disaggregated and sector basis, all of which have been especially constructed for this study. Both the time series and panel cointegration tests applied to this data are generally inconsistent with the prediction of the Balassa-Samuelson model that the tradable goods sector is compatible with purchasing power parity. However, our analysis also shows that other predictions of the Balassa-Samuelson model - most notably that there will be a strong long-run relationship between the real exchange rate and the relative productivity differential between China and the U.S. - does hold up for the Chinese economy. Moreover, the black market exchange rate appears to be more consistent with the predictions of the Balassa-Samuelson model than the official exchange rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A Multinomial Logit Model taking account of latent choice sets is employed to investigate the impact of household characteristics, such as income, size and age composition, on the choice of dwelling, specified by location, size and unit price. In addition to the price and income effects on housing demand, the model identifies a quality indicator for dwelling attributes, which can be interpreted as the mean attractiveness in a money metric measure. The data used in this study are cross-sectional survey data. The estimated model is used to calculate demand elasticities and demand probabilities, for selected groups of households and types of dwellings. Among the results can be noted that the price-income ratios, the age composition and size of household are all important determinants of the demand. The impact of income distribution on housing demand is also studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

If he/she remained at the same location, outcomes of fixed and endogenous location models must be analytically the same. Endogenous and different location changes outcomes radically.

Estimates from the literature suggest that expanded market access would cause the international price of Argentine exports of agro-manufactures to increase by between 8.7% and 15.9%. I explore two poverty effects caused by these prices changes: on food expenditure and on wages. Using a household budget survey, I estimate the impact of higher food prices on the Argentine poverty line. Using a labor force survey, I estimate the responses of wages to changes in export prices. My main finding is that market access would cause poverty to decline in Argentina. From a national head count of 29.26%, the poverty rate would decline to between 28.28% and 28.80%. This means that between 161,000 and 343,000 Argentines would be moved out of poverty.","World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Porto, G (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, MailStop MC3-303,1818 H St, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gporto@worldbank.org,,,,,,,16,9,11,1,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The present paper is an empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of China's sterilizations and capital mobility regulations, measured by sterilization and offset coefficients, respectively, using monthly data between mid-1999 and March 2009. We find that the effectiveness of China's sterilizations is almost perfect in terms of the monetary base, but not in terms of M2, and that China's capital controls still work but are not quite effective. Recursive estimation reveals that increasing mobility of capital flows and decreasing effectiveness of sterilizations might undercut China's ability to maintain monetary autonomy and domestic currency stability simultaneously. To solve the trilemma smoothly, China's monetary authority should continue to relax the management of the exchange rate, and take further steps towards deregulation of capital outflows.","Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Wang, YZ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yongzhong01@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,13,24,28,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2010,18.0,3,,,,,106,124,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01199.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,597ZO,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277801400007,0

The phases of cycles are history dependent for informational reasons, and changes in phases depend on the growth rate of aggregate investment: a slowdown in growth is interpreted as bad news and a slowdown in downturn is considered as good news. A small structural change in low cost investments can have a large effect on the pattern of cycles.

In this paper, we show that one more step iteration based on BS2SLSE gives a spatial counterpart of the three-stage least squares estimator for a system of J equations. This estimator. named BS3SLSE, is shown to be equivalent to BS2SLSE under normality and more efficient under non-normality. The proposed BS3SLSE call be interpreted as a GMM estimator where the number of moments increases with the sample size at some slow rate. The asymptotic efficiency of BS3SLSE relative to other previously proposed estimators such as MLE (Lee, 2004) and GMME (Lee, 2007a) is also discussed.

We employ vector autoregressions, instrumental variables, and qualitative evidence for 27 countries in the period 1925-39. The results suggest that monetary and fiscal stimulus was effective -- that where it did not make a difference it was not tried. They shed light on the debate over fiscal multipliers in episodes of financial crisis. They are consistent with multipliers at the higher end of those estimated in the recent literature, and with the argument that the impact of fiscal stimulus will be greater when banking systems are dysfunctional and monetary policy is constrained by the zero bound.","[Almunia, Miguel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Trinity College Dublin,"Almunia, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"; Almunia, Miguel/V-2497-2018; O'Rourke, Kevin/B-5927-2008","Benetrix, Agustin/0000-0002-6377-7509; Almunia, Miguel/0000-0002-2649-0592; O'Rourke, Kevin/0000-0001-6272-2090",,,,,84,103,118,3,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

After a section in which the alternative conceptions on the functioning of labour markets are presented and different ways of measuring human capital are compared, an applied analysis is carried out in which we provide a labour-demand-oriented measure of human capital, as defined by the amount of specific skills firms generate through work-based training (WBT) activities. By merging three rich firm-level datasets, we estimate the impact of a set of variables supposed to affect both the propensity to invest in WBT and the intensity of training within the Italian manufacturing industry over the period 2001-2005. Special attention is devoted to the variables characterizing within-firm organization of knowledge, organizational change and the formation of competence pipelines: among them, innovation, internationalization commitment, out-sourcing and new hirings. The estimates show that the effect of innovation on WBT is higher when the introduction of new technologies is supported by organizational innovations. When looking at the nature of WBT, we investigate the different determinants of the firms' propensity to provide both in-house and outside training. We measure training intensity in terms, respectively, of the number of provided training activities, private and total training costs and share of trainees.","[Antonelli, Gilberto; Antonietti, Roberto; Guidetti, Giovanni] Univ Bologna, SDIC, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Antonelli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, SDIC, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",,,"Antonietti, Roberto/0000-0002-2172-4062",,,,,51,24,25,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We focus on the interaction between the level of regulation and financial development and some individual characteristics that are important determinants of entrepreneurship, such as gender, business skills, and social networks. We find that entry regulation moderates the effect of business skills, while accentuating the effect of gender, even after accounting for the level of financial development. Specifically, women are more likely to enter into entrepreneurship in countries with higher levels of entry regulation, but mainly because they cannot find better work. This effect is also more pronounced in countries that are less financially developed. Furthermore, individuals who report having business skills are less likely to enter entrepreneurship in countries with higher entry regulation. Finally, we also find that individuals who know other entrepreneurs are less likely to start large businesses in countries with higher levels of entry and contract enforcement regulation.

In the process, they are confronted with numerous design issues. The coverage of installations in an ETS is one such issue. While blanket coverage that includes all industrial emitters of greenhouse gases in an economy has some intuitive appeal, and seems equitable, it does not take into full account all the costs related to the extent of coverage. This paper shows that an alternative approach of partial coverage based on benefit-cost analysis can achieve the same emission reduction outcome at lower social cost. The approach is based on maximizing the benefits from inclusion of installations in an ETS at the same time as taking all relevant transaction costs into account. A broad definition of transaction costs is used, which covers the regulatory costs to the government as well as regulatory costs imposed on covered installations. We find that particularly for relatively modest emissions reduction targets the cost savings of a partial coverage compared to blanket coverage are significant.","[Betz, Regina] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Ctr Energy & Environm Markets, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Sanderson, Todd; Ancev, Tihomir] Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Nat Resources, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sydney,"Betz, R (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Ctr Energy & Environm Markets, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",r.betz@unsw.edu.au; t.sanderson@usyd.edu.au; t.ancev@usyd.edu.au,,"Ancev, Tihomir/0000-0002-3521-7782",,,,,32,19,19,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

First, in order to characterize this trade-off, we solve a dynamic moral hazard problem in which agents' private effort decisions influence the life-cycle profiles of their earnings. We then show how the optimal allocation of individual effort and consumption can be implemented in a market equilibrium in which (i) agents and intermediaries repeatedly trade secured and unsecured debt instruments, and (ii) agents obtain (restricted) discharge of their unsecured debts in bankruptcy. The structure of this equilibrium and the associated restrictions on debt discharge closely match the main qualitative features of personal credit markets and bankruptcy law that actually exist in the United States.

The puzzle that the paper addresses is the issue that in this type of purchase the lender should be jointly liable with the seller for breach of sale contract by the seller (principle of joint responsibility). We study the rationale for this principle in situations where market failure arises because consumers underestimate the risk of product failure for example due to seller misrepresentation and it is difficult to enforce seller responsibility.

For the scenario where identification costs must be borne by producers and consumers of the high-quality good, the outcome under unregulated markets is identical to the optimal solution of a central planner constrained to neither ban the undesirable technology nor segregate the low-quality good. However, under certain circumstances the unregulated market equilibrium may be improved upon by government intervention that shifts the burden of identification costs to the producers of the low-quality good, or which bans the production of the low-quality good. The optimal intervention needs to be determined case-by-case and depends on consumer preferences, relative production costs, and relative costs of identification and fraud prevention.","[Lence, Sergio H.; Hayes, Dermot J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Hayes, Dermot J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Finance, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Lence, SH (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 368E Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",shlence@iastate.edu; dhayes@iastate.edu,"Lence, Sergio/L-3587-2017","Lence, Sergio/0000-0002-8296-3200; Hayes, Dermot/0000-0002-6278-7238",,,,,29,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Principles for Optimal Social Insurance and Pension Provision,ECONOMIST-NETHERLANDS,,,English,Article,,,,,,social insurance; pensions; precautionary savings,LIFE-CYCLE; CONSUMPTION,"The efficient organisation of social insurance is an important problem for modern societies. The paper discusses evidence that shocks in labour income have largely persistent effects and analyses the implications of this observation for the optimal design of institutions for wage contracting, social security, and pensions. In an optimal contract, wages reflect variations in individual productivity for incentives reasons. However, the optimal contract insures workers against firm specific shocks. These can better be born by shareholders who can diversify risks on capital markets. Progressive income taxation provides further insurance. On top of that there is scope for additional insurance based on 'verifiable' information on unemployment and health conditions. As final form of 'insurance', the paper analyzes the role of self-insurance. Income shocks can be absorbed partially by precautionary saving. The individual's saving plans for retirement and for precaution are, therefore, related issues. In an institutional setting with mandatory saving for retirement, an integration of disability and unemployment insurance on the one hand and the pension system on the other hand in a lifetime savings account allows for this interrelation. The paper analyzes how to deal with the uncertainty in the return on savings in the framework of a lifetime saving account.","[Teulings, Coen N.] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [Teulings, Coen N.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; University of Amsterdam,"Teulings, CN (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands.",C.N.Teulings@cpb.nl,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,APR,2010,158.0,1,,,,,1,21,,10.1007/s10645-010-9134-5,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,583WE,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276709900001,0

The network of social ties can potentially transmit important information on abilities and reputations and also help mitigate matching frictions by facilitating interactions among screened individuals. We conjecture that the probability of two individuals forming a team falls in the distance between the two individuals in the network of existing social ties. The objective of this paper is to empirically test this conjecture. We examine the formation of coauthor relations among economists over a twenty-year period. Our principal finding is that a new collaboration emerges faster among two researchers if they are closer in the existing coauthor network among economists. This proximity effect on collaboration is strong: Being at a network distance of 2 instead of 3, for instance, raises the probability of initiating a collaboration by 27%.

In particular, we characterize the logical relations between the decision and the criteria that enable justification of a majority decision through a proposition-wise aggregation rule with no veto power on the criteria. While the well-studied doctrinal paradox provides a negative example in which no such justification exists, we show that genuine possibility results emerge if there is a gap between the necessary and the sufficient conditions for the decision. This happens, for instance, if there is only a partial consensus about the appropriate criteria for the decision, if only a subset of these criteria can be elicited, or if the judgment on criteria is based on probabilistic acceptance thresholds.

However, these cross-country studies have generally not taken into account the fact that around the SWB national average, a considerable spread of scores exists within nations. In an extreme case, a country may be in the midst of a major social upheaval, with a large group of dispossessed and disadvantaged individuals, yet this fact is completely hidden by the arithmetical average. Using cross-country data with diverse economic and socio-economic characteristics and the latest available dataset on well-being, we uncover the factors that appear to be the most highly correlated with the inequality of well-being within nations. We find the inequalities in individual incomes and quality of health, and the level of institutional qualities to be most important in explaining the inequalities of well-being.","[Ovaska, Tomi] Youngstown State Univ, Dept Econ, Youngstown, OH 44555 USA; [Takashima, Ryo] Sophia Univ, Dept Int Relat, Tokyo 102, Japan",University System of Ohio; Youngstown State University; Sophia University,"Ovaska, T (通讯作者)，Youngstown State Univ, Dept Econ, Youngstown, OH 44555 USA.",,"Ovaska, Tomi/AAG-2390-2019","Ovaska, Tomi/0000-0002-3618-3406",,,,,29,31,33,0,14,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We investigate the consequences of this distinction, and show that whenever an agent's ex ante and ex post Outside options differ, this may equip the principal with an additional tool for screening among different agent types, by randomizing over the probability with which trade Occurs once the agent has undertaken the investment.

Per se rules are used to prevent actions that rarely, if ever, have any procompetitive benefits, such as price-fixing agreements. Rule of reason analysis is used when there are potential efficiency gains from the actions under investigation. Some vertical practices of the wireless carriers, such as bandwidth restrictions, may appear to be anticompetitive, but may also have plausible efficiency justifications so should be judged under rule of reason analysis. Economic examination of the wireless industry shows significant competition between networks, which reduces the concern about vertical relationships, but also shows some areas that should be monitored by antitrust and regulatory authorities. We propose several regulatory changes that would likely increase wireless competition and lessen the perceived need for prophylactic network neutrality rules while at the same time allowing efficiency-enhancing vertical relationships.

In a partial-equilibrium set-up, both domestic and foreign producers compete in selling a product in the domestic market, in the presence of consumption externalities. The policymaker chooses a minimum domestic standard that has to be met by both domestic and foreign producers. Protectionism occurs when the welfare-maximizing domestic standard is higher than the international standard maximizing welfare inclusive of foreign profits. We show that the standard is anti-protectionist when foreign producers are much more efficient at addressing the externality than are domestic producers. Possible exclusion of domestic or foreign producers arises with large standards, which may alter the classification of a standard as protectionist or non-protectionist.

Assuming that legislators choose a multidimensional policy on which citizens and a lobby group have opposing interests, we show that bicameralism improves the accountability of legislators to the electorate when the same party controls the two chambers and party polarization is high, while the opposite holds if the two chambers are controlled by different parties.

Our results suggest that, for both CEMAC and WAEMU, the fundamentals account for most of the exchange rates' fluctuation: increases in the terms-of-trade, government consumption and productivity tend to appreciate the exchange rate, while increases in investment and openness tend to depreciate it. At end of 2005, we find no evidence that either the CEMAC or WAEMU REERs were significantly over-valued, which suggests that no exchange rate action is currently needed.

The basic idea is that when loans are collateralized and firms are credit constrained, the amount borrowed is generated by the value of the collateral. I use a classical credit rationing model to explain the link between firms' debt capacities and asset value in the case of distress. As we shall see, the price of fixed assets depends on whether there are firms that repurchase them. In fact, it depends on the number of bad firms in the economy as well as on the liquidity of good firms. In this model, a separating equilibrium can only occur if there exist a number of bad firms that go bankrupt and if there exist good firms with sufficient liquidity. Each firm derives positive externalities from the existence of other firms. Indeed, the optimal leverage of firms depends on the possibility of repurchasing the distressed assets.","[Affuso, Antonio] Univ Parma, I-43100 Parma, Italy",University of Parma,,antonio.affuso@unimi.it,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,,CONTRIBUT ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,91,102,,10.1007/978-3-7908-2131-4_5,0.0,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNH32,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274558200005,0

Discriminant analysis is applied, to identify a number of characteristics that do successfully differentiate between each group of markets, and helps to provide authenticity to the terms - developed and emerging.","[Alrgibi, Guoma; Murray, Louis] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Finance Grp, Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland; [Ariff, Mohamed] Bond Univ, Sch Business Technol & Sustainable Dev, Finance Grp, Robina, Qld 4229, Australia",University College Dublin; Bond University,"Murray, L (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Finance Grp, Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland.",louis.murray@ucd.ie,"Ariff, Mohamed/U-6072-2019",,,,,,7,3,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

More specifically, the paper analyzes the infinitely repeated Bertrand game. It is shown that for every level of renegotiation cost, there exists a discount factor such that any collusive profit can be supported as an equilibrium outcome. Hence, any arbitrary small renegotiation cost will suffice to facilitate collusive outcomes for sufficiently patient firms. This result stands in stark contrast to the unique pure strategy WRP equilibrium without renegotiation costs, which implies marginal-cost pricing in every period. Moreover, in comparison to the findings of Mc-Cutcheon (1997), who states that renegotiation costs have to be substantial to facilitate collusion, this result points to a quite different conclusion.","[Andersson, Ola] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Wengstrom, Erik] Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Wengstrom, Erik] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",Stockholm School of Economics; Lund University; University of Copenhagen,"Andersson, O (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",ola.andersson@hhs.se; erik.wengstrom@nek.lu.se,,"Wengstrom, Erik/0000-0002-1414-9055",,,,,17,0,0,0,6,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.
