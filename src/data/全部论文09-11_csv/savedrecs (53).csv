In particular, the construction of institutionalised uncertainty, together with less formalised migratory processes, help produce 'precarious workers' over whom employers and labour users have particular mechanisms of control.","COMPAS, Oxford OX4 1HA, England",University of Oxford,"Anderson, B (通讯作者)，COMPAS, 58 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX4 1HA, England.",Bridget.anderson@compas.ox.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G032076/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G032076/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,61,599,651,5,172,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

For this purpose, the model SLOPOL4, a macroeconometric model for Slovenia, is used. Optimal policies are calculated using the OPTCON algorithm, an algorithm for determining (approximately) optimal solutions to deterministic and stochastic control problems. We determine optimal exchange rate and fiscal policies for Slovenia as solutions to optimum control problems with a quadratic objective function and the model SLOPOL4 as constraint. Several optimization experiments under different assumptions about the exchange rate regime are carried out. The sensitivity of the results with respect to several assumptions is investigated; in particular, the reaction of the optimal paths on varying the stochastic character of the model parameters is examined. If the stochastic nature of more parameters is taken into consideration, the resulting policies are closer to the deterministic solution than with only a few stochastic parameters.","[Neck, Reinhard; Haber, Gottfried] Klagenfurt Univ, Dept Econ, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria; [Weyerstrass, Klaus] IHS Vienna, A-1060 Vienna, Austria",University of Klagenfurt,"Neck, R (通讯作者)，Klagenfurt Univ, Dept Econ, Univ Str 65-67, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria.",reinhard.neck@uni-klu.ac.at,,"Weyerstrass, Klaus/0000-0002-5659-8991",EU Commission [MRTN-CT-2006-034270]; Jubilaumsfonds of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank [12166],EU Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Jubilaumsfonds of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank,The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the EU Commission through MRTN-CT-2006-034270 COMISEF and from the Jubilaumsfonds of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (project no. 12166).,,9,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

However, existing empirical studies fail to fully explain the distribution of incentives in a region or state because they do not account for variations in the distribution of population or industries. This article contributes to the literature on the targeting of incentives in several important ways, using the example of Ohio. The distribution of economic incentives is examined using the intensity of incentives, which allows for examination of whether incentives are targeted to distressed locations or industries. Intensity of incentives is measured as the value or number of incentives weighted by the number of employees and firms in each location or industry. We find that policies are missing the mark if they are indeed intended to target areas of distress or particular industries.","[Greenbaum, Robert T.; Russell, Blair D.] Ohio State Univ, John Glenn Sch Publ Affairs, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Petras, Tricia L.] Ohio Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Athens, OH 45701 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Greenbaum, RT (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, John Glenn Sch Publ Affairs, 310N Page Hall,1810 Coll Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",greenbaum.3@osu.edu,,,,,,,46,8,15,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

In this article, the authors analyze publicly available data on the new investments in capital and labor that Minnesota businesses report making in response to the program. The authors find that businesses signing deals in 2004 and 2005 reported creating 4,891 jobs and investing $768 million, with the reported activity varying significantly across the state. The number of jobs reportedly created represents less than 1% of Minnesota's total nonfarm, private employment. The authors also combine the businesses' reported data with county-level economic data and analyze how JOBZ-related investment is correlated with economic growth in each county. The authors find little evidence of JOBZ's impact on county-level economic growth during the first 3 years of the program, but do find significant impacts of several workforce and demographic variables on county-level growth.","[Kalambokidis, Laura] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Hansen, Tonya J.] Minnesota State Univ Moorhead, Dept Econ, Moorhead, MN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Minnesota State University Moorhead,"Kalambokidis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 231 Classroom Off Bldg,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",kalam002@umn.edu,,,,,,,10,5,11,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Our main finding is that firms enjoying better financial health are more likely to become exporters. The result contrasts with the previous empirical literature which found evidence that export participation improves firm financial health, but not that export starters display any ex ante financial advantage. On the contrary, we find that financial constraints act as a barrier to export participation. Better access to external financial resources increases the probability to start exporting and also shortens the time before firms decide to serve foreign customers. This finding has important policy implications as it suggests that, in the presence of financial market imperfections, public intervention can be called for to help efficient but financially constrained firms to overcome the sunk entry costs into export markets and expand their activities abroad.","[Bellone, Flora] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France; [Musso, Patrick] Univ Savoie, IREGE IMUS, Le Bourget Du Lac, France; [Schiavo, Stefano] Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Trento, Italy",Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite Savoie Mont Blanc; University of Trento,"Bellone, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France.",,"SCHIAVO, Stefano/B-6147-2012","SCHIAVO, Stefano/0000-0001-9740-5167",,,,,51,194,216,4,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2010,33.0,3,,,,,347.0,373,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01259.x,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,573CA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275884800003,0

As far as this article is concerned, there Is no previous empirical work dealing With tourist outflows from Turkey. The previous tourism Studies of Turkey have focused, by and large, on inbound tourism demand analyses. However, as a developing Country and an important tourism destination, Turkey has also been a significant Source for generating a Substantial number Of tourists in recent years. Therefore, the tourist Outflows also merit empirical analysis. Total tourist Outflows from Turkey are related to real income and relative prices. The bounds testing to cointegration procedure proposed by Pesaran et al (2001) is employed to Compute the short- and long-run elasticities of income and relative prices. An augmented form of Granger Causality analysis is conducted among the variables Of Outbound tourist flows, income and relative prices to determine the direction of causality. In the long run, causality runs interactively through the error correction term from income and relative prices to Outbound tourist flows. However, in the short run, causality runs only from income to Outbound tourism flows. The aggregate tourism outflows equation is also checked for the parameter stability via the tests of cumulative SLIM (CUSUM) and cumulative SLIM of the squares (CUSUMSQ). The results Suggest that income Is the most significant variable in explaining total tourist Outflows from Turkey and there is a stable Outbound tourism demand function. The results also lead to important policy recommendations.","Yeditepe Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34755 Istanbul, Turkey",Yeditepe University,"Halicioglu, F (通讯作者)，Yeditepe Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34755 Istanbul, Turkey.",fhalicioglu@yeditepe.edu.tr,"Halicioglu, Ferda/B-3200-2018","Halicioglu, Ferda/0000-0001-7528-0973",,,,,44,34,36,2,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

After stagnating or declining for nearly a generation, the height of adult white men and women began to increase among the birth cohorts of ca. 1975-1986, who reached adulthood between 1995 and 2006. The increase in their height overcame the prior downturn that lasted between ca. 1965 and 1974. The height gap between whil e and black men has increased by 0.43 cm (0.17 in.) during past decade compared to the previous quarter century, to reach 1.0 cm (0.39 in.). In contrast to the three other groups examined, the height of black women has been actually declining by some 1.42cm (0.56 in.). Consequently, a very considerable wedge has developed between black and while women's height of 1.95 cm, (0.77 in.). In addition, black women in the age range 20-39 weigh some 9.5 kg (21.0 lb) more than their white counterparts. Two hypotheses are worth considering, namely, (a) that the decline in their height is related to the obesity epidemic and to inadequate dietary balance, and (b) that their future health will be subject to a double jeopardy in the sense that both their increasing weight and decreasing physical stature are likely associated with negative health consequences.

This paper examines whether firm size plays a role in this supposedly favourable relationship between exporting and total factor productivity (TFP). To examine this, we investigate, separately for large and small firms, whether firms starting to export perform better ex ante (self-selection) than non-exporting firms and, conditional on this fact, if they are also more productive ex post (learning-by-exporting). With this purpose, we use both stochastic dominance and matching techniques. The dataset is a representative sample of Spanish manufacturing firms drawn from the Encuesta sobre Estrategias Empresariales for 1990-2002. Our results shed light on the importance of considering differences in firm size when analysing both self-selection into exporting and post-entry productivity changes. They confirm the existence of a binding process of self-selection into exporting among small firms, but not among large firms. Post-entry productivity growth, although with different time patterns, is significant both for small and large firms.","[Manez-Castillejo, Juan A.] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Máñez-Castillejo, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",,"Manez, Juan/K-6780-2014; ROCHINA BARRACHINA, MARIA ENGRACIA/K-8929-2014; Sanchis Llopis, Juan A./K-8923-2014","Manez, Juan/0000-0003-1105-0815; ROCHINA BARRACHINA, MARIA ENGRACIA/0000-0002-9263-1023; Sanchis Llopis, Juan A./0000-0001-9664-4668",,,,,38,26,27,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2010,33.0,3,,,,,315.0,346,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01258.x,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,573CA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275884800002,0

This highlights the importance of developing methods to efficiently use consumer information in firm pricing strategies so as to increase profits. In this article we utilize such a method which includes information about consumer consideration sets. Extant pricing strategies assume that all brands in the market are included in this competitive set while setting prices. Through an empirical illustration in the ketchup market we demonstrate that firms can improve profits substantially by including consumer consideration sets in arriving at their optimal pricing strategies. We find that the ability of a brand to increase prices seems to depend on both the number of competitors it faces as well as the proportion of households for whom there are competitors in their consideration sets.

This is the first analysis of a stadium referendum with respect to the spatial dimension outside the U.S. The new arena, which is the home venue of the professional soccer clubs FC Bayern Munchen and TSV 1860 Munchen and also was a major venue during the FIFA World Cup 2006 clearly won the approval of a majority of voters in one of the referendums with the largest participation in the history of Munich. However, in proximity of the projected site, residents strongly opposed the project, which reflects in significantly reduced shares of yes-votes. Assuming rationality, we conclude that at city level residents expected an increase in utility from the new arena that justified public expenses. However, our results also point to considerable proximity cost, probably related to the presence of fan crowds and congestion. This finding contradicts the existing evidence on stadium impact from the U.S. There are also major differences in the socio-economic determinants of voting behavior, indicating that the expected net-benefit of proximity to professional sports facilities may vary across sports and countries.","[Ahlfeldt, Gabriel M.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Maennig, Wolfgang] Univ Hamburg, Sch Business Econ & Social Sci, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Hamburg,"Ahlfeldt, GM (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",g.ahlfeldt@lse.ac.uk; w.maennig@econ.uni-hamburg.de; hanno.scholz@alice-dsl.net,,,,,,,52,4,4,0,24,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

However, some commentators have charged that covenant restrictions are full of boilerplate and mostly unenforced, thus any positive marginal price measurement captures other unobserved aspects of the subdivision. Indeed newly published estimates report zero or negative marginal price for deed-restricted subdivisions (DRS). This paper reviews these claims using a hedonic model of housing and a unique dataset that includes covenant restrictions, by-laws, and club goods. Results show a positive marginal price of deed restrictions even when controlling for several subdivision characteristics; however, the marginal price of restrictions falls to zero if a covenant is not updated after 25 years.","Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63121 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Saint Louis,"Rogers, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, 408 SSB,1 Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",rogerswil@umsl.edu,,,,,,,11,10,10,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

As-if arguments are frequently put forward in behavioral economics to justify 'psychological' models that add new parameters to fit decision outcome data rather than specifying more realistic or empirically supported psychological processes that genuinely explain these data. Another striking similarity is that both behavioral and neoclassical research programs refer to a common set of axiomatic norms without subjecting them to empirical investigation. Notably missing is investigation of whether people who deviate from axiomatic rationality face economically significant losses. Despite producing prolific documentation of deviations from neoclassical norms, behavioral economics has produced almost no evidence that deviations are correlated with lower earnings, lower happiness, impaired health, inaccurate beliefs, or shorter lives. We argue for an alternative non-axiomatic approach to normative analysis focused on veridical descriptions of decision process and a matching principle - between behavioral strategies and the environments in which they are used - referred to as ecological rationality. To make behavioral economics, or psychology and economics, a more rigorously empirical science will require less effort spent extending 'as-if' utility theory to account for biases and deviations, and substantially more careful observation of successful decision makers in their respective domains.","[Berg, Nathan] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX 75083 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Berg, N (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, 800 W Campbell Rd,GR31, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",gigerenzer@mpib-berlin.mpg.de,"Gigerenzer, Gerd/A-6250-2012; Gigerenzer, Gerd/M-5595-2013; Sanyal, Rajib Kumar/V-5290-2019","Gigerenzer, Gerd/0000-0002-6163-5419; Sanyal, Rajib Kumar/0000-0002-4848-6682",,,,,80,185,205,3,36,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Our results indicate that applicants with a name of Moroccan origin are 15 percentage points less likely to receive a response than those with a Spanish name.

The feasibility of crop revenue insurance for Chinese maize, soybean, wheat, cotton and rice markets is specifically addressed. Increased crop demand, rising production costs and variable weather necessitate the use of agricultural insurance by producers, input providers and processors. Crop producers and agribusiness entities around the world are realizing that yield-based insurance alone will not offset the risk of adverse price movements during the growing season. Producers may, for example, achieve above-average crop yields only to find that total revenues have substantially declined due to price decreases. Properly constructed and rated, revenue-based crop insurance can provide superior risk management performance to producers. Revenue policies insure producers against declines in expected revenue below a guaranteed revenue amount and thereby aid in budget planning, securing bank loans and reducing credit costs to input suppliers. The paper provides a brief discussion of revenue insurance for multiple crops in the United States, currently the largest user of crop revenue insurance. Revenue insurance adds price change into the indemnity equation, requiring use of correlated multivariate analyses. The analytical procedure for measuring revenue risks employs Monte Carlo modeling of the state-space comprised of correlated yield and price risks. This procedure is simply described using graphics. A successful application of revenue insurance in Brazil is described and contract elements deemed necessary for success are outlined. As discussed, to properly incorporate price risk, the indemnity index employed for measuring value change must satisfy five essential criteria. These criteria are applied to the major Chinese agricultural futures markets for maize, soybeans, cotton, wheat and rice. Conclusions on the feasibility of the successful development of revenue insurance for these crops are presented.

The elasticities are estimated using annual industry-level KLEM data (1961-2003) and relying on two flexible functional forms: the Translog and the Symmetric Generalized McFadden (SGM) cost functions. In addition to the point estimates, the confidence intervals of the elasticities are computed using Studentized bootstrap resampling techniques. For both industries, the estimation results suggest that capital, labour, material and energy are pairwise substitutes and that energy is the most substitutable input. However, the low magnitudes of the estimated elasticities do not seem to offer great flexibility to these industries to adapt to high increases in energy prices.","[Dissou, Yazid] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Ghazal, Reza] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, ECO Coll Insurance, Tehran, Iran",University of Ottawa; Allameh Tabataba'i University,"Dissou, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Pavillon Desmarais,55 Laurier Ave E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",ydissou@uottawa.ca; hazhar_ghazal@yahoo.com,,,IRND fund of the University of Ottawa,IRND fund of the University of Ottawa,Financial support from the IRND fund of the University of Ottawa is acknowledged.,,49,6,6,0,11,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2010,31.0,1,,,,,121.0,148,,,,,,28,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,542ST,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273516200006,0

On average, long positions in this part of the swap market yield negative returns. The daily returns are distinctively non-normal in terms of tail-fatness, but we find little evidence of asymmetry. We investigate if the flexible four-parameter class of normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) distributions can capture the observed stylized facts and find that this class of distributions offers a remarkably improved fit relative to the normal distribution. We also compare the fit with that of the four-parameter class of stable distributions; the NIG law outperforms the stable law in the vast majority of cases. Thus, the NIG family of distributions, which allows for stochastic dynamics in terms of Levy processes that are suitable for pricing derivatives and Value-at-Risk measurements, is a serious candidate for modeling term structure dynamics in the Nordic electricity market.","[Frestad, Dennis; Koekebakker, Steen] Univ Agder, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway; [Benth, Fred Espen] Univ Oslo, Dept Math, Ctr Math Applicat, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",University of Agder; University of Oslo,"Frestad, D (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, Serv Box 422, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway.",dennis.frestad@uia.no; fredb@math.uio.no; steen.koekebakker@uia.no,"Koekebakker, Steen/HJY-0883-2023","Benth, Fred Espen/0000-0001-9907-6811",,,,,65,18,18,0,16,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2010,31.0,2,,,,,53.0,86,,,,,,34,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,578GP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276281900003,0

This paper assesses the potential impact of Russian unreliability on the European gas market, and how it affects European gas import strategy. We also study to what extent Europe should invest in strategic gas storage capacity to mitigate the effects of possible Russian unreliability. The European gas import market is described by differentiated competition between Russia and a more reliable competitive fringe of other exporters. The results show that Russian contract volumes and prices decline significantly as a function of unreliability, so that not only Europe but also Russia suffers if Russia's unreliability increases. For Europe, buying gas from more reliable suppliers at a price premium turns out to be generally more attractive than building strategic gas storage capacity.","[Morbee, Joris; Proost, Stef] Catholic Univ Leuven KULeuven, Ctr Econ Studies, Dept Econ, BE-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Morbee, Joris; Proost, Stef] Catholic Univ Leuven KULeuven, KULeuven Energy Inst, BE-3000 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Morbee, J (通讯作者)，JRC, European Commiss, Inst Energy, POB 2, NL-1755 ZG Petten, Netherlands.",joris.morbee@ec.europa.eu; stef.proost@econ.kuleuven.be,,"Proost, Stefaan/0000-0003-3731-4532",KULeuven Energy Institute,KULeuven Energy Institute,"The authors thank the participants at the 2nd Enerday conference in Dresden in April 2007, the 9th IAEE European Energy Conference in Florence in June 2007, a discussion session at the European Commission - DG TREN in December 2008, a CEPE seminar at ETH Zurich in May 2009, and an ESE Meeting at the Institute for Energy in Petten in December 2009, for their comments.

Using Chesher's (1991) methodology, we obtain a small error variance approximation for the contaminated sampling distributions that characterize RB samples with CME. Then, following Chesher (2000), we develop the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators that reduce the bias of the most well known likelihood-based estimators for RB samples which ignore the existence of CME and derive a score test to detect the presence of this type of measurement error. Our approach only requires the specification of the conditional distribution of the response variable given the latent covariates and the classical additive measurement error model assumption, the availability of information on both the marginal probability of the strata in the population and the variance of the measurement error not being essential. Monte Carlo evidence is presented which suggests that, in RB samples of moderate sizes, the bias-reduced GMM estimators perform well.","[Ramalho, Esmeralda A.] Univ Evora, Dept Econ, P-7000803 Evora, Portugal",University of Evora,"Ramalho, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, Dept Econ, P-7000803 Evora, Portugal.",ela@uevora.pt,"Arranhado, Esmeralda/B-6180-2009","Arranhado, Esmeralda/0000-0002-9525-0082",,,,,36,0,0,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

A comparative framework is used to document these differences, and a model is developed to formally analyze how liberalization affects production and income distribution when the institutions that govern production and exchange are also affected. Hypotheses are derived for how endogenous institutional adjustments affect the growth response to liberalization.

In order to address this question, the article focuses on China and Japan's diplomatic styles and domestic political institutions and examines how these two elements influenced negotiations on the formation of FTAs, as well as the evolving perceptions that the Southeast Asian nations have of these two states. The article argues that Japan and China possess different kinds of weaknesses in implementing feasible external policies - a lack of policy decisiveness for Japan and weak policy credibility for China - which have resulted from the operation of domestic political institutions. Given these differences, while China implemented pragmatic diplomacy that helped improve its policy credibility, Japan's bargaining diplomatic style did not serve to rectify its weak policy decisiveness. Such differences in their diplomatic approach have led to the differing influence of these two states on Southeast Asia.","Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Beppu, Oita, Japan",Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University,"Yoshimatsu, H (通讯作者)，Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Beppu, Oita, Japan.",yoshih@apu.ac.jp,"Yoshimatsu, Hidetaka/AAZ-5473-2021",,,,,,54,4,5,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Detailed crop risk mapping with insurance data as validation will be helpful to the adjustment of insurance rate in the future. It was found that natural disasters, especially hydro-meteorological disasters were the main causes of agricultural loss in Zhejiang. Farmers in the developed coastal regions of Zhejiang were more willing to buy crop insurance and their insurance loss was higher because of more exposed to tropical cyclones and rainstorms.

This is the more surprising since it was heavily attacked by the government of the most powerful country of the world, the USA for some years. This country demanded the dissolution of the BIS at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 as a precondition for allowing nations to join the planned International Monetary Fund. Before this the Bank was also able to master the crisis resulting from the demise of the gold (exchange) standard and the end of the German reparation payments agreed on in the Dawes and Young Plans, both consequences of the Great Depression. The Bank even survived the events of the Second World War threatening it, and reacted creatively to the crisis posed by the founding of the European Monetary Union.

The relation between selection of home and work locations has been heavily debated in the transportation planning literature. In this paper we use circuity, the ratio of network to Euclidean distance to better understand the choice of, residential location relative to work. This is done using two methods of defining origins and destinations in twenty metropolitan regions in the United States, with more detailed analysis of Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota and Portland, Oregon. The first method of selection is based on actual choice of residence and work locations. The second is based on a randomly selected dataset of origins and destinations in the same regions, followed by a comparison between the two methods for these regions. The study shows circuity measured through randomly selected origins and destinations differs from circuity measured from actual origins and destinations. Workers tend to reside in areas such that the journey to work circuity is lower than random, applying intelligence to their location decisions. Consistent with traditional urban economic theory. this suggests locators wish to locate on the frontier with the largest residential lot at the shortest commute time, but in contrast with the classic model which simplifies transportation networks to be uniform, we cannot assume that all possible home-work pairs are on the frontier. This finding, developed from microscopic data not previously used for this question, reveals an important issue related to residence choice and location theory and how resident workers tend to locate with respect to network configuration in an urban context.

Swinnen Dramatic changes took place in agricultural policies in Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 1860s European nations agreed on a series of trade agreements which spread free trade across the continent. In the 1960s European nations concluded an international agreement which spread heavy government intervention and protection against imports across the continent. This paper quantifies these changes in protection over the course of a century, relates them to changes in policies, and offers a political economy explanation for the growth in agricultural protection in Europe.","[Swinnen, Johan F.

We examine a number of possible implications of capital flows and turnover on capital returns testing for evidence of a price pressure effect, 'return chasing' behaviour and information revelation. The main tool of analysis is a panel vector autoregressive (VAR) regression model in which institutional capital flows, turnover and returns are specified as endogenous variables in a two equation system in which we also control for macro-economic variables. Data on flows, turnover and returns are obtained for the ten market segments covering the main UK commercial real estate sectors. Our results do not support the widely-held belief among practitioners that capital flows have a 'price pressure' effect on property prices. However, we do find a significant positive relationship between lagged turnover and contemporaneous capital returns, suggesting that asset turnover provides increased price revelation which, in turn, reduces investment risk and increases property values.","[Marcato, Gianluca; McAllister, Pat] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Sch Real Estate & Planning, Reading RG6 6AW, Berks, England; [Ling, David C.] Univ Florida, Coll Business, Ctr Real Estate Studies, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",University of Reading; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Marcato, G (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Sch Real Estate & Planning, Reading RG6 6AW, Berks, England.",ling@ufl.edu; g.marcato@henley.reading.ac.uk; p.m.mcallister@henley.reading.ac.uk,,"Marcato, Gianluca/0000-0002-6266-4676",,,,,34,33,34,3,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Subsequently, we analyse the influence of EBA on three interrelated areas: reforming EU agricultural policy (internal), restructuring EU-ACP relations (regional) and forging a WTO round (global). We conclude that EBA has played a catalysing role in these issues, in line with the globalist-liberal preferences which have become dominant in the EU.","[Faber, Gerrit] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Orbie, Jan] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium",Utrecht University; Ghent University,"Faber, G (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",g.faber@uu.nl,,,,,,,47,19,19,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

For this, two issues are of relevance. Firstly, health and work may be endogenously related because of direct causal effects of health on work and vice versa, and because of unobservables that may affect both observed health and work outcomes. Secondly, social surveys usually contain self-assessed health measures and research indicates that these may be subject to endogenous, state-dependent reporting bias. A solution to the 'Health and Retirement Nexus' therefore requires an integrated model for work decisions, health production and health reporting mechanisms.

Own price elasticities are negative and tobacco appears to be more responsive than alcohol demand, although both responses are less than unity. Cross price elasticities are also negative and asymmetric thus suggesting complementarity. A double dividend could then be exploited, because public policy needs to tackle the consumption of only one good to control the demand of both. These results show that the optimal strategy for maximizing public revenues would be to raise alcohol taxation more than tobacco taxation. Finally, past consumption of one addictive good does not significantly reinforce current consumption of the other.","[Tiezzi, Silvia] Univ Siena, Dept Econ, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Pierani, Pierpaolo] Univ Siena, Dept Econ Policy Finance & Dev, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena; University of Siena,"Tiezzi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ, Piazza San Francesco 7, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",pierani@unisi.it; tiezzisilvia@unisi.it,"Tiezzi, Silvia/K-2794-2012; Tiezzi, Silvia/AAH-9394-2020","Tiezzi, Silvia/0000-0002-5998-7992",,,,,54,32,39,1,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Using plant-level data from the manufacturing sector, we find that a real depreciation increases the share of skilled workers in the total wage bill in exporters but not in non-exporters. This result suggests that depreciations or, more generally, increases in export profitability, may induce exporters to adopt more skill-intensive technologies. This finding gives support to recent models of trade that highlight the possible effect of the real exchange rate on skill upgrading and wage inequality. This paper also finds that real depreciations increase plants' export intensity, suggesting that skill upgrading for firms that are already exporters is the channel through which real exchange depreciations affect wage inequality.","[Alvarez, Roberto] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Ricardo A.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Universidad de Chile; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,,,,,,,,,28,8,10,0,23,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2009,32.0,8,,,,,1165.0,1179,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01203.x,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,472BT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268104800002,0

We show that our framework of influence is more general than the framework of the command games. We define several influence functions which capture the command structure. These functions are compatible with the command games, in the sense that each commandable player for a coalition in the command game is a follower of the coalition under the command influence function. Some of the presented influence functions are equivalent to the command games, that is, they are compatible with the command games, and additionally each follower of a coalition under the command influence function is also a commandable player for that coalition in the command games. For some influence functions we define the equivalent command games. We show that not for all influence functions the compatible command games exist. Moreover, we propose a more general definition of the influence index and show that under some assumptions, some power indices, which can be used in the command games, coincide with some expressions of the weighted influence indices. Both the Shapley-Shubik index and the Banzhaf index are equal to a difference between the weighted influence indices under some influence functions, and the only difference between these two power indices lies in the weights for the influence indices. An example of the Confucian model of society is broadly examined.","[Rusinowska, Agnieszka] Univ Lyon 2, GATE, CNRS UMR 5824, Ecole Normale Super LSH, F-69131 Ecully, France; [Grabisch, Michel] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75013 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Rusinowska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon 2, GATE, CNRS UMR 5824, Ecole Normale Super LSH, 93 Chemin Mouilles,BP 167, F-69131 Ecully, France.",michel.grabisch@univ-paris1.fr; rusinowska@gate.cnrs.fr,"Rusinowska, Agnieszka/KCL-5447-2024","Rusinowska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-3803-9907",,,,,23,12,12,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,AUG,2009,33.0,2,,,,,177.0,209,,10.1007/s00355-008-0350-8,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,459NV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267110800001,0

This article explores empirically how far these mechanisms have achieved their aims and thereby acted to protect the employment conditions of staff, and links this exploration to debates concerning the employment implications of organizational reforms within public sectors internationally. It concludes that in terms of bringing income security to the voluntary sector and stability to employment terms and conditions these efforts have been unsuccessful, and consequently casts doubts on more optimistic interpretations of the employment effects of organizational restructuring in the British public sector.","[Cunningham, Ian] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Human Resource Management, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [James, Philip] Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Business, Oxford OX3 0BP, England",University of Strathclyde; Oxford Brookes University,"Cunningham, I (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Human Resource Management, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",ian.cunningham@strath.ac.uk; pjames@brookes.ac.uk,,"James, Phil/0000-0001-9248-0280",,,,,28,60,61,0,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Returns to direct real estate are mean reverting, and risk decreases with horizon. This is driven by a tendency for property transaction prices to overshoot inflation. Mean reversion in real estate returns is weaker than that of equities, resulting in real estate having similar risk to equities for long-term investors. However, optimal portfolios have large allocations to direct real estate at all horizons, and the allocation increases with horizon. Finally, we find that real estate investment trusts are a redundant asset class for investors with access to direct real estate as an asset class, but they do have a role in optimal allocations when direct property investment is not feasible.","[MacKinnon, Gregory H.; Zaman, Ashraf Al] St Marys Univ, Sobey Sch Business, Dept Finance & Management Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"MacKinnon, GH (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, Sobey Sch Business, Dept Finance & Management Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",greg.mackinnon@smu.ca; ashraf.zaman@smu.ca,,,,,,,28,69,74,1,33,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2009,37.0,1,,,,,117.0,153,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00237.x,0.0,,,37,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,409RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263522400006,0

The purpose of this article is to report briefly the height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) differences between North and South Korean children by using previous sources and new data. This study employs South Korean data published by the Korean Research Institute for Standards and Science in 1997 and by the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards in 2004, comparing them to North Korean data stemming from the 1997 and 2002 nutritional surveys conducted by the United Nations. Furthermore, this article makes use of anthropometric measurements of North Korean refugee children immigrating to South Korea from 2000 to 2007. In 1997, South Korean preschool children were found on average to be 6-7 cm (2-3 in.) taller and about 3 kg (6.6 pounds) heavier than their Northern counterparts; in 2002, the average gap was about 8 cm (3 in.) and 3 kg (6.6 pounds), and the BMI gap was about 1. North Korean boys and girls escaping to South Korea were also found to be on average about 3-4 cm (1-1.6 in.) shorter and 1 kg (2.2 pounds) lighter than their Southern peers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our test is based on the notion that if search decisions are driven purely by statistical discrimination, then they should be independent of officer race. Our results, by contrast, demonstrate that officers are more likely to search if officer race and driver race differ.

The aim of the procedure is two-fold: firstly the method, is to be used as an objective measure for comparing stations in order to detect suboptimal points and improve the performance of stations as nodal points; secondly, the method provides a means to embed intermodality into regional accessibility models, allowing comprehensive modelling at lower scales. The empirical base of the work comprises data from 27 European high speed rail stations, which is deemed an appropriate statistical sample for the whole European rail network. Using the entropy metric, We found that several different patterns emerged: there was a clear hierarchy of stations which was linked to their respective roles within the system, while strong constraints impeded stations from performing optimally as true intermodal nodes.

This paper explores the effects of different oil price assumptions on natural gas markets (production, consumption, prices in different regions) in the International Natural Gas Model (INGM). Three cases from the INGM are presented: a reference case, a high oil price case and a second high oil price case, where gas-to-liquids (GTL) capacity additions are constrained. The results show that regardless of constraints on GTL capacity additions, higher oil prices lead to higher production and consumption of natural gas. However, when GTL capacity is allowed to expand, higher oil prices generally lead to higher natural gas prices and to less gas consumption in the electric power and industrial sectors as they switch to cheaper fuels and more natural gas is diverted to the production of GTLs.",,,,BPepper@icfi.com,,,,,,,10,3,3,0,7,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,,,,,,,55.0,71,,,,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,514JQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271390900006,0

We use the World Gas Model, a dynamic, strategic representation of world gas production, trade, and consumption between 2005 and 2030. In particular, we simulate a closer cooperation of the GASPEC countries when exporting pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas; we also run a more drastic scenario where GASPEC countries deliberately hold back production. The results show that compared to our Base Case, a gas cartel would reduce total supplied quantities and induce price increases in gas importing countries up to 22%. There is evidence that the natural gas markets in Europe and North America would be affected more than other parts of the world. Lastly, the vulnerability of gas importers worldwide is further illustrated by the results of a sensitivity case in which price levels are up to 87% higher in Europe and North America.","[Egging, Ruud; Gabriel, Steven A.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Holz, Franziska; von Hirschhausen, Christian] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [von Hirschhausen, Christian] Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Energy Econ & Publ Sector Management, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Gabriel, Steven A.] Univ Maryland, Appl Math & Sci Computat Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Technische Universitat Dresden; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Egging, R (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1143 Glenn L Martin Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",regging@umd.edu,"Egging-Bratseth, Ruud/AAF-3005-2020","Egging-Bratseth, Ruud/0000-0002-5061-636X",National Science Foundation [DMS 0408943]; Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),This paper is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant DMS 0408943 for co-authors one and four.

A dissenting view,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,American school; data construction; Harvard school,INTERNATIONAL-ORGANIZATION; JOURNALS,"This article challenges three aspects of the 'American' school of international political economy (IPE) as presented by Benjamin Cohen and further elaborated by Dan Maliniak and Michael Tierney in this special issue. First, I question whether their depiction of the field is accurate. What they describe is not so much the 'American' school of IPE, but the 'Harvard' school. IPE in America is a rich and varied enterprise; not so the 'Harvard' school. Second, and unfortunately, IPE in America is also highly centralized and hierarchical, and this gives the 'Harvard' school enormous latitude to influence the self-depiction of the field and in some ways also its trajectory. This is not healthy, either for IPE scholarship in America or beyond. Finally, notwithstanding the power and authority of the 'Harvard' school, we outside of America cannot abandon IPE to its grip. My suggested course of action is to continue engaging with those of our colleagues (both within and outside of this school) who are receptive to the wide-ranging pursuit of knowledge and who recognize that IPE is a field defined by its subject matter rather than by its commitment to a particular methodology.","Carleton Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Germain, RD (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",,,"Germain, Randall/0000-0003-2632-7784",,,,,13,8,11,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

A general principal is to reduce a noise (more precisely, a white noise) in data by means of e.g. stochastic processes, kernel regressions, integral transforms, wavelet transforms, or even fuzzy filters. Without applying such a method the data set would be deformed by a noise so that the resulting interpretation might be problematic or, what would be worse, misleading, Moreover, a construction of valuable models from such data is also complicated. In this paper we propose and apply a relatively new and more or less simple approach to filter a noise from data - the fuzzy transform (F-transform) originally introduced in Perfilieva [6]. More particularly, we will introduce a filter using the direct and inverse F-transform and show that the filtered data have a smaller noise, i.e., the variance of the random variable describing a filtered data noise is smaller than the variance of the random variable expressing an original data noise. Finally, the proposed filter is illustrated with the aim to estimate the probability distribution function of financial market returns.","[Holcapek, Michal; Tichy, Tomas] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dep Finance, Dep Math Methods Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,michal.holcapek@vsb.cz; tomas.tichy@vsb.cz,"Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021; Holcapek, Michal/AAV-9459-2021","Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330;",,,,,6,0,0,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,131.0,137,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900023,0

In the present study, it has aimed to use the forest by using a special function of such a forest gas for man's promotion of health. In the text, to confirm the influence that the forest gas exerted on man as part of this research, an experimental research was done. First of all, we analyzed the gas generated from the forest with the analysis of the mass of the gas chromatograph device. The principal ingredient of the forest gas was different according to the wood species. A lot of alpha pinenes and limonenes were generated from the evergreen, and a lot of limonenes were generated from the deciduous tree. These gases are called terpenoid, and have the shape that isoprene condensed. In general, a peculiar, strong smell is discharged. Carotenoid, steroid, and vitamin A are compounds that belong to this. As a result, we clarified the influence that specific and the element of the chemical composition of the gas where the forest was generated exerted on man's psychology and the body. Next, the influence that the gas of the forest exerted on man's psychology used and examined semantic D method. It is a method that the testee answers the impression received from the environment with the questionnaire form in the forest.

EU member states have been encouraged to increase labour market flexibility while maintaining security through the promotion of 'employability' and an 'adequate' floor of unemployment benefits. The economic crisis that erupted in 2008 has, however, provided flexicurity measures with a strenuous test. As this article demonstrates, those countries that have maintained relatively strong employment protections have tended to experience fewer labour market disruptions than countries with weaker employment protections. The article also suggests that while there has been some convergence in employment and social protection policy across Europe, the trend has been towards less security rather than 'flexicurity'.","Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Heyes, J (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Univ House,Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",j.heyes@bham.ac.uk,,"Heyes, Jason/0000-0002-6937-3441",,,,,37,84,90,1,63,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Despite this empirical evidence, the view that the poor are less healthy in terms of excess accumulation of fat persists. This paper provides evidence that conventional wisdom is reflecting important differences in the relationship between income and the body mass index. The first finding is based on distribution-sensitive measures of overweight which indicates that the severity of overweight has been higher for the poor than the nonpoor throughout the last 35 years. The second finding is from a newly introduced estimator, unconditional quantile regression (UQR), which provides a measure of the income-gradient in BMI at different points on the unconditional BMI distribution. The UQR estimator indicates that the strongest relationship between income and BMI is observed at the tails of the distribution. There is a statistically significant negative income gradient in BMI at the obesity threshold and some evidence of a positive gradient at the underweight threshold. Both of these UQR estimates imply that for those at the tails of the BMI distribution, increases in income are correlated with healthier BMI values. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the literature on input legitimacy, one would expect the Commission to seek to achieve balance across Member States and across diffuse and specific interests. Based on the literature on European integration which argues the EU has preferentially supported Euro groups, one would expect the Commission to support groups that promote pan-Europeanism and are organized at the European Union (EU) level. The data analysis shows that groups which promote a European identity, democracy and civic engagement and intercultural exchange, as well as those that are organized at the EU level, receive stronger support from the Commission. Additionally, groups based in the old Member States of western Europe receive significantly more funding than those in central and eastern Europe.

In contrast, when the rate of impatience is determined by the aggregate labour supply, multiple steady may exist, and the equilibrium dynamics may exhibit (local or global) indeterminacy and complex behaviour.","Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Stat & Matemat Appl Econ, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Sodini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Stat & Matemat Appl Econ, Via Cosimo Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",m.sodini@ec.unipi.it,"Sodini, Mauro/R-1776-2016","Sodini, Mauro/0000-0002-8237-8941",,,,,18,2,3,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

These projections are based on countries' initial situations, and are conditioned on the implementation of reforms and policy measures agreed in the context of programs. In this paper, we examine the accuracy of projections in 291 programs approved in the period 1993-2009. We focus on the projections of three macroeconomic variables (the ratios of the fiscal surplus to GDP and of external current account surplus to GDP, and real GDP growth) during the years immediately following the initiation of an IMF-supported program. We identify several potential reasons for divergence of projected from actual values: (i) mismeasured data on initial conditions; (ii) country-specific differences in forming projections, (iii) projections that do not reflect the dynamic time-series process of the actual data; (iv) policy forecast error; and (v) random errors in the actual data. Our data analysis suggests that the incomplete information on initial conditions and the country-specific differences in projection error are the largest contributors to discrepancies between projection and actual. We also consider whether the IMF's forecasts have gotten more accurate in recent years; there is evidence that they have for the shortest horizons, but the quantitative impact on forecast error is small.","[Conway, Patrick] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Atoyan, Ruben] Int Monetary Fund, European Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; International Monetary Fund,"Conway, P (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",patrick_conway@unc.edu,,"Atoyan, Ruben/0000-0002-3833-2639",,,,,26,7,9,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

This was motivated by an example in which some standard evaluation procedures using probability integral transforms cannot distinguish the ideal forecast from several competing forecasts. We show that this example has some unrealistic features from a time series forecasting perspective, and so provides insecure foundations for the argument that existing calibration procedures are inadequate in practice. Our alternative, more realistic example shows how relevant statistical methods, including information-based methods, provide the required discrimination between competing forecasts.

Paying particular attention to lines of business most accessible to adults lacking college credentials and substantial personal net worth, the authors' analysis yields no evidence that financial capital constraints are a significant barrier to small-firm creation.","[Bates, Timothy] Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Lofstrom, Magnus] Publ Policy Inst Calif, San Francisco, CA USA; [Servon, Lisa J.] New Sch Univ, New York, NY USA",Wayne State University; The New School,"Bates, T (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, 5050 Gullen Mall, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",tbates7893@gmail.com,"Bates, Timothy C/C-9637-2010",,,,,,29,17,28,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Population registers and personal cards covering the period from 1850 to 2004 for all Dutch provinces were used to reconstruct individual life histories of 14,900 births. For men we did not find an effect of the social class of origin (using two different SES-classifications) on mortality in age group 18 to 35. We also did not observe an effect of own social class on mortality after age 35. For women effects of social class of origin and social class of husband were generally absent as well.

Seventy-five years after the seminal Greenshields model, a variety of models have been proposed to mathematically represent the speed-density relationship which underlies the fundamental diagram. Observed in these models was a clear path toward two competing goals: mathematical elegance and empirical accuracy. As the latest development of such a pursuit, this paper presents a family of speed-density models with varying numbers of parameters. All of these models perform satisfactorily and have physically meaningful parameters. In addition, speed variation with traffic density is accounted for; this enables statistical approaches to traffic flow analysis. The results of this paper not only improve our understanding of traffic flow but also provide a sound basis for transportation engineering studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

After the Second World War Albania made extreme political choices and undertook radical agrarian reforms. These reforms were primarily driven by the socialist ideology and later by the liberal one. However, another limited reform was already made in the early twentieth century. The aim of this paper is to compare the characteristics of these land reforms issued in Albania during the period 1930-1990, to analyze their impact on agricultural production structures and the degree of land tenure security for farmers. In particular the paper tends to demonstrate that these agrarian reforms, instead of reaching their goal, namely improving the conditions of the rural population and ensuring social peace, have produced the opposite effect by increasing land conflict and land tenure insecurity and decreasing the efficiency of land us.","[Guri, Fatmir] Univ Agr Tirana, Tirana, Albania; [Civici, Adrian] Univ Europeenne Tirana, Tirana, Albania; [Jouve, Anne-Marie] IAM Montpellier, Montpellier, France",CIHEAM; CIHEAM IAM Montpellier,"Guri, F (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Tirana, Tirana, Albania.",,,,,,,,23,5,5,0,3,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2011,10.0,1,,,,,25.0,34,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,742HB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288930800004,0

There is a positive association between socioeconomic position (SEP) and height with lower SEP individuals being shorter. Height varies across the 29 Indian states even after accounting for individual differences in SEP, with substantial variation in height remaining at the neighborhood and state levels. Among men, height appears to have modestly increased for all birth cohorts as compared to the 1961-1965 cohort, with smaller increases for the most recent cohorts. For women, height across birth cohorts has shown little increase. These results suggest that inequalities in several health outcomes for low SEP adults may be reflected in inequalities in height, which can be used to represent long-term health at the population level. Shorter stature and slower growth among some groups may indicate that they did not experience the improvements that were assumed to have occurred across the population. This study presents a comprehensive, empirical description of mean height differences and the underlying variation among adults in India across diverse socioeconomic, demographic, and geographically oriented groups as well as birth cohorts.

The Sustainable Rural Development Index increases year over year and varies according to the area. The Rural Economic Development Index is low compared to the Human and Social Development Index, which explains a significant rural migration in the region. The Employment Structuring Index in rural areas show a certain fragility confirmed by a significant number of temporary work. The agricultural development index remains low despite the vocation of the region; this is ascribable to a prolonged aridity and inadequate means. The Environment Development index is hard to measure in the field.

In finance, ITS can describe the temporal evolution of the high and low prices of an asset throughout time. These price intervals are related to the concept of volatility and are worth considering in order to place buy or sell orders. This article reviews two approaches to forecast ITS. On the one hand, the first approach consists of using univariate or multivariate forecasting methods. The possible cointegrating relation between the high and low values is analyzed for multivariate models and the equivalence of the VAR models is shown for the minimum and the maximum time series, as well as for the center and radius time series. On the other hand, the second approach adapts classic forecasting methods to deal with ITS using interval arithmetic. These methods include exponential smoothing, the k-NN algorithm and the multilayer perceptron. The performance of these approaches is studied in two financial ITS. As a result, evidences of the predictability of the ITS are found, especially in the interval range. This fact opens a new path in volatility forecasting.","[Arroyo, Javier] Univ Complutense, Fac Informat, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Espinola, Rosa] Univ Complutense, Escuela Univ Estadist, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Mate, Carlos] Univ Pontificia Comillas, Inst Invest Tecnol, Madrid 28015, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid; Comillas Pontifical University,"Arroyo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense, Fac Informat, Prof Jose Garcia Santesmases S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",javier.arroyo@fdi.ucm.es,"Espínola, Rosa/I-2908-2015; Mate, Carlos/T-8296-2017; Arroyo, Javier/K-3353-2014","Mate, Carlos/0000-0003-2840-2629; Espinola Vilchez, Rosa/0000-0003-2336-3659; Arroyo, Javier/0000-0001-6127-7538",Universidad Pontificia Comillas; Spanish Council for Science and Innovation [TIN2008-06464-C03-01]; Programa de Creacion y Consolidacion de Grupos de Investigacion UCM-BSCH [GR58/08],Universidad Pontificia Comillas; Spanish Council for Science and Innovation; Programa de Creacion y Consolidacion de Grupos de Investigacion UCM-BSCH,"The authors acknowledge support from the Project Forecasting Models for Symbolic Data (PRESIM) funded by Universidad Pontificia Comillas.

However, recent literature based on cross-country regressions has claimed that more educated migrants remit less, leading to concerns that further increases in skilled migration will impede remittance growth. Microdata from surveys of immigrants in 11 major destination countries are used to revisit the relationship between education and remitting behavior. The data show a mixed pattern between education and the likelihood of remitting, and a strong positive relationship between education and amount remitted (intensive margin), conditional on remitting at all (extensive margin).

We make individuals reflect on fairness, in a structured way, before they play the dictator game. Our results suggest that moral reflection not only increases the weight people attach to fairness in distributive choices, but also has a strong effect on what people consider fair. Furthermore, we study the informational value of self-reported data. We find that self-reported data have substantial informational value, but do not add explanatory power to a random utility model estimated on purely behavioral data. Finally, we study whether there is a self-serving bias in the participants' fairness perceptions, but do not find much evidence of this phenomenon in the data.","[Cappelen, Alexander W.; Sorensen, Erik O.; Tungodden, Bertil] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Hole, Astri Drange] Bergen Univ Coll, Dept Econ, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Sorensen, Erik O.] Univ Oslo, ESOP, N-0851 Oslo, Norway; [Tungodden, Bertil] Chr Michelsen Inst, N-5892 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Western Norway University of Applied Sciences; University of Oslo,"Tungodden, B (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",alexander.cappelen@nhh.no; astri.drange.hole@hib.no; erik.sorensen@nhh.no; bertil.tungodden@nhh.no,"CAPPELEN, ALEXANDER/AAY-1676-2021","Sorensen, Erik O./0000-0002-7155-4188",,,,,32,13,14,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2011,36.0,1,,,,,105.0,120,,10.1007/s00355-010-0468-3,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,695JA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285365200007,0

Contrary to a common view in the literature, we show that lending to the king was profitable even under worst-case scenario assumptions. Lenders maintained long-term relationships with the crown. Losses sustained during defaults were more than compensated by profits in normal times. Defaults were not catastrophic events. In effect, short-term lending acted as an insurance mechanism, allowing the king to reduce his payments in harsh times in exchange for paying a premium in tranquil periods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Based on Monte Carlo experiments, we conclude that if the data generating process (DGP) is an AR(1), MA(1) or ARMA(1, 1) process, with moderate parameter values, the periodogram, GPH, QML, and modified R/S methods, followed by the DFA, MDFA, and CMA ones, perform reasonably well as regards with bias, although some of these techniques exhibit a non-negligible size distortion. Moreover, the QML, the periodogram, DFA, MDFA, and CMA methods overall provide with powerful and low-bias estimators, under alternative ARFIMA (p, d, q)-DGPs. The wavelet-based estimator in turn has high power, but it is noticeably upward (downward) biased when the autoregressive (moving-average) coefficient of the DGP is large. Our Monte Carlo experiments are complemented with an application to Dow Jones AIG Gold Sub-index data, by means of bootstrap re-sampling.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Fernandez, V (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.",vfernandez@ing.puc.cl,"Fernandez, Viviana/HSE-4822-2023; Fernandez, Viviana/R-8935-2019","Fernandez, Viviana/0000-0003-4726-2174; Fernandez, Viviana/0000-0003-4726-2174",,,,,38,5,5,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

What have been the roots of these deficient rules, particularly in Europe, where rapid spill-over from US markets took policy makers and observers by surprise? This article focuses on regulatory liberalism as the paradigm guiding European Union (EU) regulation. It has dominated regulatory thinking for decades, but it has been implemented throughout Europe only since the mid-1990s. This shift can be traced to political institutions that have filtered policy ideas. EU financial reforms have pushed policy from pragmatism, under which it was adapted to political contingencies, to dogmatism, which adapts it to the intellectual exigencies of rigid policy paradigms. Inadvertently, reforms had created an epistemic community in which 'professional' rule setters systematically ignored external criticisms. The institutionalised ambition to craft 'intellectually sound' policy-rather than policy that simply 'works' -generated rules that persistently ignored the financial markets' self-reflexivity and thereby aggravated the crisis.","Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, NL-1012 DL Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Mügge, D (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Oudezijds Achterburgwal 237, NL-1012 DL Amsterdam, Netherlands.",D.K.Muegge@uva.nl,,"Mugge, Daniel/0000-0001-9408-7597",,,,,104,44,45,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

There have, however, been few, if any, attempts to understand the distinctive features of this disorder from within the social sciences. Rather, the increasing prevalence of all forms of eating disorders are understood as a product of how the concepts of 'femininity' and the 'controlled body' are constructed within contemporary society. Bulimia and anorexia are ultimately seen to have their roots in the same social phenomena. While recognising the insights that the existing literature offers, we argue that in order to fully understand the rise of bulimia we must focus on the food system. More precisely, we must examine how the commercialisation of food preparation has led to a partial breakdown in meal structures and the rise of 'everyday' bingeing. The rise of extreme forms of disordered consumption associated with bulimia can be related to broader changes in the eating regime.","Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Pirie, I (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",i.j.pirie@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,87,3,5,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Yet commentators at the time faulted the financial press for inaccuracy and biases, which they linked to the existence of payments made by companies for coverage in the editorial section. This article tests whether the payment scheme induced a systematic bias in the coverage of companies listed on the Paris stock exchanges by newspapers. The results show that, although firms' media coverage was affected, the performance of firms actually touted by the press was good. Thus, the media bias can also be explained by newspapers choosing the companies' exposures according to their editorial policy.","[Bignon, Vincent] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Dept HPI, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland; [Bignon, Vincent] EconomiX Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Paris, France; [Miscio, Antonio] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Bignon, V (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Dept HPI, Rue Lausanne 132,Case Postale 136, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland.",vincent.bignon@graduateinstitute.ch; antoniomiscio@gmail.com,"Bignon, Vincent/JYP-2587-2024",,,,,,70,17,19,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

In this article, we first present a simple model of search behavior that includes the seller setting a list price. Holding constant the mean of the buyers' distribution of potential offers for a good, we assume that the greater the list price, the slower the arrival rate of offers but the greater is the maximal offer. This trade-off determines the optimal list price, which is set simultaneously with the seller's reservation price. Comparative statics are derived through a set of numerical sensitivity tests, where we show that the greater the variance of the distribution of buyers' potential offers, the greater is the ratio of the list price to expected sales price. Thus, sellers of atypical goods will tend to set a relatively high list price compared with standard goods. We test this hypothesis using data from the Columbus, Ohio, housing market and find substantial support. We also find empirical support for another hypothesis of the model: atypical dwellings take longer to sell.","[Haurin, Donald R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Nadauld, Taylor] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Finance, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Sanders, Anthony] George Mason Univ, Dept Finance, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Brigham Young University; George Mason University,"Haurin, DR (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",Hau-rin.2@osu.edu; jhaurin@alum.mit.edu; Nadauld_1@cob.osu.edu,", Don/AAI-8422-2020",,,,,,20,54,62,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2010,38.0,4,,,,,659.0,685,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00279.x,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,682VN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284431200003,0

Services are of particular interest since their significance has grown in terms of both quantity and quality. Only one and a half decades ago, most services were considered non-tradable, but the emergence and development of new information and communication technologies has made many services internationally tradable. The liberalisation of international trade in services trade has further accelerated the volume of services trade. Our econometric estimations focus on services offshoring by German manufacturing sectors. We use revised input-output data from 1995 to 2006. We first estimate the impact of services offshoring on labour productivity. We then measure the effects of services offshoring on labour demand. The results show that services offshoring increased sectoral labour productivity, but reduced German manufacturing employment. The overall results suggest that labour demand decreased over 1995-2006, because labour-reducing productivity and substitution effects dominated labour-augmenting scale effects from services offshoring.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Winkler, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,30,36,42,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2010,33.0,12,,,,,1672.0,1701,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01269.x,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,700SN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285764700002,0

It took several weeks for the network to re-equilibrate, during which period travelers continued to learn and adjust their travel decisions. A good understanding of this process is crucial for traffic management and the design of mitigation schemes. Data from loop-detectors, bus ridership statistics, and a survey are analyzed and compared, revealing the evolving traffic reactions to the bridge collapse and how individual choices could help to explain such dynamics. Findings on short-term traffic dynamics and behavioral reactions to this major network disruption have important implications for traffic management in response to future scenarios.

In doing so, two benchmark cases (i) equal distribution, and (ii) agglomeration in the sense of a core-periphery structure as well as the corresponding transition processes are discussed. Integration is understood as enhancing inter-territorial cooperation and it describes the extent to which one region may benefit from the other region's public input. Both integration and the characteristics of the public input crucially affect whether or not agglomeration arises and hence to which extent economic activity is concentrated. Key results are: Intensifying integration reduces the strengths of agglomeration forces and the corresponding degree of concentration will be lower. Relative congestion leads to an overestimation of capital returns and capital growth in the core region is faster due to congestion thereby leading to suboptimally high concentration.

The propensity score matching method is used to adjust for observable differences of firm characteristics between exporters and non-exporters, allowing an adequate 'like-for-like' comparison.

I test this model using time series data.

The model assumes that a decision maker uses, sequentially, two criteria to screen options. Each criterion only permits a decision between some pairs of options, while the other options are incomparable according to that criterion. When the first criterion is not decisive, the decision maker resorts to the second criterion to select an alternative. We find that: (1) traditional economic models based on discounting alone cannot explain a significant (almost 30%) proportion of the data no matter how much variability in the discount functions is allowed; (2) our model, despite considering only a specific (exponential) form of discounting, can explain the data much better solely thanks to the use of the secondary criterion; (3) our model explains certain specific patterns in the choices of the irrational people. We reject the hypothesis that anomalous behavior is due simply to random mistakes around the basic predictions of discounting theories: deviations are not random and there are clear systematic patterns of association between irrational choices.","[Manzini, Paola; Mariotti, Marco] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland; [Manzini, Paola; Mariotti, Marco] IZA, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland; [Mittone, Luigi] Univ Trent, Dept Econ, I-38100 Trento, Italy",University of St Andrews; University of St Andrews; University of Trento,"Manzini, P (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",Paola.Manzini@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Manzini, Paola/N-5205-2015","Manzini, Paola/0000-0001-5474-0512; Mariotti, Marco/0000-0002-5308-5154; Mittone, Luigi/0000-0001-6521-7698",,,,,28,18,19,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2010,69.0,3,,,,,327.0,354,,10.1007/s11238-010-9214-7,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,627WL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280074600001,0

Although the ultimate aim is still to ensure the integration of candidate countries, the timing and modality of membership is not guaranteed in advance. This article utilizes a political economy model to demonstrate that open-ended accession negotiations would lead to suboptimal outcomes in the form of inadequate convergence reforms undertaken in the candidate country and poor membership prospect offered by the EU. This analytical finding is compatible with and can be useful in understanding the dynamics of deteriorating reform output in Turkey and weakening EU commitment to Turkish membership since the start of the open-ended accession negotiations process in 2005. Two necessary conditions must be satisfied to overcome such adverse outcomes in the enlargement process: (i) the EU and the accession country must renew their commitments to reform and integration through a new political bargain; and (ii) they should follow this bargain with periodic summits for co-ordinating their commitments in the face of shocks to, or emerging deadlocks in, the process of open-ended accession negotiations.","Univ Greenwich, London SE18 6PF, England",University of Greenwich,"Ugur, M (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, London SE18 6PF, England.",m.ugur@gre.ac.uk,"Ugur, Mehmet/AAG-5018-2019","Ugur, Mehmet/0000-0003-3891-3641",,,,,37,23,25,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Toward this understanding, we develop a model that integrates sticky prices and sticky information-a dual-stickiness model. We find that both rigidities are present in U. S. data. We also show that the dual-stickiness model's closest competitor is the hybrid New Keynesian model. For both models, current inflation depends in part on last period's inflation. The former model achieves this dependence endogenously through the interaction of the two rigidities rather than through backward-looking behavior. U.S. data support the dual-stickiness model over the hybrid model because lagged expectations terms appear in the former's inflation Euler equation. Finally, we show that it is quantitatively important to distinguish between the two by simulating a dynamic equilibrium model under each of the two inflation equations.","[Dupor, Bill] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Tsuruga, Takayuki] Kansai Univ, Suita, Osaka, Japan",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Kansai University,"Dupor, B (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,"Tsuruga, Takayuki/S-2151-2019; Dupor, William/I-5742-2016","Tsuruga, Takayuki/0000-0002-8177-2330; Dupor, William/0000-0002-2407-2792",,,,,35,34,38,0,9,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Participating CBOs respond to the financial needs of their diverse communities primarily in three ways: (a) adapting programs for the underserved, (b) facilitating access to the mainstream, and (c) preserving existing assets. Unlike mainstream banks, they use a comprehensive asset-building framework premised on extensive technical assistance and culturally congruent programming. The interviewed organizations face a variety of challenges in implementing programs-namely, maintaining financial solvency and working with limited capacity-issues that they struggle to overcome through forming collaborations and partnerships, earned income strategies, obtaining certification, and cross-training.","[Pfeiffer, Deirdre; Ong, Paul] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Patraporn, RV (通讯作者)，1st 5 LA,750 N Alameda St,Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90012 USA.",varisap@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,12,13,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

J,"Lockwood, B; Whalley, J",,,,"Lockwood, Ben; Whalley, John",,,Carbon-motivated Border Tax Adjustments: Old Wine in Green Bottles?,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"(1285) Ben Lockwood and John Whalley We discuss emerging proposals for border tax adjustments (BTAs) to accompany commitments to reduce carbon emissions in the EU, the US and other OECD economies. The rationale offered for such border adjustment is that various entities, such as the EU, if making commitments to reduce emissions which go beyond those undertaken in other regions of the world, impose added costs on domestic producers which create a competitive disadvantage for them. Some form of remedy is viewed as reasonable to maintain the competitiveness of domestic industries when responding to global environmental problems. In this paper, we argue that despite its current carbon manifestation, the issue of border tax adjustments and both their rationale and their effects on trade are not new and, despite the present debate (which seems to overlook older literature), have arisen before. Earlier debate on border tax adjustments occurred at the time of the adoption of the value-added tax (VAT) in the EU as a tax harmonisation target in the early 1960s. But academic literature of the time showed that a change between origin and destination basis in the VAT would be neutral and hence the use of a destination-based tax in the EU to accompany the VAT offered no trade advantage to Europe. Here we argue that essentially the same arguments also apply for carbon-motivated BTAs, and in the current debate there seems to be a misconception between price-level effects and relative price effects stemming from a BTA, which needs correcting. We also argue that the impact of border tax adjustments should be viewed as independent of the motivation of the adjustments.","[Lockwood, Ben] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Whalley, John] China Agr Univ, NBER, CIGI, Univ Western Ontario, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Warwick; China Agricultural University,"Lockwood, B (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",,,,ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,19,42,48,4,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2010,33.0,6,,,,,810.0,819,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01285.x,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,604ZL,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278316900002,0

We find a negative effect of housing deprivation on the individuals' health, both when housing conditions are introduced in a disaggregated manner in the model and when they are combined in a latent variable.","[Ayala, Luis] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Madrid 28032, Spain; [Navarro, Carolina; Labeaga, Jose M.] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Ayala, L (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.",cnavarro@cee.uned.es; luis.ayala@urjc.es; jlabeaga@cee.uned.es,"Ayala, Luis/AAA-2231-2019; Ayala, Luis/ABF-8664-2021","NAVARRO RUIZ, CAROLINA/0000-0003-4052-4098; Ayala, Luis/0000-0002-3141-827X",,,,,47,26,27,3,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Direct government expenditure shocks are found to increase output and private consumption on impact. The output multiplier is smaller than one and is falling rather quickly reaching zero after 3 years. Government operating expenditure has sizeable positive effects on output, in the long run in particular due to public capital formation. Compensation of public employees is not effective in stimulating the economy. Government net revenue shocks do not affect output significantly. Indirect taxes have little effects, while direct taxes lower output significantly.

Using census data this article examines the occupational distribution of immigrants by country of origin and whether immigrants displace native workers from jobs. In the period studied it seems that immigrant workers have relieved bottlenecks in the labour market and have been complementary rather than substitutes for native workers. Between 2002 and 2006 the proportion of immigrants employed in high-skill jobs decreased while the number in low-skill jobs increased substantially. Compared to Irish nationals the possession of education qualifications for immigrants, particularly those from the 10 new EU member states, does not appear to confer the same advantages. The evidence here indicates a significant degree of occupational downgrading and 'brain waste' among non-nationals.","Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Personnel & Employment Relat, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Turner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Personnel & Employment Relat, Limerick, Ireland.",tom.turner@ul.ie,,,,,,,36,29,32,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Based on detailed analyses of data on institutional ownership, performance, CEO and board characteristics over the 10 year period 1998-2007, we find significant evidence that large institutions influence governance through CEO compensation-greater institutional ownership is associated with greater emphasis on incentive-based compensation (higher pay-performance sensitivity of CEO compensation), and higher cash and total compensation for CEOs. Further, we find that institutions are less active when managers are performing in a superior fashion. Two important conclusions emerge from the analysis. First, similar to unregulated firms, institutional owners do act as monitors in REITs. Broadly, this result suggests that governance is necessary for REITs. Second, institutional investors set a high pay-performance sensitivity for CEOs, but are willing to pay higher cash compensation to induce managers to take risk.","[Feng, Zhilan] Union Grad Coll, Sch Management, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA; [Ghosh, Chinmoy; He, Fan] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, Storrs, CT 06268 USA; [Sirmans, C.

At the micro level, banks that are politically connected are larger and more profitable than other banks, despite being less leveraged and having less risk. At the country level, this connectedness is strongly negatively related to economic development. Controlling for this, the analysis finds that the phenomenon is more prevalent where institutions are weaker and governments more powerful but less accountable.

This paper analyses and compares how this idea of the law affects Wagner's theorisation of state-economy interaction and his insights into public economics.","[Solari, Stefano] Univ Padua, Dept Econ, I-35123 Padua, Italy; [Corado, Daniele] Fac Law, I-31100 Treviso, Italy",University of Padua,"Solari, S (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",d.corrado@giuri.unipd.it; stefano.solari@unipd.it,,,,,,,46,5,5,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Using hourly Nordic electricity spot market prices, I find that the value of short-term response of electricity prices to a shock in CO2 prices in off-peak hours is consistent with expected values for near complete pass-through of CO2 emission costs when coal-generated power is at the margin. Likewise, the estimates reveal that peak hour electricity price responses to CO2 price shocks are as expected for a market that has near complete pass-through of CO2 emission costs when natural gas-generated power is at the margin.

J,"Forte, F",,,,"Forte, Francesco",,,SERGIO STEVE AS A PUBLIC ECONOMIST,HISTORY OF ECONOMIC IDEAS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The author examines the thought and mission of Sergio Steve (1915-2006) as a leading public economics scholar of the 'transition generation' before and after World War II. The theorization of Steve is viewed mainly through his portraits of the economists with whom he was most familiar: Keynes, De Viti de Marco, Einaudi and Griziotti. The theory developed by Steve may be defined as a De Viti-Keynesian (or rather, a Keynesian-De Vitian) macroeconomic theory. Steve's peculiar interpretation of Keynes leads him to emphasize the limits and risks of deficit spending. On the other hand, Steve's scepticism towards an approach in terms of public choice based on individual preferences in fiscal economics emerges both when he analyses the theoretical contributions of Pantaleoni and Black and when he contrasts the 'economic' approach of Einaudi with that of Griziotti in terms of political decisions. Steve prefers an approach a la De Viti, based on the alternation of different political groups (parties) in power. Steve's 'realism' regarding the choice of the types of taxation emerges in his analysis of the different tax models of Einaudi and Griziotti. The critical and problematic stance of Steve is best depicted by his approval of Gustavo Del Vecchio's dynamic perspective, which allows for the probabilistic nature of the economic theories and consequently for their fragmentation. This approach involves the impossibility of erecting a (completely closed) general theory, positive and/or normative.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Forte, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

First, the existing literature on East Asian regionalism has treated China as a strategic unitary actor. Second, Chinese policy elites claim that China is exceptional for its 'big country morality' of seeking to provide agreements that benefit smaller countries. What drives China's trade policy in the 'post-WTO' era? More precisely, does China, as a state ruled by a Communist Party, have different factors affecting its FTA policy-making than do other states? Is China pursuing FTAs 'with Chinese characteristics': are the motivations behind China's FTAs different from those of other countries? The research presented in this paper finds that China's FTA policymaking process involves a lot of bargaining and is particularly affected by the relative weakening of liberalizing forces vis-a-vis protectionist ones after the WTO accession. Moreover, the effectiveness of economic diplomacy is affected by coordination problems between economic and political sections within the government. Although China has a few motivations that go beyond what drives other countries to FTAs, those expectations are either difficult to realize or not very useful even if realized.","Asia Res Ctr, Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Jiang, Y (通讯作者)，Asia Res Ctr, Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",,,,,,,,79,31,35,3,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It offers an explanation of the social processes of 'value creation and capture' within a chain based on the system-wide motion of global capital accumulation. A firm connection is thus established between the particular dynamics internal to each industry and the general dynamics of the 'system as a whole', which is, precisely, where the greatest weakness of the GVC approach lies. Furthermore, the usefulness of those general theoretical insights is then shown through a more empirical discussion of recent transformations in the composition and governance structure of GVC resulting from two interrelated processes: the tendency for a growing de-linking between innovation and manufacturing and the rise of highly concentrated global contractors. These phenomena have paradigmatically developed in the electronics industry, giving rise to the formation of the so-called modular or turnkey production networks.

It shows how contestations of the European Union have, to some extent, been driven by strategic considerations related to inter-party competition. In Poland's fluid party landscape, political actors have sometimes relied on Euroscepticism to create seemingly clear lines of division between themselves and their political competitors. Yet these Eurosceptic views interact with, and are therefore also constrained by, certain legacies: ideas on the relationship between Europe and Poland that are already part of the cultural context.","Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Int & European Policy, BE-3000 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Vermeersch, P (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Int & European Policy, Pk Str 45 Bus 3602, BE-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",peter.vermeersch@soc.kuleuven.be,"Vermeersch, Peter/A-6938-2010","Vermeersch, Peter/0000-0002-8326-7557",,,,,37,5,5,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2010,62.0,3,,,,,503.0,522,,10.1080/09668131003647853,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,593BA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277425300006,0

Home prices are lower in cities with higher ambient pollution levels, and the marginal valuation for green amenities is rising over time. Cities featuring higher per-capita FDI flows have lower pollution levels.

This case study reports on the quality of seafarer training and on the local enforcement of international training standards in a developing country which has become a major supplier of outsourced seafarer labour. Maritime education and training institutions (METs) cannot compete freely to supply quality training at competitive prices because of the market-fixing activities of the crewing agencies who demand kickbacks from the METs. Other pressures on training quality include the existence of papermill METs (issuing certificates without training) and a developed market in forged certificates. This poses a considerable challenge for the national institutions charged with overseeing examinations and inspecting METs. The struggle to achieve effective governance of the training of outsourced labour in the shipping industry may arguably be viewed as a critical case for other globalizing industries.,"[Bloor, Michael; Sampson, Helen] Cardiff Univ, Seafarers Int Res Ctr, Sch Social Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Bloor, M (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Seafarers Int Res Ctr, Sch Social Sci, 52 Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.",BloorMJ@cf.ac.uk; SampsonH@cf.ac.uk,"Sampson, Helen/AAU-8005-2020","Sampson, Helen/0000-0002-5857-9452",,,,,39,34,40,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We motivate and demonstrate the application of latent class models to measure social capital, based on the idea that social capital is an unobservable multidimensional construct. We explain and show the construction of latent classes that measure an individual's social capital using data from the General Social Survey. Our method generates meaningfully different conclusions about the accumulation of social capital than those obtained by previous research. We present evidence that higher income influences social capital accumulation because of a higher opportunity cost of time. We also find evidence of complementarities in social capital accumulation within an individual's peer group. Finally, we show that community heterogeneity influences the likelihood that individuals adhere to certain social norms independent of their propensity to participate in voluntary organizations.","[Owen, Ann L.; Videras, Julio] Hamilton Coll, Clinton, NY 13323 USA",Hamilton College,"Videras, J (通讯作者)，Hamilton Coll, 198 Coll Hill Rd, Clinton, NY 13323 USA.",jvideras@hamilton.edu,,,,,,,30,17,23,1,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Sons of blue-collar fathers and of parents employed in agriculture were generally shorter than sons of clerks and professional employees (teachers, doctors, lawyers).

At the height of the housing boom in 2004, a typical flip produces an annual rate of return exceeding 60%.

First, the better-educated players and players of higher socioeconomic background have better outside opportunities. If they decide to follow a professional soccer career, they must be truly good to compensate their higher opportunity costs. Second, if innate athletic talent is distributed equally among the population, we should not find any difference in the performance evaluation of White and non-White players. This potential difference provides a market test for discrimination. Using data on the Uruguayan Soccer League in the 2000 and 2001 seasons, we find evidence of these two types of selection biases. Our estimations show a positive relationship between education and performance, education and promotions, socioeconomic background and performance, socioeconomic background and promotions, and discrimination against non-White players in the national league but not with respect to international soccer markets.","Univ ORT Uruguay, Dept Econ, Montevideo 11300, Uruguay",University ORT Uruguay,"Gandelman, N (通讯作者)，Univ ORT Uruguay, Dept Econ, Bulevar Espana 2633, Montevideo 11300, Uruguay.",gandelman@ort.edu.uy,,"Gandelman, Nestor/0000-0002-4023-8342",,,,,23,8,9,2,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Moulin (1988) established that every Condorcet voting function suffers from the No Show Paradox, or Abstention Paradox, which means that in some voting situations some voters would achieve a better result by abstaining (in other words, could manipulate the election by abstaining). This problem is similar to that of extending the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem on voting manipulation through casting an insincere ballot to voting correspondences. The main result of the paper states that for every Condorcet voting correspondence there are situations in which every optimistic or pessimistic voter with some preferences could manipulate the election by abstaining. Another result states, by counterexample, that some Condorcet voting correspondences are free from the Abstention Paradox from the point of view of other types of voters.","[Jimeno, Jose L.; Perez, Joaquin; Garcia, Estefania] Univ Alcala, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Fundamentos Econ & Hist Econ, Madrid 28802, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,"Jimeno, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Fundamentos Econ & Hist Econ, Plaza Victoria 3, Madrid 28802, Spain.",josel.jimeno@uah.es; joaquin.perez@uah.es; estefania.garcia@uah.es,,"Jimeno Pastor, Jose Luis/0000-0002-0832-227X",,,,,15,20,20,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2009,33.0,3,,,,,343.0,359,,10.1007/s00355-008-0360-6,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,480YR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268773700001,0

This article hopes to contribute to this young, yet growing body of literature by process-tracing the changes that have occurred in the institutional setup of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Founded during the first oil crisis of 1973-74, the IEA has had to deal with major environmental changes over its lifetime. In response, the agency has diversified away from its original raison d'etre, namely managing an emergency oil sharing mechanism, to become a more proactive policy adviser guiding its member governments toward sustainable energy economies. The article seeks to explain the observed patterns of change and inertia, using a theoretic paradigm that builds on theories of new institutionalism. The paper argues that the agency's institutional flexibility can only be fully explained by taking into account a combination of factors: (1) the member states' choices, in particular the impulses of the G8-members of the IEA; (2) path dependency, especially the institutional link with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); and (3) agency by the secretariat and the executive bureau of the IEA.","[Van de Graaf, Thijs; Lesage, Dries] Univ Ghent, Global Governance Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Van de Graaf, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Global Governance Res Grp, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",thijs.vandegraaf@ugent.be,"Van de Graaf, Thijs/J-5280-2016","Van de Graaf, Thijs/0000-0003-3372-3830",,,,,57,40,44,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

To deal with such situations two alternative sequences of nested dominance criteria between Lorenz curves are introduced. At the limit the systems of dominance criteria appear to depend solely on the income share of either the worst-off or the best-off income recipient. This result suggests two alternative strategies for increasing the number of Lorenz curves that can be strictly ordered; one that places more emphasis on changes that occur in the lower part of the income distribution and the other that places more emphasis on changes that occur in the upper part of the income distribution. Both strategies turn out to depart from the Gini coefficient; one requires higher degree of downside and the other higher degree of upside inequality aversion than what is exhibited by the Gini coefficient. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the sequences of dominance criteria characterize two separate systems of nested subfamilies of inequality measures and thus provide a method for identifying the least restrictive social preferences required to reach an unambiguous ranking of a given set of Lorenz curves. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the introduction of successively more general transfer principles than the Pigou-Dalton principle of transfers forms a helpful basis for judging the normative significance of higher degrees of Lorenz dominance. The dominance results for Lorenz curves do also apply to generalized Lorenz curves and thus provide convenient characterizations of the corresponding social welfare orderings.","Stat Norway, Res Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Aaberge, R (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, POB 8131 Dep, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",rolf.aaberge@ssb.no,,,,,,,39,38,39,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,AUG,2009,33.0,2,,,,,235.0,259,,10.1007/s00355-008-0354-4,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,459NV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267110800003,0

The results show that the number of reverse commuters has significantly increased because the municipality of Paris has lost many jobs but few working residents whilst employment has developed in the suburbs. Reverse commuters are mainly and increasingly high-income professionals whose workplace is located close to the central city in employment sub-centres that are well served by public transport. Consequently reverse commuters have lower than average car use although differences exist and are related to their professional status.

Due to the increasing evidence in many North American cities that the duration of the congested peak travelling periods is expanding (peak spreading), it becomes necessary and natural to investigate these two commuting decisions jointly. In addition to being considered jointly with mode choice decisions, trip timing must also be modelled as a continuous variable in order to precisely capture peak spreading trends in a policy sensitive transportation demand model. However, in the literature to date, these two fundamental decisions have largely been treated separately or in some cases as integrated discrete decisions for joint investigation. In this paper, a discrete-continuous econometric model is used to investigate the joint decisions of trip timing and mode choice for commuting trips in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The joint model, with a multinomial logit model for mode choice and a continuous time hazard model for trip timing, allows for unrestricted correlation between the unobserved factors influencing these two decisions. Models are estimated by occupation groups using 2001 travel survey data for the GTA. Across all occupation groups, strong correlations between unobserved factors influencing mode choice and trip timing are found. Furthermore, the estimated model proves that it sufficiently captures the peak spreading phenomenon and is capable of being applied within the activity-based travel demand model framework.

This is in part a recognition that we may have been undervaluing the cost of fatalities and injuries to society associated with crashes, but also a strong belief in the need to focus on establishing the amount, ex ante, that individuals are willing to pay to reduce the risk of exposure to circumstances that might lead to death or degree of injury on the road network. This study has developed a framework in which to identify the degree of preference heterogeneity in willingness to pay by individuals who are drivers or passengers in cars to avoid being killed or injured. A stated choice experiment approach is developed. The empirical setting is a choice of route for a particular trip that a sample of individuals periodically undertakes in Australia. The particular trip is described in enough detail to provide the respondent with a familiar market environment, providing all the relevant background information required for making a decision. Mixed logit models are estimated to obtain the marginal (dis)utilities associated with each influence on the choice amongst the attribute packages offered in the stated choice scenarios. These estimates are used to obtain the WTP distributions for fatality and injury avoidance, which are then aggregated to obtain estimates of the value of risk reduction (VRR), of which the fatality class is also known as the value of a statistical life (VSL).

The negative relationship between height and depression among males persists after controlling for body mass index (BMI), differences in pubertal timing, and individual fixed effects, but does not explain the effect of height on educational attainment.

EU Commission initiatives are based on the promotion of interdependence through market opening, favouring a policy of competition over security of supply. The reason for this focus is found in the EU's embedded inclination towards liberal markets. Russia, by contrast, has chosen suboptimal state control of natural resources over the frontier capitalism of the 1990s. Sustainability of the current rent based system and geopolitical considerations are essential to Russia and Gazprom. In this situation a pragmatic approach that aims at security of supply and security of demand seems to be more successful.

J,"Jayaraj, D; Subramanian, S",,,,"Jayaraj, D.; Subramanian, S.",,,The wellbeing implications of a change in the sex-ratio of a population,SOCIAL CHOICE AND WELFARE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"It is often the case with socio-economic, or development-related, indicators that these are explicitly in the nature of 'wellbeing' or 'illbeing' indicators, such that increases in their values are routinely interpreted as reflecting 'improvements' or 'deteriorations', as the case may be. The sex-ratio of a population is one such indicator: an over-time reduction in the value of this statistic is generally regarded as pointing to a worsening in the relative wellbeing of women. This paper argues that summary real-valued socio-economic measures are largely in the nature of end-state descriptions, and not always completely reliable guides to the processes underlying their realization. This is also true for the sex-ratio measure. The paper points to the utility of decomposing a given change in the sex-ratio of a population into changes in its constituent and determining factors. In particular, the sex-ratio can be seen to be determined by the prior history of sex-ratios at birth and the prior history of the relative survival advantage of females. The magnitude and direction of changes in these determining factors are pointers to the processes that have mediated the change in the aggregate sex-ratio, and therefore pointers to whether the sex-ratio change-independently of the direction of change-may be interpreted in developmentally favourable or unfavourable terms. The issues underlying these considerations are illustrated through the use of relevant demographic data for India.","[Jayaraj, D.; Subramanian, S.] Madras Inst Dev Studies, Madras 600020, Tamil Nadu, India",,"Jayaraj, D (通讯作者)，Madras Inst Dev Studies, 79 2nd Main Rd, Madras 600020, Tamil Nadu, India.",jayaraj@mids.ac.in; subbu@mids.ac.in,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2009,33.0,1,,,,,129.0,150,,10.1007/s00355-008-0349-1,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,434XV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265308500007,0

For this purpose, panel unit root tests are employed to improve power against univariate counterparts. Since cross section correlation is a distinct feature of the underlying panel data, results are based on various second generation panel unit root tests, which account for cross section dependence among units. If an unobserved common factor model is assumed for generating the observations, there is indication for both a common factor and idiosyncratic components driving the non-stationarity of hours worked.

Our aim was to compare anticipated and actual behavioural reactions to the rail strike, investigate associations with traveller and trip characteristics, and perceived behavioural control and satisfaction with the chosen alternative. Forty-four percent of the people who had anticipated to travel by train on the day of the strike abandoned their trip, 24% switched to car as driver, 14% switched to another mode (as passenger), 18% stayed with the train and rescheduled the planned activity to another day. Almost half of people who had anticipated travelling by car expected to change behaviour as well. Multinomial logistic regression showed low preference for car among rail users. Considerable marginal effects were found for several variables, e.g.: young people and females were less likely to switch to car; short and middle distance trips were less likely abandoned or switched to another day: commute and business trips were more likely done by car, and business trips less likely cancelled. Despite high levels of perceived behavioural control and satisfaction with the chosen alternative, permanent modal shift as result of this strike is not expected. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to this change, we are able to analyze the political economy aspect of this restrictive policy, i.e., we can study the effect of the host government's welfare preference on the optimal foreign ownership restriction. Since the analytical solution to the optimal share restriction policy cannot be specified in general, we use a numerical approach based on collocation to approximate the solution to the problem. Within this framework, under certain conditions, it turns out that the rent extraction-efficiency trade-off is sharper the less the host government favors the local firm. We show that not only economic factors but also political factors play an important role in the determination of the foreign ownership restrictions.","[Karabay, Bilgehan] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Pulverer, Gernot; Weinmuller, Ewa] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Anal & Sci Comp, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Technische Universitat Wien,"Karabay, B (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",bilgehan.karabay@tcmb.gov.tr; gernotpulverer@gmail.com; e.weinmueller@tuwien.ac.at,"Karabay, Bilgehan/ABF-6761-2020; Karabay, Bilgehan/H-2937-2014",,,,,,50,4,5,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This paper extends these views into a formal theoretical model through pricing based on comparables. We project that the spillover effect of a foreclosure on neighborhood property values depends on two factors: the discount of foreclosure sale and the weight placed on the foreclosed property as a comparable in the valuation. The former is related to housing cycle and the latter varies by time of foreclosure and its distance from the subject property. Empirical results based on a 2006 sample show that this effect is significant within a radius of 0.9 km (roughly 10 blocks) and within 5 years from its liquidation. The most severe impact is an 8.7% discount on neighborhood property values, which gradually drops to anywhere between -1.2 to -1.7% for foreclosures liquidated within the past 5 years. These spillover effects vary slightly when the sample selection bias is taken into account. Based on an alternative sample of purchase transactions in 2003, the estimated spillover effects in booming years are reduced by half, confirming on the important role played by housing cycles.","[Lin, Zhenguo; Rosenblatt, Eric; Yao, Vincent W.] Fannie Mae, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae),"Lin, ZG (通讯作者)，Fannie Mae, 3900 Wisconsin Ave, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",len_lin@fanniemae.com; eric_rosenblatt@fanniemae.com; vincent_w_yao@fanniemae.com,,"Yao, Vincent/0000-0002-4660-8199",,,,,28,178,234,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Since the factor structure restricts the autocovariance matrices of the component indicators, a distance test, or the Hansen-Sargan test of over-identifying restrictions, is applicable. This also gives a GMM counterpart of the Stock-Watson coincident index, or a new composite index (CI) of coincident indicators, as a by-product.

Quality-controlled price dispersion data series are estimated using a sample of transaction data in the housing presale and spot markets in Hong Kong. Our results show that transaction volume has a negative and significant effect oil price dispersion in the spot market, but a positive and significant effect in the presale market. These support our conjecture that there are more noise traders in the presale market due to lower transaction costs.

We take advantage of recent developments of panel cointegration techniques that control for endogeneity of regressors to estimate cointegration vectors. Empirical evidence shows that there exists a long-run equilibrium between productivity level and the three kinds of capital; among them, human capital turns out to have the strongest impact on productivity. Regional productivity is found also to be positively affected by R&D activity and public infrastructure of neighboring regions. Finally, results of the Granger-causality tests support the hypothesis that human capital and infrastructure Granger-cause productivity in the long-run while the opposite is not true: only for R&D stock is the bi-directional causality found.

Work status is another important human capital outcome related to early child health. This study examines the relationship of linear growth restriction at 2 years of age to work status in young adults who have, for the most part completed their schooling and further explores whether this relationship differs by gender. The analysis sample of 1795 was drawn from participants in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, which followed individuals from birth to age 20-22 years. Work status in 2005 was represented by three categories: not working, working in an informal job, and working in a formal job. Formal work in the Philippines, as in most countries, is associated with regular hours, higher wages and benefits. Analyses were stratified by gender and current school enrolment, and adjusted for socioeconomic status and attained years of schooling. Among males no longer in school, higher length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) at age 2 was associated with a 40% increase in likelihood of formal work compared to not working. In females, each 1 unit increase in LAZ was associated with 0.2 higher likelihood of formal vs. informal work. No significant associations were observed in the small sample of young adults still in school. To improve job prospects of young adults, it is important to provide proper nutrition in early childhood and adequate educational opportunities during schooling years. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, evidence shows that the two trends are largely independent. A detailed analysis of IQ trends on the Raven's Progressive Matrices tests in Britain dramatizes the poverty of the nutrition hypothesis. A multiple factor hypothesis that operates on three levels is offered as an alternative instrument of causal explanation. The Raven's data show that over the 65 years from circa 1942 to the present, taking ages 5-15 together, British school children have gained 14 IQ points for a rate of 0.216 points per year. However, since 1979, gains have declined with age and between the ages of 12-13 and 14-15, small gains turn into small losses. This is confirmed by Piagetian data and poses the possibility that the cognitive demands of teen-age subculture have been stagnant over perhaps the last 30 years. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This antagonism gives reason to discuss whether or not the EU should be granted an autonomous tax source. Our contribution to this debate explores the factors which shape the acceptance of the EU tax option among European policy makers. A self-conducted survey among Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), which resulted in a response of some 150 of the representatives, offers us a unique database. Concerning MEPs' revenue system preferences, our findings confirm an important impact of party ideology and individual characteristics while they indicate that country-specific factors also contribute to understand the attitudes towards an EU tax. In the light of our findings the status quo bias in the revenue system of the EU can be attributed to the persistent importance of national interests with respect to tax policy.","[Heinemann, Friedrich; Mohl, Philipp; Osterloh, Steffen] ZEW, Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Heinemann, F (通讯作者)，ZEW, Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany.",heinemann@zew.de,,,,,,,47,13,13,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Over a medium-term of twenty years - a period of pronounced growth and change in the region's employment and population - lagged employment density dominates access variables in explaining levels and ranks of current employment density. Similarly. the probability that a tract is located within a current employment center is largely a function of past membership rather than proximity to highways or the central business district. Moreover, longer-term persistence is also readily apparent: concentrations of employment a century ago explain the current distribution of employment as well as access to the modern highway system. This stability in the location of employment and employment concentrations over medium- and longer-terms suggests important roles for agglomeration, adjustment costs, and the durability of fixed investment in modeling the evolution of metropolitan areas.

The authors address this issue by decomposing U. S. county-level employment into four supply components: net commuting, the employment (unemployment) rate, the labor force participation rate, and population. They find that over all counties, net commuting represents the largest supply response, although this primarily holds in metropolitan areas. The benefits to original residents, measured as the sum of unemployment and labor force participation responses, are larger in rural counties. They also are larger in central-city counties of the larger metropolitan areas. The greatest benefits are found in persistent-poverty nonmetropolitan counties as well as in mining and manufacturing-dependent nonmetropolitan counties. Finally, sensitivity analysis indicates the importance of geographical scale and periodicity in assessing the issue of who benefits from regional job growth.","[Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, AED Econ Dept, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Li, Hui] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Rickman, Dan S.] Oklahoma State Univ, Chair Reg Econ Anal, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Partridge, MD (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, AED Econ Dept, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,,"Rickman, Dan/0000-0003-1233-7420",,,,,43,29,41,2,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

LNG will likely increase its share of European natural gas imports in the future, Russia will not dominate the European imports (share of similar to 1/3), the Middle East will continue to be a rather modest supplier, the UK is successfully converting from being a natural gas exporter to become a transit node for LNG towards continental Europe, and congested pipeline infrastructure, and in some cases LNG terminals, will remain a feature of the European natural gas markets, but less than in the current situation.","[Holz, Franziska; von Hirschhausen, Christian; Kemfert, Claudia] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Kemfert, C (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",fholz@diw.de,,"Kemfert, Claudia/0000-0002-6742-0478",,,,,19,18,20,1,12,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,,,,,SI,,137.0,150,,,,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,514JQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271390900010,0

Anthropometric measures, migration and the quality of life in early nineteenth century London?",EXPLORATIONS IN ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Anthropometric history; Height; Britain; London; Standard of living; Urbanisation; Migration; Nineteenth century; Seamen,URBANIZATION; STATURE; ENGLAND; HEALTH,"Using a new source of evidence we explore the mobility of mid-nineteenth century seamen. Among seamen born outside London, the tall, the literate and those who could remember the exact day, month and year when they were born, characteristics that we suggest mark them out as men with more choices in life, were more likely to migrate to London. Contrary to what might be inferred from contemporary descriptions of urban disamenities or from persistent differentials in mortality, London appears as a desirable destination for those who could choose. The conclusion must be that London was not so bad, and we should adjust our perception of the problems of urbanisation accordingly, with implications for the wider debate on the standard of living during the industrial revolution. The paper's methodological interest is the use of height as an explanatory variable in the analysis of migration. Although correlated with other variables that are routinely used in anthropometric studies to indicate life chances, such as literacy and the ability to know and recall date of birth, height has empirical advantages over these alternatives in that it exhibits higher levels of significance. Moreover while literacy and heaping are in essence binary variables, height is a (near) continuous one, and one that allows us to test for linear and non-linear responses, as we do with interesting results in this paper. Perhaps the most fruitful use of height in historical analyses may turn out to be as an explanatory variable; at the very least such a research strategy provides anthropometric historians with further opportunities.

I challenge this view by arguing that the Nordic countries have had a significant, and at times even decisive, influence upon the civilian ESDP. They put civilian crisis management on the ESDP agenda and successfully kept it there in the face of strong opposition led by France; they have played central roles with respect to proposing and designing its concepts and institutions; and they have consistently made disproportionate mission contributions in terms of both personnel and treasure. I identify three factors that have blinded researchers to the Nordic role and explain the Nordic influence with four explanatory factors derived from the emerging literature on the European Union (EU) and small states.

The models are estimated using data collected in 1998 from more than 1300 working commuters in the San Francisco Bay Area. A cross-model analysis reveals three robust relationships, namely: (I) myriad measures of travel amounts work together to affect perceptions; (2) perceptions are consistently important in shaping desires: and (3) affections have a positive relationship with desires. The second finding Suggests that two individuals who travel the same objective amount may not have the same desire to reduce their travel: how much individuals perceive their travel to be is important. The third point argues that the degree to which travel is enjoyed is a key determinant of shaping desires to reduce travel: the more travel is enjoyed, the less the desire to reduce it.

As a result, the spread of Saint-Simonian ideas took place indirectly via Spanish exiles in France. Some returning exiles sought to spread the Saint-Simonian creed between 1834 and 1838, in some cases following the line of Enfantin and in others from a more eclectic stance. Meanwhile, the relative economic backwardness of Spain, characterized by a strong prohibitionist bent among the more industrialized sectors, prevented a more enthusiastic response to Saint-Simonian ideas.","Univ Zaragoza, Dept Appl Econ & Econ Hist, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Hormigo, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Appl Econ & Econ Hist, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",,,,,,,,66,2,2,0,1,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Their aim was to create a future society in which work could be experienced as a positive activity.

Relatively few strikes ended in any sort of compromise. Sometime during the last decade of the 19th century, however, the pattern begins to change, with the fraction of strikes ending in compromise peaking at nearly half during World Wars I and II. What explains these changes in strike outcomes between the late 19th century and 1945? We explore the effects of macroeconomic conditions, industrial organization and product markets, labor organization, law and public policy, and immigration and trade on the costs and benefits of achieving strike compromises. We find that temporary government intervention in settling strikes during World War I helped move labor and management away from an adversarial equilibrium, and thus allowed growing acceptance of organized labor to be reflected in a permanent increase in the rate of compromise. We conclude that changes in the nature of strike outcomes represent an important and neglected aspect of broader changes in the place of organized labor in the American political economy.

Considerably higher values are found for the secondary and primary-completed definitions. Overall, the higher the threshold for defining skilled labor, the lower the elasticity and less likely is the switch between types of labor.

However, very few eligible homeowners used reverse mortgages to achieve consumption smoothing until recently, when the reverse mortgage market in the United States witnessed substantial growth. In this article, I examine 1989-2007 loan-level reverse mortgage data and conduct three sets of analyses to better understand the demand for reverse mortgages among elderly homeowners. First, I study the ZIP code characteristics correlated with reverse mortgage originations. Second, I show that recent reverse mortgage borrowers are significantly different from earlier borrowers in many respects. Third, I investigate the reasons why the reverse mortgage market experienced substantial growth in the mid-2000s. Combining the reverse mortgage data with county-level house price data, I find that higher house prices lead to more reverse mortgage originations. Specifically, the increases in house prices account for about one-third of the overall growth in the reverse mortgage market from 2003 to 2007.","Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Shan, H (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",hui.shan@frb.gov,,,,,,,23,51,57,2,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2011,39.0,4,,,,,743.0,768,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2011.00310.x,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,854MT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297499500005,0

With such atomistic competition, increasing the number of consumers leaves the distributions of producers' prices and other choices unchanged. In many models featuring non-trivial strategic considerations, producers' prices fall as their numbers increase. I examine observations of restaurants' sales, seating capacities, exit decisions, and prices from 222 US cities. Given factor prices and demographic variables, increasing a city's size increases restaurants' average sales and decreases their exit rate and prices. These results suggest that strategic considerations lie at the heart of restaurant pricing and turnover.

However it is likely that a traveler cannot assess all available information on all alternative routes due to time constraints and limited cognitive capacity. This paper presents a model that is consistent with a general network topology and can potentially be estimated based on revealed preference data. It explicitly takes into account the information acquisition and the subsequent path choice. The decision to acquire information is assumed to be based on the cognitive cost involved in the search and the expected benefit defined as the expected increase in utility after the search. A latent class model is proposed, where the decision to search or not to search and the depth of the search are latent and only the final path choices are observed. A synthetic data set is used for the purpose of validation and ease of illustration. The data are generated from the postulated cognitive-cost model, and estimation results show that the true values of the parameters can be recovered with enough variability in the data. Two other models with simplifying assumptions of no information and full information are also estimated with the same set of data with significantly biased path choice utility parameters. Prediction results show that a smaller cognitive cost encourages information search on risky and fast routes and thus higher shares on those routes. As a result, the expected average travel time decreases and the variability increases. The no-information and full-information models are extreme cases of the more general cognitive-cost model in some cases, but not generally so, and thus the increasing ease of information acquisition does not necessarily warrant a full-information model.

However, these facilities also appear attractive to public transport users who start using their cars for getting to the P + R location.

The results show that the distribution of individuals' preferences for car over public transport is the main determinant of this impact. P + R has a larger traffic reducing effect if more individuals prefer their car. At the same time, the shift of traffic from city to periphery improves welfare. These effects get stronger when a P + R facility provides a superior access to the mainline public transportation network. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

I examine the role to which economic factors may have influenced the decision to be a rescuer. Using cross-country data and detailed individual-level data on rescuers and nonrescuers, I find that richer countries had many more rescuers than poorer ones, and within countries, richer people were more likely to be rescuers than poorer people. The individual-level effect of income on being a rescuer remains significant after controlling for ease-of-rescue variables, such as the number of rooms in one's home, suggesting that the correlation of income and rescue is not solely driven by richer people having more resources for rescue. Given that richer people might be thought to have more to lose by rescuing, the evidence is consistent with the view that altruism increases with income.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hoffman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,58,25,29,0,20,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

In order to survive in these very competitive environments, information on what factors impact on costs and efficiency of airlines is crucial in guiding strategic change. To evaluate key determinants of 58 passenger airlines' efficiency, this paper applies a two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach, with partially boot-strapped random effects Tobit regressions in the second stage. Our results suggest that the effects of route optimisation, in the sense of average stage length of the fleet, are limited to airline technical efficiency. We show that airline size and key fleet mix characteristics, such as aircraft size and number of different aircraft families in the fleet, are more relevant to successful cost management of airlines since they have significant impacts on all three types of airline efficiency: technical, allocative and, ultimately, cost efficiency. Our results also show that despite the fuel saving benefits of younger aircraft, the age of an airline's fleet has no significant impact on its technical efficiency, but does have a positive impact on its allocative and cost efficiency.

More precisely, the data satisfy CARP if the graph allows a node-partitioning into two induced subgraphs that are acyclic. We prove that partitioning the obtained graph into two acyclic subgraphs is NP-complete. Next, we derive a necessary condition for CARP that can be verified in polynomial time, and we present an example to show that our necessary and sufficient conditions do not coincide. We also propose and implement fast heuristics for testing the sufficient condition. These heuristics can be used to check reasonably large data sets for CARP, and can be of particular interest when used prior to computationally demanding approaches. Finally, based on computational results for both real-life and synthetic data, we conclude that our heuristics are effective in testing CARP.","[Nobibon, Fabrice Talla; Spieksma, Frits C.

The highest decile increased by some 18-22 BMI units in the course of the century while the lowest ones increased by merely 1-3 BMI units. For example, a typical African American woman in the 10th percentile and 64 in. (162.6 cm) tall increased in weight by just 12 pounds (5 kg) whereas in the 90th percentile her weight would have increased by 128 pounds (58 kg). Hence, the BMI distribution became increasingly right skewed as the distance between the deciles increased considerably. The rate of change of the BMI decile curves varied greatly over time and across gender and ethnicity. The BMI deciles of white men and women experienced upswings after the two world wars and downswings during the Great Depression and also decelerated after 1970. However, among African Americans the pattern is different during the first half of the century with men's rate of increase in BMI values decreasing substantially and that of females remaining constant at a relatively high level until the Second World War. After the war, though, the rate of change of BM I values of blacks came to resemble that of whites with an accelerating phase followed by a slowdown around the 1970s. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

By combining micro-level data on height and weight with regional- and province-level information, we are able to link individual height and BMI at age 18 to regional and provincial averages of environmental variables in the year of birth. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in rich low-mortality settings, the negative effects of childhood disease dominate the positive selection effects of mortality. We find that both income and disease matter, although income matters more than disease for height, while the opposite is true for BMI. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Recently quadratic approximations have been explored. This paper examines the accuracy of these and higher-order approximations in an endogenous growth model with public capital, thereby extending the work done in the current literature on the neoclassical growth model. We find that significant errors may persist in computed transition paths and welfare even after resorting to approximations as high as fourth order. Moreover, the accuracy of approximations may not increase monotonically with the increase in the order of approximation. Also, as in the previous literature, we find that achieving acceptable levels of accuracy when computing the welfare consequences of a policy change typically requires a higher order approximation than attaining similar levels of accuracy in the computation of the transition path: typically an increase in order of approximation by one is sufficient.","[Atolia, Manoj; Awad, Bassam; Marquis, Milton] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Awad, B (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",matolia@fsu.edu; bawad@fsu.edu; mmarquis@fsu.edu,"Atolia, Manoj/A-8858-2009; Atolia, Manoj/AAJ-7691-2020","Atolia, Manoj/0000-0002-4020-8522;",,,,,34,5,5,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

As passenger car emissions were found to be significant and rapidly increasing, their reduction was specially targeted. Following a bill passed by US Congress in 1968, requirements were set in 1970 for the vehicle manufacturers to reduce the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) with 90% by 1975, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) with 90% by 1976. These requirements were soon adapted to the Japanese regulatory framework, and were known in both countries as the Muskie Act or Muskie Law after the senator who developed the original bill. The new requirements spurred tremendous research and development efforts. Car manufacturers and research institutions in USA, Japan and Europe investigated and developed alternative solutions, including gas turbine and steam engine vehicles. California, the USA state with the most severe air quality problems and the only state at the time allowed to establish more strict requirements than federal regulation, established requirements implying the use of oxidation catalysts in 1975 and three-way catalysts (TWC's) in 1977. Japan as a nation adopted similar requirements 1976 and 1978. Export of cars from Japan to USA increased rapidly. The rest of USA adopted emission standards similar to California's only in 1981, timing USA vehicle sales rebound after the energy crisis and grave economic downturn. Strict requirements were thus established only after more than a decade of civic and legal processes between federal authorities, the car manufacturers and NGO's. The history of vehicle development is one of cooperation and competition. This paper argues that the international cooperation on different levels of society (government, industry and science) together with commercial competition between the two countries was strong, continuous and instrumental in enabling the development of technology, appropriate regulation and infrastructural changes and thus created a market for cleaner cars and effectively reduced emissions from the growing vehicle fleet. In other words, the introduction of TWCs was reinforced by the simultaneous development of mitigating technology in two car producing countries competing for market space. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, there is a wide variation in the reasons for farm exits. A review of the literature shows that a limited number of explanatory variables are generally accepted as being driving forces for farm exit rates. For the majority of indicators, ambiguous results are reported. In this paper, we analyse the determining factors of farm exit rates in Germany by examining municipalities from 1999 to 2007. We evaluate the robustness of the relationship between a set of explanatory variables and farm exit rates at different spatial scales. Our results indicate that the direction of impact of some variables (farm size, population density and the share of ruminants kept at low intensity as a fraction of the total ruminant stock) on farm exit rates is unambiguous throughout Germany. For the majority of the analysed explanatory variables, the strength of their impact on farm exit rates depends on their observation level or regional context.","[Roeder, Norbert] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst vTI, Inst Rural Studies, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Kilian, Stefan] TUM, Environm Econ & Agr Policy Grp, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Technical University of Munich,"Röder, N (通讯作者)，Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst vTI, Inst Rural Studies, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",norbert.roeder@vti.bund.de; stefan.kilian@wzw.tum.de,"Roeder, Norbert/G-7281-2016",,,,,,34,0,0,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We show that summary pro-poor measures such as poverty-growth elasticities may violate this axiom. We then characterize a special dominance condition under which a given summary pro-poor measure will satisfy the growth-rate consistency axiom. Finally, we establish a general growth-rate dominance condition under which all summary pro-poor measures will respect the growth-rate consistency axiom.","[Zheng, Buhong] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80202 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Zheng, BH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",buhong.zheng@cudenver.edu,,,,,,,24,4,5,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2011,37.0,1,,,,,61.0,79,,10.1007/s00355-010-0480-7,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,774MQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291391100003,0

We find that so far the increase in actual protectionist measures to restrict trade through tariff and non-tariff barriers has been moderate. None of the World Trade Organization (WTO) members has retreated into widespread trade restrictions or protectionism to date. At the same time, however, evidence from surveys shows that public pressure for more economic protection has been mounting since the mid-2000s and has possibly intensified since the start of the financial crisis. Meanwhile, our model-based simulations suggest that the impairment of the global flow of trade would hamper the recovery process from the crisis as well as the long-term growth of the global economy. At the same time, it is unlikely that protectionism would help correct existing current account imbalances. Moreover, the countries implementing protectionist measures should expect a deterioration of their international competitiveness, which would further affect the potential for longer-term real GDP growth.","[Bussiere, Matthieu] Banque France, Paris, France; [Perez-Barreiro, Emilia; Straub, Roland; Taglioni, Daria] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; Bank of France; European Central Bank,"Bussière, M (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,38,10,12,0,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2011,34.0,5,,,,,826.0,852,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01355.x,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,769RB,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291034800010,0

This paper explores the social practice of slugging, an informal system of carpooling in the Washington. DC area. Slugging emerged in response to the establishment of Virginia's High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes in the early 1970s. as single drivers picked up riders alongside the road (slugs) in order to meet the requirements for driving in the less congested HOV lanes. Drawing on the work of sociologist Anthony Giddens, as well as the sociological insights of Georg Simmel and Stanley Milgram, we suggest that the practice of slugging highlights the processes of institutionalization and structuration. This paper details how the region's mass transportation policies and urban culture have combined to result in an institutionalized practice with particular norms and logics of behavior. We conclude that looking at specific cases where social context has affected transportation, like slugging, could provide useful insights on the impact of social context on transportation policies and systems.

These interactions have been investigated primarily from an intra-household perspective, but increasingly too in other types of social settings. In the case of interactions within a workplace, it has been suggested that the decision to telecommute may have some important social components. Previous research has concentrated on social isolation, and the effect on job satisfaction of qualitatively different (i.e., telecommunications-mediated) relationships with managers and colleagues. A topic that remains unexplored is the way social norms, in effect the influence of other people's behavior, may influence the decision to adopt telecommuting. In this paper we set to investigate, within a qualitative framework, the role of social contact in the process of acquiring information on, and making decisions about, telecommuting. The results indicate that social contact does play a subtle but non-trivial role in the adoption and continuation process, and offer some insights about the importance of the social dimension, institutional set-up, and how they interact to influence the decision to telecommute.

The Vexed Role of Agricultural Distortions,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,IMPACTS; INCOME,"Trade policy reforms in recent decades have sharply reduced the distortions that were harming agriculture in developing countries, yet global trade in farm products continues to be far more distorted than trade in non-farm goods. Those distortions reduce some forms of poverty and inequality but worsen others, so the net effects are unclear without empirical modelling. This article summarises a series of new economy-wide global and national empirical studies that focus on the net effects of the remaining distortions to world merchandise trade on poverty and inequality globally and in various developing countries. The global Linkage model results suggest that removing those remaining distortions would reduce international inequality, largely by boosting net farm incomes and raising real wages for unskilled workers in developing countries, and would reduce the number of poor people worldwide by 3 per cent. The analysis based on the Global Trade Analysis Project model for a sample of 15 countries, and nine stand-alone national case studies, all point to larger reductions in poverty, especially if only the non-poor are subjected to increased income taxation to compensate for the loss of trade tax revenue.","[Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Cockburn, John] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Martin, Will] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Adelaide; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Laval University; The World Bank,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,51,28,29,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2011,34.0,4,,,,,487.0,515,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01339.x,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,745KA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289163100001,0

It takes Portuguese trade with Brazil as a case study to discuss the impact of colonial market expansion on social capital. The hypothesis is that social capital depletion prompted an uneven distribution of information and a limited access to honest individuals, who might afford a premium to certain forms of agency. Given the states' inability to provide legal sanctioning in colonial regions, this article focuses on private-order mechanisms which were effective for selecting reputable individuals. The exploration of network analysis identifies the mechanism that responds to such an adverse environment and supports the argument that business organizations which counted on the geographical mobility of agents had comparative advantages. The approach followed in this article brings new insights on informal institutional arrangements and on itinerancy in contexts of low levels of social capital.","[Costa, Leonor Freire; Rocha, Maria Manuela] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Sch Econ & Management UTL ISEG, Dept Social Sci GHES, Lisbon, Portugal; [Araujo, Tanya] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Sch Econ & Management UTL ISEG, Dept Econ UECE, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Costa, LF (通讯作者)，Univ Tecn Lisboa, Sch Econ & Management UTL ISEG, Dept Social Sci GHES, Lisbon, Portugal.",leonorc@iseg.utl.pt; manuelar@iseg.utl.pt; tanya@iseg.utl.pt,"Araujo, Tanya V/B-5772-2009; Costa, Leonor/JKJ-5903-2023; COSTA, Leonor Freire/IVU-7777-2023","Rocha, Maria Manuela/0000-0002-3535-447X; Araujo, Tanya/0000-0001-6993-7043; Costa, Leonor/0000-0002-8867-3036",,,,,81,11,13,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

We assume that individuals have preferences over edges of a graph that need to be aggregated. The goal is to find a socially best spanning tree in the graph. As ranking all spanning trees is becoming infeasible even for small numbers of vertices and/or edges of a graph, our interest lies in finding algorithms that determine a socially best spanning tree in a simple manner. This problem is closely related to the minimum (or maximum) spanning tree problem in Discrete Optimization. Our main result shows that for the various underlying ranking rules on the set of spanning trees discussed in this article, the sets of best spanning trees coincide. Moreover, a greedy algorithm based on a transitive group ranking on the set of edges will always provide such a best spanning tree.","[Darmann, Andreas; Klamler, Christian] Graz Univ, Inst Publ Econ, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Pferschy, Ulrich] Graz Univ, Inst Stat & Operat Res, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz,"Darmann, A (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Inst Publ Econ, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",andreas.darmann@uni-graz.at; christian.klamler@uni-graz.at; pferschy@uni-graz.at,"Pferschy, Ulrich/D-2182-2012","Pferschy, Ulrich/0000-0001-8881-1497; Klamler, Christian/0000-0003-1225-5943",,,,,26,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2011,70.0,4,,,,,511.0,527,,10.1007/s11238-010-9228-1,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,723MO,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287510900006,0

White females were consistently taller than black females by about 1.5 cm (0.6 in.). Whites from Great Lakes and Plains states and black Southwestern females were the tallest. US females were tall compared to their European counterparts. The height of females began to decline in the antebellum period, possibly before that of males. The recovery of physical stature was also earlier among females than among males. This implies that the biological standard of lower-class men and women did not move in parallel during the onset of modern economic growth.

Uncertainty is considered both on the supply-side (e.g., the effect of incidents on habitual route choice behavior) and on the demand-side (e.g., due to prediction errors in demand forecasting). The framework developed in this paper also allows the benefits of real-time travel information to be compared directly against the benefits of responsive pricing, allowing planning agencies to identify the value of these policy options or contract terms in publicly-operated toll roads. Specifically, six scenarios reflect different combinations of policy options, and correspond to different solution methods for optimal tolls. Demonstrations are provided on both the Sioux falls and Anaheim networks. Results indicate that providing information to drivers implemented alongside responsive tolling may reduce expected total system travel time by over 9%, though more than 8% of the improvement is due to providing information, with the remaining 1% improvement gained from responsive tolling.

This paper first develops an account of treaty compliance that incorporates the intrinsic benefits to the state of compliance, regime costs associated with certain rights, the political costs that NGOs, judges, and others are able to impose for non-compliance, and the fiscal and economic costs of compliance. The paper argues that for child survival rights, fiscal and economic costs are likely to be dispositive, and that as a result richer countries are more likely to comply. The paper then uses an instrumental variable approach to investigate whether ratification of the Convention of the Rights of the Child was associated with stronger effort at the country level on child survival rights. It finds that ratification of the CRC was correlated with a subsequent increase in immunization rates, but only in upper middle and high income countries.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Gauri, V (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",vgauri@worldbank.org,,,,,,,28,20,25,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

It reveals heterogeneity of tourism flows across different destinations. It also emphasizes the crowding-out effects of cruise tourism on stay-over tourism. Using a static Cournot game framework, the authors show that, for most of the destinations, stay-over tourism and cruise tourism are strategic substitutes. Moreover, a 'crowding-out trap' seems to have emerged since the beginning of the 1990s and is tending to spread. Policymakers have a weak negotiating position vis-a-vis an oligopolistic cruise ship tourism industry, resulting in an uncontrolled and increasing share of cruise tourism flows. As the Caribbean authorities have managed their growth process in the belief that there is complementarity between cruise tourism and stay-over tourism, these results suggest that the strategic vision of a growth process based on tourist activity has to be revised.","[Bresson, Georges] CNRS, ERMES, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Bresson, Georges] Univ Paris 04, Univ Paris 11, Inst Labour Studies & Publ Policies, TEPP,CNRS, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Logossah, Kinvi] Univ Antilles Guyane, CEREGMIA, Schoelcher 97271, Martinique, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bresson, G (通讯作者)，CNRS, ERMES, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75230 Paris 05, France.",bresson-georges@orange.fr; kinvi.logossah@martinique.univ-ag.fr,,,,,,,55,26,29,4,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

These individual choices determine the degree to which the goal is reached. Influence is assessed by newly defined binary relations, each of which ranks members on the basis of their relative performance at a corresponding level of participation. For institutions with three options (e.g., voting games in which each voter may vote yes, abstain, or vote no), we obtain three influence relations, and show that their strict components may be cyclic. This latter property describes a paradox of power which contrasts with the transitivity of the unique influence relation of binary voting games. Weak conditions of anonymity suffice for each of these relations to be transitive. We also obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for each of these relations to be complete. Further, we characterize institutions in which the rankings induced by these relations, and the Banzhaf-Coleman and Shapley-Shubik power indices coincide. We argue that extending the influence relations to firms would be useful in efficiently assigning workers to different units of production.

The model considers purchase offers that arrive according to a Poisson process. The homeowner's problem is to set a price that will maximize his net profit. The selling agent suggests a price to the homeowner that will maximize her net profit, which consists of her sales commission minus her costs. Our model accounts for a deadline to sell the home, a common feature of the housing market, beyond which fixed and variable penalty costs accrue to both the homeowner and selling agent. We demonstrate the behavior of the model and show under what conditions the owner's and agent's incentives are aligned. Our computational results suggest, in most circumstances, that agents should not pressure owners to substantially lower their asking prices in the presence of a deadline.","Temple Univ, Dept Management Sci & Operat Management, Fox Sch Business, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Rosenthal, EC (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Management Sci & Operat Management, Fox Sch Business, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",edward.rosenthal@temple.edu,,,,,,,34,4,5,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Results from a Survey Experiment in Tanzania,WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CLASSIFICATION; ERRORS,"Labor market statistics are critical for assessing and understanding economic development. However, widespread variation exists in how labor statistics are collected in household surveys. This paper analyzes the effects of alternative survey design on employment statistics by implementing a randomized survey experiment in Tanzania. Two features of the survey design are assessed - the level of detail of the employment questions and the type of respondent. It turns out that both features have relevant and statistically significant effects on employment statistics. Using a short labor module without screening questions induces many individuals to adopt a broad definition of employment, incorrectly including domestic duties. But after reclassifying those in domestic work as 'not working' in order to obtain the correct ILO classification, the short module turns out to generate lower female employment rates, higher working hours for both men and women who are employed, and lower rates of wage employment than the detailed module. Response by proxy rather than self-report has no effect on female labor statistics but yields substantially lower male employment rates, mostly due to underreporting of agricultural activity. The large impacts of proxy responses on male employment rates are attenuated when proxy informants are spouses and individuals with some schooling.

In addition to providing an appraisal of the existence of asymmetry in the Irish and UK markets, the paper provides an important methodological contribution. Tests of asymmetry in the literature normally partition the sample into periods of falling and rising international oil prices. This fails to account for price pressures coming from the equilibrium error of the cointegrating relationship. In particular, the possibility of conflicting price pressures arising from short-run dynamics in retail prices and responses to disequilibrium errors needs to be explicitly modelled. We take this issue into account in an econometric model and we highlight the importance of this distinction. In terms of the asymmetric behaviour of these markets, the paper finds no evidence to support the rockets and feathers hypothesis that prices rise faster than they fall in response to changes in the value of international oil prices. doi: 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-No3-1","[Bermingham, Colin; O'Brien, Derry] Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Bermingham, C (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, POB 559,Dame St, Dublin 2, Ireland.",colin.bermingham@centralbank.ie; derry.obrien@centralbank.ie,,,,,,,10,29,29,0,9,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2011,32.0,3,,,,,1.0,26,,10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-No3-1,0.0,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,784TM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292181100001,0

Recently, we identified the cDNA for MA-ACS1 from banana and studied the transcript and protein accumulation patterns of this gene. The expression of this gene correlated well with 1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid (ACC) content in banana pulp during ripening. In-silico analysis provided important insight in the structural and phylogenetic characteristics of MA-ACS1. We analysed the differential transcript accumulation pattern and protein levels of MA-ACS1 in response to ethylene, auxin, wounding and low temperature in preclimacteric banana fruit. Our study provides information about the regulation of expression of the MA-ACS1 in response to various factors during ripening in banana fruit, which may have physiological relevance concerning ethylene biosynthesis during post-harvest conditions. Furthermore, we have detected a GCC-box putative ERE (ethylene-responsive element) and an ARE (auxin-responsive element) specific DNA-binding activity in the banana pulp and studied the ethylene-and auxin-responsive characteristics of the GCC-box and ARE (TGTCTC)-containing synthetic promoter fragments. Understanding the expression pattern of ripening genes and the molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression during ripening is crucial in regulating the expression of ripening genes to control ripening under post-harvest conditions to reduce massive spoilage of fruits during shipping and storage.","[Choudhury, S.

I use structural VARs with sign restrictions, which take the form of restricting the short-run negative relationship between vacancies and unemployment (i.e., Beveridge curve). Despite the 'weakness' of these restrictions, they reveal a clear, unambiguous pattern that, when unemployment increases and vacancies drop, (i) both the separation rate and gross separations rise quickly and remain persistently high, (ii) the job finding rate and vacancies drop in a hump-shaped manner, and (iii) gross hires respond little initially, but eventually rise. These results point to the importance of job loss in understanding US labor market dynamics. This pattern also holds with respect to different kinds of shocks that induce the same Beveridge curve relationship. This paper also considers the 'disaggregate model', which uses data disaggregated into six demographic groups and incorporates transitions into and out of the labor force. I show that the separation rate continues to play a dominant role among prime-age male workers, while, for other groups, changes in the job finding rate are more important.

The extensive microeconomic data about the rural households in China is used to explore the determinants of rural-urban migration. Characteristics of individuals, households and migrant sending communities are examined. Empirical analysis finds that the number of family adult workers, schooling years of all household members, village-level migrant networks have a statistically significant positive effect on the probability of migration. It is concluded that migration choice is a rational decision and a relatively effective approach to narrow down the wealth gap between the rural and urban areas.

Many pests and diseases cause huge economic losses to the farmers. Among these, Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) is one of the most important production constraints. The disease is widespread in almost all banana-growing states of India, with disease severity as high as 80-90% in some states where susceptible cultivars are grown on large areas. The important groups of banana severely affected by this disease are: 'Silk' (AAB), 'Ney Poovan' (AB), 'Pisang Awak' (ABB), 'Pome' (AAB), 'Bluggoe' (ABB) and 'Monthan' (ABB). Recently, a virulent strain of Foc affecting Cavendish types has been identified. In addition, 'Mysore' (AAB) which was hitherto tolerant to Foc has recently been found infected by Foc vegetative compatibility group (VCG) 0124/0125. A diversity analysis was carried out on 200 Foc isolates collected from different parts of India, to find out the various pathotypes in Foc by VCG analysis. The analysis indicated the presence of six different VCG groups. Ddiversity analyses of Foc, pathogen-host resistance, biological control using endophytes, standardisation of a diagnostic kit for the identification of the pathogen present in the soil and in the plant are the major areas of Foc research in India. Recently, molecular markers for the identification of pathogenic Fusarium present in the soil as well as in planting material have been developed. No effective control measures are available except growing of resistant cultivars. Recently, the National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) has identified an effective fungal antagonist, Trichoderma viride, which has effectively controlled the soil-borne inoculum of the Fusarium pathogen. A mass-production protocol at farm level using banana farm waste has been developed for the cost-effective management of the disease. Activities for the effective management of this disease are discussed.","[Mustaffa, M.

Finally, we analyze the impact of increasing demand elasticities over time, and varying the financial values of the production capacities that remain at the end of the planning horizon. We believe that such a tool is valuable for professionals and scholars interested in the dynamics of production capacity mix (portfolio of technologies) in the electricity sector It is also of paramount importance for public decision makers who have to simultaneously deal with environmental issues and with price control, both of which are politically sensitive. doi: 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-No4-8","[Pineau, Pierre-Olivier; Rasata, Hasina; Zaccour, Georges] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Pineau, PO (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",pierre-olivier.pineau@hec.ca,,"Zaccour, Georges/0000-0003-4505-0477",NSERC Canada; HEC Montreal,NSERC Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); HEC Montreal,We wish to thank the two anonymous reviewers and the editor for their very helpful comments.

We characterize these lotteries and show that, in a given pair, they only differ by their moments of order greater than or equal to n. When the n-th derivative of the utility function is positive (negative) and n is odd (even), the agent prefers a lottery with higher (lower) n + 2p-th moments for p belonging to the set of positive integers. This result links the preference for disaggregation of risks across states of nature to the complete structure of moments preferred by mixed risk averse agents. It can be viewed as a generalization of a proposition appearing in Ekern (1980) which focused only on the differences in the n-th moments.","Strasbourg Univ, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LARGE Res Ctr, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Roger, P (通讯作者)，Strasbourg Univ, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LARGE Res Ctr, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",roger@cournot.u-strasbg.fr,,"ROGER, Patrick/0000-0003-0313-367X",,,,,12,9,9,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2011,70.0,1,,,,,27.0,44,,10.1007/s11238-009-9176-9,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,700NV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285751600003,0

The utilities adjustment, which is necessary, sometimes contributed, but is no smoking gun.

We extend the analysis to an unbalanced panel sample (minimum and maximum spell of five and 31 years). For the unbalanced panel, we reject the null hypothesis that the densities are the same, while we fail to reject the null hypothesis for the balanced panel. These results suggest that inclusion of young firms that non-randomly exit will affect the firm size distribution. The difference in the results is due to the presence of survivorship bias.

Contrary to its importance in practice, land use for production has received no attention in the branches of the economy, on which the new economic geography puts its focus: goods and services produced under increasing returns. We develop a simple general equilibrium model, an extension of the model by Helpman (1998), in which the increasing returns sector uses land in addition to labor. We identify a sharp contrast: with land use for production, a bell-shaped curve of spatial development can emerge. Such a curve is ruled out, however, if land is used for housing only. In contrast to common explanations for the bell-shaped curve which assume that part of the workforce is immobile, our approach builds on the insight that, ultimately, there is only one immobile resource, land.

Most studies support the gains of trade and recognise the substantive contributions of GATT/WTO in fostering free trade; the evidence is, however, not ubiquitously unambiguous. The macroeconomic evidence provides a dominant support for the positive and significant effects of trade on output and growth, while the microeconomic evidence lends larger support to the exogenous effects of productivity on trade, as compared to the effects of trade on productivity. The GATT/WTO remains surrounded by barriers to trade and avowed preferences for preferential trade agreements. The strength of the argument for the gains of trade needs to be evaluated in juxtaposition with several methodological and measurement issues that surround the trade-growth empirics. Most studies focus on partial equilibrium analysis of trade policy and ignore the general equilibrium aspects of macroeconomic policy. It is difficult to disentangle the effects of trade policies from those of other macroeconomic policies and unequivocally interpret the observed correlations between trade policies and economic growth. Trade is one of the several catalysts of productivity and growth and hence its contribution is contingent on its weight in economic activity.","Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Singh, T (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",,,,,,,,223,141,153,0,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2010,33.0,11,,,,,1517.0,1564,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01243.x,0.0,,,48,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,685GB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284616100007,0

Analysis of IMF lending over a protracted period of time reveals considerable volatility. Using both bivariate and multiple regression estimation, this paper investigates the determinants of IMF lending and examines the extent to which it is predictable. Although some significant relationships are discovered, many of them are unstable and time variant. This makes it difficult to predict IMF lending with any degree of confidence. The paper goes on to examine briefly the policy implications of unpredictability. It is critical of the ways in which the problem has been handled in the past and it offers what it argues is a preferable solution.","[Bird, Graham] Univ Surrey, Surrey Ctr Int Econ Studies, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England; [Bird, Graham] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Rowlands, Dane] Carleton Univ, Norman Paterson Sch Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",University of Surrey; Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College; Carleton University,"Bird, G (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Surrey Ctr Int Econ Studies, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England.",,,,,,,,15,5,5,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2010,33.0,10,,,,,1280.0,1301,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01289.x,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,658UY,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000282516100005,0

Parties are unable to commit to a policy before the election; they choose a nonlinear income tax schedule once elected. In each period, citizens cast a vote either for the incumbent or for the challenger. We first show that there exist (pure strategy) subgame perfect equilibria where both parties choose the most-preferred tax schedule of their constituent, subject to the constraint that they are reelected. We characterize a specific class of these BPR (Best Policy with Reelection) equilibria in which one of the parties plays its constituent's unconstrained optimal tax function. Equilibrium tax schedules are always piecewise linear. Depending on the income levels of the two parties' constituents, we obtain either classical left-vs-right equilibria (where the poor vote for one party and the rich for the other one) or ends-against-the-middle equilibria (where both poor and rich vote for one party while the middle class votes for the other party).

We introduce and study the weighted influence indices of a coalition on a player in a social network where the players have an ordered set of possible actions. Each player has an inclination to choose one of the actions. Due to the mutual influence among players, the final decision of each player may be different from his original inclination. In a particular case, the decision of the player is closer to the inclination of the influencing coalition than his inclination was, i.e., the distance between the inclinations of the player and of the coalition is greater than the distance between the decision of the player and the inclination of the coalition in question. The weighted influence index which captures such a case is called the weighted positive influence index. We also consider the weighted negative influence index where the final decision of the player goes farther away from the inclination of the coalition. We consider several influence functions defined in the generalized model of influence and study their properties. The concept of a follower of a given coalition and its particular case, a perfect follower, are defined.

The volume ranking has strange properties and cannot be justified by unit invariance and symmetry. The pointed distance (of the budget hyperplane from the origin along some line) provides a measure or ranking that coincides with the standard purchasing power or real income. The linear price index is practically unavoidable for measuring or ranking freedom. This is applied to the determination of income distribution and taxation implied by the equal freedom of choice of different domains. Concepts of equal or compared potential freedoms and utility-freedom relate freedom analysis to the basic classical concepts of fair allocation (equity-no-envy, egalitarian equivalence, etc.).

To deal with imperfect marijuana data, we exploit the interdependencies in the consumption of the three drugs identified in prior research, and introduce a Monte Carlo simulation procedure to formally account for the inherent uncertainty in marijuana-related data and parameters. To illustrate the application of the framework, we use Australian data to simulate the impact on consumption of the legalisation of marijuana, which is then subject to taxation. Under the base-case scenario and when the marijuana risk premium is 200%, taxing marijuana at the same rate as tobacco is estimated to yield additional revenue of about 24% of the pre-existing proceeds from taxation of tobacco and alcohol. The role of uncertainty surrounding marijuana is highlighted by providing the entire probability distributions of all endogenous variables in a consistent multivariate framework.","[Clements, Kenneth W.; Lan, Yihui] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Zhao, Xueyan] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",University of Western Australia; Monash University,"Clements, KW (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, M251,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",kclement@biz.uwa.edu.au; ylan@biz.uwa.edu.au; Xueyan.zhao@buseco.monash.edu.au,"Clements, Kenneth William/AAY-8440-2020","Clements, Kenneth William/0000-0002-7776-0724; Zhao, Xueyan/0000-0002-5096-8787; Lan, Yihui/0000-0002-0312-9868",,,,,67,9,9,0,26,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Aim of this research is to determine whether an increase in fuel prices is sufficient enough to raise the market area of intermodal transport to the same degree that would be accomplished by stimulating intermodal transport through policy instruments. Therefore, several fuel price scenarios are analysed in order to verify the impact of different fuel price evolutions on the market area of unimodal road transport compared to intermodal transport in Belgium. The LAMBIT-model (Location Analysis for Belgian Intermodal Terminals), which is a GIS-based model (Macharis and Pekin, 2008), is used to analyse the different fuel price increases and enables a visualisation of the impact on the market area. The LAMBIT model incorporates the different network layers for each transport mode by setting up a GIS network that includes four different layers: the road network, the rail network, the inland waterways network and the final haulage network. The geographic locations of the intermodal terminals and the port of Antwerp are added as nodes in the network and the Belgian municipality centres are defined and connected to the different network layers. Based on the different fuel price scenarios representing respectively a fuel price increase with 10% (low price case), 50% (business as usual case) and 90% (high price case), the results of the LAMBIT model show that the market areas rise in favour of intermodal barge/road and intermodal rail/road. Depending on the scenario, the degree of modal shift however differs. Additionally, in order to compare policy measures with the effect of a fuel price increase, the internalisation of the external costs is analysed with the LAMBIT model. For some years, the European Commission is supporting the idea that transportation costs should reflect the true impacts on environment and society, and is relentlessly pushing towards the so called 'internalisation of external costs' as a policy instrument in order to establish fair and efficient pricing of different transport modes. This requires monetarizing the external effects of transport and adding them to the already internalized costs in order to give the correct price signals. Results of this comparative analysis performed with the LAMBIT model are also presented in this paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead of a step function, we observe a continuous increase of the probability of paid leave of absence with the number of employees. In particular, a lot of establishments have a works councillor in paid leave of absence before the legal threshold and a lot of establishments have no-one far behind the threshold. Contrary, the probability of paid leave of absence for one works councillor sharply increases at the legal threshold for establishments with bad relations between management and works council.","[Mohrenweiser, Jens; Backes-Gellner, Uschi] Univ Zurich, Inst Strategie & Unternehmens Okon, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Mohrenweiser, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Strategie & Unternehmens Okon, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",jens.mohrenweiser@isu.uzh.ch; backes-gellner@isu.uzh.ch,"Backes-Gellner, Uschi/D-6652-2014",,,,,,24,0,0,0,5,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

This article illustrates why such reflection can be important, by showing how different normative frameworks lead to different policy suggestions concerning international labour migration. In a conventional neoclassical economics view, labour migration brings obvious gains to the migrants themselves; 'revealed preferences' is sufficient to know that such gains exist. In a 'happiness studies' perspective, however, those benefits are not nearly as obvious, and a discussion of implications for labour migration policy might come to quite different conclusions. In general, the quality of one's suggestions for policy implications is likely to be enhanced via greater awareness and explicit discussion of the normative positions embedded in such views.","Univ Leicester, Dept Sociol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Bartram, D (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Sociol, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",d.bartram@le.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,6,6,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Over the past 20 years, policies and programs have sought to increase the potential success of these businesses. Yet little is known about the extent to which these policies and programs respond to the specific needs of business owners. Using a mixed-methods approach, the authors investigate the barriers to success that small business owners face, the effectiveness of current policies and programs aimed at serving small businesses, and ways to improve the current system. Focusing on disadvantaged entrepreneurs in New York City, the authors find five primary gaps within the current policy system: a transitional gap, an information gap, and an institutional capacity and service delivery gap. The authors argue that the capital and training needs of small business owners are deeper and more complex than what the current policy system addresses and offer recommendations for improvement.","[Servon, Lisa J.; Rastello, Blaise] Milano New Sch Management & Urban Policy, CDFP, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Fairlie, Robert W.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Seely, Amber] Volunteers Amer, New Orleans, LA USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Servon, LJ (通讯作者)，Milano New Sch Management & Urban Policy, CDFP, 72 5th Ave, New York, NY 10011 USA.",servonl@newschool.edu,,,,,,,27,12,20,0,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The results show a downturn in height, as in many other parts of Europe and America, particularly substantial for those born at the end of the 1830s. At a regional level, however, major differences emerge from the analysis. First of all, a major height difference between recruits from southern and northern states emerges, probably due to the lower population density and to the specialization in dairy farming in the north. Secondly, time trends reveal at least three different patterns, probably related to the different underlying economic structure: in Bavaria, where the production system was more backward and changed relatively little in the early nineteenth century, heights almost stagnated at very low levels for the whole period under study; in the southwest, characterized by a more dynamic proto-industrial structure, height declined in years of declining grain prices and slightly increased when food prices recovered; in the agricultural north, where the peasants were mainly cottagers working on big estates cultivated with intensive practices, the overall decline in height is much less marked than in the southwest, and the trend moves in a countercyclical fashion with respect to food prices. A separate analysis for Prussia reveals a further differentiation between the west and east Elbian regions: the height of eastern Prussians appears to increase during the 1820s and the early 1830s. As the present sample is mainly representative of non-agricultural workers, the positive trend in the east may be due to both an improved food supply, fostered by a stronger application of the agrarian reforms, and a lower degree of competition among industrial workers, due to a delayed dismantling of the guild systems.","Univ Mannheim, MEA Mannheim Res Inst Econ Aging, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Coppola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, MEA Mannheim Res Inst Econ Aging, L 13,17, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",coppola@mea.uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,75,8,8,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1361-4916,,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The complexity arises from connections between their elements, such that a change in one element influences the performance of other elements. Kauffman's NK model offers a way to depict such interdependencies and has therefore often been used in economic investigations of the influence of problem or search decomposition on the attainable results. However, papers on the effect of different decompositions on solution quality come to contradictory conclusions. Some observe an initial advantage of over-modularization where others do not. As they also differ in the employed search procedures, but do not base them on empirical findings, the present paper examines the results of more empirically based search strategies. Using algorithms based on innovation strategies derived from patent data, the paper establishes a clear advantage of correct problem decompositions.","Univ Kassel, D-34109 Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Geisendorf, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, FB 07,Untere Konigsstr 71, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.",s.geisendorf@wirtschaft.uni-kassel.de,,,,,,,44,11,12,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The yield is modeled as the interaction of potential and effort functions, where potential represents maximum yield that would be observed if the effort was infinite. The potential function is determined by some endogenous factors, and the effort function is determined by an exogenous input and allows for increasing and decreasing marginal returns to effort. A non-linear model incorporating these features is theoretically derived and empirically tested using data on outcomes from sales-tax audits. The results document the superiority of this model in capturing the underlying relationships, and provide a better out-of-sample fit to the data compared to two OLS models.

These theories call for a re-assessment of the minimal requirements of rational choice. Here, I consider how an analysis of sequential decision making contributes to this assessment. I criticise Hammond's (Economica 44(176):337-350, 1977; Econ Philos 4:292-297, 1988a; Risk, decision and rationality, 1988b; Theory Decis 25:25-78, 1988c) 'consequentialist' argument for the SEU preference axioms, but go on to formulate a related diachronic-Dutch-book-style' argument that better achieves Hammond's aims. Some deny the importance of Dutch-book sure losses, however, in which case, Seidenfeld's (Econ Philos 4:267-290, 1988a) argument that distinguishes between theories that relax independence and those that relax ordering is relevant. I unravel Seidenfeld's argument in light of the various criticisms of it and show that the crux of the argument is somewhat different and much more persuasive than what others have taken it to be; the critical issue is the modelling of future choices between 'indifferent' decision-tree branches in the sequential setting. Finally, I consider how Seidenfeld's conclusions might nonetheless be resisted.","London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Philosophy Log & Sci Method, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Steele, KS (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Philosophy Log & Sci Method, London, England.",K.Steele@lse.ac.uk,,"Steele, Katie/0000-0003-4042-1822",AHRC [AH/H001166/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/H001166/1] Funding Source: researchfish,AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),,,30,18,22,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2010,68.0,4,,,,,463.0,487,,10.1007/s11238-009-9145-3,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,558CS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274718700006,0

S. firms abroad and thus borrower nations are attractive destinations for U. S. foreign direct investment (FDI). Surprisingly, no study has tested the impact of IMF loans on U. S. FDI. Controlling for common explanations in the literature, we use a treatment effects model and interviews with IMF staff researchers to investigate whether countries under different kinds of IMF programs receive more U. S. FDI than countries not under IMF arrangements. Using panel data for 126 developing countries from 1980 to 2003, we find that IMF borrowers tend to be more attractive to U. S. investors but not all IMF programs have the same effect. Our findings suggest that differences in loan duration, the extent of borrower input in policy decisions, and loan amounts affect borrowers' leverage with the Fund and the U.

Does adult stunting also inflict private costs in traditional societies? Adult stunting penalties or height premiums might only emerge when traditional societies modernize. Here we estimate the association between adult stunting and indicators of adult well-being using data from a panel study in progress among the Tsimane', a foraging-farming society of native Amazonians in Bolivia. Subjects included 248 women and 255 men >= age 22 measured annually during 5 consecutive years (2002-2006). Nine outcomes (wealth, monetary income, illness, access to credit, mirth, schooling, math skills, plant knowledge, forest clearance) were regressed separately against a stunting dummy variable and a wide range of control variables. We found no significant association between any of the indicators of own well-being and adult stunting. Additional analysis showed that stunting bore an association only with poorer mid-arm muscle area. Height premiums and stunting penalties, though evident and marked in modern societies, might not be common in all traditional societies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It also indicates that the sources of over-optimistic assessments of East Asian economies were mainly to be found outside East Asia and included the Bretton Woods Institutions themselves, Western media and analysts. In Korea, weaknesses in risk management were the result of (i) lack of expertise in relation to handling the risks associated with capital flows, and (ii) disincentives to manage risks emanating from a relatively successful history of government-provided safety nets for both industry and banking. Financial liberalisation widened risk-taking opportunities, by allowing Korean financial institutions to both borrow from and lend to institutions outside Korea. It also created additional disincentives for managing risk by intensifying competition and eroding bank franchise values. Weaknesses in prudential regulation allowed bank portfolios to become riskier, especially in terms of increased liquidity risk as a result of maturity mismatches between dollar-denominated assets and liabilities. The liquidity crisis, which followed the re-assessment of the South Korean economy by international lenders in late 1997, triggered a full-blown financial crisis because of the absence of an effective international lender of last resort.","[Amess, Kevin] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Demetriades, Panicos] Univ Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Nottingham; University of Leicester,"Amess, K (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Demetriades, Panicos/K-2279-2019","Demetriades, Panicos/0000-0002-4752-013X; Amess, Kevin/0000-0002-2447-1988",,,,,19,3,3,0,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2010,33.0,2,,,,,212.0,238,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01225.x,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,551WG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274242700003,0

Consequently income typically received as a lump-sum refund on filing a tax return was shifted into the previous year's monthly income.

We argue that these two different characterisations share a definition-identity-outcome frame within which hedge funds are separate and distinct from other financial actors, and engaged in an activity of buying and selling assets with 'real' and fixed risk/return characteristics. To break with this frame, our article makes two discursive moves. First, it counters metaphor with analogy by replacing the metaphor of buying and selling with the analogy of war, drawing on Deleuze and Guattari's concept of 'war machine'. Second, it combines the military analogy of war with our own political and economic concept of conjuncture to emphasise the relevance of space and time in understanding hedge fund practice and performance. These two moves open up a different approach which highlights the interconnectedness of hedge funds with other financial actors, and the increasing difficulty of distinguishing hedge funds from other financial and non-financial companies who now engage in combat using identical strategies. The techniques of shorting and leveraging are presented as weapons not tools because hedge funds are not just active traders, but active manipulators of those trades, when the goal is to 'make the positions work'. We conclude, however, that this strategy becomes more difficult on new terrain as the economic conjuncture shifts from excess liquidity to credit crunch.","[Erturk, Ismail; Leaver, Adam; Williams, Karel] Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Ertürk, I (通讯作者)，Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England.",ismail.erturk@mbs.ac.uk,"Erturk, Ismail/W-4693-2019","Leaver, Adam/0000-0001-6199-6057",,,,,65,17,17,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Anchored in an institutional theory of government action that draws on historical institutionalism, this article finds that cleavages between liberal market economies (US, Britain) and organized market economies (Germany, France) determined the failure to regulate hedge funds in the 1990s, the origins of a self-governance regime in the mid-2000s, as well as the nature of the G20 agreement in 2009. Historical institutionalism offers an important complement to theoretical traditions in international political economy (IPE) that stress the role of states' market power in shaping international regulatory regimes, especially in accounting for how the evolution of state preferences affect the nature of international regulation over time. The article concludes with suggestions for how historical institutionalism can be extended beyond its typical purview in comparative politics to give analytical and substantive nuance to the study of international market regulation.","[Fioretos, Orfeo] Temple Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Fioretos, O (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",,,"Fioretos, Karl Orfeo/0000-0002-2899-8023",,,,,60,65,69,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

A commonly used contract involves the principal paying the agent a percentage of the sale price as commission. With respect to real estate brokerage contracts, it has been argued that percentage commission contracts fail to provide sufficient incentives to the agent. This paper re-evaluates the standard solution to a one seller, one agent agency problem by introducing more than one agent. It is shown that percentage commission contracts can induce first-best effort levels from agents. The result is due to the negative externalities created by the winner-takes-all race among agents. The optimal commission rates in this model are inconsistent, however, with the observed uniformity in commission rates across markets in the USA.","[Fisher, Lynn M.] MIT, Ctr Real Estate, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 01239 USA; [Yavas, Abdullah] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business Adm, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Fisher, LM (通讯作者)，MIT, Ctr Real Estate, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, 77 Massachusetts Ave,W31-310, Cambridge, MA 01239 USA.",lfisher@mit.edu; ayavas@psu.edu,,,,,,,12,16,20,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This paper will not question this standard interpretation of the history of general equilibrium theory, but makes the case that characterizing the 'stability' question in terms of market stability- in particular the stability of the equilibrium price vector in the Walrasian general equilibrium model-actually helped to stabilize the standard model of consumer choice in general equilibrium theory and elsewhere within microeconomics. The problem of the stability of 'consumer's equilibrium' was much discussed early in the twentieth century, and it has recently re-emerged in a different guise as the 'endowment effects' and 'reference dependencies' of contemporary behavioral economics, and yet it disappeared from mainstream discussion during the period 1950 to 1980. This paper argues that shifting the discussion from the intra-agent stability of the individual consumer to the inter-agent stability of the competitive market contributed-despite its ultimately negative impact on general equilibrium theory-to the long period of stable normal science consumer choice theory enjoyed during the middle of the twentieth century.","Univ Puget Sound, Dept Econ, Tacoma, WA 98416 USA",,"Hands, DW (通讯作者)，Univ Puget Sound, Dept Econ, Tacoma, WA 98416 USA.",hands@ups.edu,"Hands, D.

The Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC and the scientific literature have analyzed some low stabilization scenarios but with as yet little attention being given to the regional distribution of the global mitigation costs. Our study helps to fill this gap. While we examine how technological development and international trade affect mitigation costs, this paper is novel in addressing the interaction between both. Simulation results show for instance that reduced revenues from fossil fuel exports in a low stabilization scenario tend to increase mitigation costs borne by the exporting countries, but this impact varies with the technology options available. Furthermore it turns out that the use of biomass in combination with carbon capturing and sequestration is key in order to achieve ambitious CO2 reduction targets. Regions with high biomass potential can clearly benefit from the implementation of low stabilization scenarios due to advantages on the carbon market. This may even hold if a reduced biomass potential is assumed.","[Leimbach, Marian; Baumstark, Lavinia] PIK Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Dept Sustainable Solut, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Bauer, Nico] Paul Scherrer Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lueken, Michael] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Research, Potsdam, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] TU Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Leimbach, M (通讯作者)，PIK Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Dept Sustainable Solut, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",leimbach@pik-potsdam.de,"Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208; Bauer, Nico/0000-0002-0211-4162",,,,,37,48,50,2,24,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2010,31.0,,,,1,,109.0,136,,,,,,28,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,681SC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284336100005,0

The feasibility of this strategy might now be called into question.

Using a panel gravity model, we investigate the interactions of wars, alliances, naval power and trade from the 18th to mid-20th centuries. Striking an alliance with a naval power helps a country's interstate commerce. Fighting a naval power on the other hand limits a country's interstate commerce. Further, we split this effect on trade between an extensive effect (effect on a country's trade when fighting a naval power) and an intensive effect (effect of that power gaining more naval strength). We conclude that the intensive effect is a powerful one - large navies have historically been destroyers of trade when mobilized to combat.

In our views, the competitiveness of enterprises based on Industrial cluster, has been the competition in the industrial chain more than the products (services), therefore, the entry point for upgrading the cluster should not be confined to the lower manufacturing link of the industrial chain, and there should be the non-manufacturing links, which are the most valuable (such as product design, brand, the sharing key technology and marketing networks, etc.).","[Wang Huilong] Shaoxing Univ, Yuanpei Coll, Shaoxing, Peoples R China",Shaoxing University,,,"shaohua, wang/AAB-7904-2022; chi, renyong/H-1741-2012",,,,,,3,0,0,0,6,DONGHUA UNIV PRESS,SHANGHAI,"1882 YAN AN WEST RD, SHANGHAI, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-81111-752-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,180.0,184,,,,,,5,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BVE75,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291325600039,0

Compared with the prevalent methods currently, the chaos model in this paper overcomes their disadvantages that show only the static venture coefficient but not express how to regulate and control ventures dynamically. The numerical example indicates that the effect on the venture yield from every chaos control factor is different in various situations. Thus, to gain the wanted venture yield, it is necessary for enterprises to select appropriate degree of management to different situation, while stronger is not always mean better.","[Xia Yiqun] Shanghai Inst Technol, Sch Econ & Managemen, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,DONGHUA UNIV PRESS,SHANGHAI,"1882 YAN AN WEST RD, SHANGHAI, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-81111-752-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,208.0,210,,,,,,3,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BVE75,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291325600045,0

The difficulty arises because there is a need to make a complete ranking of teams even though each team has a different schedule of games with a different set of opponents. A similar problem arises whenever one wants to establish a ranking of patents or academic journals, etc. This article develops a simple consistent weighted ranking (CWR) scheme in which the importance of (weights on) every success and failure are endogenously determined by the ranking procedure. This consistency requirement does not uniquely determine the ranking, as the ranking also depends on a set of parameters relevant for each problem. For sports rankings, the parameters reflect the importance of winning vs. losing, the strength of schedule, and the relative importance of home vs. away games. Rather than assign exogenous values to these parameters, we estimate them as part of the ranking procedure. The NCAA college football has a special structure that enables the evaluation of each ranking scheme and hence, the estimation of the parameters. Each season is essentially divided into two parts: the regular season and the postseason bowl games. If a ranking scheme is accurate, it should correctly predict a relatively large number of the bowl game outcomes. We use this structure to estimate the four parameters of our ranking function using historical data from the 1999-2003 seasons. Finally, we use the parameters that were estimated and the outcome of the 2004-2006 regular seasons to rank the teams each year for 2004-2006. We then calculate the number of bowl games whose outcomes were correctly predicted following the 2004-2006 season. None of the six ranking schemes used by the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) predicted more bowl games correctly over the 2004-2006 period than our CWR scheme.","[Gandal, Neil] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Publ Policy, Sch Govt & Policy, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Fershtman, Chaim] Tel Aviv Univ, Eitan Berglas Sch Econ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Fainmesser, Itay] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Tel Aviv University; Tel Aviv University; Harvard University,"Gandal, N (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Publ Policy, Sch Govt & Policy, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",gandal@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,10,9,10,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

S. cities. High-income households, driven by a high demand for housing services, tend to locate in areas of the city where the housing stock is relatively young. Because cities develop and redevelop from the center outward over time, the location of these neighborhoods varies over the city's history. The model predicts a suburban location for the rich in an initial period, when young dwellings are found only in the suburbs, while predicting eventual gentrification once central redevelopment creates a young downtown housing stock. Controlling for other determinants of where the poor live (e. g., proximity to amenities and public transit), empirical work indicates that if the influence of spatial variation in dwelling ages were eliminated, central-city/suburban disparities in neighborhood economic status would be reduced by up to 10 percentage points. Model estimates further predict that between 2000 and 2020, central-city/suburban differences in economic status will narrow in cities of all sizes, and especially in the larger metropolitan areas as American cities become more gentrified.","[Brueckner, Jan K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Rosenthal, Stuart S.] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Syracuse University,"Brueckner, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",,,,,,,,26,173,218,4,61,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

In the background were expanding macroeconomic imbalances that leading states had neglected to address. Spawned by imprudence and regulatory failures, the crisis soon deepened and the collaborative impulse that might have prompted earlier and more fundamental macro-policy action became focused on emergency management. Ad hoc policy co-ordination ensued as liquidity was injected into turbulent markets and troubled financial intermediaries were recapitalized or reorganized. The collective performance was inelegant, not least inside the European Union. The crisis shed a harsh spotlight on the weak fiscal foundations of the Union and on the now-pressing need for collaborative adjustments in national macroeconomic policies. Since overt political innovation on such matters remains difficult, both within Europe and globally, the crisis underlined the crucial importance of much better collaborative instruments for the oversight and stabilization of integrating financial markets.","Univ Toronto, Munk Ctr Int Studies, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada",University of Toronto,"Pauly, LW (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Munk Ctr Int Studies, 1 Devonshire Pl, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada.",louis.pauly@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,44,31,35,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In the first half of the 19th century, the real wage stagnated while output per worker expanded. The profit rate doubled and the share of profits in national income expanded at the expense of labour and land. After the middle of the 19th century, real wages began to grow in line with productivity, and the profit rate and factor shares stabilized. An integrated model of growth and distribution is developed to explain these trends. The model includes an aggregate production function that explains the distribution of income, while a savings function in which savings depended on property income governs accumulation. Simulations with the model show that technical progress was the prime mover behind the industrial revolution. Capital accumulation was a necessary complement. The surge in inequality was intrinsic to the growth process: technical change increased the demand for capital and raised the profit rate and capital's share. The rise in profits, in turn, sustained the industrial revolution by financing the necessary capital accumulation. After the middle of the 19th century, accumulation had caught up with the requirements of technology and wages rose in line with productivity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This paper analyzes the expansion of China's railway network, the evolution of its spatial accessibility, and the impacts on economic growth and urban systems over a time span of about one century (1906-2000). First, major historical events and policies and their effects on railway development in China are reviewed and grouped into four major eras: preliminary construction, network skeleton, corridor building, and deep intensification. All four eras followed a path of inland expansion. Second, spatial distribution of accessibility and its evolution are analyzed. The spatial structure of China's railway network is characterized by concentric rings with its major axis in North China and the most accessible city gradually migrating from Tianjin to Zhengzhou. Finally, the study indicates that railway network expansion has significantly improved economic development and heavily influenced the formation of urban systems in China. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We first develop a theoretical model, where labour supply and transfers are jointly determined. We then estimate labour supply and transfers jointly, using unique data on labour supply of teenagers, the wages they receive, and the transfers from their parents. We show how these two processes depend on each other, and how transfers and labour supply react to changes in wages.","[Dustmann, Christian] UCL, London, England; [Micklewright, John] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [van Soest, Arthur] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",University of London; University College London; University of Southampton; Tilburg University,"Dustmann, C (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",c.dustmann@ucl.ac.uk; j.micklewright@soton.ac.uk; A.H.O.vanSoest@uvt.nl,"van Soest, A/AGL-3772-2022","van Soest, A/0000-0002-4765-8382",,,,,30,12,13,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

It demonstrates that the entry of a foreign firm often lowers domestic welfare. This results because the public firm locates largely independently of the presence of the foreign firm and because the profit earned by the foreign firm reduces domestic welfare. Privatization of the public firm typically lowers domestic welfare but can increase global welfare. Thus, domestic governments are unlikely to allow foreign entry and when they do, they are unlikely to privatize the public firm despite the potential rise in global welfare. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Investment is also sensitive to measures of financial market frictions, suggesting that constraints on retention of cash flow distort investment decisions. Liquidity is managed through dividend policy and access to short-term bank finance, in which bank lines of credit smooth variation in available cash flow and accelerate investment. Using the Kaplan-Zingales method for measuring the degree of financial constraint, we identify substantial differences between investment and liquidity management policies of firms, in which more (less) financially constrained firms in our sample exhibit high (low) investment and liquidity management sensitivity to variables that measure financial market frictions.","[Riddiough, Timothy J.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Wu, Zhonghua] Florida Int Univ, Sch Business, Miami, FL 33199 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Riddiough, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",triddiough@bus.wisc.edu; wuz@fiu.edu,,,,,,,39,41,48,0,20,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2009,37.0,3,,,,,447.0,481,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00248.x,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,489AO,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269392000004,0

In a horse race of alternative forecasting models, participants' forecasts significantly outperform economic variables in predicting vote shares and are comparable in predictive power to a measure of incumbency status. Participants' forecasts seem to rest on judgments of candidates' personal attributes (such as likability) rather than inferences about candidates' policy positions.

The manufacturing sector contributes around 40 per cent of the GDP in the Chinese economy, and the cultural, educational and sporting product manufacturing industry has a significant proportion of FDI activities, and firms in this sector are active in exporting. Through the empirical exercise, we find that there exist export spillovers from FDI in the industry, for which the magnitude depends on firms' geographical location, sale cost and revenue ratio, and ownership structure. On average, domestic firms located in Western China suffer from a foreign presence, irrespective of whether they are privately owned or state and collectively owned. For firms in Central China, both the privately owned and state and collectively owned firms appear to benefit from foreign presence. Regarding firms located in Coastal China, the privately owned firms suffer from the foreign presence, while in contrast the state and collectively owned firms benefit from the foreign presence. In addition, in this industry there are more firms that benefit from the presence of FDI than those that suffer, which to some extent justifies the government's policy to attract the FDI inflow.","James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia",James Cook University,"Sun, SZ (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",,,"Sun, Sizhong/0000-0001-8430-915X",,,,,9,53,54,0,27,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2009,32.0,8,,,,,1203.0,1222,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01175.x,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,472BT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268104800004,0

Unlike previous investigations, which have been limited to an examination of linear effects, this one finds that height influences on wages are curvilinear, and more so for men than for women. More specifically, it finds that women who are shorter than average and men who are somewhat taller than average, but not among the tallest, enjoy significant wage advantages. Furthermore, using Blinder's decomposition to determine two components of wage differences, we find that these differences can be partitioned into an endowment component and unexplained influences (discrimination). There is a difference between the public and private sectors and between men and women as to the degree of the latter effect. This investigation supports the hypothesis that short and very tall men employed in the private sector are disadvantaged the most. The outcome for women is less robust than for men.

It identifies and elaborates the 'minimization of uncovered cost' as a reasonable objective for this purpose and develops a simple but theoretically grounded tool to decide whether or not the number of tourists should be increased (by changing the user fees) to achieve that objective. Empirically, the study assesses the potential revenue from tourism and the current position in this regard and uses this information in judging the desirability of increasing fees. On the basis of a 'willingness to pay' survey of tourists, it seemed that tourist numbers Would be reduced by half if higher entry fees were charged - and the higher fee would not have much effect on total revenue. However, the current institutional structure of the wildlife park, despite well-defined state ownership and strict enforcement of forest regulations, is not conducive to the implementation of this policy of revenue maximization compatible with environmental conservation.","Ctr Dev Studies, Trivandrum 695011, Kerala, India",,"Santhakumar, V (通讯作者)，Ctr Dev Studies, Trivandrum 695011, Kerala, India.",santhakumar@cds.ac.in,,,,,,,17,5,5,0,19,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"COLERIDGE HOUSE, 4-5 COLERIDGE GARDENS, LONDON NW6 3QH, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The study also provides more reasonable estimates of McCallum's estimated border effect in United States-Canada trade.","[An, Galina] Kenyon Coll, Dept Econ, Gambier, OH 43022 USA; [Puttitanun, Thitima] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",University System of Ohio; Kenyon College; California State University System; San Diego State University,"An, G (通讯作者)，Kenyon Coll, Dept Econ, Gambier, OH 43022 USA.",,,,,,,,18,3,4,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The analysis is based on the intertemporal approach to the current account which states that if real exports and real imports are integrated of order one then cointegration between them is a necessary and sufficient condition for the economy to satisfy its intertemporal budget constraint. On the basis of various unit-root and cointegration tests on the shares of real exports and imports in real GDP, this study concludes that the Czech Republic and Slovenia are not in violation of their intertemporal budget constraint and their trade imbalances are sustainable. However, the real exports and imports of these countries, and also the export, import measures of Hungary, do not seem to behave as random walks, excluding the possibility of cointegration between them.","La Trobe Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"Kónya, L (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",L.Konya@latrobe.edu.au,"Konya, Laszlo/C-3118-2008","Konya, Laszlo/0000-0001-5613-7258",,,,,16,16,16,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Expenditures for one student per year or the proportion of students per 100 inhabitants rank among other important indicators. This paper deals with the analysis of public expenditures, which were directed at the sphere of education using the latest available data of EUROSTAT. Information from 26 EU countries and Norway was used. A linear regression model was compiled with three predictors and the interpreted variable of expenditure for a student. This model originated on the basis of the wider range of indicators using step regression and the rate of its determination amounted to about 90%.

Increased flows of LNG into the United States and the potential sensitivity of these shipments to price differentials between Europe and North America suggests the possibility of a strengthening relationship between natural gas prices on these two continents. At the same time, there is considerable evidence linking natural gas price movements in Europe and North America to those for crude oil. Accordingly, we use a series of econometric tests to determine whether the co-movement between natural gas prices in Europe and North America is mediated through crude oil prices or is being shaped directly by gas-to-gas arbitrage.","[Brown, Stephen R.

The paper undertakes an economic analysis of oil extraction that explicitly represents the conditions and constraints that influence the decisions of a firm. This microeconomic analysis diverges from conventional, Hotelling macroeconomic models of nonrenewable-resource extraction and has substantially different findings. Optimality conditions such as Hotelling's rule or first-order conditions are not utilized in defining accounting statistics. Contrary to the findings of many studies, it is found that traditional (non-green) accounting practice for commercial natural resources such as petroleum sensibly balances the aims of economic accounting. Instead, adjustments to practice are most needed for non-commercial values such as pollution or amenities.","McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H4X 1R4, Canada",McGill University,"Cairns, RD (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, 855 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H4X 1R4, Canada.",robert.cairns@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,23,8,9,0,11,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,30.0,4,,,,,113.0,139,,,,,,27,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,500HU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270290500004,0

This framework is applied to specify and estimate models of household demand for conventional gasoline cars and alternative fuel vehicles in Shanghai based on rank-ordered data obtained from a stated preference survey. Subsequently, the framework is extended to allow for random effects in the utility specification to allow for intrapersonal correlation in tastes across stated preference questions. The preferred model is then used to calculate demand probabilities and elasticities and the distribution of willingness-to-pay for alternative fuel vehicles. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The more severe age wave and lower income in rural area pose challenges to the vulnerable rural household support system. The separation of old age security system between rural and urban areas also puts great pressure on the urbanization of landless farmers.

The results provide compelling evidence against the model-free forecast for three Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, over a 2001 - 2006 evaluation period. In contrast, the at-the-money implied volatility forecast is given strong support for the three equities over this period. Neither benchmark is supported for the S&P500 index. Importantly, the main qualitative results are invariant to the method of noise correction used in measuring future volatility.

Most often, the existence of the equilibrium is left unexplored. By examining decision making by governments that make only constrained efficient choices, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of equilibria when there are multiple policy instruments, multiple mobile factors and many different production processes. Convexity of the minimum Cost function, dual to the factor preferences and production function primitives, is sufficient to ensure the existence of equilibrium. We also find that equilibrium may not exist because of the economies of scale inherent in provision of public goods which benefit mobile factors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, the article addresses the question of whether South East Europe is a potential asset or liability to the enlarged EU. SEE countries are quite diverse in terms of levels of competitiveness, with visible effects on the role of RD, which is confirmed by analysis of RD demand and supply factors. Improvements in the national innovation systems of SEE countries have largely taken place through vertical linkages on the supply and demand sides. However, a wider role for RD will depend increasingly on the strength of horizontal linkages within national systems of innovation and their key agentthe local innovative business enterprise sector. This calls for a rethinking of science and technology policy, traditionally defined as a sectoral activity.","UCL, Sch Slavon & E European Studies, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Radosevic, S (通讯作者)，UCL, Sch Slavon & E European Studies, London WC1E 6BT, England.",s.radosevic@ucl.ac.uk,"Radosevic, Slavo/AAH-6516-2019","Radosevic, Slavo/0000-0001-7905-2281",,,,,47,8,9,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2009,61.0,4,,,,,621.0,650,PII 911202007,10.1080/09668130902826212,0.0,,,30,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,445WY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266083400003,0

This notion is generally useful to describe a capital market in which is relevant information. If relevant information is completely processed by the capital market price mechanism then such capital market is called to be efficient. Thus the capital market efficiency accentuates the informational efficiency of capital markets. It means that in the efficient capital market investors cannot expect achieving of enormous returns by long time. In. other words, the capital market is efficient if the fluctuations of returns in time are unpredictable, Thus a time series of such fluctuations can be generated by some derivations of Brownian motion. Considering long range macroeconomic forces which are non-extensive, we use Tsallis's approach for maximum entropy formulating. By this way it is possible to obtain fat tailed distributions by power laws optimizing Tsallis's entropy and to give some theoretical base to some stylized facts on capital markets. For the estimating of the capital market efficiency is used the notion Tsallis entropy (information gain).",,,,vosvrda@utia.cas.cz,"Vosvrda, Miloslav/G-8956-2014","Vosvrda, Miloslav/0000-0001-9821-9059",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,340.0,345,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900062,0

The proximate cause of the economic crisis was the collapse of the housing bubble that caused both the recession that began at the end of 2007 and the financial crisis that erupted in 2008. The drop in GDP in the USA, while steep, was not more severe than in most of the other OECD countries and the macroeconomic policy response was better. Yet the increase in the US unemployment rate was among the steepest.

We argue that this approach does not consider the biases introduced by effects that overlap the zone of capitalization for nonmarket goods. We show this bias can dominate the usual omitted variable bias using data on developer-provided open space. We control for multiscale capitalization and omitted variables simultaneously by extending the Hausman-Taylor estimator where the panel component of the estimator is defined over repeated transactions within neighborhoods rather than the traditional definition following a unique cross-sectional unit through time.,"[Abbott, Joshua K.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Klaiber, H.

We demonstrate this by referring to an example taken from environmental sociology. The effect of wealth on individuals' willingness to pay for environmental protection is controversially discussed in the literature. Studies analyzing the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) report that individuals in wealthier nations are more concerned about the environment, while studies using the World Values Survey (WVS) or the European Values Study (EVS) come up with the opposite finding. The puzzle is resolved when the different levels of acquiescence are taken into consideration. As it turns out, respondents in poorer nations in Asia and Eastern Europe have higher levels of acquiescence than respondents in richer Western nations. Thus, acquiescence conceals the wealth effect of studies analyzing the WVS or EVS and the issue is resolved when acquiescence is properly controlled for in multivariate statistical models.","[Franzen, Axel; Vogl, Dominikus] Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, CH-3000 Bern 9, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Franzen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, Lerchenweg 36, CH-3000 Bern 9, Switzerland.",franzen@soz.unibe.ch; vogl@soz.unibe.ch,"Franzen, Axel/AAV-3583-2021",,,,,,25,2,2,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The stochastic volatility in mean (SVM) models that we use allow for gathering innovations to inflation uncertainty and assess the effect of inflation volatility shocks on inflation over time. When we assess the interaction between inflation and its volatility, the empirical findings indicate that response of inflation to inflation volatility is positive and statistically significant.

Unfortunately, the effects of distances to amenities on housing prices are generally not consistent indicators of the true price impact of that amenity. Instead these variables serve as proxies for the relative position of every observation in space. Whenever a household considers more than two landmarks in a housing purchase, distance variable parameter estimates are simply the best linear fitted weights for that multiple criteria location decision. Simulations illustrate extreme sensitivity in parameter estimates to the researcher's choice of landmarks. One strategy models the location of each observation directly instead of its distances to amenities.

We pursue two notions of partial cooperative equilibria that follow a modification of Nash's best response rationality rather than a core-like approach. Partial cooperative Nash equilibrium treats non-cooperative players and the coalition of cooperators symmetrically, while the notion of partial cooperative leadership equilibrium assumes that the group of cooperators has a first-mover advantage. We prove existence theorems for both types of equilibria. We look at three well-known applications under partial cooperation. In a game of voluntary provision of a public good we show that our two new equilibrium notions of partial cooperation coincide. In a modified Cournot oligopoly, we identify multiple equilibria of each type and show that a non-cooperator may have a higher payoff than a cooperator. In contrast, under partial cooperation in a symmetric Salop City game, a cooperator enjoys a higher return.","[Lazarova, Emiliya A.] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Chakrabarti, Subhadip; Gilles, Robert P.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland",University of Birmingham; Queens University Belfast,"Lazarova, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, JG Smith Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",s.chakrabarti@qub.ac.uk; r.gilles@qub.ac.uk; e.a.lazarova@bham.ac.uk,"LAZAROVA, EMILIYA/AAI-6647-2020","Lazarova, Emiliya/0000-0002-7178-0644",,,,,23,6,6,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2011,71.0,2,,,,,175.0,193,,10.1007/s11238-011-9246-7,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,791HN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292655900003,0

On the theoretical side, the paper adds to the existing results on non-parametric bounds on quantiles with no prior information and under monotone treatment response (MTR) by introducing and studying the identifying properties of alpha-quantile monotone treatment selection (alpha-QMTS), alpha-quantile monotone instrumental variables (alpha-QMIV) and their combinations. The main result parallels that for the mean; MTR and alpha-QMTS aid identification in a complementary fashion, so that combining them greatly increases identification power. The theoretical results are illustrated through an empirical application on the Italian returns to educational qualifications. Bounds on several quantiles of ln(wage) under different qualifications and on quantile treatments effects (QTE) are estimated and compared with parametric quantile regression (alpha-QR) and alpha-IVQR estimates from the same sample. Remarkably, the alpha-QMTS & MTR upper bounds on the alpha-QTE of a college degree versus elementary education imply smaller year-by-year returns than the corresponding alpha-IVQR point estimates.

The model for schooling choice is assumed to be an ordered probit model, whereas the earnings equation contains variables that are flexible transformations of schooling and experience, with corresponding coefficients that are allowed to be heterogeneous across individuals. Under the assumption that the distribution of the random terms of the model can be expressed as a finite mixture of multinormal distributions, we show that the joint probability distribution for schooling and earnings can be expressed on closed form. In an application of our method on Norwegian data, we find that the mixed Gaussian model offers a substantial improvement in fit to the (heavy-tailed) empirical distribution of log-earnings compared to a multinormal benchmark model.

Social interactions between households and between individuals potentially have an influence on a wide range of the long-term and short-term choices involved in these systems. In this paper we identify the areas in which social interactions play a role and address the question how these influences can be modelled in the context of agent-based LUTI models. We distinguish impacts on activity participation (joint activity participation, support-and-help activities) and impacts on decision making (information exchange, social adaptation of preferences and aspirations) as the two main areas of social influence. A prototype of a LUTI model is proposed that accounts for impacts of the social network on longer-term mobility decision making through information exchange and social adaptation of preferences and aspirations. The model is demonstrated in a numerical simulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, several recent papers have investigated whether GARCH effects exist in the U.S. housing market, as changes in house prices can have far-ranging impacts on defaults, foreclosures, tax revenues and the values of mortgage-backed securities. Some research in finance indicates that the conditional variance of some assets exhibits far greater persistence, or even long memory, than is accounted for in standard GARCH models. If house prices do indeed have this very persistent volatility, properly estimating the conditional variance to allow for such persistence is crucial for optimal portfolio management. We examine a number of U.S. metropolitan areas, and find that, for those with significant GARCH effects, more than half indeed exhibit the very high persistence found in other assets such as equities. We also find that, for those markets exhibiting such persistent volatility, C-GARCH models typically do a better job in forecasting than standard GARCH models. Moreover, there is some tentative evidence that metro areas with the fastest appreciation may be most likely to have such long memory conditional variance. These findings should help in improving risk management, through, for instance the construction of better-specified value-at-risk models.","Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA",Wichita State University,"Miles, W (通讯作者)，Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, 1845 Fairmt, Wichita, KS 67260 USA.",william.miles@wichita.edu,,,,,,,16,18,19,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We exploit a natural experiment that takes place on most college campuses in the US - randomized roommate assignments. While previous studies suggest that having an obese spouse, friend, or sibling increases one's likelihood of becoming obese, these social interactions are clearly non-random. We collect data from female students living on campus at a private Midwestern university at the beginning and end of their first year of college. Our findings suggest that the amount of weight gained during the freshman year is strongly and negatively correlated to the roommate's initial weight. Further, our analysis of behaviors suggests that female students adopt some of their roommates' weight-loss behaviors which cause them to gain less weight than they otherwise would have. In particular, we find evidence that this effect may be through influences in eating, exercise, and use of weight loss supplements. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

This paper develops an alternative semi-parametric method for forecasting that does not rely on this convention and applies it to the problem of forecasting asset return volatility. In this approach, a forecast is a weighted average of historical volatility, with the greatest weight given to periods that exhibit similar market conditions to the time at which the forecast is being formed. Weighting is determined by comparing short-term trends in volatility across time (as a measure of market conditions) by means of a multivariate kernel scheme. It is found that the semi-parametric method produces forecasts that are significantly more accurate than a number of competing approaches at both short and long forecast horizons.","[Becker, Ralf] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Clements, Adam E.; Hurn, Stan] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",University of Manchester; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Becker, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",ralf.becker@manchester.ac.uk; a.clements@qut.edu.au; s.hurn@qut.edu.au,"Clements, Adam E/I-9812-2012","Clements, Adam/0000-0002-4232-0323; Hurn, Stan/0000-0002-6134-7943",,,,,30,4,4,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The author introduces a framework to address this question that draws attention to the social forces and power dynamics at play in determining what standards of legitimacy apply. Rather than beginning with a focus on democratic legitimacy, which pre-judges what legitimacy requires, the framework posits that what constitutes legitimacy results from an interaction of communities who must accept the authority of the institution with broader legitimating norms and discourses - or social structure - that prevail in the relevant issue area. To illustrate its plausibility, the framework is applied to a comparison of intergovernmental and non-state institutions in the social and environmental issue area: the intergovernmental Kyoto Protocol on climate change and members of the non-state International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labeling Alliance, an umbrella organization created to develop agreement on 'best practices' for its members. Implications of the findings for legitimacy of global economic governance are also explored.","Univ Toronto, Ctr Int Studies, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Bernstein, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Ctr Int Studies, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,107,245,273,5,145,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This paper constructs and compares new measures of the prevalence, depth and severity of both mild and extreme underweight in children from three months to three years of age, as measured by 130 DHS surveys for 53 countries over a period from 1986 to 2006. We find that variance in mild underweight has a larger and more robust correlation with child mortality than variance in severe underweight, and is itself more closely correlated with local agricultural output, over a wide range of regression specifications. We conclude that the prevalence of mild underweight deserves greater attention as a useful signal of changing public health conditions among preschool children in developing countries.

In 2006, the Queensland Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation (Qld DEEDI), the Indonesian government and Bioversity International commenced an Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) project which included a study of the geographical distribution of Foc in Indonesia. Relationships that existed between different banana varieties and Foc VCGs were also assessed. We consulted two global databases that contain records of Foc disease samples: the Qld DEEDI database and that maintained at the University of Florida in Homestead. Information from these sources suggested that: (i) Most varieties are susceptible to tropical race 4 (TR4) (VCG 01213); (ii) 'Gros Michel' (AAA), 'Silk' (AAB) and 'Saba' (ABB) are each susceptible to several VCGs; (iii) Some varieties tend to have certain VCGs associated with them; and (iv) 'Sucrier' (AA) and 'Lakatan' (AAA) are only affected by TR4. Although a greater understanding of these relationships would require pathogenicity studies with representative isolates of the different VCGs, these observations reinforce prior concerns over VCG 01213 and its continued spread in Asia. Future collections of this pathogen should be accompanied by photos of the sample plant to ensure that varieties are identified correctly.","[Daniells, J.

The familiar max- min transitivity condition is a member of this family, but there are infinitely many others. Restricting attention to fuzzy aggregation rules that satisfy counterparts of unanimity and independence of irrelevant alternatives, we characterise the set of triangular norms that permit preference aggregation to be non-dictatorial.

Were African colonial states ruled by near absolutist governments who strived to maximize revenue extraction in order to strengthen their grip on native African societies? Or did European powers build 'states without substance', governed with minimal resources and effort, failing to invest in basic public goods? This paper develops an analytical framework for comparing colonial tax and spending patterns and applies it to eight British African colonies (1880-1940). We show that colonial fiscal systems did not adhere to a uniform logic, that minimalism prevailed in West Africa, extractive features were more pronounced in East Africa, and that Mauritius revealed characteristics of a developmental state already before 1940.

Findings Low efficiency in resource possession, literature utilization and internal management exists in library systems in China. Immiserizing growth in service capacity, incremental loss in literature utilization and the curse of the stock of resource possession are also widespread in libraries, which is worrisome. The results of estimating service-efficiency loss show that the service-efficiency loss is often so high that the average loss rate in Chinese public libraries is 57.9. Information defect, intensified monopolization, external assessment and non-excludability as well as property rights and investment systems are all factors contributing to library-service efficiency loss in China. However, in general, through updating management philosophy, optimizing literature structures, promoting the circulation of documents in stock and enhancing efficiency assessment, the loss of library service efficiency can be effectively controlled in China. Practical implications On the basis of the status of library management in China, in order to search methods to reduce conflicts between demand and use of literatures, the general phenomenon of poor service efficiency of libraries and the problem of service-efficiency loss of libraries in China have been empirically analyzed and verified. This research could provide the opportunity to change the status of non-efficiency in utilization of resources and to enhance good library management in China. Originality and value - This research employed statistics and economics to analyze empirically and econometrically about service-efficiency loss of libraries in China.

THE CONTRIBUTION OF TWO FRENCH INSTITUTIONALIST SCHOOLS,HISTORY OF ECONOMIC IDEAS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNCERTAINTY,"The analyses produced by the French 'regulationist' and 'conventionalist' schools of economic theory both complement and contradict each other. Adherents of the regulationist school fear that convention theory's 'soft consensualism' will cause it to lose its Marxist-Keynesian radicalism, while the conventionalists, on the other hand, seek to persuade the regulationists that they alone hold the microeconomic key to the relative theoretical impasse in which the latter are said to find themselves. It is absolutely essential for heterodox economics to have at its disposal an alternative theory of action with which to counter the homo oeconomicus of neoclassical economics, which underpins the dominant mode of economic theorizing. Such a theory is lacking in both the regulationist and conventionalist schools, and is ultimately the missing piece in the heterodox jigsaw puzzle, without which radical institutionalism is condemned to remain a theoretical archipelago without any real power in the face of the neoclassical continent. We will investigate how, without always fully accepting it, these two schools point towards a common theory of economic action, for which we will attempt to prepare the ground.","[Postel, Nicolas; Sobel, Richard] Univ Lille 1, CLERSE, CNRS, UMR 0819, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille,"Postel, N (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 1, CLERSE, CNRS, UMR 0819, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",nicolas.postel@univ-lille1.fr; richard.sobel@univ-lille1.fr,,,,,,,80,3,3,0,7,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

We estimate a Bayesian VAR model with informative steady-state priors for the Colombian economy using quarterly data from 1995 to 2007. A variance decomposition shows that world GDP growth and government spending are the most important factors, explaining roughly 17 and 16 per cent of the variance in Colombian GDP growth respectively. The model, which is shown to forecast well out-of-sample, can also be used to analyse alternative scenarios. Generating both endogenous and conditional forecasts, we show that the impact on Colombian GDP growth of a substantial downturn in world GDP growth would be non-negligible but that the decline still would be mild by historical standards.","[Abrego, Lisandro] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Osterholm, Par] Natl Inst Econ Res, Stockholm, Sweden",International Monetary Fund,"Abrego, L (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,"Österholm, Pär/ABD-8486-2020","Österholm, Pär/0000-0002-4840-7649",,,,,14,3,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2010,33.0,12,,,,,1788.0,1810,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01288.x,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,700SN,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285764700006,0

This implies that the household structure - i.e. the (average) household size, the composition, the relative share of different household types, and the number of households - differs across cities. This aspect is usually completely neglected in urban models used to study economic and policy issues that arise in today's cities. Furthermore, the household structure might change over time. For instance, over the last decades average household size has decreased in many countries. Several implications of this change have been discussed, but usually not in regard to an urban economy with its interdependencies. We develop an applied urban general equilibrium model (based on Anas and Xu, 1999 or Anas and Rhee, 2006) which explicitly takes the household structure into account and thus allows studying the impacts of differences in the household structure on urban areas. The paper shows that the household structure affects an urban economy and its spatial pattern in various ways and may contribute to explain economic and spatial effects on cities and differences across cities. Compared to a 'Base City' which reflects the actual household structure in the United States, urban labor force participation, housing demand, rents, wages as well as urban commuting and shopping patterns are considerably affected by, e.g., differences in the average household size in a city. For instance, wage inequality between differently skilled workers raises and extreme cross commuting drops to almost zero when the city turns into a 'Singles City'. Hence, pure economic forces associated with the household structure may shape cities in a different way, implying that the impacts of urban policies may depend on the household structure and therefore differ across cities.

The authors analyze national surveys of 700 to 1,000 local governments from 1994, 1999, and 2004 to track use of business incentives over time. They find a shift from primary reliance on business incentives to use of a broader set of strategies that includes business retention and small business support. The authors also find evidence of policy learning with increased attention to accountability among governments that use business incentives. The 2004 model results also suggest that governments that rely most heavily on incentives may face more intergovernmental competition, stagnating or declining economies, and lower tax bases. For such governments, business incentives may contribute to a cycle of destructive competition.","[Zheng, Lingwen; Warner, Mildred] Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Warner, M (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, W Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",mew15@cornell.edu,,"Warner, Mildred/0000-0002-0109-338X",,,,,64,71,92,2,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Recommendations are theorized to have two effects: they can create a focal point for final bargaining positions, and they can decrease outcome uncertainty should dispute persist. While the focal point effect may lower dispute rates, the uncertainty reduction effect is predicted to do the opposite for risk-averse bargainers. Which of these effects dominates is of critical importance in the design of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures, which are increasingly utilized in a variety of settings. We theoretically examine the effects of recommendations on the contract zone using a framework which allows bargainers' final positions to influence a binding outcome should negotiations fail. This provides a more stringent test of focal points than previously considered. We also present data from controlled laboratory experiments consistent with our model. Recommendations are empirically shown to influence final bargaining positions and negotiated settlement values. In fact, recommendations significantly reduce dispute rates, even where they are completely ignored in final-stage arbitration. This highlights a potentially significant role for the use of nonbinding procedures, such as mediation, as a preliminary stage in more efficient ADR procedures.","[Dickinson, David L.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Hunnicutt, Lynn] Pacific Lutheran Univ, Dept Econ, Tacoma, WA 98447 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; Pacific Lutheran University,"Dickinson, DL (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",dickinsondl@appstate.edu; hunnicutt@plu.edu,,,,,,,31,6,6,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2010,69.0,4,,,,,615.0,634,,10.1007/s11238-009-9156-0,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,652ED,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281983400008,0

Which causal relationships should be explained? Which theory should be used? In answering these questions, the article forwards a conceptualization of Europeanization based on Historical Sociology and Social Constructivism, which implies a departure from the practice in the current Europeanization literature to concentrate on the contemporary with a narrow focus (EU-ization) at the expense of the historical with a broad focus (Europeanization). It is suggested that the causal relationships to be explained are the transfer of European ideas across time and space using a 'present-as-reality' definition of the European idea set. In doing so, it becomes apparent that Europeanization cannot be accepted as either static or something that is solely connected to the EU, and that Europeanization has been characterized by diffusion patterns going both into and out of Europe and sociological processes involving subtle shifts in process, structure, agents and conceptions of 'Other' and 'Significant We'.","Danish Inst Int Studies, DK-1401 Copenhagen, Denmark",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies,"Flockhart, T (通讯作者)，Danish Inst Int Studies, Strandgade 71, DK-1401 Copenhagen, Denmark.",tfl@diis.dk,,"Flockhart, Trine/0000-0002-3709-2493",,,,,49,55,62,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In doing so, we include the Financial Perspective 2000-2006, which has not been analysed before. Secondly, we address the problem of endogeneity in a panel context by basing the identification on internal instruments via a system GMM estimator. Finally, we control for spatial spillover effects by applying a spatial panel econometric estimator. Our results show that Objective 1 payments in particular do, in fact, promote regional economic growth, whereas the total amount of Objectives 1, 2, and 3 do not have a positive and significant impact on the EU regions' growth rates.

First, inflations of 22 OECD countries have a common factor that accounts for nearly 70% of their variance. This comovement is due not only to the trend components of inflation (up from 1960 to 1980 and down thereafter) but also to fluctuations at business cycle frequencies. Second, there is a robust error correction mechanism that brings national inflation rates back to global inflation. A simple model that accounts for this feature consistently beats standard benchmarks in forecasting inflation four to eight quarters ahead across samples and countries.","[Ciccarelli, Matteo] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Mojon, Benoit] Banque France, Paris, France",European Central Bank; European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Ciccarelli, M (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,38,186,195,2,24,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The turning point occurred in the 1930s when to stay in power, the Conservatives in the Pampas resorted to electoral fraud, which neither the legislative, executive, or judicial branches checked. The decade of unchecked electoral fraud led to the support for Juan Peron and subsequently to political and economic instability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The model is tested on a panel of firm- and plant-level data from Norwegian manufacturing industries. The results indicate a frequent presence of moderate pro-cyclical markups. Labour adjustment costs are present in four out of seven sectors but small in magnitude.

We employ a new micro-founded measure of bilateral trade costs based on a standard model of trade in differentiated goods to address this question. These trade costs gauge the difference between observed bilateral trade and frictionless trade. They comprise tariffs, transportation costs, and all other factors that impede international trade but which are inherently difficult to observe. Trade costs fell on average by 10-16 percent between 1870 and 1913. We also use this measure to decompose the growth of trade over that period and find that roughly 44 percent of the rise in trade within our sample can be explained by reductions in trade costs: the remaining 56 percent is attributable to economic expansion.

While the use of state trading was modified by China's accession to the WTO, state trading still dominates for some commodities, even though there have been recent attempts to diminish its importance. In this paper, we analyse the potential trade distorting effect of COFCO on market access and export competition by drawing on some recent research on the impact of STEs on agricultural trade.

Mixtures of ordered probability models which control for unobserved heterogeneity are estimated for both male and female respondents for two age groups: those between age 25 and 49 and those aged 50 or older in 2001. The main result is that educational attainments depend significantly less on family background variables for the younger cohorts. This is a qualitatively different result from what Canadian sociologists have found. They argue that there is little mobility in the Canadian educational system which has remained much as it was at the beginning of the twentieth century.

Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia cherished an idea of making China an alternative economic partner. However, after 1989, China perceived these states as minor, almost unimportant partners, regardless of their efforts. Their profile was raised by EU accession but there was little change in their strength in terms of bilateral relations with China.

The trading price increase or the net asset value(NAV) decrease would narrow CEF discounts. However, fund investors achieve excess returns by investing in CEFs at deep discounts only if the narrowing of the discount is caused by the trading price increase. Error-correction model confirms that most Chinese CEFs exhibit statistically significant coefficients on error-correction terms of both trading price and NAV. That implies that the movement of the price and NAV both would change the discount, but the discount changes are primarily due to the movement of the trading price. The empirical study of this paper shows that fund investors would achieve excess returns by investing in CEFs at discounts in China.","[Huang Wenbin] Fuzhou Univ, Dept Stat, Sch Management, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China",Fuzhou University,,bear_23@163.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-14-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,483.0,488,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE32,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298225400076,0

In both cases, however, creating the abstract commodity framework necessary to make sense of the notion of 'cost-effectiveness' has entailed losing touch with what was supposedly being costed, helping to engender systemic crisis. The new financial markets expanded credit and multiplied leverage by isolating, quantifying, slicing, dicing and circulating diverse types of uncertainty; the resulting unchecked pursuit of liquidity led to a catastrophic drying up of liquidity. The carbon markets, meanwhile, by identifying global warming solutions with reductions in an abstract pool of tradable pollution rights and linking them with 'offsets' manufactured through quantitative techniques, ended up blocking prospective historical pathways toward less fossil fuel dependence and thus exacerbated the climate problem. Unsurprisingly, both markets have provoked strong, if diverse and confused, movements of societal self-defence.

There are specific techniques such as instrumental variables, which are used in the economics literature to deal with some individual forms of model misspecification, only addressing one problem at a time. The joint and separate solutions to the problems of unknown functional forms, omitted variables and measurement errors, discussed in this paper, prove that instrumental variables do not exist. Therefore, the specific techniques used in the literature are not feasible. This paper proposes a general method for estimating underlying parameters in the presence of a range of model misspecifications.

Three closely related perspectives are important. First, the rapid expansion of the Chinese and Indian economies has sustained the world price for oil, of which Angola is the second-largest producer in sub-Saharan Africa. In the process, China has also become Angola's third-largest trading partner, with a sizeable trade surplus favouring Angola. Second, from an international financing perspective, China's keen interest to diversify the portfolio of assets in which to invest its huge international reserves is only matched by Angola's need to find alternatives to normal and concessional sources of international financing, from which it is excluded due to the lack of progress in negotiating with the Bretton Woods institutions. Third, all these issues must be understood in the broader and possibly more complex scenario of the political economy of the relationship between Angola and the world. Because of the country's size and control over huge oil resources, the growing presence of China in Angola has reverberations across the rest of Africa. And Angola has also joined OPEC in late 2006.","[Aguilar, Renato] Gothenburg Univ, S-41124 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Goldstein, Andrea] OECD, Paris, France",University of Gothenburg; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Aguilar, R (通讯作者)，Gothenburg Univ, S-41124 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,,,,,,10,12,14,1,39,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2009,32.0,11,,,,,1543.0,1562,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01249.x,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,528KV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272445000003,0

The firm is privately informed about its costs of production and abatement, and the regulator which can only infer the firm's technology after observing the output from the period 1 - has the chance to set environmental taxes in period 1 to correct the firm's opportunistic behavior. The regulator is aware that the polluter may strategically choose a given level of production (and pollution) in period 1 in order to manipulate the regulator's beliefs concerning its technology and, consequently, adjusts the tax paid in period 2. We show that if the regulator reduces pollution taxes in the first period below the level under symmetric information, then the clean firm will signal its type by further reducing its output. Having gathered information from the firm with respect to its technology and emissions, the regulator raises pollution taxes in the second period. In the light of the present results, soft fiscal policies based on initial low-taxes, which are later increased, may be used in the presence of asymmetric information to provide incentives for a firm to reveal its true level of emissions and mitigate opportunistic behavior.","[Antelo, Manel; Loureiro, Maria L.] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Antelo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Campus Norte, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",manel.antelo@usc.es; maria.loureiro@usc.es,"; Loureiro, Maria/Q-2384-2015","Antelo, Manel/0000-0003-1846-6872; Loureiro, Maria/0000-0002-7082-3980","Galician Autonomous Government (Xunta de Galicia) [PGIDIT06PXIB201002PR, PGIDIT06PXIB242181PR]",Galician Autonomous Government (Xunta de Galicia)(Xunta de Galicia),"The authors would like to thank two very thoughtful referees for valuable comments and suggestions.

We use a standard ultimatum game, but in one treatment, Indian subjects made offers to French subjects (ItoF treatment) and, in another treatment, French subjects made offers to Indian subjects (FtoI treatment). We observed that FtoI treatment bargaining mostly ended up with unequal splits of money in favor of French, while nearly equal splits were the most frequent outcome in ItoF treatment interactions. The experimental results are organized through a standard social reference model, modified for taking into account the different marginal value of money for bargainers. In our model, bargaining is driven by relative standing comparisons between players, occurring in terms of real earnings (that is monetary earnings corrected for a purchasing power factor) obtained in the game. The norm of equity behind the equalization of real earnings is called local equity norm, and contrasted to a global equity norm which would encompass the wealth of players beyond the game. According to what we observed, no beyond-game concern seems to be relevantly endorsed by subjects.","[Laslier, Jean-Francois] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Boarini, Romina] OECD, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Robin, Stephane] Univ Lyon 2, GATE, F-69131 Ecully, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2,"Laslier, JF (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.",boarini@oecd.org; jean-francois.laslier@polytechnique.edu; robin@gate.cnrs.fr,"Laslier, Jean-Francois/GSJ-2634-2022; Laslier, Jean-Francois/K-1539-2019","Laslier, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-8334-1350;",,,,,21,14,15,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2009,67.0,4,,,,,341.0,373,,10.1007/s11238-009-9135-5,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,495BG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269863600001,0

One of the main objectives of these programs is to increase the stock of educated labor in the state by retaining those whose education is subsidized. This study provides evidence on the extent to which such a program in Florida has affected the location decision of college-educated Florida natives. The analysis utilizes a difference-in-difference approach and data from the Census and American Community Survey (ACS). The results indicate that those eligible for the program are significantly more likely to locate in Florida after completing their education than those who were not eligible. These results are robust to a number of alternative specifications, including a comparison with neighboring states. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The main findings are as follows. First, the ratio of 'whole cost' to the level of consumption in a hypothetical economy is high: 50% for Indonesia, 39% for Hong Kong, 36% for Korea, 30% for Thailand and 18% for Malaysia. Second, the dynamic process of 'cost at period t' quickly converges to 40% immediately after the crisis, though the costs for Indonesia and Hong Kong gradually increase toward 100%. Third, the IMF-supported programs in Thailand, Indonesia and Korea were implemented straight after the peak cost. Finally, the cost of the IMF-supported program was relatively inexpensive compared with the welfare cost of the crisis.","[Miyakoshi, Tatsuyoshi] Osaka Univ, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Okubo, Masakatsu] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Shimada, Junji] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Sch Management, Tokyo, Japan",Osaka University; University of Tsukuba; Aoyama Gakuin University,"Miyakoshi, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, 1-31 Machikaneyama Machi, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",miyakoshi@osipp.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The evaluations of a number of Russian and British economists are used as gauges of Keynes's advice, and also as more general comparison in relation to the equivalent policies pursued by other Allied countries.","Univ Bedfordshire, Harrow HA3 9AG, Middx, England",University of Bedfordshire,"Barnett, V (通讯作者)，Univ Bedfordshire, 77 Rowland Ave, Harrow HA3 9AG, Middx, England.",vlbarnett@postmaster.co.uk,,,,,,,42,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JUL,2009,61.0,5,,,,,797.0,812,,10.1080/09668130902905008,0.0,,,16,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,478GA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268574600004,0

It is a reasonable conjecture that the land price gradient would vary with direction from the CBD. The variation in the gradient could be caused by a number of factors, but the idea that the land price gradient is flatter along radial transportation routes than in other directions is widely recognized even though there is little rigorous empirical work supporting this belief. This paper will examine the structure of urban land prices with a focus on the land price gradient as a function of the direction around the center of the city using a piecewise linear function. The added flexibility in the gradient estimate gained by this approach reveals a dramatically varying directional land price gradient.","[Munneke, Henry J.] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Colwell, Peter F.] Univ Illinois, Dept Finance, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Munneke, HJ (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, 206 Brooks Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",hmunneke@terry.uga.edu,,,,,,,37,16,18,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The most important data sources are travel time and traffic flow measurements made in the year before the charges were introduced (during April 2005) and during the first spring with the charges (during April 2006, 4 months after the charges were introduced). Using matrix calibration, effects on the non-observed link flows and travel times are extrapolated, enabling us to calculate the social value of changes in travel times and travel costs. Impacts on traffic safety and emissions are calculated using standard Swedish CBA relationships. The system is shown to yield a significant social surplus, well enough to cover both investment and operating costs, provided that it is kept for a reasonable lifetime: investment and startup costs are recovered in terms of social benefits in around 4 years.

J,"Holguín-Veras, J; Cetin, M",,,,"Holguin-Veras, Jose; Cetin, Mecit",,,Optimal tolls for multi-class traffic: Analytical formulations and policy implications,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Optimal pricing; Multi-class traffic; Congestion pricing; Freight road pricing,RECEIVER-CARRIER POLICIES; OFF-PEAK HOURS; CONGESTION TOLLS; TRAVEL-TIME; ROAD; EQUILIBRIUM; BEHAVIOR; NETWORK; URBAN; TRANSPORTATION,"This paper puts together an analytical formulation to compute optimal tolls for multiclass traffic. The formulation is comprised of two major modules. The first one is an optimization component aimed at computing optimal tolls assuming a Stackelberg game in which the toll agency sets the tolls, and the equilibrating traffic plays the role of the followers. The optimization component is supported by a set of cost models that estimate the externalities as a function of a multivariate vector of traffic flows. These models were estimated using Taylor series expansions of the output obtained from traffic simulations of a hypothetical test case. Of importance to the paper is the total travel time function estimated using this approach that expresses total travel time as a multivariate function of the traffic volumes. The formulation presented in the paper is then applied to a variety of scenarios to gain insight into the optimality of current toll policies. The optimal tolls are computed for two different cases: independent tolls, and tolls proportional to passenger car equivalencies (PCE). The numerical results clearly show that setting tolls proportional to PCEs leads to lower values of welfare that are on average 15% lower than when using independent tolls, though, in some cases the total welfare could be up to 33% lower. This is a consequence of two factors. First, the case of independent tolls has more degrees of freedom than the case of tolls proportional to PCEs. Second, tolls proportional to PCEs do not account for externalities other than congestion, which is likely to lead to lower welfare values. The analytical formulations and numerical results indicate that, because the total travel time is a non-linear function of the traffic volumes, the marginal social costs and thus the optimal congestion tolls also depend on the traffic volumes for each vehicle class. As a result of this, for the relatively low volumes of truck traffic observed in real life, the optimal congestion tolls for trucks could indeed be either lower or about the same as for passenger cars. This stand in sharp contrast with what is implied in the use of PCEs, i.e., that the contribution to congestion are constant. This latter assumption leads to optimal truck congestion tolls that are always proportional to the PCE values. The comparison of the toll ratios (truck tolls divided by passenger car tolls) for both observed and optimal conditions suggests that the tolls for small trucks are about the right level, maybe a slightly lower than optimal. However, the analysis of the toll ratio for large trucks seems to indicate a significant overcharge, The estimates show that the average observed toll ratio for large trucks is even higher than the maximum optimal toll ratio found in the numerical experiments. This suggests that the tolls for large trucks are set oil the basis of revenue generation principles while the passenger car tolls are being set based oil a mild form of welfare maximization. This leads to a suboptimal cross-subsidization of passenger car traffic in detriment of an important sector of the economy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

At the center of Ellsberg's argument lies a thought experiment that has come to be known as the three-color example. It has been observed that a significant number of sophisticated decision makers violate the requirements of subjective expected utility theory when they are confronted with Ellsberg's three-color example. More generally, such decision makers are in conflict with either the ordering assumption or the independence assumption of subjective expected utility theory. While a clear majority of the theoretical responses to these violations have advocated maintaining ordering while relaxing independence, a persistent minority has advocated abandoning the ordering assumption. The purpose of this paper is to consider a similar dilemma that exists within the context of multiattribute models, where it arises by considering indeterminacy in the weighting of attributes rather than indeterminacy in the determination of probabilities as in Ellsberg's example.","Columbia Univ, Dept Philosophy, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Helzner, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Philosophy, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jh2239@columbia.edu,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2009,66.0,4,,,,,301.0,315,,10.1007/s11238-008-9099-x,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,411IT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263643800001,0

The direction of the income effect is reversed by endowing subjects with the highest price of a lottery when asking the WTP question. Our results show that the income effect is too small to be the only source of the disparity. Since the disparity concentrates on a subsample of subjects, parametric and nonparametric tests of the WTA-WTP ratio may lead to contradictory results. The disparity is significantly reduced when background risk is introduced.

Delay in initiating prenatal care was modeled as a function of pregnancy risk indicators, enabling factors, and regional characteristics. Conditional maximum likelihood (CIVIL) estimation was used to model self-selection into prenatal care use when estimating its effectiveness. Birth registry data was collected post delivery on infants with and without common birth defects born in 1995-2002 in Argentina using a standard procedure. Several maternal health and fertility indicators had significant effects on prenatal care use. In the group without birth defects, prenatal care delay increased significantly LBW and preterm birth when accounting for self-selection using the CIVIL model but not in the standard probit model. Prenatal care was found to be ineffective on average in the birth defect group. The self-selection of higher risk women into earlier initiation of prenatal care resulted in underestimation of prenatal care effectiveness when using a standard probit model with several covariates. Large improvements in birth outcomes are suggested with earlier initiation of prenatal care for pregnancies uncomplicated with birth defects in Argentina, implying large opportunity costs from the long waiting time observed in this sample (about 17 weeks on average). The suggested ineffectiveness for pregnancies complicated with common birth defects deserves further research. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A theorem for these bounds-Bounds for Probable Modus Ponens-entails a principle for updating on possibly uncertain evidence subject to these bounds that is a generalization of the principle for updating by conditioning on certain evidence. This way of updating on possibly uncertain evidence is appropriate when updating by 'probability kinematics' or 'Jeffrey-conditioning' is, and apparently in countless other cases as well. A more complicated theorem due to Karl Wagner - Bounds for Probable Modus Tollens - registers narrowest bounds for P(similar to h) when P(similar to e) = y and P(e/h) = x. This theorem serves another principle for updating on possibly uncertain evidence that might be termed 'contraditioning', though it is for a way of updating that seems in practice to be frequently not appropriate. It is definitely not a way of putting down a theory - for example, a random-chance theory of the apparent fine-tuning for life of the parameters of standard physics - merely on the ground that the theory made extremely unlikely conditions of which we are now nearly certain. These theorems for bounds and updating are addressed to standard conditional probabilities defined as ratios of probabilities.

While earlier scholars have ascribed a central role to mechanization, Olmstead and Rhode argue that dramatic biological gains were made by an army of improving farmers responding to the challenges of insect pests, biological pathogens, new soils and movement into new climatic zones. These gains remained largely hidden because of the way most statistics have been presented and discussed. By teasing out these advances from the historical record, Olmstead and Rhode not only challenge interpretations about the nature of agricultural development in the United States but also open up a whole new research agenda that promises to revitalize the field of agricultural history here and elsewhere.

The representative household maximizes its utility function which contains a real rigidity in consumption in a form of a habit formation. The monopolistic competitive firms maximize their net present value of dividends (their profits) with respect to Calvo-type price setting. The sticky price setting of home producers and importers represents nominal rigidities in the model. Monetary policy is conducted according to a Taylor-type rule. The model includes exogenous foreign sector which is represented by Euroarea-12. The framework assumes a perfectly competitive labour market and a complete financial market. The log-linear model is estimated using Bayesian method (we use the Dynare toolbox for Matlab). Evaluation of the model for Slovakia is based on an analysis of impulse response functions and an assessment of estimated parameters.

An unusually large data set, covering 64 countries and some 5 million births, is used to show that fertility behavior responds to the presence-or absence-of sons in many regions of the developing world. The response to the absence of sons is particularly large in Central Asia and South Asia. Modernization does not appear to reduce this differential response. For example, in South Asia the fertility response to the absence of sons is larger for women with more education and has been increasing over time. The explanation appears to be that a latent demand for sons is more likely to manifest itself when fertility levels are low. As a result of this differential fertility behavior, girls tend to grow up with significantly more siblings than do boys, with potential implications for their well-being when quantity-quality tradeoffs result in fewer material and emotional resources allocated to children in larger families.

The comment concludes that although a de-coupling of Cohen's version of IPE and the rest would seem tempting and logical it is unlikely to happen for reasons of politics, academic and international.","Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Intercultural Commun & Management, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Leander, A (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Intercultural Commun & Management, Copenhagen, Denmark.",,,"Leander, Anna/0000-0002-0237-9507",,,,,8,15,17,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Author of this article used a selected parts of Rasin's textbook,National economy which treat of the international adjustment under paper (uncovered) money. Only a few pages of original Rasin's text deal with a lot of economics variables and their relations, often without detailed explanation. Author selected only 12 variables and their relations to construct a sufficiently simple model that transforms the Rasin's ideas to formal mathematical language. The model describes the behavior of domestic economy after the monetary expansion in relation to the rest of the world with stable currency. The model consist of one exogenous variable (money stock in domestic country), I I endogenous variables (exchange rate, real export and import, domestic and foreign price level, domestic and foreign nominal wage rate, domestic and foreign flow of nominal savings, domestic and foreign interest rate) and I I equations. After rearrangement the model contains 6 endogenous variables and 6 ordinary linear differential equations. A numerical solution under selected parameters gives the same result as Rasin's claim and it could be considered as a proof of logical consistency of his thinking about the disequilibrium of this economic system. The transformation of historic text to the formalized mathematical language is difficult job and author is familiar with the danger of distortion through misunderstanding of given historic economic paradigm. Nevertheless author maintains that this approach is useful - many times forgotten old ideas can upgrade the contemporary economic thought.","[Martincik, David] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Finance, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,,martinci@kef.zcu.cz,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,214.0,220,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900039,0

The computations suggest that the market allocation of households to locations (i.e., rings) differed from an efficient location pattern. In 1956 the Chicago CBD had employment of 593,000, which was 29% of employment in the metropolitan area. The remaining employment was widely dispersed. A more efficient allocation places up to 11.5% more households in the rings nearest to the CBD, given the location pattern of employment. Other policies, such as increasing work trips by public transit and charging time-of-day tolls to shift the rush hour to other times. are shown to reduce congestion costs and to reduce the amount of population redistribution needed to achieve an efficient population distribution.

It was shown by Hayashi that the two different approaches to investment can be integrated and that q can be interpreted as the value to the firm of an additional unit of capital, which is the discounted value of its future marginal revenue products.

If age profiles of income, consumption, and savings were stable and estimable for the entire population, they might imply how the demographic transition would affect national savings rates, but there is little agreement on the impact of age composition. These age profiles differ by gender and are affected by human capital investments, whereas existing microsimulations are estimated from samples of wage earners that are not distinguished by sex or schooling and make no effort to model family labor supply behavior or physical and human capital accumulation. Considering these shortcomings of assessments of the demographic dividend, a case study based on household surveys and long-run social experiments may be more informative. Matlab, Bangladesh, extended a family planning and maternal and child health program to half the villages in the district in 1977, and recorded fertility in the program villages was 15-16 percent lower than in the control villages for two decades. Households in the program villages realized health and productivity gains that were concentrated among women, survival and schooling increased among children, and after 19 years household physical assets were 25 percent greater per adult than in the control villages. These large gains in the wake of the program-induced demographic transition suggest reasons for designing new labor market and microcredit policies to help women during the demographic transition invest in productive skills; shift their time more efficiently from child care to home production, self-employment, and wage labor; and invest more in the human capital of their children.

Its crucial merit lies in a process-based understanding of scale which helps to overcome the limitations of more static concepts like multi-level governance. More recently, the usefulness of the scale concept, as well as the relationship between scale and other spatial categories, has been increasingly discussed. This paper aims to contribute to these discussions from the perspective of amaterialist state theory. The paper's argument is that the scale concept needs further clarification with respect to its understanding of hegemony, the national state and societal relations with nature. It elaborates this argument by analyzing the rescaling of the protection of intellectual property rights on genetic resources, with particular reference to the WTO-TRIPs Agreement. The paper concludes by stating that the production of new spatial scales of the state can be an important element in the reorganization of control over nature. However, the strong structural selectivities in favor of dominant social and political forces which characterize international state apparatuses negatively affect their hegemonic capacity. Thus, the role of national states in the regulation of contradictory social forces remains crucial and may even be strengthened by processes of rescaling.","Univ Vienna, Inst Polit Sci, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Wissen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Inst Polit Sci, Vienna, Austria.",,,,,,,,82,20,20,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In this article, detailed retrospective data from the Polish School Leavers Survey are used to analyse the dynamics of entry and exit from fixed-term contracts. The results show that neither firm-based vocational training nor diplomas from more selective tertiary education institutions provide graduates better access to secure entry positions. Regarding exit dynamics, transition patterns from fixed-term contracts into unemployment suggest that the timing of exits often coincides with the date of becoming eligible to collect unemployment benefits. The results also imply that, in Poland, fixed-term contracts might serve employers by helping them to identify the best workers.","[Baranowska, Anna] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Stat & Demog, PL-02513 Warsaw, Poland; [Gebel, Michael] Univ Mannheim, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany",Warsaw School of Economics; University of Mannheim,"Baranowska, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Stat & Demog, Ul Madalinskiego 6-8, PL-02513 Warsaw, Poland.",anna.baranowska@sgh.waw.pl,"Gebel, Michael/JPA-5999-2023; Gebel, Michael/L-1148-2015; Gebel, Michael/JAZ-0674-2023","Gebel, Michael/0000-0002-8557-7508; Gebel, Michael/0000-0002-8557-7508; Gebel, Michael/0000-0002-8557-7508",,,,,27,30,31,1,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The concept of financialisation has emerged within Marxist political economy in an effort to relate booming finance to poorly performing production. Yet, there is no general agreement on what it means, as is shown in this article through a selective review of economic and sociological literature. The article puts forth an analysis of financialization that draws on classical Marxism while remaining mindful of the recent crisis. Financialization represents a systemic transformation of mature capitalist economies with three interrelated features. First, large corporations rely less on banks and have acquired financial capacities; second, banks have shifted their activities toward mediating in open financial markets and transacting with households; third, households have become increasingly involved in the operations of finance. The sources of capitalist profit have also changed accordingly.","[Lapavitsas, Costas] Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of London,"Lapavitsas, C (通讯作者)，SOAS, Dept Econ, Thornhaugh St, London WC1 0XG, England.",cl5@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,230,262,9,125,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The latter may highlight a number of secondary impacts of rail transit on nuisance elements such as crime and parking as well as targeted public and private investment along rail-transit corridors. In order to estimate neighborhood property values, one must establish relevant control neighborhoods. In the case of Charlotte, North Carolina, the public planning and funding process provides information on proposed light rail-transit (LRT) corridors that were ultimately not selected as the first alignment in Charlotte's light rail transit system in 2000. Estimation incorporates a difference-in-difference estimator across a range of hedonic models. Preferred estimates highlight that LRT provides a neighborhood impact of 4.0% for single-family properties and 11.3% for condominiums sold within 1 mile of LRT stations. No neighborhood impacts are realized for commercial properties and estimated price gradients provide insignificant impacts across a number of models. Results suggest that LRT investment may be used more as an economic development tool for specific neighborhoods rather than a transportation amenity in cities like Charlotte, which contain sparser development patterns.

While it justifies this engagement with its poverty reduction objective and its capacity to pave the way for new business activities in developing countries, critics blame the World Bank as a climate profiteer and as an unfair competitor in private markets. Our econometric analysis of over 2,000 projects registered until May 2010 under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol allows us to compare the activities of the Bank with those of other, primarily private actors. The results indicate that hardly any of the CDM projects can be considered as strongly pro-poor. Nevertheless, in comparison to the rest of the CDM projects, the Bank's portfolio shows a relatively clearer orientation towards poor countries. Within these countries, however, the Bank does not show any particular pro-poor focus, and tends to implement those projects that are commercially most attractive. Moreover, there is no evidence of the Bank phasing out its activities once the market becomes fully operational, which goes against its professed pioneering and catalytic role in carbon markets.","[Michaelowa, Axel; Michaelowa, Katharina] Univ Zurich, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, Zurich, Canton Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Michaelowa, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, Zurich, Canton Zurich, Switzerland.",axel.michaelowa@pw.uzh.ch; katja.michaelowa@pw.uzh.ch,"Michaelowa, Katharina/B-4931-2018","Michaelowa, Katharina/0000-0002-0317-209X; Michaelowa, Axel/0000-0001-5053-3700",,,,,69,30,34,1,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

These two stylized facts challenge the literature on the beneficial brain drain which demonstrates that migration can increase the average human capital in the sending countries if immigration policies are selective, or the skill premium at destination is higher than at origin. We propose a model with empirically sensible assumptions on immigration policies and skill premia, where individuals face heterogeneous and correlated education and migration costs. The model is consistent with a robust stylized fact, namely that the rate of migration increases with schooling, and it shows that the average level of education of the stayers can be increasing in the probability to migrate even in such a setting. Our simulation results prove that these findings hold for reasonable parameter values. This extends the case for a beneficial brain drain in a further direction.","[Bertoli, Simone; Bruecker, Herbert] IAB, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Bruecker, Herbert] Univ Bamberg, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Bertoli, S (通讯作者)，IAB, Weddigenstr 20-22, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",sb3151@gmail.com; herbert.bruecker@iab.de,,"Bertoli, Simone/0000-0002-6512-0834",,,,,18,2,2,0,11,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

According to a national reference among German children and adolescents aged 3-17 years, 15% are overweight (including obese) and 6.3% are obese. This study aims to assess the economic burden associated with overweight and obesity in children based on a cross-sectional survey from two birth cohort studies: the GINI-plus - German Infant Nutritional Intervention plus Non-Intervention study (3287 respondents aged 9 to <12 years) and the LISA-plus study - Influence of life-style factors on the development of the immune system and allergies in East and West Germany (1762 respondents aged 9 to <12 years). Using a bottom-up approach, we analyse direct costs induced by the utilisation of healthcare services and indirect costs emerging from parents' productivity losses. To investigate the impact of Body Mass Index (BMI) on costs, we perform various descriptive analyses and estimate a two-part regression model. Average annual total direct medical costs of healthcare use are estimated to be (sic)418 (95% CI 1346-511]) per child, split between physician (22%), therapist (29%), hospital (41%) and inpatient rehabilitation costs (8%). Bivariate analysis shows considerable differences between BMI groups: (sic)469 (severely underweight), (sic)468 (underweight), (sic)402 (normal weight), (sic)468 (overweight) and (sic)680 (obese).

The purpose of the study is to investigate whether there were social differences in mortality in this context and whether these differences increased during the industrial break-through. The expected advantages for higher social classes could not be confirmed in this environment. Instead, the best survival was found among those belonging to the agricultural sector. We found a strongly gendered pattern, with much higher mortality for and small health differences among men, while the results indicate increasing social inequality in female mortality during industrialization. The spatial pattern of mortality was pronounced and living with a partner had a strong impact on survival, particularly for men. We finally discuss the role of gender and class expectations in relation to lifestyles for the social patterning of mortality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike democracies, non-democracies do not have functioning electoral systems and free presses to make their commitments costly thus credible. Yet, the need to credibly commit to a policy arises for non-democracies as well. In particular, when non-democratic leaders push for economic reforms, they need to coordinate the beliefs of domestic groups and attract international resources. How do non-democracies solve the commitment problem and succeed in achieving their policy goals? In this study, we argue that international institutions provide an important mechanism through which non-democratic countries could credibly signal their commitment to open economic policies. We test the argument with the involvement of IMF programs by post-communist countries from 1989 to 2005. We find that while IMF status is used as a credible commitment device for all countries, the effect is more significant for non-democracies.","[Fang, Songying] Rice Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Owen, Erica] Princeton Univ, Niehaus Ctr Globalizat & Governance, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Rice University; Princeton University,"Fang, SY (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",sfang@rice.edu; eowen@princeton.edu,,,,,,,48,20,29,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

However, empirical studies of societies shifting subsistence from foraging to primary food production have found evidence for deteriorating health from an increase in infectious and dental disease and a rise in nutritional deficiencies. In Paleopathology at the Origins of Agriculture (Cohen and Armelagos, 1984), this trend towards declining health was observed for 19 of 21 societies undergoing the agricultural transformation. The counterintuitive increase in nutritional diseases resulted from seasonal hunger, reliance on single crops deficient in essential nutrients, crop blights, social inequalities, and trade. In this study, we examined the evidence of stature reduction in studies since 1984 to evaluate if the trend towards decreased health after agricultural transitions remains. The trend towards a decrease in adult height and a general reduction of overall health during times of subsistence change remains valid, with the majority of studies finding stature to decline as the reliance on agriculture increased. The impact of agriculture, accompanied by increasing population density and a rise in infectious disease, was observed to decrease stature in populations from across the entire globe and regardless of the temporal period during which agriculture was adopted, including Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, South America, and North America.

In my formal model, special interests can offer political support to the government in exchange for a discriminatory implementation commitment that benefits them. The government colludes with the special interests if the value of political support exceeds the cost. However, if the government colludes with special interests in country A, the payoff to the government and special interests in country B also decreases because the probability of successful international cooperation decreases. In equilibrium, special interests create a collective-action problem that complicates international cooperation. In addition to providing a new explanation for the power of special interests in international cooperation, the article illuminates how international negotiations and domestic treaty implementation interact. The analysis also reveals a new dimension of flexibility in international cooperation.","[Urpelainen, Johannes] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ju2178@columbia.edu,,,,,,,77,6,6,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

In this paper we develop a model that combines short turning and deadheading in an integrated strategy for a single transit line, where the optimization variables are both of a continuous and discrete nature: frequencies within and outside the high demand zone, vehicle capacities, and those stations where the strategy begins and ends. We show that closed solutions can be obtained for frequencies in some cases, which resembles the classical square root rule. Unlike the existing literature that compares different strategies with a given normal operation (no strategy - single frequency), we use an optimized base case, in order to assess the potential benefits of the integrated strategy on a fair basis. We found that the integrated strategy can be justified in many cases with mixed load patterns, where unbalances within and between directions are observed. In general, the short turning strategy may yield large benefits in terms of total cost reductions, while low benefits are associated with deadheading, due to the extra cost of running empty vehicles in some sections.

A mathematical stochastic model was designed and implemented using data collected from farms in the area and other local sources. These policies are mainly based on modifying water quantity, the irrigable area, and the flat water tariffs. Finally all these changes are also analyzed in the presence of a volumetric water tariff designed by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Results have shown how fundamental it is to improve distribution efficiency of the channel system in order to increase irrigated land, for the positive socio-economic and environmental impacts on the territory. However, the introduction of a volumetric tariff could be an effective tool to control water demand expected to augment due to such policy measures, depending on yearly water availability; it could be very profitable to the RIB which will increase returns.","[El Chami, Daniel; Scardigno, Alessandra] Int Ctr Adv Mediterranean Agron Studies CIHEAM IA, I-70010 Valenzano, BA, Italy; [Zagnoli, Giorgio; Malorgio, Giulio] Univ Bologna, DEIAGRA, Dipartimento Econ & Ingn Agr, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",CIHEAM; CIHEAM BARI; University of Bologna,"El Chami, D (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Adv Mediterranean Agron Studies CIHEAM IA, Via Ceglie 9, I-70010 Valenzano, BA, Italy.",,"Chami, Daniel El/L-3607-2013","Chami, Daniel El/0000-0002-0712-858X",,,,,29,8,8,0,6,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2011,10.0,2,,,,,25.0,32,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,793WJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292854300004,0

The authors employ a fixed effects instrumental variable model with spatial and time autocorrelation function tested on aggregate income, employment, the unemployment rate, and sectoral activity in manufacturing, wholesale, and construction. The authors find no impacts of the MEGA credit program on county-level aggregate employment, unemployment rates, wages, or incomes. Furthermore, there is no impact of manufacturing or warehousing credits on employment or wages in these sectors. The authors do find that MEGA credits produce a transient impact on construction employment (a drop in construction wages is statistically but not economically significant). The construction impact of MEGA is an estimated $123,000 investment per construction job. Generally, 75% of these jobs last for 1 year, with the remaining 25% lasting only into the second year.","[Hicks, Michael J.] Ball State Univ, Miller Coll Business, Muncie, IN 47304 USA; [Hicks, Michael J.] Ball State Univ, Ctr Business & Econ Res, Muncie, IN 47304 USA; [LaFaive, Michael] Mackinac Ctr Publ Policy, Morey Fiscal Policy Initiat, Midland, MI USA",Ball State University; Ball State University,"Hicks, MJ (通讯作者)，Ball State Univ, Miller Coll Business, Muncie, IN 47304 USA.",mhicks@bsu.edu,,,,,,,24,25,30,1,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Schools that begin as charters generate large improvements in discipline and attendance but not test scores, with the exception of math in middle schools. This suggests improvements in noncognitive but not cognitive skills, although these improvements do not persist if students return to regular public schools. Charters that convert from regular public schools have little impact on either skill type.

The resulting credit growth was very slight in the USA and UK but very large in China. The US and UK money multipliers collapsed because the required capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was binding for many of their banks. Specifically, the value of the money multiplier is zero when CAR is not met, is one when CAR is binding and when the asset purchased by the central bank requires the commercial bank to hold capital against it, and equals the reciprocal of the required reserve ratio when CAR is not binding. To improve China's economic performance, we propose three new growth drivers to replace the present instruments of macro-stimulus: changes in rural economic institutions to create new entrepreneurs, an urbanisation strategy based on the principle of future home ownership and modernisation of the financial system.","[Zhang, Wei] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,,,,,,,,,15,11,11,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2011,34.0,5,,,,,667.0,686,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01346.x,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,769RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291034800001,0

In this paper, we investigate whether the procyclical nature of mortality in developed countries found by Ruhm (Q J Econ 115(2):617-650, 2000) and others is also present in Mexico. We assemble a unique panel data set that contains state-level data on mortality rates by age and cause of death, GDP per capita, and socioeconomic status. We find that for Mexico total mortality rates are procyclical, with the largest impact on those aged 20-49. While these findings are similar to those in Ruhm (Q J Econ 115(2):617-650, 2000), the effects of business cycles on mortality rates differ for several specific causes of death. These results suggest that whereas total mortality may be procyclical in both developed and developing countries, significant differences may exist for some causes of death.","[Gonzalez, Fidel; Quast, Troy] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA",Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University,"Gonzalez, F (通讯作者)，Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA.",fxg001@shsu.edu,,,,,,,36,36,40,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Participants carry out social activities like caring for the elderly, city cleaning or environmental activities. The principal objective is to improve or maintain the employability of hard-to-place unemployed. However, there is a certain risk of within-firm substitution of regular employees by One-Euro-Job participants. The aim of the study is to identify such substitution effects in participating establishments. For this purpose I present some descriptive results from the survey 'Experience with One-Euro-Jobs'. In a further step I use data from the IAB Establishment Panel 2004 to 2007 to identify substitution effects. To account for selectivity, I apply a difference-in-difference approach and propensity score matching. The empirical results indicate that regular employment relationships are not substituted by One-Euro-Jobs. This holds for West as well as for East Germany. However, the identification of within-firm substitution in the matching procedure requires that the program has no employment effect on the control group. Otherwise, substitution effects cannot be identified. For this reason, I provide evidence for potential displacement effects in the control group using a fixed-effects panel model. The results indicate that the control group is not affected by the program.","Inst Arbeitsmarkt & Berufsforsch, Forsch Bereich Betriebe & Beschaftigung, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",,"Hohendanner, C (通讯作者)，Inst Arbeitsmarkt & Berufsforsch, Forsch Bereich Betriebe & Beschaftigung, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",christian.hohendanner@iab.de,,,,,,,48,5,5,0,5,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

There is no empirical support for this prediction. In order to account for the phenomenon of political divergence, this paper offers a stochastic electoral model where party leaders or candidates are differentiated by differing valences-the electoral perception of the quality of the party leader. If valence is simply intrinsic, then it can be shown that there is a convergence coefficient, defined in terms of the empirical parameters, that must be bounded above by the dimension of the space, in order for the electoral mean to be a Nash equilibrium. This model is applied to elections in Turkey in 1999 and 2002. The idea of valence is then extended to include the possibility that activist groups contribute resources to their favored parties in response to policy concessions from the parties. The equilibrium result is that parties, in order to maximize vote share, must balance a centripetal electoral force against a centrifugal activist effect. We estimate pure spatial models and models with sociodemographic valences, and use simulations to compare the equilibrium predictions with the estimated party positions.","[Schofield, Norman; Ozdemir, Ugur] Washington Univ, Ctr Polit Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Gallego, Maria] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Zakharov, Alexei] State Univ Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",Washington University (WUSTL); Wilfrid Laurier University; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Schofield, N (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Ctr Polit Econ, 1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",schofield.norman@gmail.com; mgallego@wlu.ca; uozdemir@artsci.wustl.edu; 3ax@mail.ru,"Ozdemir, Ugur/AAW-9738-2020; Gallego, Maria/AAF-2143-2020","Ozdemir, Ugur/0000-0001-6736-7008;",,,,,38,12,12,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2011,36.0,3-4,,,,,451.0,482,,10.1007/s00355-010-0505-2,0.0,,,32,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,726TZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287750400005,0

In 2004, voters in Oregon approved Measure 37, which required payments to private landowners for reductions in the value of their property resulting from land-use regulations. The central economic question behind Measure 37 and compensation statutes adopted in other states is, what is the effect of land-use regulations on property values? Economists investigating this question have typically estimated hedonic property value models with regulations included as exogenous regressors. This approach is likely to be invalid if the parcel characteristics that determine property values also influence the government's decision about how to implement regulations. We use Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to study the effect of the Portland, Oregon, Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) on property values. RDD provides an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect under relatively mild conditions and is well-suited to our application because the UGB defines a sharp treatment threshold. We find a price differential on the western and southern sides of the Portland metropolitan area ranging from $30,000 to at least $140,000, but no price differential on the eastern side. Support for Measure 37 was fueled by price differences such as these among parcels subject to different regulations, but one must be careful not to view current price differentials as evidence that regulations have reduced property values.

Part-time employment can help to ease work-family conflict for women, while simultaneously contributing to the household income. However, part-time work is limited in its economic benefits, is also career limiting, and, in the USA, it generally comes without health insurance. While most of the current research regarding maternal employment decisions focuses on women, this research involves interviews with 83 British and American fathers, to better understand the complexity of such decision-making.

In 1932/33, Joan Robinson published many of Kahn's main ideas, rendering subsequent publication by him derivative.

Individual-level data for Ecuador and its two main migration destinations, Spain and the United States, are used to examine the size and skill composition of these migration flows and the role of wage differences in accounting for these features. Estimations of earnings regressions for Ecuadorians in all three countries show substantially larger income gains following migration to the United States than to Spain, with the wage differential increasing with migrants' education level. While this finding can account for the pattern of positive sorting in education toward the United States, it fails to explain why most Ecuadorians opted for Spain. The explanation for this preference appears to lie in Spain's visa waiver program for Ecuadorians. When the program was abruptly terminated, monthly inflows of Ecuadorians to Spain declined immediately.

Among the newer issues are runs between financial institutions, the role of financial derivatives, the opaqueness of securitization, the too big to fail problem, the incompleteness of micro-based risk assessments by financial institutions and a modern reinterpretation of the liquidity trap.

Smith read and digested Galileo's famous works directly and through his careful study of his most important influence, Isaac Newton. We conjecture that Smith's failure to solve the paradox in the Wealth of Nations and to seek a measurement of constant change was, at least derivatively, an attempt to follow Galileo methodological lead. We raise the possibility that Smith connected social and physical science in the quest to measure the ever-changing wealth of nations.","[Ekelund, Robert B., Jr.] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Auburn, AL 36830 USA; [Thornton, Mark] Ludwig von Mises Inst, Auburn, AL 36832 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Ekelund, RB (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, 404 Blake St, Auburn, AL 36830 USA.",bobekelund@prodigy.net; mthornton@mises.org,,,,,,,37,4,4,0,7,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

The article uses the model to construct predictive distributions of daily S&P 500 returns 1971-2005 and one-year maturity bond returns 1987-2007. For these time series the model compares favorably with ARCH and stochastic volatility models.

Field observations and sample collections, facilitated by two ACIAR (Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research)-projects, were undertaken to generate a Fusarium wilt distribution and incidence map, based on vegetative compatibility groups (VCG). The activities were conducted from 2006 to 2009 in 15 banana-producing provinces, where each province involved two districts, each encompassing two banana-producing areas. Fifteen to 20 banana orchards were observed, and vascular strand samples were collected from the same fields. Incidence of Fusarium wilt ranged from 0.08 to 100%, with an average of 23.99 +/- 14.41%. Seven VCGs of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) were initially identified, namely VCG 0120-0120/15, 01213/16, 01218, 0123, 0124/5 and 0126. One third of the total isolates was identified to be Foc tropical race 4 (TR4) VCG 01213/16, which is distributed widely in almost all provinces, infecting local cultivars 'Barangan' (AAA), 'Raja' (AAB) and 'Ambon Hijau' (AAA), as well as other cultivars of different ploidies and genomes. Besides mismanagement by banana farmers, the wide distribution of the disease may be due to the movement of planting materials along with transmigration of people from Java to other islands.","[Hermanto, C.; Sutanto, A.; Jumjunidang; Edison, H.

We estimate a Vector Autoregressive Equilibrium Correction Model (VECqM) to quantify the height and GDP per capita response to various living-standard indicators. We observe that conditions that perpetuate an elevated level of sickness and mortality and that raise the relative price of consumption goods tend to impede human growth, as reflected in a decline in average adult height, whereas factors that promote the purchase of health services and that help to open up the economy to international trade and ideas have tended to have an opposite effect from the 1850s onward. Our results also indicate that neither the level of per capita GDP nor its growth rate has a unidirectional relation to various measures of living standards, chiefly adult stature. Instead, our findings suggest that there may be behavioral factors (e.g., emphasis on health services), political factors (e.g., degree of openness), and economic factors (e.g., relative consumer costs to GDP deflator) whose affects may have been influenced the level of GDP, over the sample period.

As such, it is perhaps self-evident that theoretical approaches that focus on the role of institutions in shaping social life should have something to say about its nature, role and impact. This article argues that not only can institutionalist approaches enhance our understanding of CSDP, but using it as a case study can illustrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of institutionalism. In particular, it can indicate the importance of combining insights into the importance of institutional structures in shaping politics and policy with the crucial role power plays in mitigating some institutional effects. This argument is pursued via consideration of the evolution and workings of CSDP.","[Menon, Anand] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Menon, A (通讯作者)，16 James St, Oxford OX4 1ET, England.",a.menon@bham.ac.uk,"Menon, Anand/HDO-5867-2022","menon, anand/0000-0002-0304-6528",ESRC [ES/H046739/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H046739/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,68,36,38,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

An analysis of correlation between cash and non-cash shows that the division was largely effective, while a calculation of unexpected cash issues indicates that the income and outlay balance was useless. The results suggest that the Soviet monetary management did not work as intended because wages and output were not equilibrated from the beginning, and information and operational instruments to correct monetary imbalances did not exist.","Yokohama Natl Univ, Int Grad Sch Social Sci, Hodogaya Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2210005, Japan",Yokohama National University,"Nakamura, Y (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Int Grad Sch Social Sci, Hodogaya Ku, Tokiwadai 79-4, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2210005, Japan.",y-nkmr@ynu.ac.jp,"NAKAMURA, Yasushi/P-3643-2014","NAKAMURA, Yasushi/0000-0002-0026-8715",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21530335] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,63,6,7,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2011,63.0,7,,,,,1133.0,1156,,10.1080/09668136.2011.592264,0.0,,,24,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,877ZJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299220900001,0

Then we develop and calibrate a modified version of Pissarides' (2000) model with energy costs, which we simulate in response to shocks mimicking the behavior of the actual oil price shocks. We find that (i) these shocks are an important driving force of job market flows; (ii) the job finding probability is the main transmission mechanism of such shocks; and (iii) they bring a new amplification mechanism for the volatility of the labor market, and should thus be seen as complementary of labor productivity shocks.

Recently, the screening of over 170 Musa genotypes indicated that there is substantial genetic diversity in the pVACs contents of banana and plantain fruit pulp. Additional screening of the more than 6000 accessions maintained in over 60 field genebanks worldwide is highly desirable, but detailed pVACs analysis by spectrophotometry and reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) is both time consuming and expensive, due to the need for specialised equipment and technical expertise. The aim of this work was to validate alternative colour-based prescreening techniques for measuring fruit pVACs contents. The prescreening techniques used showed that pulps with white-cream coloration contained low levels of carotenoids, while those with more orange colour had levels of carotenoids ranging from low to high. The regression models tested indicated a positive correlation between Musa pulp colour and carotenoids content (significant at P<0.001), especially for the lower colour scores. The correlation was stronger for the yellowness index measured by colorimetry than for the DSM colour chart scores. It is expected that these results will allow researchers to reduce the costs and time required for pVACs analysis by prescreening field germplasm collections by colour-based methods and selecting only the most interesting accessions for precision analysis.","[Pereira, L.

Migration and trade have been traditionally viewed rather separately and the relevance of the many, and complex, interdependencies has been given remarkably little attention in the literature to date. In this article, we focus on the two-way interaction between international migration and agreements designed to enhance cross-border trade and investment. Liberalisation of international trade in services and in the movement of people potentially offers much greater economic gains than liberalisation of remaining barriers to goods trade. However, progress within multilateral frameworks is fraught with difficulty. The World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) has yielded little real progress so far and negotiations within more flexible unilateral and bilateral frameworks are likely to be more successful in liberalising the movement of labour. We discuss a range of specific examples, focusing particularly on the interesting case of New Zealand. We find that trade agreements are increasingly including agreements on migration, though typically favouring temporary migration and involving numerically modest quotas. We conclude that migration regulatory frameworks are likely to be further and more strongly linked to trade and investment agreements in the future, particularly given changing economic and demographic forces. The primary focus of migration policies may nonetheless remain different from that of trade policies. While further migration liberalisation is likely to be through bilateral and regional agreements, it will be important to try to lock in the gains of such agreements, while simultaneously working to consolidating these in a way that will help to facilitate future multilateral agreement.","[Poot, Jacques] Univ Waikato, Ctr Populat Studies, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Strutt, Anna] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Waikato; University of Waikato,"Poot, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Ctr Populat Studies, Hamilton, New Zealand.",,,"Poot, Jacques/0000-0003-4735-9283; Strutt, Anna/0000-0003-1776-2231",,,,,106,18,20,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2010,33.0,12,,,,,1923.0,1954,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01299.x,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,700SN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285764700011,0

The term commercial revitalization is frequently used to characterize the resurgence of retail activity in neighborhoods previously considered moribund and perilous areas to avoid. In most instances, however, the factors animating commercial revitalization are implicitly assumed and, as such, are conceptually and empirically underdeveloped. This article elucidates commercial revitalization and focuses on the agency of neighborhood small business owners as underexplored stakeholders. Using the extended case methodology, this article examines Black business owners in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, who mounted a relatively successful campaign of retail restructuring by cultivating political clout, establishing civic alliances, participating in neighborhood planning, and promoting the commercial district as an economic and cultural enclave. However, merchants failed to develop mechanisms to sustain their vision and advance commercial revitalization. The article concludes with a discussion of planning and policy implications.","Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Architecture Planning & Preservat, Community & Capital Action Res Lab, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Sutton, SA (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Architecture Planning & Preservat, Community & Capital Action Res Lab, 400 Avery Hall, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ss3115@columbia.edu,,,,,,,77,47,75,1,54,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

An analysis of the observable rules for real-life markets results in transfer equations and algorithms for the calculation of the individual purchasing prices and sales quantities. With distribution functions for offer and demand, which reflect the behaviour of the actors, the collective market outcome can be calculated, such as market price and sales, their variance and time dependency as well as the distribution effects of markets. The market laws, which result by simulation and probability theory, deviate in many respects from the statements of common price- and market-theories.

The typological study based on a factor analysis allowed to determine four groups of farms: small-sized (an average UAA of 5.97 ha), medium-sized (an average UAA of 12 37 Ha), intermediate-sized (25.17 ha) with a high rate of land lease (10.83 ha) and large-sized (an average UAA of 45 ha with 51% of irrigated farmland). The farmers who were subsidized under the FNRDA could increase their milk production (69, 88%), their cattle stock (55, 42%), their fodder production (6, 02%) and their income (45, 02%). The sustainability analysis showed that the best performance is recorded on the agro-ecological and economic scales while the social and territorial dimension is still a limitation to the total sustainability.

The main estimates rely on a structural approach where output of the whole economy is described by a Cobb-Douglas function and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is estimated allowing for possible breaks in the deterministic trend. The results confirm that over the considered period the potential gross domestic product growth has been faster in the United States than in other studied countries, reflecting a combination of higher labour contribution and faster TFP growth.

We examine land invasions in Brazil using a panel data set with over 50,000 municipality-year observations. Adverse economic shocks, instrumented by rainfall, cause the rural poor to invade and occupy large landholdings. This effect exhibits substantial heterogeneity by land inequality and land tenure systems, but not by other observable variables. In highly unequal municipalities, negative income shocks cause twice as many land invasions as in municipalities with average land inequality. Cross-sectional estimates using fine within-region variation also suggest the importance of land inequality in explaining redistributive conflict.","[Hidalgo, F.

We use newly available data from the German Socio-Economic Panel to measure directly the relationship between migration and risk attitudes. We find that individuals who are more willing to take risks are more likely to migrate. Our estimates are substantial compared to unconditional migration probabilities, as well the effects of conventional determinants of migration, and are robust to controlling for a variety of demographic characteristics. We find no evidence that our results are the result of reverse causality.","[Jaeger, David A.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Jaeger, David A.] Univ Cologne, D-5000 Cologne 41, Germany; [Dohmen, Thomas] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Falk, Armin] Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Huffman, David] Swarthmore Coll, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Sunde, Uwe] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland",City University of New York (CUNY) System; University of Cologne; Maastricht University; University of Bonn; Swarthmore College; University of St Gallen,"Jaeger, DA (通讯作者)，CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA.",,"Jaeger, David A/A-7871-2009","Jaeger, David/0000-0003-3863-1011; Dohmen, Thomas/0000-0002-9321-0319",,,,,17,202,227,2,36,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The 2008 auction in India for cricketers to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) of Twenty20 cricket has revealed the bids made for 75 players. Using the information on the bids, the author has estimated hedonic price equations. The author finds that the usual way of judging cricketers-in terms of runs scored and wickets taken-is reflected in the estimated equations. In addition, young players command a substantial premium over other players as do players from India and Australia. The author extends the analysis to evaluate the performance of players in the IPL tournament of 2008 and estimates the rates of return to the owners of the teams. The estimated models are checked for robustness by incorporating the results of the IPL Auction of 2009. The author finds that the models are robust to the inclusion of additional cricketers bought during the latest IPL auction.","Middlesex Univ Dubai, Sch Business, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",Middlesex University,"Karnik, A (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ Dubai, Sch Business, POB 500697, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",A.Karnik@mdx.ac,"Karnik, Ajit/ABC-9627-2021","Karnik, Ajit/0000-0002-9817-9648",,,,,16,13,14,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Estimating the causal effects of income on happiness,EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Income; Life satisfaction; Instrumental variables; Longitudinal; Happiness; Cost-benefit analysis,MODEL; SATISFACTION; PERSONALITY,"There is a long tradition of psychologists finding small income effects on life satisfaction (or happiness). Yet the issue of income endogeneity in life satisfaction equations has rarely been addressed. The present paper is an attempt to estimate the causal effect of income on happiness. Instrumenting for income and allowing for unobserved heterogeneity result in an estimated income effect that is almost twice as large as the estimate in the basic specification. The results call for a reexamination on previous findings that suggest money buys little happiness, and a reevaluation on how the calculation of compensatory packages to various shocks in the individual's life events should be designed.","Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Powdthavee, N (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",np517@york.ac.uk,"Powdthavee, Nattavudh/K-7230-2019; Powdthavee, Nattavudh/I-2573-2013","Powdthavee, Nattavudh/0000-0002-9345-4882",,,,,45,108,121,7,81,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.
