The analysis focus on extreme movements of exchange rate returns across different regimes using tail index indicators. Sequential and rolling tests, developed by Quintos et al (2001) are used to identify the dates of breaks in the Turkish exchange rate for the period 28 January 1980 to 11 October 2004 and for the sub-periods which cover the fixed exchange rate regime from 28 January 1980 to 22 February 2001 and the flexible exchange rate regime from 23 February 2001 to 11 October 2004. Compelling evidence for breaks in the tail index is found not only across but also within different exchange rate regimes - especially within the fixed regime. Moreover, breakpoint dates are clustered right before the crisis in 2001. This makes the tail index indicator a fairly good candidate for a variable to be used in early warning systems for currency crises.","Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Gazi Magusa 10, Mersin, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Payaslioglu, C (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Gazi Magusa 10, Mersin, Turkey.",cem.payasli@emu.edu.tr,"Payaslıoğlu, Cem/E-8478-2015",,,,,,35,5,5,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The positive correlation between drinking and higher wages has existed in the economics literature on alcohol consumption for almost two decades. However, a clear explanation for this finding is only beginning to emerge. I use data on male military personnel from the 1985 Worldwide Survey of Alcohol and Nonmedical Drug Use Among Military Personnel to explore a theory of social capital. Specifically, one way individuals can invest in social capital is through drinking in certain settings. Abstainers miss out on opportunities to increase their social capital stock because they forego social interaction that could result in promotion. Some evidence comes from exploring the wage bonus for Officers versus Enlisted. I find the effect of different drinking levels on wages varies with station in the military. Officers who drink between two and 38 drinks per week earn between 2 and 8% more than Officers who abstain. Alternatively, enlisted personnel gain a much smaller bonus from drinking, which is consistent with the ways in which the military differs on Officers and Enlisted promotions, thus supporting evidence for social capital as a wage-enhancing drinking mechanism.","Precision, Dallas, TX 75205 USA",,"Peters, BL (通讯作者)，Precision, 4514 Travis St,Suite 230, Dallas, TX 75205 USA.",bpeters@precisioncorp.net,,,,,,,31,4,7,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The best research to date finds relatively small achievement gains for students offered education vouchers, most of which are not statistically different from zero. Furthermore, what little evidence exists regarding the potential for public schools to respond to increased competitive pressure generated by vouchers suggests that one should remain wary that large improvements would result from a more comprehensive voucher system. The evidence from other forms of school choice is also consistent with this conclusion. Many questions remain unanswered, however, including whether vouchers have longer-run impacts on outcomes such as graduation rates, college enrollment, or even future wages, and whether vouchers might nevertheless provide a cost-neutral alternative to our current system of public education provision at the elementary and secondary school level.","[Rouse, Cecilia Elena] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Rouse, Cecilia Elena] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Rouse, Cecilia Elena] Princeton Univ, Educ Res Sect, Firestone Lib, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Barrow, Lisa] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",Princeton University; Princeton University; Princeton University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Rouse, CE (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",rouse@princeton.edu; lbarrow@frbchi.org,,"Barrow, Lisa/0000-0001-7439-0038",,,,,70,69,95,0,30,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1383,,,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

In the private information environment, barter exchange for high-quality goods is rare since people have incentive to produce low-quality goods and attempt to cheat uninformed trading partners. This environment gives money a role in mitigating informational frictions. I consider two environments, one where traders can signal their quality of goods and one where they cannot, and two types of informational problems -- adverse selection and moral hazard -- in a search-theoretic framework. Both environments support the notion that money reduces the adverse selection problem and increases welfare. However, with moral hazard, money is less effective in overcoming informational frictions. Because low-quality goods producers can still consume as long as they hold money even when their products are recognized as low quality, agents have incentive to produce low-quality goods. I conduct several policy analyses, and find that the role of money is very sensitive to the inflation rate. While the Friedman rule is the optimal monetary policy in my environment, it cannot generate a first-best allocation unless traders are able to signal their quality of goods.","[Shao, Enchuan] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Shao, Enchuan] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA USA",Bank of Canada; California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Shao, EC (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",eshao@bankofcanada.ca,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,4,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We are arguing the consideration, that it is qualitatively new process, which main causes are derived mainly from the fact, that two crucial discrepancies of civilization came into critical magnitude. It is the contradiction between the economy and humans, let us say between society and economy and natural environment, which are causing increasingly dire polarization of earnings and wealth, limiting global demand, building tip abundant production capacities and constraining investments to the real economy. Growing surplus of capital can not find adequate space for gains in the real economy.

Private consumption expenditures ought to increase because wage incomes typically are associated with higher consumption propensities than capital incomes. Investment expenditures ought to be negatively affected because investment will positively depend on profits. Net exports will be negatively affected because an increase in the wage share corresponds to an increase in unit labour costs and thus a loss in competitiveness. Therefore, theoretically, aggregate demand can be either wage-led or profit-led depending on how these effects add up. The results will crucially depend on how open the economy is internationally.

We use a simple New Keynesian model to show how the optimal output gap weight in the central bank's objective function depends on the degree of model uncertainty. In particular, we show numerically that the rationale for appointing a conservative central bank prevails even if the central bank is concerned about the robustness of policy with respect to model misspecifications. Moreover, we find that the central bank should put more relative weight on inflation stabilization if the degree of uncertainty increases. Interestingly, if the degree of uncertainty is large, monetary policy should be delegated to a conservative central banker even in the absence of shock persistence.","Swiss Natl Bank, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss National Bank (SNB),"Tillmann, P (通讯作者)，Swiss Natl Bank, Zurich, Switzerland.",peter.tillmann@snb.ch,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The results reveal the following. Climate policy has diminishing returns, and there is therefore a maximum to what can be achieved. The success of climate policy is hampered if, as is likely, the terrestrial biosphere turns from a carbon sink to a carbon Source because of climate change. All major countries have to reduce their emissions in order to meet the more ambitious stabilization targets. The cost of climate policy would be lower if the stabilization target can be exceeded in the interim. The EU target of 2 degrees C warming above pre-industrial is infeasible under almost all assumptions. A cost-benefit analysis Would endorse a target of 4.5 W m(-2) (but not much stricter than that) if all major emitters engage in abatement. Under the same condition, the median US voter would support a 3.7 W m(-2) target (but not Much stricter than that). International permit trade would encourage large developing countries to reduce their emissions, but the trade flows would be substantial relative to product trade and much larger than official development aid.

It also examines whether this wage premium is greater than the compensation workers demand for the less desirable non-wage characteristics of such jobs. The coefficients of the change in the proportion of men in an occupation on the change in wages for quits and layoffs provide opposing biased estimates of the wage premium; because workers who Voluntarily quit move to better matches, but those that are laid off accept jobs from the representative distribution of job offers. Specifically, when the premium paid over- (under-)compensates for undesirable work characteristics, the quit estimate is a downward (upward) biased estimate of the wage premium, while the layoff estimate is biased upward (downward). Results from the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) indicate that: (1) the estimated bounds of the wage premium are large; and (2) the wage premium overcompensates for the non-wage characteristics of male jobs.

We argue that the evidence is mostly consistent with the following Joint hypothesis: 1) The high commissions charged in the 1990s were partly returned to annuitants as informa (and illegal) cash rebates. it) Myopic pensioners prefer cash rebates over present values. iii) Therefore the legal threat caused the drop in broker commissions, tightened the slack for cash rebates, increased competition via annuity rates, and raised the long-run elasticity to one.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Escuela Adm, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Walker, E (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Escuela Adm, Santiago, Chile.",,"Walker, Eduardo/B-6331-2017",,,,,,11,4,4,0,10,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

This restitution ratio varies from 0.04 to 5, or from 0.1 to 10 if penalties are included. While some of this variation is explained by differences in the defendants' conduct, controlling for this, settlement negotiations that involved New York as well as the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) resulted in restitution ratios that were higher by a factor of 5-10. An analysis that uses the firms' headquarters location and customers' state of residence as instruments for New York's involvement suggests that this difference is causal, and not the result of New York involving itself in cases likely to lead to large settlements. Given the much larger staff and institutional expertise of the SEC, it is likely that these differences in outcomes are due to differences in effective aggressiveness, not prosecutorial resources. Differences in aggressiveness are consistent with popular conceptions of the regulators' career concerns, as well as with theories of industry focus and regulatory capture.","Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Dartmouth College,"Zitzewitz, EW (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",eric.zitzewitz@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,43,6,7,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

A sequence of vector error correction models (VECM) has been estimated within a multinational setting which covers 14 EU Member States. Using weekly data at the country level, this paper finds an influence of prices for European Union Allowances (EUAs) on unleaded petrol retail prices during the trial phase of the EU ETS from 2005 to 2007. The country-specific long-run elasticities of petrol prices with respect to the EUA prices are between 0.01 and 0.09. Given that these elasticities are of the same order of magnitude as the share of carbon allowances costs in total production costs in the refining industry, the estimates are consistent with the full pass-through potential. The variance decomposition analysis shows furthermore that a significant fraction of petrol price changes in Austria, Germany, France and Spain can be explained by changes in allowances prices (between 10% and 20%).

Game theory and behavioral economics have enriched the menu of models acceptable in the professional journals. More important, empirical standards have greatly advanced. Behavioral models are being confronted with computerized games and even with in-the-field experiments, especially in poor countries where recruiting experimental subjects is cheaper.

This idea culminated in a paper published by Simon in 1979 in the Scandinavian Journal of Economics. We extend Simon's argument that production functions should ideally be estimated using physical data, and discuss the serious problems that arise when they are estimated using constant-price monetary data. Simon also suggested that the good statistical fits to production functions could be derived from a markup pricing model, but he did not follow this up. We show that this can indeed account for the very good statistical fits of the Cobb-Douglas and other production functions.

We find that newspapers have a robust positive effect on political participation, with one additional newspaper increasing both presidential and congressional turnout by approximately 0.3 percentage points. Newspaper competition is not a key driver of turnout: our effect is driven mainly by the first newspaper in a market, and the effect of a second or third paper is significantly smaller. The effect on presidential turnout diminishes after the introduction of radio and television, while the estimated effect on congressional turnout remains similar up to recent years.

We find that the regime-switching behaviour of the common regional business cycle is consistent (or even precedes recession) with the business cycle expansion and contraction indicators used by the Council for Economic Planning and Development. This finding suggests that the common regional business cycle identifies the turning point after the 1990s.

We simulate a New Keynesian model in which the central bank can only observe a noisy estimate of the output gap and find that the less pronounced reaction of the Federal Reserve to output gap fluctuations since 1979 can account for a substantial part of the reduction in the standard deviation of GDP associated with the Great Moderation.

However, the marginal WTP is shown to increase with a higher degree of religiosity.

As the RBA can potentially influence future outcomes for inflation and output through its choice of cash rate target, we examine whether the RBAs forecasts reveal useful information about its tradeoff between inflation and output volatility. Our results suggest that the RBA targets a linear combination of deviations of inflation around target and output growth around potential growth where the weight given to output growth deviations is about one-third that given to inflation deviations. If we interpret this weight as the ratio of a central banks (relative) preference for output volatility and the slope parameter of the Phillips Curve; for typical values of the latter parameter we find the RBA while not a strict inflation targeter gives significantly less weight to minimising deviations in the output gap, than it does to minimising deviations of inflation around target.","[Otto, Glenn] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Voss, Graham] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Victoria,"Otto, G (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",g.otto@unsw.edu.au,,"Voss, Graham/0000-0001-7544-6013",,,,,30,3,3,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

This is somewhat surprising since social trust is normally associated with economic outcomes that are beneficial to society. The aim of this paper is to test whether undeclared work is a dark side of social trust:Since the Eurobarometer data may contain inaccurate self-reports on undeclared work and social trust may affect the willingness to provide truthful answers, we use more appropriate data in our test. Specifically, we use data from one single country (Danish Values Studies, 1999/2008) and undeclared work morale as an indicator of actual undeclared work where undeclared work morale is the degree to which a person thinks undeclared work is wrong. We find a significant negative relationship between social trust and undeclared work morale after adjusting for a number of important controls. Thus, the evidence is in line with the bivariate picture of the Eurobarometer survey and suggests a dark side of social trust. We provide some initial explanations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

From the Veblenian perspective, nonprofit organization is explained as an institutional consequence of the pecuniary-industrial dichotomy. The Ayresian theoretical system is used to highlight nonprofit organization as a particular form of the progressive weakening of the institution of private property in response to technological imperatives. Based on these arguments, the societal meaning of nonprofit organization is shown to be in realizing instrumental value that is unattainable through pecuniary ceremonial behavior embodied in the for-profit sector. At the same, in line with the Veblenian analysis of American universities, the ability of nonprofit firms to attain instrumental value is recognized as potentially limited by the corrupting effects of the embedding pecuniary culture.","Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe, Volkswagen Fdn, Halle, Germany",Volkswagen; Volkswagen Germany; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Valentinov, V (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe, Volkswagen Fdn, Halle, Germany.",,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; Valentinov, Vladislav/V-2932-2019","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646;",,,,,36,29,38,0,15,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

However, there is heated debate on whether China has passed the Lewis turning point and entered a new era of labor shortage from a period of unlimited labor supply. Most empirical studies on this topic focus on the estimation of total labor supply and demand. Yet the poor quality of labor statistics leaves the debate open. In this paper, China's position along the Lewis continuum is examined though primary surveys of wage rates, a more reliable statistic than employment data. Our results show a clear rising trend of real wages rate since 2003. The acceleration of real wages even in slack seasons indicates that the era of surplus labor is over. This finding has important policy implications for China's future development model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Skilled and unskilled labor are used in the formal sector, whereas only unskilled labor (which moves freely across sectors) is used in the informal economy. The extent to which a permanent increase in the world risk-free interest rate affects the incidence and depth of poverty is shown to depend crucially on the wedge between consumption and product wages. The model is also extended to account for endogenous minimum wages and capital accumulation.","[Agenor, Pierre-Richard] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Studies, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Agénor, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Studies, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",pierre-richard.agenor@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2011,62.0,4,,,,,656,690,,10.1111/j.1467-999X.2011.04137.x,0.0,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,836SR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000296132000008,0

Two types of capital are considered: fixed capital and mobile capital. The effects of search intensity and the inflow of foreign capital on the volume and the rate of urban unemployment and on the social welfare are also examined in both of the two cases. The main finding is: more efficient on-the-job search from the rural sector raises unemployment rate when capital is mobile between the two sectors. This is counterproductive to the standard result.

In the presence of congestion, the consumption tax is shown to be distortionary. Optimal fiscal policy involves using consumption-based instruments in conjunction with the income tax. An income tax-financed increase in government spending dominates both lump-sum and consumption tax-financing. Replacing the lump-sum tax with an income tax to finance a given level of spending dominates introducing an equivalent consumption tax. These results contrast sharply with the literature, where the consumption tax is generally viewed as the least distortionary source of public finance.","[Chatterjee, Santanu] Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Ghosh, Sugata] Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Brunel University,"Chatterjee, S (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",schatt@uga.edu; Sugata.Ghosh@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,,36,25,27,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Agent overconfidence can have conflicting effects on the equilibrium contract. On the one hand, an optimistic or overconfident agent disproportionately values success-contingent payments, and thus prefers higher-powered incentives. On the other hand, if the agent overestimates the extent to which his actions affect outcomes, lower-powered incentives are sufficient to induce any given effort level. If the agent is moderately overconfident, the latter effect dominates. Because the agent bears less risk in this case, there are efficiency gains stemming from his overconfidence. If the agent is significantly overconfident, the former effect dominates; the agent is then exposed to an excessive amount of risk, and any gains arise only from risk-sharing under disagreement. An increase in optimism or overconfidence increases the effort level implemented in equilibrium. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Yet results vary broadly across methods and countries. To examine these vertical spillovers in a systematic way, we collected 3626 estimates of spillovers and reviewed the literature quantitatively. Our meta-analysis indicates that model misspecifications reduce the reported estimates and journals select relatively large estimates for publication. No selection, however, was found for working papers. Taking these biases into consideration, the average spillover to suppliers is economically significant, whereas the spillover to buyers is statistically significant but small. Greater spillovers are received by countries that have underdeveloped financial systems and are open to international trade. Greater spillovers are generated by investors who come from distant countries and have only a slight technological edge over local firms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Part of the output of each sector serves as a production input in both sectors, in accordance with a realistic input-output structure. Strategic complementarities induced by factor demand linkages significantly alter the transmission of shocks and amplify the loss of social welfare under optimal monetary policy, compared to what is observed in standard two-sector models. The distinction between value added and gross output that naturally arises in this context is of key importance to explore the welfare properties of the model economy. A flexible inflation targeting regime is close to optimal only if the central bank balances inflation and value added variability. Otherwise, targeting gross output variability entails a substantial increase in the loss of welfare. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, any use of incentive schemes by a personalistic dictator is limited by the fact that all punishments are conditional on the dictator's own survival. We endogenize loyalty and competence in a principal-agent game between a dictator and his viziers in both static and dynamic settings.

The analysis uses the static two-asset portfolio problem with one safe asset and one uncertain one. While it is intuitive that more ambiguity aversion would reduce demand for the uncertain asset, this is not necessarily the case. We derive sufficient conditions for a reduction in the demand for the uncertain asset and for an increase in the equity premium. An example that meets the sufficient conditions is when the set of plausible distributions for returns on the uncertain asset can be ranked according to their monotone likelihood ratio. It is also shown how ambiguity aversion distorts the price kernel in the alternative portfolio problem with complete markets for contingent claims.","[Gollier, Christian] LERNA, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Gollier, C (通讯作者)，LERNA, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",,"Gollier, Christian/G-4476-2012",,,,,,37,100,109,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We therefore provide stronger evidence that the efficiency effect due to intra-industry spillovers is larger than that generally estimated by data from standard surveys.

Our dataset is a mixed panel/multi-year cross-sections of dwellings/households in the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the United States as of 2008. We estimate static and dynamic models of electricity and gas demand. We find strong household response to energy prices, both in the short and long term. From the static models, we get estimates of the own price elasticity of electricity demand in the -0.860 to -0.667 range, while the own price elasticity of gas demand is -0.693 to -0.566. These results are robust to a variety of checks. Contrary to earlier literature (Metcalf and Hassett, 1999; Reiss and White, 2005), we find no evidence of significantly different elasticities across households with electric and gas heat. The price elasticity of electricity demand declines with income, but the magnitude of this effect is small. These results are in sharp contrast to much of the literature on residential energy consumption in the United States, and with the figures used in current government agency practice.

Indeed, cointegration between the common components of the underlying variables indicates that international developments dominate the long-run relationship between energy consumption and real GDP.

The novel element is that each consumer's willingness to pay for quality is private information and is allowed to differ across brands. The consumer's preferences are represented by a multidimensional type containing the marginal value of quality for different products. Buyers with high willingness to pay for quality also display strong preferences for particular brands, and require higher discounts in order to switch away from their favorite product. Therefore, competition is fiercer for buyers with lower tastes for quality, and hence more elastic demands. This is in sharp contrast to earlier models in which competition is fiercer for higher-taste, more valuable buyers. In equilibrium, firms either compete intensively for the entire market (providing strictly positive rents to all consumers) or shut down the least profitable segment of the market. Quality levels are distorted downwards for all buyers, except for those with the highest type. The number of competing firms and the degree of correlation across brand preferences enhance the efficiency of the allocation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We depart from the existing literature by setting the agent's preference parameters to match target levels of macro-variables observed in the real U. S. economy. In our approach, economies with tempted and nontempted agents are indistinguishable in terms of aggregate consumption, labor, and saving behavior when social security provides a replacement rate of 40% (as in the United States). This situation makes agents bear costly self-control problems over more years. Our simulations indicate that social security improves welfare with degrees of temptation equal to 11% or higher.

Using a simple theoretical framework, we show that international trade systematically affects the distribution of firm size: the power law exponent among exporting firms should be strictly lower in absolute value than the power law exponent among non-exporting firms. We use a dataset of French firms to demonstrate that this prediction is strongly supported by the data, both for the economy as a whole and at the industry level. Furthermore, the differences between power law coefficients for exporters and non-exporters are larger in sectors that are more open to trade. While estimates of power law exponents have been used to pin down parameters in theoretical and quantitative models, our analysis implies that the existing estimates are systematically lower than the true values.

There is no clear-cut relation between the variation of money holdings within generations and age. Furthermore, money is found to be only weakly correlated with both income and wealth. We analyze three motives for money demand in an overlapping generations setup in order to explain these observations: (1) money-in-the-utility, (2) an economy with costly credit service, and (3) limited-participation. All three models are consistent with the hump-shaped relation between average money holdings and age, yet they predict a much closer association between money holdings, income, wealth, and age than we find in the data. Only the limited-participation model partly replicates the low bivariate correlation between money and income as well as between money and interest-bearing assets.

The motivation is to update and extend the literature in an attempt to determine the relationship between the US exchange rate and energy prices. In addition, the causal relationships among the energy futures prices are examined. Cointegration is detected among the variables, but contrary to the existing empirical literature, it is found that the US exchange rate can be excluded from the cointegrating space. The Granger causality tests and impulse response functions also indicate that the US exchange rate is not related to the energy prices. The recursive cointegration analysis reveals that the relationship between the US exchange rate and the energy futures prices has faded across time.","[Li, Raymond] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Raymond] Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Macquarie University,"Li, R (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ray.li@polyu.edu.hk,"Li, Raymond/AAN-6505-2020","Li, Raymond/0000-0002-8868-7104",,,,,22,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

This brings up an interesting question. How do increases in trade affect energy consumption? This study uses panel cointegration data estimation techniques to examine the impact of trade on energy consumption in a sample of 8 Middle Eastern countries covering the period 1980 to 2007. Short-run dynamics show Granger causality from exports to energy consumption, and a bi-directional feedback relationship between imports and energy consumption. Long run elasticities estimated from FMOLS show that a 1% increase in per capita exports increases per capita energy consumption by 0.11% while a one percent increase in per capita imports increases per capita energy consumption by 0.04%. These results are important in establishing that increased trade affects energy demand in the Middle East in both the short and long-run. This has implications for energy policy and environmental policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Instead of viewing the favors' beneficiaries, i.e. the elites, as an exogenous entity, we allow the king to decide whom to coopt provided the subjects are heterogeneous in the potential support-their strength-they could bring to the regime. While the ruler can select the elites on the basis of their personal characteristics, an alternative strategy consists in introducing some uncertainty in the cooptation process. The latter strategy allows the king to reduce the clients' cooptation price since in the event of a revolution the likelihood of being included in the future body of elites is lower. We show that weak rulers are more likely to coopt the society's strongest individuals, while powerful rulers diversify the composition of their clientele. Moreover, when agents value more future discounted outcomes, the king is more likely to randomly coopt subjects.","Univ Namur, B-5000 Namur, Belgium",University of Namur,"Sekeris, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Namur, Rempart Vierge 8, B-5000 Namur, Belgium.",psekeris@fundp.ac.be,"Sekeris, Petros/I-2165-2019; Sekeris, Petros/IAM-7551-2023","Sekeris, Petros/0000-0003-0402-2744;",,,,,36,14,14,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Households largely saved the transfers and tax rebates. The federal government only increased purchases by a small amount. State and local governments saved their stimulus grants and shifted spending away from purchases to transfers. Counterfactual simulations show that the stimulus-induced decrease in state and local government purchases was larger than the increase in federal purchases.

Estimates on a large sample of Italian firms indicate that increased crowdedness has reduced Italian exports, but only by 0.2%-0.3% per year. This is substantially less than the contribution of other factors such as higher unit labour costs or weak demand growth in the EU15.

The model captures financial market institutional quality with creditors' ability to recover assets from bankrupt firms. Bankruptcy costs affect vulnerability to sudden stops directly but also indirectly by affecting the degree of liability dollarization.

Next, we study the possibilities of fiscal policy reducing or even annihilating the effects of the crisis. We also investigate the optimal reaction of fiscal policies based on the assumption that Slovenian policy-makers behave as though they were optimizing an objective function.

We put forward evidence, based on the general-to-specific method, suggesting that the estimated long-run effects of reform on growth are normally distributed, and that accounting for institutions and initial conditions (trade liberalization) are principal factors in decreasing (increasing) the probability of reporting significant and positive effects of reform on growth.

With large debts - e.g. mortgages - such defaults pose a threat to financial system stability. In this paper we use the Polish household budget surveys to simulate the impact of changes in the labour market status of household members on the ability of the household to service its mortgage payments. The simulation results are subsequently aggregated to facilitate a macro-level interpretation of the findings. We simulate various scenarios of labour market deterioration. Finally, we also introduce a policy instrument into the simulations providing, in a fiscally neutral manner, additional stability to the financial system. Based on robustness checks, the findings seem to be reliable. The results suggest that even with shares of debtors among consumers as low as in Poland, the propagation mechanism may indeed result in a considerable threat, while the fiscally neutral instrument is effective and well-suited to be addressed in providing additional stability to the financial system.

To analyse this question, we set up a simple reduced-form model in which monetary and fiscal policy interact, and imbalances (bubbles) can occur in the medium-run. Considering several scenarios with both benevolent and idiosyncratic policy-makers, the analysis shows that the answer depends on a number of characteristics of the economy, as well as on the monetary and fiscal policy preferences with respect to inflation and output stabilisation. We show that socially optimal financial instability prevention should be carried out by: (i) both monetary and fiscal policy (sharing region) under some circumstances; and (ii) fiscal policy only (specialisation region) under others. There is, however, a moral hazard problem: both policy-makers have an incentive to be insufficiently pro-active in safeguarding financial stability and shift the responsibility to the other policy. Specifically, under a range of circumstances, we obtain a situation in which neither policy mitigates instability threats (indifference region). These results can be related to the build-up of the current global financial crisis, and have strong implications for the optimal design of the delegation process.","[Libich, Jan] La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Libich, Jan] Australian Natl Univ, CAMA, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Hallett, Andrew Hughes] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Hallett, Andrew Hughes] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland; [Stehlik, Petr] Univ W Bohemia, Dept Math, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",La Trobe University; Australian National University; George Mason University; University of St Andrews; University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Libich, J (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Sch Business, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",j.libich@latrobe.edu.au,"Libich, Jan/JWO-5802-2024; Libich, Jan/ABD-4410-2020; Stehlik, Petr/C-9618-2016","Libich, Jan/0000-0002-2991-2228; Stehlik, Petr/0000-0003-0585-020X",,,,,26,8,8,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

When purchases can trigger a small donation by an outside anonymous group, consumers respond strongly and apparently without regard for the specific conditions that trigger the donation. Consumers respond similarly when the outside donation requires a personal donation which consumers generally decline. When the outside donations are relatively large, however, consumers appear to pay close attention to the trigger conditions, and increase their purchases only where needed to generate the outside donation. Overall, increasing the salience of financial incentives weakens consumers' positive responses to the outside group's donation pledges. We also present evidence that the donation pledges have positive long-term effects on demand and may reduce price sensitivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A logarithmic form of demand function for employment, derived from the constant elasticity of substitution production function is estimated. An interaction variable is introduced after having ensured that the employment function has a structural shift by Chow break test. The results based on the time series data from the period 1969-1970 to 2004-2005, show that the positive magnitude of elasticity of employment with respect to output in transport, storage and communications industry is relatively very high, as the differential output elasticity of employment is not only positive but also more than unity followed by wholesale and retail trade and financing, insurance and real estate industries in the private organized sector during the post-economic reform period. This reflects the fact that the labor absorption capacity in the industries of transport, storage and communications, wholesale and retail, financing, insurance and real estate is relatively high. The magnitude of output elasticity of employment in financing, insurance and real estate is relatively high during the post-economic reform period as the differential output elasticity of employment is relatively small as compared to output elasticity of employment during the pre-economic reform period. The labor absorption capacity in private sector during the post-reform period is found to be relatively high as compared to public sector as the differential employment elasticity during the post-reform period in private sector is low. Further the results for the organized sector as a whole illustrate that the output elasticity of employment during the post-reform period is negative on account of negative differential output elasticity of employment showing that the economic growth during the post-reform period is not labor intensive in the Indian economy. Therefore, there is a need to review the sectoral policies to generate additional employment opportunities in the organised sector of the Indian economy.","Osmania Univ, Dept Econ, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India",Osmania University,"Upender, M (通讯作者)，Osmania Univ, Dept Econ, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India.",profmupender@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,4,2,2,1,14,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

It uses a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model characterized by search and matching frictions in the labor market and nominal rigidities in the goods market. It finds that firing costs and unemployment benefits can have substantial effects on aggregate fluctuations. Increasing firing costs decreases the volatility of output, employment, and job flows due to the reduction in the mass of jobs sensitive to disturbances and lower incentives for firms to hire and fire workers. Hence, firms adjust to shocks mainly through prices, causing inflation to become more volatile. Raising unemployment benefits has the reverse effect on aggregate fluctuations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In order to upgrade the skill workforce the firm has at least two main channels at its disposal: the external labour market strategy, mainly based on hiring and firing mechanisms; the internal labour market strategies, which improve the skill base of the employees through training activities. The main objective of the present work is to verify the relations between innovative strategies and both the workforce composition and the training activities, within an integrated framework that also leads us to consider the role of specific aspects of the industrial relations system. The firm level analysis is based on original datasets which include data on manufacturing firms for two Italian local production systems, located in the Emilia-Romagna region. The results suggest that the firms use both the two channels to improve their skill base, which is actually related to the innovation activities, although there is weak supporting evidence of the use of external labour markets to upgrade the workforce skills: the upskilling phenomenon seems to be associated to specific innovative activities in the technological sphere, while specific organisational aspects emerge as detrimental for blue collars. On the side of internal labour market strategies the evidence supports the hypothesis that innovation intensity induces the firms to implement internal procedures in order to upskill the workforce, confirming the importance of internal labour market strategies. Moreover, we have recognized the important role of firm level industrial relations in determining the training activities for the blue collar workers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This paper examines whether natural resources in host countries alter this relationship. We estimate a linear dynamic panel-data model using data from 112 developing countries over the period 1982-2007. We find that democracy promotes FDI if and only if the value of the share of minerals and oil in total exports is less than some critical value. We identify 90 countries where an expansion of democracy may enhance FDI and 22 countries where an increase in democratization may reduce FDI. We also find that the effect of democracy on FDI depends on the size and not the type of natural resources. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, most of these experiments use numeric effort tasks that subjects may not be intrinsically motivated to complete. This paper aims to analyze the incentive effects of monitoring using a real-effort task for which intrinsic motivation is more likely to exist. We conducted two similar experiments, in the lab in Montreal and in the field in Ouagadougou. In contrast to the lab, subjects in the field are unaware they are taking part in an experiment. The following results are observed both in the lab and in the field. Relative to the baseline treatment, we find that our two monitoring treatments significantly increase effort, in line with agency theory. However, effort levels are not significantly different between the monitoring treatments.

In our benchmark case, each principal is matched with one agent of unknown type. In our second treatment, a principal can select one of three agents, while in a third treatment an agent may choose between the contract menus offered by two principals. We first show theoretically how different ratios of principals and agents affect outcomes and efficiency. Informational asymmetries generate inefficiency. In an environment where principals compete against each other to hire agents, these inefficiencies may disappear, but they are insensitive to the number of principals. In contrast, when agents compete to be hired, efficiency improves dramatically, and it increases in the relative number of agents because competition reduces the agents' informational monopoly power. However, this environment also generates a high inequality level and is characterized by multiple equilibria. In general, there is a fairly high degree of correspondence between the theoretical predictions and the contract menus actually chosen in each treatment. There is, however, a tendency to choose more 'generous' (and more efficient) contract menus over time. We find that competition leads to a substantially higher probability of trade, and that, overall, competition between agents generates the most efficient outcomes.","[Charness, Gary] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Cabrales, Antonio] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Villeval, Marie Claire] Univ Lyon, CNRS, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Villeval, Marie Claire] GATE Lyon St Etienne, CNRS, F-69130 Ecully, France",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2,"Charness, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",antonio.cabrales@uc3m.es; charness@econ.ucsb.edu; villeval@gate.cnrs.fr,"Cabrales, Antonio/AAC-1805-2020; Charness, Gary/JVP-0357-2024; Villeval, Marie Claire/H-7773-2017","Cabrales, Antonio/0000-0003-0209-0399; Villeval, Marie Claire/0000-0001-8578-5449",,,,,46,16,19,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Despite a natural association with concepts of life cycles, industrial policy has not been analyzed in the context of an industry life-cycle model. In particular, an important life-cycle characteristic, the potential for very large changes in the rate of net entry, is ignored. In this paper, we demonstrate how the impact of industrial policy depends critically on the entry and exit dynamics within an industry. We construct a model of technology adoption in which the number of firms is endogenous, and derive a set of novel predictions about the effects of protection on firm technology decisions. Specifically, we show that permanent protection can induce earlier adoption, but also decreases the probability that a given firm adopts the new technology. Likewise, we demonstrate that reducing the duration of protection results in faster adoption than permanent protection, but also reduces a given firm's probability of adoption. Finally, we show that, for industries characterized by flexibility in firm numbers, protection does not change the rate of technology adoption but does increase the size and probability of a shakeout (large scale net exit).

Differences between the SOEME and the SOE are derived. Parameters depend on features of the labor market and on consumption inequality, and affect the natural interest rate, terms of trade and potential output. The supply curve turns out to be flatter and more volatile, with a larger number of shift factors, including policy-determined terms of trade. A simple basic version of the model is simulated in order to compare different policy targets in response to a cost shock. Flexible domestic inflation targeting gives the lowest volatility although there are trade-offs. Exchange rate volatility is relatively lower but still makes a major contribution to controlling inflation. Flexible CPI inflation targeting performs better when combined with some kind of managed floating. Inflation targeting has to be flexible. With more backward-looking behavior the policy response to a shock is reduced. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Despite of its simple structure, the resulting dynamic system shows emergence of erratic fluctuations in the capital accumulation process when the production function is unimodal and the delay in production is explicitly considered. It complements the seminal paper of Day (1982) in which a discrete-time neoclassical growth model displayed chaotic behavior for some configurations of the propensity to save, the growth rate of labor and the capital depreciation rate. Our analysis has at least two implications. First, nonlinearities and delay matter for a birth of aperiodic fluctuations of national product in the continuous-time model. Second, comparing the effects caused by two different time delays, fixed and continuously distributed time delays, reveals that the continuous-time model with the former can generate complex fluctuations while the one with the latter generates simple fluctuations when the shape parameter of the density function is small and complex fluctuations when large.

These insights are obtained for extremely simplified economies or rely on unrealistically simple social networks. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a sense for the quantitative importance of effects generated by real life social networks. In this paper, I augment a labor market matching model to allow for information transmission through social networks. I illustrate the effects of social networks and I use simulations to quantify the predictions of the model for complex and realistic social networks. Information transmission through social contacts reduces the steady state unemployment rate from a hypothetical 6.5% to 5%. Social referrals can explain 1/5th of the observed duration dependence of unemployment.

Dealing with identification and the large dimensionality of the empirical exercise with a Global VAR approach, the findings highlight the diversity of the transmission process. While liquidity shocks have had a more severe impact on advanced economies, it was mainly the decline in risk appetite that affected emerging market economies. The tightening of financial conditions was a key transmission channel for advanced economies, whereas for emerging markets it was mainly the real side of the economy that suffered. Moreover, there are some striking differences also within types of economies, with Europe being more adversely affected by the fall in risk appetite than other advanced economies.

In the model, firms are heterogeneous in productivity and make investment and financing decisions subject to capital adjustment costs, equity issuance costs, and collateral constraints. We show that when the dividend and capital gains tax cuts are unexpected and permanent, dividend payments, equity issuance, and aggregate investment rise immediately. By contrast, when these tax cuts are unexpected and temporary, aggregate investment falls in the short run. This fall allows firms to distribute large dividends initially in response to the temporary dividend tax cut. We also find that the effects of a temporary dividend tax cut are very different from those of a temporary capital gains tax cut. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we study the implications for merger policy when countries non-cooperatively deploy production-based taxes and firms may be partly owned by foreigners. We find that when foreign firm ownership is low in the pre-merger situation, non-cooperative tax policies are more efficient after a national merger, and smaller synergy effects are needed for this type of merger to be proposed and cleared. In contrast, cross-border mergers dominate when the degree of foreign firm ownership is high initially. These results suggest a link between increasing international portfolio diversification and the rising share of cross-border mergers.","[Haufler, Andreas] Univ Munich, Seminar Econ Policy, D-80799 Munich, Germany; [Schulte, Christian] Univ Munich, Munich Grad Sch Econ, D-80799 Munich, Germany",University of Munich; University of Munich,"Haufler, A (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Seminar Econ Policy, Akad Str 1 2, D-80799 Munich, Germany.",Andreas.Haufler@lrz.uni-muenchen.de; Christian.Schulte@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,"Haufler, Andreas/D-8591-2011",,,,,,32,5,6,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The three episodes, he argued, provided a natural experiment to test his and Anna J. Schwartz's explanation of the Great Depression of the 1930s. I use similar data for the U.S. recession that began in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a fourth such natural experiment. What makes this episode particularly interesting are the continuing comparisons between it and the Great Depression that have been made as events unfolded. The results are clear-cut. In the recent recession, like the U.S recessions at the start of this century and the Japanese recession in the 1990s, there were no severe monetary shocks of the sort experienced in the 1930s. This recession, again like the other two, has been very much milder, and very likely will prove very much shorter than the Great Depression. This, in turn, is exactly what the Friedman and Schwartz hypothesis predicts.","Fordham Univ, Sch Business, New York, NY 11209 USA",Fordham University,"Lothian, JR (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Sch Business, 113 W 60th St, New York, NY 11209 USA.",lothian@fordham.edu,,,,,,,16,6,6,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The objective is to obtain general mechanisms within a general setting in order to complement the much advanced but model specific literature. It turns out that these arithmetic and simultaneously economic conditions for thresholds or indeterminacy require complementarity and non-moderate dynamic social influence. In other words, complexities can be related (necessary and sufficient) to a familiar static property that social interactions turn the (stationary) demand for the private stock into a Giffen good. Indeterminacy requires in addition 'low' subjective discounting and proper interactions between control, stock and externality.

To this end, Martin Feldstein's pro-privatization rhetoric will be compared to that of President Bush. In doing so, we will aim at showing that just as the political rhetoric of Social Security invokes the authority of ideographs such as personal ownership to draw on a society's ideological and cultural repertoire, economic rhetoric undertakes a similar task by employing economic ideographs like deadweight loss to resonate with fellow economists through an appeal to the implicit normative premises embedded in the language of economics.","Columbia Coll Chicago, Chicago, IL USA",,"Avsar, RB (通讯作者)，Columbia Coll Chicago, Chicago, IL USA.",,"Avsar, Rojhat/AAM-1333-2021","Avsar, Rojhat/0000-0001-6904-4800",,,,,50,7,11,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The model explains how two distinct policy shocks involving redistribution and immigration imply, subsequently, two completely opposite outcomes. Agents' inability to borrow aggravates a negative macroeconomic effect of heterogeneity on growth. Redistribution mitigates that effect but creates microeconomic disincentives on saving and work-effort. Consequently, immigration shocks that perturb variance of efficiency induce a negative growth-inequality relationship, while redistribution shocks, in New Zealand's case, produce larger fluctuations in incentives than in macro benefits, implying a positive growth-inequality relationship.

Interest-lending prohibition persisted under Islamic rule much longer than in the rest of Europe. The unique history and political fragmentation of the region allows investigating within-country effects, in six countries that were formerly only partly occupied by the Ottoman Empire. Former Islamic rule is consistently associated with lower contemporaneous formal financial development, both across and within countries. It is associated with a decrease in bank penetration by 10% across countries and 4% within countries. However, within country, the effect of the Ottoman Empire is confined to financial development. There is no association between former Ottoman rule. income, small and medium sized enterprise development or entrepreneurship. The effect is robust to controlling for a wide number of observable characteristics. Moreover, localities with Armenian. Jewish or Greek minorities, who were allowed to practice interest lending under Ottoman rule, have higher levels of bank penetration. By contrast, Islamic religion and trust in the financial system play no role in explaining such long-term persistence. journal of Comparative Economics 39 (1) (2011) 1-16.

Recently, scholars have taken the important step of investigating whether certain types of communication (e. g., promises) might affect decisions differently than other types of communication. This requires classifying natural language messages. Unfortunately, no broadly-accepted method is available for this purpose. We here describe a coordination game for classification of natural language messages. The game is similar in spirit to the ESP game that has proven successful for the classification of tens of millions of internet images. We compare our approach to self-classification as well as to classifications based on a standard content analysis.

Agents do not predict human behavior in a new set of experiments because subjects innovate, constructing a property convention of mutual taking in 5 out of the 6 experimental sessions that allows exchange to crowd out theft. When the same convention is made available to agents, they adopt it and again replicate human behavior.

The model consists of an investment stage with uncertain returns and subsequent quantity competition. The access price is a function of investment costs and the regulatory regime. A regime with fully distributed costs or a regulatory holiday induces highest investments, followed by risk-sharing and long run incremental costs regulation. Simulations indicate that risk-sharing creates most consumer welfare, followed by regimes with fully distributed costs, regulatory holiday and long run incremental costs, respectively. Risk-sharing benefits consumers as it combines relatively high ex-ante investment incentives with strong ex-post competitive intensity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Finally, results from non-linear panel data estimation reveal that patents are not deemed as useful appropriability instruments by software firms and that a threat effect by hardware firms is growing in importance.

In most impact studies, the supply chain between agricultural production and final consumption is modelled in a perfectly competitive framework. However, there is a growing attention of stakeholders for the presence of imperfectly competitive markets, with the retail sector often being under investigation. This issue is empirically analysed with an application to the dairy industry. First, the degree of market power is estimated using a multi-output demand and price transmission equation system. Then, this model is used for policy simulation with the perfect competition outcome taken as a benchmark to evaluate the impact of imperfect competition. Results show a significant degree of market power in the dairy industry with implications on the projected policy scenarios. Moreover, the imperfect competition model alters the price transmission mechanisms, generating more flexible price trends. (C) 2010 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The empirical analysis is based on survey and ownership data for a large sample of small- and medium-sized German firms. After controlling for endogeneity and selection bias, we find that foreign acquisitions have a large negative impact on the propensity to perform innovation activities and a negative impact on average R&D expenditures in innovative firms. Furthermore, innovation output, measured as product and process innovations, and the share of sales from product innovations, is not significantly affected by a foreign acquisition for a given amount of innovation efforts. Hence, the estimation results do not provide any evidence of significant technology transfer through foreign acquisitions in form of a higher innovation success. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We present a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) of a sample of 38 vehicle inspection units under a concession regime with a homogeneous level of quality. which is enforced by a regional regulator, between the years 2000 and 2004. The differences in efficiency scores show the potential technical efficiency benefits of introducing some form of incentive regulation or of progressing towards liberalization. We also compute scale efficiency scores, showing that only units in territories with a very low population density operate at a sub-optimal scale. Among those that operate at an optimal scale, there are significant differences in size; the largest ones operate in territories with the highest population density. This suggests that the introduction of new units into the most densely populated territories (a likely effect of some form of liberalization) would not be detrimental in terms of scale efficiency. The firm's identity seems to be a determinant of the distance to the efficiency frontier. Finally, we show that between 2002 and 2004, a period of high regulatory uncertainty in the sample's region. technical change was almost zero. Regulatory reform should take due account of scale and diversification effects, while at the same time avoiding regulatory uncertainty.","[Trillas, Francesc] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Montolio, Daniel; Duch, Nestor] Univ Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Trillas, F (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Duch-Brown, Nestor/L-2767-2014; Montolio, Daniel/F-1204-2016; Trillas, Francesc/L-4642-2014","Duch-Brown, Nestor/0000-0002-7727-5868; Trillas, Francesc/0000-0002-2148-3545",,,,,31,3,3,0,5,UNIV ZARAGOZA,ZARAGOZA,"DEPT ESTRUCTURA ECONOMICA ECONOMIA PUBLICA, GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

Yet competition agencies have different safe harbours. We used merger models to run many simulations involving a wide range of market structures and merger-induced aggregations. The post-merger unilateral price increases in these scenarios were used to gauge what the safe harbours should be to keep price increases below a specified threshold. The safe harbour thresholds commonly used were found typically to be too restrictive, in that they failed to screen out mergers that were almost certainly competitively benign.","[Yang, Qing Gong; Pickford, Michael] Commerce Commiss Wellington, Econ Serv Branch, Wellington, New Zealand",,"Yang, QG (通讯作者)，Commerce Commiss Wellington, Econ Serv Branch, Wellington, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,59,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

The paper provides provisional estimates of this cost and looks at its implications for the sustainability of public finances, taking into account also the impact of aging populations. The historical experience suggests that economic growth is persistently lowered in the aftermath of financial crisis, making fiscal consolidation more difficult yet all the more essential. Meanwhile the timing of the exit from fiscal stimulus and subsequent fiscal consolidation must reconcile sustainability and stabilisation goals-a delicate balancing act. The paper will argue in favour of structural reform to boost the economic growth potential alongside fiscal consolidation. The fiscal coordination framework in the EU, together with the Europe 2020 strategy, is seen to underpin this approach.","OECD, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"van den Noord, P (通讯作者)，OECD, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",paul.vandennoord@oecd.org,,"van den Noord, Paul/0000-0001-5725-5811",,,,,29,5,5,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2011,38.0,1,,,SI,,19,51,,10.1007/s10663-010-9144-1,0.0,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022VR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309992700003,0

In case of a rigorous analysis one can see that just these two forces (often chaotic and therefore unpredictable) attracted the economic system in hazardous situations. Under the impact of their actions would be added an infernal race to have exaggerated profits in case of some capitalists, undeserved incomes in case of some employees (generally stimulated by trade unions), rapid and exaggerated consumption in case of some households, increased material advantages in case of some assisted persons, etc. When such tendencies are generalised, the resulting imagine could be a bleak: economic agents, including the representative agent at the macroeconomic level, presumed to be rational, by economic theory, begin to ckmonstrate some strange behaviour ranging from atypical to the irrational.

Results obtained in these studies about the causal link appear to be sensitive with respect to the countries analyzed, sample period and methodology employed. Considering the sensitivity of the causal link, we use the rolling window and time-varying coefficients estimation methods to analyze the Granger causality based on Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). When applied to Turkey for the 1963-2006 periods, this methodology enables us to overcome differences in the outcome of the tests performed in other studies for tourism receipts and GDP. The findings of this paper are as follows: results from the full sample within the VECM model indicate that there is no Granger causality between the series, while the findings from the time-varying coefficients model based on the state-space model and rolling window technique show that GDP has no predictive power for tourism receipts; however, tourism receipts have a positive-predictive content for GDP following early 1980s.

This article examines the effects of the Food Stamp Program on the prevalence of obesity using 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data. Results indicate that food stamps have significant positive effects on obesity and the obesity gap for females, but these effects are relatively small, and consequently, such benefits are approximated to have played a minor role in increasing obesity at the aggregate level.","[Baum, Charles L.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA",Middle Tennessee State University,"Baum, CL (通讯作者)，Middle Tennessee State Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, POB 27, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.",cbaum@mtsu.edu,,,,,,,63,38,59,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The down turn that appears to have begun in the USA in September, 2008 have negative impact on Indian economy. The most immediate effect of this global financial crisis on India is an out flow of foreign institutional investment (Fit) from the equity market. This withdrawal by the FIIs led to a steep depreciation of the rupee. The banking and non-banking financial institutions have been suffering losses. The recession generated the financial crisis in USA and other developed economies have adversely affected India's exports of software and IT services. For fighting this crisis, government responded through its monetary policy by pumping the liquidity into the system rather than using effective fiscal policy i.e. public expenditure and investment to face the recession. No doubt, government has introduced three fiscal stimulus packages for stimulating demand in the economy but it is not sufficient, the larger government expenditure should be oriented towards agriculture and infrastructure. The present paper is an attempt to analyze the impact of recent global financial meltdown on Indian economy. The paper is divided into three sections. In the first introductory section, we have discussed the features of recent global financial meltdown. The section two, deals with the impact of this crisis on Indian economy.

On the other hand, the response rate drops when the Internet is the only response and recruiting mode. A mixed mode survey, where the Internet is the primary method but where respondents are knowingly subject to a telephone follow up survey, is found to give substantially higher Internet response rates. If the telephone follow-up does not include SC questions, the value of time result will still be biased.

In addition, an adverse financial shock produces sizeable declines in output, inflation and interest rates. In the long-run analysis, we finnd the following effects of banking intermediation: (i) the stock of capital increases to take advantage of its collateral services, and (ii) consumption and labor fall in response to the finance cost attached to purchases of goods. Using the baseline calibrated model, we show how a 10 percent increase in banking efficiency would result in a permanent welfare gain equivalent to 0.3 percent of output.","[Casares, Miguel] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain; [Poutineau, Jean-Christophe] Univ Rennes 1, F-35014 Rennes, France",Universidad Publica de Navarra; Universite de Rennes,"Casares, M (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain.",mcasares@unavarra.es; jean-christophe.poutineau@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

By utilizing 650 observations of Taiwan banks, this study examines the effects of specific types of ownership on the risk-taking behaviours of banks under differential ownership structures. In light of the increasing foreign institution ownership during privatization, this article further constructs relative governance strength variables to observe how inside management and foreign institutions interact to affect these banks' risk-taking. The results show that banks with higher inside management ownership and higher government ownership have higher overdue loan and lower capital adequacy ratios. Banks with higher foreign institution ownership and stronger relative governance strength are associated with lower overdue loans and higher regulatory capital. In general, the results are consistent regardless of the choice of ownership structure or relative governance strength of foreign institutions as independent variable. These findings contribute to add evidence for risk-taking behaviour manifested by banks in the emerging market, where feasible monitoring mechanisms still need to be explored.","[Chou, Shuching] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Grad Inst Finance, Touliu 640, Yunlin, Taiwan; [Lin, Fengyi] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Business Management, Taipei 106, Taiwan",National Yunlin University Science & Technology; National Taipei University of Technology,"Chou, SC (通讯作者)，Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Grad Inst Finance, 123,Sect 3,Univ Rd, Touliu 640, Yunlin, Taiwan.",chousc@yuntech.edu.tw,,,,,,,42,13,13,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

CEE countries liberalised their trade with the European Union from the mid-1990s, while also receiving substantial foreign investment in the process. The first part of the period witnessed strong agglomeration effects in all of the countries, leading progressively to core-periphery type specialisation, and increasing regional wage differentials. In the second part of the period, however, there is notable evidence of a reversal in the relative regional specialisation, pointing to a U-shaped pattern of relative regional wages. Using the regional data for five CEE countries in 1990-2004 we argue that FDI inflows can be an important factor accelerating the observed regional adjustment process in the host country. First, we show that in four out of five CEE countries there is a significant U-shaped adjustment pattern of regional wages after they opened up to foreign trade. Second, we find robust econometric confirmation that in three of the five countries FDI has contributed significantly to faster adjustment of relative regional wages.","[Damijan, Joze P.; Kostevc, Crt] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia; [Damijan, Joze P.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS, Louvain, Belgium",University of Ljubljana; KU Leuven,"Kostevc, C (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.",crt.kostevc@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Damijan, Joze/0000-0001-9150-1174",,,,,46,11,11,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,2,,,,,163,189,PII 937641138,10.1080/14631377.2011.570041,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,764XM,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290667900002,0

The basic reason put forward is that to aim for more equitable distribution will reduce total savings in short and medium terms by reducing the weighted average of propensities to save of the different strata of the society. Therefore, the main objective for countries in transitional period is to have a higher economic growth rather than a fairer distribution of income. Recent developments on economic growth studies from a longer perspective and with sustainability criterion has put above idea in real jeopardy. It is shown that by paying more attention to justifiable distribution especially among different generations will promote a higher genuine savings which results in a higher rate of steady economic growth. In this research we use dynamic optimization approach (optimal control) for studying the mechanics of this regularity and test the proposition for selected MENA zone countries and then compare with some developed countries. Our ultimate goal is suggesting a fair fiscal policy to have a high economic growth compatible with a fairer distribution of wealth and income. It seems that any attempt to provide a more equitable condition, will be eventually reached to a higher capital formation, higher saving and higher output per capita in MENA region compared with selected developed countries.

This paper develops an analytical model that is applicable to any sector characterized by asymmetric VAT exemptions of services and activities. We analyze the effects of such asymmetric tax regimes on market shares, optimal prices, tax receipts, and social welfare. The analytical model shows how asymmetric VAT exemptions distort competition by strengthening the competitive position of non-rated firms. The net effect of such tax exemptions depends on the fraction of VAT-rated inputs versus the fraction of non-rated customers. We further elucidate main competitive impacts of VAT policies, while showing their consequences on overall welfare by presenting simulation results based on a calibrated quantitative model of a selected sector.

We separate the overall mortality gap into three temporal components-fitness at birth, conditional neonatal mortality, and conditional post-neonatal mortality-and quantify the extent to which each of the components can be predicted using a flexible reweighting method. Almost 90 percent of the overall mortality gap is due to differential fitness at birth, little of which can be predicted by racial differences in background characteristics. The remaining mortality gap stems from conditional post-neonatal mortality differences, nearly all of which can be predicted by background characteristics. The predictability of the mortality gap has declined substantially over the past two decades, largely because the mortality gap among extremely low-fitness infants is increasingly unrelated to background characteristics.","[Elder, Todd E.; Goddeeris, John H.; Haider, Steven J.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Elder, TE (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",telder@msu.edu; goddeeri@msu.edu; haider@msu.edu,,,,,,,39,11,16,1,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We distinguish between different origins of ownership and study wage and productivity differences. The raw wage differential between foreign and domestically-owned firms is about 23 percent. The empirical analysis is carried out on both firm- and individual-level data. A key finding is that industry, region and notably human capital explain only a small part of the foreign-domestic ownership wage differential. Both white and blue collar workers as well as skilled and unskilled employees obtain a foreign ownership wage premium. Foreign ownership premia are more prevalent in older and less technologically advanced firms. Joint estimation of productivity and wage equations show that, controlling for human capital, the difference in productivity is about twice as large as the wage differential. Overall, results indicate that the international firms share their rents with their employees.","[Eriksson, Tor; Pytlikova, Mariola] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Sch Business & Social Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Eriksson, T (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Sch Business & Social Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",tor@asb.dk; marp@asb.dk,"Pytlikova, Mariola/I-5193-2018","Pytlikova, Mariola/0000-0002-0639-152X; Eriksson, Tor/0000-0001-9309-5499",,,,,42,6,6,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

One of the firm is a brick-and-mortar one while the other is on-line. Both firms sell the same product except that (constant) marginal costs may differ. Consumers going to the shop around the corner face transportation costs according to their adress whereas on-line consumers bear a fix cost that may capture technological burden and risk premium. In the pricing Nash equilibria the new economy firm has smaller market shares eventhough it offers more attractive prices. For the on-line firm to become a leader, the cost difference must be large enough to offset the comparative disadvantage it face on the demand side. In the long run, increasing competition ultimately forces the local firm out of downtown. We argue that this effect may be related to some of the forecasts concerning the geographical impact of the development of remote access services.","[Foncel, Jerome; Guyot, Marianne; Jouneau-Sion, Frederic] Univ Lille 3, GREMARS, F-59653 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Jouneau-Sion, Frederic] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium",Universite de Lille; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Foncel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 3, GREMARS, F-59653 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",,,,,,,,16,5,5,0,14,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Our main goal is to test whether this new figure has modified the labour supply behaviour of those workers who receive Renta Agraria, in comparison to the one of those who still receive Subsidio Agrario. Our results indicate that workers under the new regime have shorter unemployment spells than those with Subsidio.

Using data for 90 countries between 1965 and 1999, we find evidence in support of the theory, especially for oil and mineral booms.

The effects of increasing the Value Added Tax (VAT) on purchases of SSCSD are estimated. Obesity is more likely among heavy drinkers than among light or moderate drinkers. Therefore, the effects on high- and low-purchasing households are estimated by using Quantile Regressions (QRs) on Norwegian household purchase data. Since many households did not purchase SSCSD during each survey period, censored as well as ordinary QRs are used. Our results suggest that a VAT increase from 13 to 25% will have the highest percentage effect among low-purchasing households but the absolute effect is highest among high-purchasing households. Low-purchasing households will reduce their purchases by about 5 L while the reduction is almost 20 L among high-purchasing households. However, the effects among high-purchasing households are not statistically significant from zero. A reduction of 5 L corresponds ceteris paribus to an annual reduction of about 0.3 kg of body weight.","[Gustavsen, Geir Waehler; Rickertsen, Kyrre] Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, Oslo, Norway; [Rickertsen, Kyrre] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Rickertsen, K (通讯作者)，Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, Oslo, Norway.",kyrre.rickertsen@umb.no,"Rickertsen, Kyrre/AAG-6921-2020","Rickertsen, Kyrre/0000-0002-5068-0847",,,,,23,28,32,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The empirical results show that individual traders traded towards increasing arbitrage opportunities unlike other types of traders. This study helps explain the reason why arbitrage opportunities persist even when arbitrage trading is executed in the real world. According to our empirical results, arbitrage opportunities can persist if the behaviour of individual traders regarding arbitrage opportunities overwhelms other traders who are against arbitrage opportunities. This is not fully explained by previous studies that attributed the persistence of arbitrage opportunities to the limit to arbitrage. In this context, this study suggests that two separate arguments need to be combined for explaining arbitrage trading in the real world, namely studies of arbitrage trading and the behavioural approach.","[Won, Seungyeon] Myongji Univ, Dept Business Adm, Seoul 120728, South Korea; [Hahn, Sang Buhm] Kyonggi Univ, Dept Econ, Suwon 443760, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Myongji University; Kyonggi University,"Won, S (通讯作者)，Myongji Univ, Dept Business Adm, 50-3 Namgajwadong, Seoul 120728, South Korea.",sywonb@yahoo.co.kr,,"Hahn, Sang Buhm/0000-0002-0669-3114",,,,,10,0,0,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

As a result, economists moved away from trade as a plausible explanation for rising income inequality. In recent years, however, a number of new mechanisms have been explored through which trade can affect (and usually increase) income inequality. These include within-industry effects due to heterogeneous firms, the effects of offshoring of tasks, effects on incomplete contracting, and the effects of labor-market frictions. A number of these mechanisms have received substantial empirical support.","[Harrison, Ann] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Harrison, Ann] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [McLaren, John] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [McMillan, Margaret] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [McMillan, Margaret] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; The World Bank; University of Virginia; Tufts University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Harrison, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jmclaren@virginia.edu,,"McLaren, John/0000-0003-1030-9880; Harrison, Ann/0000-0002-1873-2432",,,,,71,90,104,2,37,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4603-4,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

While much research has been devoted to measuring this reduced-form parameter, less is known about its underlying structural determinants. Using a model with exogenous talent endowments, endogenous parental investment in children, and endogenous redistributive institutions, we identify the structural parameters that govern the intergenerational elasticity of income. The model clarifies how the interaction between private and collective decisions determines the equilibrium level of social mobility. Two societies with similar economic and biological fundamentals may have vastly different degrees of intergenerational mobility depending on their political institutions. We offer empirical evidence in line with the predictions of the model. We conclude that international comparisons of intergenerational elasticity of income are not particularly informative about fairness without taking into account differences in politico-economic institutions.

We seek to analyze to what extent the state governments are benefiting from the investments that they have made in the form of development projects. Given the weak temporal dimension of our sample, we will apply the generalized method of moments (GMM) as developed by Arellano and Bond (1991). The results of our estimations show that when a one-period lag is retained, the state governments' revenue is significantly and positively associated with development expenditure. An increase in development projects will lead to an increase in state governments' revenues. However, the results of the other two estimations show that development expenditures are not correlated with state governments' revenue. Together these results may imply that the effect of development projects on state governments' revenues only lasts for one year and will disappear afterwards. This in turn may be explained by the fact that most if not all development projects implemented by the state governments are rather small in scope and with immediate or short term effect. Nevertheless, the results are not sufficient for us to claim that the revenues obtained from these channels will necessarily be used for the repayment of the debt contracted to finance the projects. A further investigation is needed in order to see to what extent the proceeds from the development projects carried out by the state governments in Malaysia is used to repay their loans.","[Jalil, Ahmad Zafarullah Abdul; Harun, Mukaramah; Mat, Siti Hadijah Che] Univ Utara Malaysia, Dept Econ, Coll Business, Sintok 06010, Kedah, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,,zafar@uum.edu.my,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9083-4,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,10.0,,,,,,131,135,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZY02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303284800024,0

This inquiry considers 14 EU countries, and in the period from 1995 to 2008, which are grouped according to welfare state regimes We consider Social Democratic, Corporatist, Mediterranean and Liberal welfare state regimes. Panel regression results indicate that political orientation engenders no significant statistically measurable effects on poverty rates before social spending. Effects register, however, as significant when considering poverty rates after social spending. With respect to the first set of results, we advance two key explanations. First, we note a longer period of time is necessary in order to observe actual effects of political orientation on market generated poverty. Second, political parties with their respective programs do not register as influential enough to solve social problems related to income disiribution when taken alone. Influences register as indirect and are expressed through changes in employment rates and social spending. The second set of results support the hypothesis that a selected political regime does indeed contribute to poverty reduction. In sum, political orientation and political regime does indeed affect poverty through welfare state institutions, as well as through labour market institutions.","[Josifidis, Kosta; Supic, Novica; Ivancev, Olgica] Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Hall, John] Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA",University of Novi Sad; Portland State University,"Josifidis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",josifidis@gmail.com; johnbattailehall@gmail.com; novicasupic@yahoo.com; olgicai@ef.uns.ac.rs,"Supic, Novica/ABF-9244-2022; Supic, Novica/Q-8905-2019","Supic, Novica/0000-0002-9526-7255;",,,,,37,8,8,0,18,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,5,,,SI,,651,674,,10.2298/PAN1105651J,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,877OY,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299193000006,0

Priorities in economic growth and income distribution are different opinions. Some groups conceive that there exist incompatibility and conflict between economic growth and equitable distribution of income, and unfair income distribution in the early stages of economic growth of any country is considered necessary, believing that income distribution has precedence over economic growth. In contrast, others believe that increasing inequality is an obstacle to the economic growth, and economic growth is prior to income distribution. There are still other groups who say economic growth and income distribution have no priority over one another. This paper reviews theoretically the analysis of the three groups, as mentioned, and considers Iran's experience in this regard, concluding that in Iran income inequality has had no effect on the increase of economic growth rate, and economic development objectives and equitable distribution of income have been consistent and compatible.

Interestingly, the Kuznets curve for intra-household inequality is absent and to our knowledge the paper provides the first attempt in determining the factors that influence intra-household inequality. It was found that variation in the age of family members only affected inequality in low-expenditure groups while total assets affected inequality in the mid-level-expenditure group. Age variations arise due to the existence of intergenerational family structure among the poorer households and strong affinity towards asset accumulation among the middle class could have harmful effects on the development of children and the welfare of the weaker members within such families. These intra-family distributional problems can be addressed through targeted redistributive policies to provide additional resources and enhance family cohesion.","[Mahadevan, Renuka] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Kumar, Sunil] Univ S Pacific, Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Suva, Fiji",University of Queensland; University of the South Pacific,"Mahadevan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",r.mahadevan@uq.edu.au,"Mahadevan, Renuka/AAA-1046-2019","Mahadevan, Renuka/0000-0003-4105-2993",,,,,44,2,2,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

This paper uses a structural VAR framework to assess the inertia and responsiveness to business cycle fluctuations of government revenues and expenditures in Romania, thus shedding light on the fiscal sustainability of this country. A desirable situation that signals a strong fiscal position is that in which public revenues and expenditures respond more to variations of GDP and are determined less by their own past values. The main result is that fiscal policy variables are positively influenced by GDP variations (significant responsiveness) and negatively influenced by their own past values (significant, but negative persistence, indicating a stable behaviour of the variables), which means that Romania has a sustainable fiscal position.","[Leonte, Alexandru] Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,alexandruleonte@yahoo.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9083-4,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,10.0,,,,,,246,249,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZY02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303284800046,0

The result is that few Internet surveys and experiments are able to exploit the unique capabilities of the web. This paper suggests a new approach, illustrated with a working prototype: an open-source, domain-specific language (DSL) designed for specifying web surveys and experiments, which is called websperiment. The paper first looks at the existing approaches, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. It then outlines the concepts underlying websperiment, and this DSL's nature and scope, with simple code examples.

Starting from the puzzling observation that the Nepalese conflict escalated after a period of substantial growth and poverty reduction, it hypothesizes that increasing differences in welfare between groups can help explain recruitment by the Maoists. The hypothesis is tested with data from two national-representative household surveys, matched with district-level information regarding mass abductions by the Maoists from newspaper articles. The identification strategy relies on the fact that the months following finalization of the second round of data collection were characterized by a geographical escalation of the conflict. The paper first shows that gains from growth between 1995 and 2003 were much smaller for the (near) landless than for the landed; it then shows that recruiting through abduction of young people was more intensive in districts where inequality between the landed and the landless had previously increased.","SAIS Johns Hopkins Univ, Washington, DC 20036 USA",,"Macours, K (通讯作者)，SAIS Johns Hopkins Univ, 1717 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",kmacours@jhu.edu,,,,,,,45,41,51,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Most of the financial systems of public higher education are fully or partially dependent on the state budget. Therefore future perspective of many of them is to find additional private sources for their budget One strong argument to implement tuition fee is high rate of return to education (proved e.g. by Psacharopoulos and Patrinos). The paper introduces situation in financing of higher education in selected European countries - Czech Republic and England. There are described mechanisms of financing of higher education in the Czech Republic including data about actual perspectives of an expected reform based on the White Book.

The firing pattern of neurons within this system appears to 'mirror' an action performed and seen, coding a functional correspondence between a motor action and sensory perception of that action. Indirect evidence acquired through various neuroimaging techniques supports the presence of such a neural system, termed the mirror neuron system (MNS) in the human brain. In this paper I discuss evidence suggesting that the human MNS - by linking intention and outcome, perception and action, observer and actor - forms part of the neural system for empathic concern, the capacity to understand and feel another's emotional state. By helping to establish a 'likeness' between interacting agents, the human MNS may support the active desire to understand others, to feel what they are feeling and to help alleviate another's suffering. By providing a biological substrate for such fundamental affiliative behaviors, the MNS may provide a neural scaffold for the evolution of our sophisticated sociality and the morality that governs it.

This indicates that the qualities of exports from the observed transitional economies have not rapidly improved, and the export structure remains relatively unfavourable, particularly when compared to advanced transitional countries. The most important factors in the success of advanced transitional economies were: the inflow of foreign direct investment, imports of modern technology (and later, their own development), innovation, development of small and medium sized enterprises, foreign competition, the development of a market economy and macroeconomic stability. The export structures of Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia correlate with improvement in the process of transition in the observed countries. In 2009 Bosnia had the absolute lowest level of similarity coefficient among the studied countries, followed by Serbia, Romania and Croatia, which corresponds to the overall economic performance and foreign trade of the observed economies.","European Studies Inst, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Nikolic, G (通讯作者)，European Studies Inst, Belgrade, Serbia.",goranvnikolic@gmail.com,"nikolic, goran/ABI-6361-2020","nikolic, goran/0000-0001-9312-2194",,,,,13,3,3,0,8,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,3,,,,,393,406,,10.2298/PAN1103393N,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,834YP,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000296000700007,0

We find out that exchange rate changes have diverse effects on the two sectors. Specifically, domestic private firms absorb exchange rate changes in their profit margins while foreign-owned firms are resistant against exchange rate changes. We ascribe the resistance of foreign-owned firms to transfer pricing strategies of multinationals. One determinant of a multinational company price strategy is different taxation in countries of its operation. That is the reason for concentration of gross profits in low taxed countries by manipulating intrafirm prices. As a result these optimization strategies have adverse effects on a macroeconomic level causing ineffectiveness of the exchange rate adjustment mechanism and distortions in both foreign trade and GDP statistics.","Czech Natl Bank, External Econ Relat Div, Prague 11503 1, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank,"Novotny, F (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, External Econ Relat Div, Na Prikope 28, Prague 11503 1, Czech Republic.",filip.novotny@cnb.cz,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,8,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

We show that an outside lender offering constant-consumption contracts can earn a higher profit if he conditions his repeated interactions with each borrower on the history of his interactions with all the group members (a joint liability contract), rather than on his history with that borrower only (individual liability contracts). This result holds even in the absence of informational asymmetries. The observation driving it is that with individual liability contracts, a joint welfare-maximizing group may prefer to have one or more group members default on their contracts, so that the group can consume a mix of outside funds and the defaulters' stochastic income. One contribution of our work is to give precise economic content to the concept of social collateral as the per-agent surplus from group risk-sharing over autarky. The group can deter its members from defaulting on their contracts with the principal by threatening to reduce that surplus. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It also reports the most visible E.U. banks' M&As and government interventions that resulted from the 2007-2009 financial crisis, make a preliminary evaluation of the outcomes, and suggests possible future trends for the banking industry in the region.","EGADE Business Sch ITESM, Monterrey, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Salgado, RJS (通讯作者)，EGADE Business Sch ITESM, Campus Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico.",roberto.santillan@itesm.mx,"Santillan, Roberto/Q-3287-2019; Salgado, Roberto/AAG-6677-2020","Santillan, Roberto/0000-0001-5162-1403;",,,,,30,2,3,0,15,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,2,,,,,245,266,,10.2298/PAN1102245S,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,818JW,,gold,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294749000006,0

In particular, do rent controls increase the presence of poor and minority residents in a locale? Theoretically, the effect of rent control on community composition is ambiguous, as it depends upon several factors including willingness to occupy controlled apartments, landlord imposed rationing mechanisms, and spillover effects of rent controlled housing on uncontrolled units. Using census data on how Cambridge, Massachusetts and nearby communities responded to the state imposed end of rent control, I find evidence that rent control increased the presence of minority residents but also decreased the proportion of poor residents. This evidence is robust to alternate control areas and several specification checks. I also find that despite its positive impact on minority membership, rent control is associated with an increase in traditional measures of residential segregation.","Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University,"Sims, DP (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",davesims@byu.edu,,,,,,,31,14,16,2,18,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This aversion has resulted in a greater interest in products which guarantee a return on investment. In trying to attract investors again, the issuers offer many so-called structured products. For conservative investors, it is especially suitable to invest in products which guarantee a return on investment and, at the same time - provided that other conditions are met - they offer a so-called bonus, the amount of which varies with products. Although with most such products there is a so-called maximum bonus defined, it is often an interesting yield, especially when compared to very low interest rates on deposits. It is an interesting direction for scientific research to find out how parameters of such a structured product are set, i.e. how the issuer can ensure without a risk the resources needed for the realisation of the given structured product payment profile. The aim of this paper is to analyze some of the existing structured products and to prove that their creation is possible by utilizing option strategies known as the Long and Short Combo. The paper builds on the papers [7] and [10], which have analyzed the Long and Short Combo Strategies with regard to their utilization in trading or hedging. The source of inspiration for this new application of the mentioned option strategies was the paper [9] which deals with the principle of the so-called Speed Certificates creation, which can also be classified as structured products, although they are without an investment guarantee. There are two main outcomes of the article. The first one is the proof that the Bonus Deposit VI structured product offered in Slovakia has the same profit profile as an alternative investment consisting of the purchase of an underlying asset and the creation of the Long Combo option strategy. The other one is the proof that the Currency Deposit EUR/PLN structured product has the same profit profile as an alternative investment consisting of the exchange of EUR for PLN and the creation of the Short Combo option strategy.","[Soltes, Vincent] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,,vincent.soltes@tuke.sk,"Šoltés, Vincent/AAA-2329-2020",,,,,,11,12,12,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,481,487,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200052,0

With firm-specific productive heterogeneity, weaker firms quit when faced with a negative aggregate shock. Consequently, trade does not always increase firm-level aggregate productivity as negative shocks on the home market can be compensated for by positive shocks elsewhere. Weaker firms, which would otherwise quit in autarky, can continue to operate by exporting. Despite this, trade can still improve welfare for the risk-averse consumer by reducing aggregate price fluctuations.","[Thia, Jang Ping] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Thia, Jang Ping] Ctr Econ Performance Globalisat, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Thia, JP (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England.",thia3003@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In order to avoid repetition of scientific material, we will leave out here the broad description of theoretical aspects of motivation for participation in CSOs, which have been studied extensively in publications by Tijunaitiene (2009a); Tijunaitiene, Balciunas (2010); Tijunaitiene et al. (2009 a, b). This article deals with citizens' intentions to participate in CSOs in the context of individualistic and collectivistic incentives. The article consists of three parts. First, with reference to a part of results of research carried out in 2007 here are analyzed links between individualistic motives for participation and citizens' intentions to participate in future. It is proposed in the article that for most of the research participants the most important individualistic incentives are internal incentives, i.e., greater self-realization, pleasure, valuable experience of learning, and greater self-confidence. This is grounded on the fact that in the research on values self-confidence is highly appreciated, and people's self-realization very often is related to public and social activities. For those who intend to more actively participate in CSOs in future it is very important to feel that they can control their life. Nevertheless, for citizens their personal interests are often above public interests. The second part describes the analyzed links between collectivistic incentives and intentions to participate in CSOs by comparing two dimensions (joint activities and organizational activity competence), i.e., various statements that encompass factors and actual statistics of participation. There is made a statement that the dimension of joint activities is strongly expressed for those who intend to decrease or increase the intensity of participation, and also for those who intend to retain the same level of intensity. It follows that the stable albeit relatively low level of participation in CSOs (e.g., involvement in activities of labour unions or political parties) testifies that their permanent members are united by the aim to influence social and political processes. In addition, averagely expressed dimension of organizational activity competence lets us state that by participating in activities of CSOs citizens do not commit themselves to follow the public good in their activities, they rather associate their participation with leisure time, feeling well within the CSO or are influenced to participate by others. Nevertheless most of the CSO members intended to retain the same level of intensity of participation. The third part reveals the changes in participation in CSOs with reference to available statistical information as well as researches by other authors, it is summed up that currently the most active participation is in activities of local communities, because the interest is in issues of the nearest environment. Potential level of citizens' participation in CSOs is rather high, because it is social activities that are related to opportunities of self-realization.","[Tijunaitiene, Rigita; Bersenaite, Jurgita] Siauliai Univ, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai University,"Tijunaitiene, R (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Architektu Str 1, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",rigita@smf.su.lt; jurgitabersenaite@gmail.com,,"Bersenaite, Jurgita/0000-0002-9891-6767",,,,,54,1,1,0,5,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We reveal that both firm specific and common factors have an impact on CEE corporations; nevertheless, compared to similar papers, the degree of heterogeneity is lower, confirming the theories of CEE inter-country high correlation. In comparison with similar previous approaches, our research develops a more extended perspective on CEE corporate finance peculiarities. We emphasize the interactions across a wider range of financial indicators relating to profitability, asset management and capital structure ratios in the light of the country and firm-level characteristics.

The study reveals that the relationships among CEE stock markets are time varying. While before the crisis stock market linkages are limited, we find that during crisis these interactions become significantly stronger. Our results further suggest that the potential for diversifying risk by investing in different CEE markets is limited during financial turmoil. Other findings reveal the leading role of the Russian market in the CEE region before the crisis. Also, before the crisis CEE markets were significantly influenced by innovations in the USA market, thus explaining why they were affected heavily by the crisis, which has managed to spread immediately in the region.","Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Tudor, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cristianat@gmail.com,"Tudor, Cristiana/AGZ-0508-2022; tudor, cristiana/A-2705-2010","Tudor, Cristiana/0000-0001-6108-1666; tudor, cristiana/0000-0001-6108-1666",,,,,40,21,22,0,17,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,4,,,,,525,543,,10.2298/PAN1104525T,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,867MC,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298457500006,0

The OECD approach is used in the paper, 2003 and 2008 data were used. The practical part is focused on the analysis of the relationship of the labour market regulation and unemployment and testing of the dependence of these two variables. A nonparametric (distribution-free) rank statistic (the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient) was applied. Test was performed on the data of the Czech Republic and other countries of the European Union based on of the mathematical and statistical program. The least regulated labour markets can be found in Ireland and United Kingdom. On the contrary, the most regulated labour markets can be found in Portugal, France, Germany and Spain. The values of the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient suggested weak, positive relationship between EPL and the unemployment rate, respectively very weak, negative relationship between EPL and the employment rate.

This view is still controversial as philosophers debate the extent of human morality. One type of moral behavior, assisting a stranger, has been shown by economists to be quite common in the laboratory and outside it. This paper presents the Empathy-Generosity-Punishment model that reveals the criticality of moral sentiments in producing prosocial behaviors. The model's predictions are tested causally in three neuroeconomics experiments that directly intervene in the human brain to turn up and turn down moral sentiments. This approach provides direct evidence on the brain mechanisms that produce prosociality using a brain circuit called HOME (human oxytocin-mediated empathy). By characterizing the HOME circuit, I identify situations in which moral sentiments will be engaged or disengaged. Using this information, applications to health and welfare policies, organizational and institutional design, economic development, and happiness are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, some of the factors leading to the expansion of the objectives and ambitions of the care system, such as the ageing of the population, pose significant challenges to its long-term financial sustainability. In this context, the paper first reviews the main factors likely to contribute to the growth in LTC demand and expenditure, and reflects on the policy priorities associated with state-backed funding systems in the area. Using results from a bespoke dynamic micro-simulation model, it then illustrates the discussion through a quantitative analysis of the equity and efficiency implications of alternative funding models discussed in the context of the ongoing reforms of the LTC system in England.","[Fernandez, Jose-Luis; Forder, Julien] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Forder, Julien] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Kent,"Fernández, JL (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.",j.fernandez@lse.ac.uk; j.forder@lse.ac.uk,"Fernandez, Jose-Luis/D-2451-2010","Fernandez, Jose-Luis/0000-0002-4190-7341",,,,,61,12,13,0,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Despite these efforts, the country's economic growth has been lackluster, trailing that of many other developing nations. In this paper, I review arguments for why Mexico hasn't sustained higher rates of economic growth. The most prominent suggest that some combination of poorly functioning credit markets, distortions in the supply of nontraded inputs, and perverse incentives for informality creates a drag on productivity growth. These are factors internal to Mexico. One possible external factor is that the country has the bad luck of exporting goods that China sells, rather than goods that China buys.

China is expected to become number one sometime in the mid-2020s, unless its growth rate of gross domestic product per worker declines dramatically, a la the lost decade of Japan. Next, the paper examines whether China becoming the number one economy will mean its currency, the renminbi (RMB), will become the international key currency. According to the basket currency regressions during the period that Chinese currency was gradually appreciating against the US dollar from July 2005 to August 2008, it is shown that the RMB has already acquired a strong influence on the Asian currencies. This shows that the RMB is fast gaining the status of a regional anchor currency for a possible regional joint float. As the Chinese government proceeds with internationalization of its currency, the RMB is expected to gain in the ranking of other aspects of international currency, such as the store of value and the medium of exchange.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Ito, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",itointokyo@aol.com,,,,,,,20,26,28,6,70,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1832-8105,,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

Intertemporal consumption and saving behavior strongly affect the relation between redistributive taxation and charitable contribution. Indeed, the analyses presented herein reveal that more patience (i.e. higher saving) engenders a lower redistributional tax rate. However, the optimal redistributive tax rate is not zero because redistributive taxation improves the efficiency of providing public goods that are not improved by balanced growth.

Moreover, this test suggests that economic growth has a significant positive long-run impact on energy consumption in these countries before 1988 and this effect becomes negative after 1988 in Ghana and South Africa.

Keynes was nevertheless hesitant about the practical relevance of weight in the process of rational decision making because of the 'stopping problem' of finding a rational principle to decide where to stop the process of acquiring information in forming a probability judgment before making a decision. This paper discusses the relevance of the stopping problem by way of an inquiry into the nature, properties and implications for rational decision making of Keynes's conception of evidential weight. It is argued that in practical choice situations the decision maker often decides where to stop the process of acquiring information by following Keynes's advice to consider the degree of completeness of the available information before making a decision. This method implies that the decision maker is able to arrive at an assessment of the dimension of what may be called her 'relevant ignorance'. By considering some examples of how the acquisition of new evidence may affect the decision maker's behaviour, it is argued that it is in fact possible to talk reasonably about relevant ignorance, or what are sometimes called 'unknown unknowns', and that this concept might explain a range of human behaviours. While this concept does not provide a rational principle to solve the stopping problem, it does provide a method of inquiry for dealing with a number of paradoxes not solvable within the Bayesian approach.

However, little is known about the effectiveness of policies targeting coca cultivation. This paper uses a survey-based experiment to evaluate the effects of the two main policies: eradication and alternative development programs. Our results support Becker's (1968) model of crime participation and in addition shed light on other non-monetary factors that affect the coca cultivation decision: religion, legitimacy, remoteness, and poverty are found to be important. We find that coca cultivation is inelastic to increases in perceived risk and relative profit so eradication and alternative development would have a rather small effect on coca cultivation.

The labor market is dual featuring low-skilled and high-skilled workers and simple and complex jobs. Simple jobs pay a minimum wage, while wages in the complex jobs are determined by Nash bargaining. Opportunities for low-skilled workers are limited to simple jobs; while high-skilled unemployed can apply for both types of jobs, and thereby can accept to be downgraded. We analyze the outcomes of simple job subsidy policies assuming that government budget is balanced through taxes on occupied workers. We first give conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a steady-state equilibrium and we then analyze the effects of different fiscal instruments. We show that in this set-up, increasing simple job subsidies does not necessarily reduce low-skilled unemployment or unemployment spells. By introducing heterogeneous skills and possible downgrading of the high-skilled workers, we show that the effectiveness of such policies in reducing the classical unemployment is decreasing. In fact, any additional classical unemployed re-entering the job market is accompanied by an increasing number of high-skilled workers downgrading to low-skilled jobs. We calibrate the model on French labor market data. It is found that for five low-skilled workers leaving classical unemployment, two high-skilled workers are downgraded. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis helps clarify the roles of two forms of regularity assumptions (buyer-regularity and seller-regularity) in ranking revenues and illustrates how revenue ranking is linked to submodularity and supermodularity of the common-value function and to a single-crossing property of a function derived from the monopoly or monopsony pricing function in the resale stage.","[Cheng, Harrison H.; Tan, Guofu] Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Cheng, HH (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, 3620 S Vermont Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",hacheng@usc.edu; guofutan@usc.edu,,,,,,,24,24,27,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In addition, the impact of arm's-length offshoring is negative for nonmultinationals and nonexporters but nonnegative for multinationals and exporters.

This paper experimentally analyzes selfish preferences of the entrepreneurially talented. We find that making a distinction between creative talent and business talent explains systematic differences in selfish behavior. Generally, both the less business-talented and the more creative are more willing to forego private payoffs to avoid losses to others. A moderator analysis reveals that less creative individuals with business talent are significantly more selfish than all others, including the creative with business talent. This finding applies to both certain and risky payoffs with and without negative externalities. The paper makes a contribution to entrepreneurship research by qualifying the implications of talent allocation models and highlighting the importance of distinguishing between the two types of entrepreneurial talent. We also add to the field of experimental economics by advancing research on altruism under risk and with negative externalities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the case of crude oil markets, statistical support is claimed for weak efficiency over a wide range of time-scales. However, the results are still controversial since theoretical arguments point to deviations from efficiency as prices tend to revert towards an equilibrium path. This paper studies the efficiency of crude oil markets by using lagged detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to detect delay effects in price autocorrelations quantified in terms of a multiscaling Hurst exponent (i.e., autocorrelations are dependent of the time scale). Results based on spot price data for the period 1986-2009 indicate important deviations from efficiency associated to lagged autocorrelations, so imposing the random walk for crude oil prices has pronounced costs for forecasting. Evidences in favor of price reversion to a continuously evolving mean underscores the importance of adequately incorporating delay effects and multiscaling behavior in the modeling of crude oil price dynamics.

Under dynamic efficiency, the global welfare loss of policy implementation in a net foreign creditor country is lower than of a policy in the net foreign debtor country.

Through an empirical analysis of customers of a logistics service provider in Israel, it is argued that service providers can intelligibly influence customers' impression and the emotional experience they get through the service provision interaction. Moreover, if this impression is positive, customers perceive an incremental value in the service interaction and tend to develop a long-lasting commitment to the organisation which can develop into loyalty. In general, this rationale is validated by the research. In addition, it was discovered that price is not the main element of customer loyalty; even its role is found to be less dominant than the role of emotion.

After doing so for 30 years since and advising the government of Taiwan in the 1960s and the 1970s and the government of the People's Republic of China in the 1980s and the 1990s, this is an opportune moment for me to summarize the important lessons I have learned. The lessons will be summarized in four parts: on economic science, on formulating economic policy and providing economic advice, on the special characteristics of the Chinese economy and on the experience of China's economic reform. At the beginning, I should comment on the quality of Chinese official data on which almost all quantitative studies referred to in this article were based. Chow (2006) has presented the view that by and large the official data are useful and fairly accurate. The main justification is that every time I tested an economic hypothesis or estimated an economic relation using the official data the result confirmed the well-established economic theory. It would be a miracle if I had the power to make the Chinese official statisticians fabricate data to support my hypotheses. Even if I had had the power, most of the data had already been published for years before I conceived the ideas of the studies reported in this article.","Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Chow, GC (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,9,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Contrary to the theoretical predictions, contributions are significantly higher in the lottery than in the all-pay auction, both overall and by individual income types.","[Corazzini, Luca] Univ Padua, I-35100 Padua, Italy; Bocconi Univ, Mainz, Germany; Univ St Andrews, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland; Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy",University of Padua; University of St Andrews; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Corazzini, L (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",,,"FARAVELLI, Marco/0000-0001-9646-9126",,,,,18,42,48,1,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

Using agents' minimum foresight concerning possible future payoffs, Maskin and Tirole (Rev Econ Stud 66: 83-114, 1999) show that indescribability does not matter for contractual incompleteness as long as there is symmetric information at both the contracting stage and the trading stage. This is called the irrelevance theorem. The following generalization of the irrelevance theorem is shown here: indescribability does not matter even in the presence of asymmetric information at the trading stage, as long as there is symmetric information at the contracting stage. This is an important clarification because Kunimoto (Econ Lett 99:367-370, 2008) shows that indescribability can matter if there is asymmetric information at both stages. It is thus argued that asymmetric information at the contracting stage is necessary for indescribability to be important in the rational agents contracting model.","[Kunimoto, Takashi] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Kunimoto, Takashi] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; Universite de Montreal,"Kunimoto, T (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, 855 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",takashi.kunimoto@mcgill.ca,"KUNIMOTO, Takashi/H-4964-2016",,,,,,11,2,4,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

We consider a simple dynamic general equilibrium model in which agents vote over the desired inflation rate in each period, and inequality is persistent. Inflation in our model is a mechanism of redistribution, and we find that the link between inequality and inflation within any period or over time depends on institutional and preference related parameters. Furthermore, we find that differences in the initial distributions of wealth can yield a diverse set of patterns for the evolution of the inflation and inequality link. Relative to existing literature, our model leads to more precise predictions about the inflation-inequality correlation. To that end, results in the extant empirical literature on the inflation and inequality link need to be interpreted with caution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides a guide to the current state of knowledge on British macroeconomic policy between 1929 and the eve of the Second World War for today's economists and policy-makers. Mindful that some will seek 'lessons' from this earlier age, it makes clear the very particular economic and policy context of the time, including the marked difference between British and American economic performance and policies and the challenge posed by the massive rise in debt brought about by the First World War. Knowledge transfer is possible here for policy learning, but what transpires is that lessons are typically stronger as negatives than as positives: namely what should not be done in general, as against what might be done, this largely situation specific. The focus is the role and effectiveness of the monetary and fiscal policies pursued together with an assessment of the principal policy not adopted, namely the Keynesian solution of significant loan-financed public works to remedy mass unemployment. The analysis is comparative with respect to US macroeconomic economic performance and policy; it explores the different macroeconomic shocks of the 'contraction' phase (the term 'Great Depression' is not really appropriate to the British experience) in the two countries; comparative policy regimes; and then, in turn, analyses the policy mix and policy effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy, including for Britain the counterfactual Keynesian solution. A business-cycle periodization is adopted, with the key role for the abandonment of the gold standard in terms of regaining freedom of choice in macroeconomic policy, itself experiencing significant developments after 1931. The traditional role of the cheap-money-induced housing boom in Britain's post-1932 economic recovery is reaffirmed; the impact of the fiscal policies actually pursued are then discussed, as are assessments of the likely effectiveness of the Keynesian solution had the 1929 Liberal Party's 'We can conquer unemployment' spending package been implemented.","Univ Bristol, Sch Humanities, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Middleton, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Humanities, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England.",roger.middleton@bristol.ac.uk,,,,,,,69,20,20,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Results show a modification of the wage distribution over the period under analysis, which basically affects the low and medium wage levels. The detailed analysis of the wage distributions for workers with permanent and fixed-term contracts reveals that the latter were the ones responsible for the wage increases, while the change in the shape of the distribution at intermediate wage levels was caused by the modification of the shape of the distribution of permanent workers. By applying a semi-parametric technique that allows us to consider effects on the entire wage distribution, we conclude that the changes observed in the distributions of 1995 and 2002 were caused by modifications in the wage structure that exert a different effect depending on the type of contract: homogeneous wage improvements for fixed-term workers and decreases at intermediate wage levels for permanent workers.","[Motellon, Elisabet; Lopez-Bazo, Enrique] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [El-Attar, Mayssun] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Motellon, Elisabet] Univ Alcala de Henares, Dep Fundamentos Econ & Hist Econ, Alcala De Henares 99775, Spain",University of Barcelona; European University Institute; Universidad de Alcala,"Motellón, E (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,"Lopez-Bazo, Enrique/AAY-3187-2020; Motellón, Elisabet/L-2352-2014; Lopez-Bazo, Enrique/L-1176-2014","Lopez-Bazo, Enrique/0000-0002-4654-8237;",,,,,28,4,4,0,4,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

The first studies which analysed news effects on exchange rates were established in the early 1990s (see, for example, Dornbusch). Almost at the same time Meese and Rogoff published their influential paper, revealing the forecasting inferiority in exchange rates of structural models against the random walk. This finding has shocked the pillars of exchange rate economics and thus cast general suspicion on research focusing on fundamentals in this field. The eventual rising popularity of event studies can partly be attributed to the re-establishment of the raison d'etre of exchange rate economics. This work focuses on systematically surveying this literature with particular respect to its primary goal, i.e. shedding light on the analytical value of fundamental research. Thus, its major findings are, first, fundamental news does matter, whereas non-fundamental news matters to a lesser degree. Second, news influences exchange rates via two separated channels, i.e. incorporating common information into prices directly or indirectly based upon order flow. Third, with a few exceptions the impact of fundamental news on exchange rates is fairly stable over time.","Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Rebitzky, RR (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany.",,,,,,,,84,3,5,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

It seems sensible to require that measures of mispricing should (i) relate the fundamental value and price, (ii) be monotone in the difference between fundamental value and price, and (iii) be independent of the total number of periods and the absolute level of fundamental value. We show that none of the measures currently used fulfills all these criteria. To facilitate comparability across different experimental settings with different parameterizations we propose two alternative measures which fulfill all evaluation criteria. The measure for mispricing, RAD (relative absolute deviation), is calculated by averaging absolute differences between the (volume-weighted) mean price and the fundamental value across all periods and normalizing it with the absolute value of the average FV of the market. The measure for overvaluation, RD (relative deviation), is calculated analogously, but uses raw difference between (volume-weighted) mean prices and fundamental values. Hence, it provides information on whether the mispricing stems from over- or undervaluation of the asset.","[Stoeckl, Thomas; Huber, Juergen; Kirchler, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Sch Management, Dept Banking & Finance, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Kirchler, Michael] Univ Gothenburg, Ctr Finance, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Innsbruck; University of Gothenburg,"Stöckl, T (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Sch Management, Dept Banking & Finance, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",thomas.stoeckl@uibk.ac.at; juergen.huber@uibk.ac.at; michael.kirchler@uibk.ac.at,,"Huber, Juergen/0000-0003-0073-0321",,,,,26,124,130,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

However, there has been a lack of similar empirical study on China and other developing countries. This paper attempts to fill this gap by answering how and to what extent oil-price shocks impact China's economy, emphasizing on the price transmission mechanisms. To that end, we develop a structural vector auto-regressive model. Our results show that an oil-price increase negatively affects output and investment, but positively affects inflation rate and interest rate. However, with price control policies in China, the impact on real economy, represented by real output and real investment, lasts much longer than that to price/monetary variables. Our decomposition results also show that the short-term impact, namely output decrease induced by the cut in capacity-utilization rate, is greater in the first 6 periods (namely half a year), but the portion of the long-term impact, defined as the impact realized through an investment change, increases steadily and exceeds that of short-term impact in the 7th period. Afterwards, the long-term impact dominates, and maintains for quite some time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Neither standard macroeconomic models that abstract from financial intermediation nor traditional models of the bank lending channel are adequate as a basis for understanding the recent crisis. Instead we need models in which intermediation plays a crucial role, but in which intermediation is modeled in a way that better conforms to current institutional realities. In particular, we need models that recognize that a market-based financial system-one in which intermediaries fund themselves by selling securities in competitive markets, rather than collecting deposits subject to reserve requirements-is not the same as a frictionless system. I sketch the basic elements of an approach that allows financial intermediation and credit frictions to be integrated into macroeconomic analysis in a straightforward way.

We find that the nutrition intake and the body mass index have positive effects on income while duration of illness and daily working hours have negative effects. These conclusions imply that the Chinese Government should put more emphasis on improving migrant workers' well-being, including offering educational programs on nutrition and health, and enhancing medical insurance and the old-age insurance system.","[Wang, Zhigang] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Holly] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Zheng, Shi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Song, Shunfeng] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Renmin University of China; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Renmin University of China; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Wang, ZG (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhengshi1974@ruc.edu.cn; ohshigo@yahoo.com.cn; wanghong@purdue.edu; song@unr.edu,"Wang, H.

When trade is liberalized efficient foreign exporters enter and push out the least efficient domestic firms. Fewer firms remain in total. But exporters endogenously offer more variety than domestic firms. The entry of variety-rich foreign firms unambiguously dominates the decrease in the number of firms.

Many countries operate with no enforcement of the obligation to pay, making zakat a form of voluntary redistribution. We analyze how zakat affects capital accumulation in a model that explicitly recognizes the voluntary nature of zakat. The voluntary payment is modeled using both warm glow and social custom frameworks. These are embedded within an overlapping generations model with heterogenous consumers and endogenous population growth. The results show that zakat can raise the capital-labor ratio when it is motivated by the warm glow but welfare can be nonmonotonic in the strength of the warm glow. In the social custom model, reduced participation can lead to a reduced capital-labor ratio as the rate of zakat is increased.","[Ali, D. H. Norulazidah P. H.

We show that the introduction of heterogeneity in the frequency of price change triples the degree of monetary non-neutrality generated by the model. We furthermore show that the introduction of intermediate inputs raises the degree of monetary non-neutrality by another factor of three, without adversely affecting the model's ability to match the large average size of price changes. A single-sector model with a frequency of price change equal to the median, rather than the mean, generates monetary non-neutrality similar to that in our multisector model. Our multisector model with intermediate inputs generates variation in real output in response to calibrated aggregate nominal shocks that can account for roughly 23% of the U.

This paper argues that failing to account for the limited Canadian ancestry of visible minorities overestimates discrimination if immigrant assimilation is an intergenerational process. Using the 2001 and 2006 Canadian Censuses, weekly earnings, conditional on a rich set of worker and job characteristics, are compared with child immigrant, second-, and third-and-higher-generation Canadian men. The results reveal a tendency for earnings to increase across subsequent generations of visible minority, but not white, men. Though the pattern is strongest between the first and second generation, for black men it is also evident between the Canadian born with and without a Canadian-born parent. Despite this progress, for most visible minority groups earnings gaps are identified even among third-and-higher-generation Canadians.","Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Skuterud, M (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",skuterud@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,31,31,36,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The current Scottish guidelines recommend individuals participate in physical activity of moderate vigour for 30 min at least five times per week. For an individual contemplating the recommendation, decisions have to be made in regard of participation, intensity, duration and multiplicity. For the policy maker, understanding the determinants of each decision will assist in designing an intervention to effect the recommended policy. With secondary data sourced from the 2003 Scottish Health Survey (SHeS) we statistically model the combined decisions process, employing a copula approach to model specification. In taking this approach the model flexibly accounts for any statistical associations that may exist between the component decisions. Thus, we model the endogenous relationship between the decision of individuals to participate in sporting activities and, amongst those who participate, the duration of time spent undertaking their chosen activities. The main focus is to establish whether dependence exists between the two random variables assuming the vigour with which sporting activity is performed to be independent of the participation and duration decision. We allow for a variety of controls including demographic factors such as age and gender, economic factors such as income and educational attainment, lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, healthy eating and medical history. We use the model to compare the effect of interventions designed to increase the vigour with which individuals undertake their sport, relating it to obesity as a health outcome.

It employs a Bayesian structural VAR model that requires imposing only a minimum of economically meaningful sign restrictions. We find that equity market shocks and housing price shocks have been major determinants of the US current account in the past, accounting for up to 30% of the movements of the US trade balance at a horizon of 20 quarters. By contrast, shocks to the real exchange rate have been less relevant, explaining about 9% and exerting a more temporary effect on the US trade balance. Our findings suggest that large exchange rate movements may not necessarily be the key element of an adjustment of today's large current account imbalances, and that in particular relative global asset price changes could be a potent source of adjustment.

Whilst the British government has often espoused the virtues of technological neutrality. UK policies now seek to promote nuclear power, coal with CO2 capture and storage, and renewable energy. Policy decisions are often informed by estimates of cost per unit of output (for example, pound/MWh), also known as levelised costs. Estimates of these costs for different technologies are often used to provide a 'ballpark' guide to the levels of financial support needed (if any) to encourage uptake, or direct investment away from the technologies the market might otherwise have chosen. Levelised cost estimates can also help to indicate the cost of meeting public policy objectives, and whether there is a rationale for intervention (for example, based on net welfare gains). In the UK electricity sector, investment is undertaken by private companies, not governments. Investment is driven by expected returns, in the light of a range of risks related to both costs and revenues. Revenue risks are not captured in estimates of cost or cost-related risks. An important category of revenue risk is associated with electricity price fluctuations. Exposure to price risks differs by technology. Low electricity prices represent a revenue risk to technologies that cannot influence electricity prices. By contrast, 'price makers' that set marginal prices are, to an extent, able to pass fuel price increases through to consumers. They have an inherent 'hedge' against fuel and electricity price fluctuations. Based on recent research by the UK Energy Research Centre, this paper considers the implications of such price risks for policy design. The authors contrast the range of levelised costs estimated for different generating options with the spread of returns each is exposed to when electricity price fluctuations are factored in. Drawing on recent policy experiences in the renewable energy arena, in the UK and elsewhere, the authors provide an assessment of investment risk in policy effectiveness and consider how policy design can increase or ameliorate price risk. They discuss the circumstances under which policy goals might be best served by 'socialising' price risk, through fixed price policies. The importance of increased and explicit attention to revenue risk in policymaking is discussed, along with the means by which this might be achieved. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To answer this question, we employed an empirical framework of the cointegrated vector autoregressive model.

To achieve this, we estimate the model's posterior density using Bayesian methods. Within this framework we first extend Ireland (2001b, 2004a) hybrid estimation approach to allow for a vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) process to describe the movements and co-movements of the model's errors not explained by the basic RBC model. Our main findings for the model with neutral technical change are: (i) the VARMA specification of the errors significantly improves the hybrid model's fit to the historical data relative to the VAR and AR alternatives; and (ii) despite setting the RBC model a more difficult task under the VARMA specification, neutral technology shocks are still capable of explaining a significant share of the observed variation in output and its components over shorter- and longer-forecast horizons as well as hours at shorter horizons. When the hybrid model is extended to incorporate investment shocks, we find that: (iii) the VAR specification is preferred to the alternatives; and (iv) the model's ability to explain fluctuations improves considerably.

This perspective leads to different models of 'rational conflicts' i.e. a threat of conflict without any real clash. An alternative approach is developed by different models inspired by the Public Choice School, which build upon the logic of coercive power within the framework of a self-interested behaviour. The integration of 'social conflicts' in a narrowly defined individual cost/benefit theoretical framework has resulted in reducing 'social conflict' to real private (but not social) conflict. In other words, economic theory has considered social protesters either as potential or actual looters but rarely as a group of people struggling for a common cause. Integration of social conflict into economic theory will require: (i) abandoning the ubiquitous market model when describing conflictual relationships; (ii) accepting the logic of force or coercive power as a starting point; and (iii) expanding the idea of interest to include encompassing (including class) interest.","Univ Paris 08, F-93526 St Denis 02, Vincennes, France",Universite Paris-VIII,"Vahabi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, F-93526 St Denis 02, Vincennes, France.",mehrdad.vahabi@wanadoo.fr,,,,,,,80,16,19,2,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This paper studies how welfare and investment incentives are affected when an increasing number of derivatives are introduced. It develops an equilibrium model of the electricity market with risk averse firms and a set of traded financial products, more specifically: a forward contract and an increasing number of options. We first show that aggregate welfare (the sum of individual firms' utility) increases with the number of derivatives offered, although most of the benefits are captured with one to three options. Secondly, power plant investments typically increase because additional derivatives enable better hedging of investments. However, the availability of derivatives sometimes leads to 'crowding-out' of physical investments because firms' limited risk-taking capabilities are being used to speculate on financial markets. Finally, we illustrate that players basing their investment decisions on risk-free probabilities inferred from market prices, may significantly overinvest when markets are not sufficiently complete.

This effect is strongest when the neighbor has moderately higher income. In addition a person's lifetime happiness often follows a U shape. Previous models have explained subsets of these phenomena, typically assuming the person has limited ability to assess their own (hedonic) utility. Here I present a model that explains all the phenomena, without such assumptions. In this model greater income of your neighbor is statistical data that, if carefully analyzed, would recommend that you explore for a new income-generating strategy. This explains unhappiness that your neighbor has greater income, as an emotional prod that induces you to explore, in accord with careful statistical analysis. It explains the U shape of happiness similarly. Another benefit of this model is that it makes many falsifiable predictions.

In the second stage, we use indicators of trade, FDI, and tourism, as well as the convergence index, to compute the weights for the composite index. We found that economic convergence in the AP region increased until 1998 but has since fallen back. The integration of trade, investment, and people flows increased between 1990 and 2000, weakened slightly to 2003, and has since picked up again.

In particular, we argue that government policies created some benefit to urban dwellers at the expense of rural areas, lending support to Lipton's urban-bias hypothesis, which states that government, under strong political pressure from the urban population, directs resources from rural to urban areas without consideration of efficiency or equity.","[Fesselmeyer, Eric] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Le, Kien T.] Univ Virginia, Weldon Cooper Ctr Publ Serv, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",National University of Singapore; University of Virginia,"Fesselmeyer, E (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Block AS2,05-02,1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",ecsef@nus.edu.sg; tkl7b@virginia.edu,,,,,,,22,20,22,0,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1351-3958,,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

This paper is the first attempt to analyze the economics of human trafficking and labour migration based on micro data, using unique household surveys from Belarus, Bulgaria, Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine. We find that individual trafficking risks are much higher in regions with large emigration flows. The reasons are lower recruitment costs for traffickers in emigration areas and, to a less extent, more negative self-selection into migration. Our results also indicate that illegal migration increases trafficking risks and that better information, e.g. through awareness campaigns, might be an effective strategy to reduce the crime. These findings may help policymakers to better target anti-trafficking efforts. Journal of Comparative Economics 38 (2) (2010) 173-188.

We re-evaluate their results and find that for most countries the averages of actual postbreak ratios were below the averages of the extrapolated prebreak ratios and that a large share of the breaks coincided with the 1970s oil shocks.

We propose a new approach for estimating marginal returns to medical spending based on variation in medical inputs generated by diagnostic thresholds. Specifically, we combine regression discontinuity estimates that compare health outcomes and medical treatment provision for newborns on either side of the very low birth weight threshold at 1,500 grams. First, using data on the census of U. S. births in available years from 1983 to 2002, we find that newborns with birth weights just below 1,500 grams have lower one-year mortality rates than do newborns with birth weights just above this cutoff, even though mortality risk tends to decrease with birth weight. One-year mortality falls by approximately one percentage point as birth weight crosses 1,500 grams from above, which is large relative to mean infant mortality of 5.5% just above 1,500 grams. Second, using hospital discharge records for births in five states in available years from 1991 to 2006, we find that newborns with birth weights just below 1,500 grams have discontinuously higher charges and frequencies of specific medical inputs. Hospital costs increase by approximately $4,000 as birth weight crosses 1,500 grams from above, relative to mean hospital costs of $40,000 just above 1,500 grams. Under an assumption that observed medical spending fully captures the impact of the very low birth weight designation on mortality, our estimates suggest that the cost of saving a statistical life of a newborn with birth weight near 1,500 grams is on the order of $550,000 in 2006 dollars.","[Almond, Douglas] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Doyle, Joseph J., Jr.; Kowalski, Amanda E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Doyle, Joseph J., Jr.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kowalski, Amanda E.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Williams, Heidi] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Yale University; Harvard University,"Almond, D (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,"Williams, Heidi/0000-0002-0330-7003","NIA NIH HHS [T32 AG000186-21, T32 AG000186-20, P01 AG005842, P01 AG005842-21, T32 AG000186] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,52,119,139,3,59,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We then show that for a game G with discontinuous payoff, some of the most important existence results of Dasgupta and Maskin, Simon, and Reny are based on constructing approximating sequences of games that variationally converge to G. In fact, this notion of convergence will help simplify these results and make their proofs more transparent.

The model predicts an inverse U-shaped relationship between migration duration and the expected rate of return on repatriated savings. A higher rate provides an incentive to go back earlier and consume less abroad, while it can also trigger emigration aimed at generating the savings required for investment after return. The paper illustrates how the behaviour of temporary migrants reflects the interaction between their preferences and the opportunities available in labour and capital markets of both countries.","Grad Inst, Dept Econ, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Djajic, S (通讯作者)，Grad Inst, Dept Econ, Geneva, Switzerland.",slobodandjajic@yahoo.com,,,,,,,33,17,17,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

I show that inflation reduces both quantity and variety under both pricing mechanisms.

We assess hypotheses about the tax savings of endogenous foreign subsidiary ownership relative to domestic firms in a data-set of 507,542 foreign- and domestically-owned manufacturing plants in Europe. We identify a significant profit tax saving of endogenous foreign ownership in high-tax host countries. There is evidence of profit shifting which seems more pronounced than debt shifting in Europe: multinationals earn significantly higher profits than comparable domestic units in low-tax countries but significantly lower ones in high-tax countries. Consequently, profit tax payments of foreign-owned firms are lower than those of domestic firms in high-tax countries but higher in low-tax countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

When assessing the ex post performance of multinationals, selectivity issues must be taken into account. Applying an endogenous treatment model, it turns out that after switching, both productivity and wage growth are higher at newly founded MNEs. While capital intensities increase compared with those of national firms, employment growth rates are negatively related to switching, suggesting that home and foreign employment are substitutes.","[Jaeckle, Robert] TNS Infratest Sozialforsch, D-80687 Munich, Germany",,"Jäckle, R (通讯作者)，TNS Infratest Sozialforsch, Arnulfstr 205, D-80687 Munich, Germany.",robert.jaeckle@tns-infratest.com,,,,,,,26,6,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

The benchmark model assumes uncorrelated shocks across countries and implies that U.S. shocks account for less than 3% of the variability observed in several Canadian series, at all forecast horizons. Accordingly, model-implied cross-correlation functions between Canada and U.S. are essentially zero. Both findings are at odds with the data. A specification that assumes correlated cross-country shocks partially resolves this discrepancy, but still falls well short of matching reduced-form evidence. One central difficulty resides in the model's inability to account for comovement without generating counter factual implications for the real exchange rate, the terms of trade and Canadian inflation.

The country-level analysis in this paper suggests that (i) the link between income and population growth is (almost) everywhere broken and (ii) there is little evidence of declining returns to scale because of constraints imposed by land carrying capacity anywhere.

At aggregated levels of energy consumption empirical findings suggest the presence of a uni-directional causal relationship running from total energy consumption to real GDP. At disaggregated levels empirical evidence suggests that there is a bi-directional causal relationship between industrial and residential energy consumption to real GDP but this is not the case for the transport energy consumption with causal relationship being identified in neither direction. The importance of these findings lies on their policy implications and their adoption on structural policies affecting energy consumption in Greece suggesting that in order to address energy import dependence and environmental concerns without hindering economic growth emphasis should be put on the demand side and energy efficiency improvements.

Accordingly, this paper designs a central bank loss function, which proves consistent with the economic structure. Under the designed central bank loss function discretionary policy proves optimal for social welfare. Optimal discretionary policy emerges because the implied behavioral equation is identical with that under commitment to the social loss function. Consequently, this paper also designs policy rules. To some extent, policy rules appear more basic, flexible, and operational than social and central bank loss functions, but the social loss function serves as an ultimate objective and the central bank loss function explicitly identifies the attainable targets and appropriate weight to achieve the social optimum.

It also appears that training has a stronger effect on the entrepreneurs with less formal education.

The campaigns began because of advances in health technology, which mitigates concerns about reverse causality. Malarious areas saw large drops in the disease thereafter. Relative to non-malarious areas, cohorts born after eradication had higher income as adults than the preceding generation. These cross-cohort changes coincided with childhood exposure to the campaigns rather than to pre-existing trends. Estimates suggest a substantial, though not predominant, role for malaria in explaining cross-region differences in income.

Access to information about job opportunities as well as perceptions about the buoyancy of the labour market depend critically on the social structures and the social networks to which labour market participants belong. In this paper, we examine the impact of information externalities generated through network membership on labour market status. Using Census data from South Africa, a country characterized by high levels of unemployment and worker discouragement, we adopt an econometric approach that aims to minimise the problems of omitted variable bias that have plagued many previous studies of the impact of social networks. Our results suggest that social networks may enhance employment probabilities by an additional 3-12%, and that failure to adequately control for omitted variables would lead to substantial over-estimates of the network co-efficient. In contrast, the impact of social networks on reducing worker discouragement is much smaller, at between 1 and 2%. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Misleading advertising leads to over-consumption but that may be offsetting the underconsumption associated with oligopoly outputs. If all advertising is misinformation then a tax or quantity restriction on advertising maximizes welfare, and other policy interventions are inferior. If firms undertake quality improving investments that are complementary to misinformation, then combining taxes or bans on misleading advertising with other policies can increase welfare.

Several recent papers have argued that the uncertainty about the relative power of the contenders in a war will tend to increase its duration. In these models, uncertainty is directly related to the relative size of the contenders. We argue that the duration of civil wars increases the more polarized a society is. Uncertainty is not necessarily linked to the structure of the population but it could be traced back to the measurement of the size of the different groups in the society. Given a specific level of measurement error or uncertainty, more polarization implies lengthier wars. Our empirical results show that ethnically polarized countries have to endure longer civil wars than ethnically less polarized societies.","[Reynal-Querol, Marta] Univ Pompeu Fabra, ICREA, CEPR, Barcelona, Spain; [Reynal-Querol, Marta] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CESifo, Barcelona, Spain; [Montalvo, Jose G.] IVIE, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; ICREA; Pompeu Fabra University,"Reynal-Querol, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, ICREA, CEPR, Barcelona, Spain.",marta.reynal@upf.edu,"Montalvo, Jose G./D-6731-2013; Reynal-Querol, Marta/L-7038-2014","Montalvo, Jose G./0000-0003-4161-5055; Reynal-Querol, Marta/0000-0002-0293-5446",ICREA Funding Source: Custom,ICREA(ICREA),,,34,48,55,1,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Higher levels of exposure to foreign currency debt and large current account deficits associated with reliance on foreign capital greatly increased the likelihood of experiencing a sudden stop. Trade openness and strong reserve positions had the opposite effect. Sudden stops accompanied by financial crises are associated with drops in output per capita below trend equal to three to four percent. Frictions in the international capital markets of the day are a likely candidate for these output losses. Sudden stops connected with crises do not seem to bring trend growth downwards. Sudden stops not connected with crises appear to be associated with significant declines in trend growth. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Cox, GM; Harvie, C",,,,"Cox, Grant M.; Harvie, Charles",,,Resource price turbulence and macroeconomic adjustment for a resource exporter: A conceptual framework for policy analysis,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Resource price shock; Dynamic macroeconomic model; Simulation analysis; Macroeconomic adjustment; Policy analysis,OIL PRODUCTION; ECONOMY; EXPECTATIONS,"Increased global demand for energy and other resources, particularly from the rapidly developing economies of China and India and the opening up of global resource markets to global investors and speculative activity, has resulted in considerable recent turbulence in resource prices. The recent magnitude of change in resource prices, both positive and negative, and their macroeconomic implications is of considerable contemporary importance to both resource importing and exporting economies. For a resource exporting economy, such as that of Australia, the recent resource price boom has resulted in: increased government taxation revenue, increased employment and wages in the resource and resource related sectors, increased spending in the domestic economy that contributed to buoyant economic growth, increased resource exports to the booming economies of China and India and contributed to a stronger domestic currency with beneficial effects upon inflation. On the other hand these developments have had adverse effects on the non-resource sector by: subjecting it to more intense competition for limited resources, contributing to a loss of international competitiveness and reduced exports arising from a stronger exchange rate, reducing employment in the relatively more labour intensive non-resource sector, and contributing to an eventual slow down in the overall economy. These positive and negative effects, and the overall impact of a resource price boom, require a fundamentally closer analysis of the structure of the economy under scrutiny. In this context the policy response by government is likely to be pivotal in determining the overall macroeconomic outcomes from a resource price boom. The aim of this paper is to develop a generic analytical framework to appraise economic outcomes in the wake of a resource price boom for a resource producing and exporting economy. To this end a dynamic long run macroeconomic model is developed, emphasising the important role and contribution of government fiscal policy in influencing subsequent macroeconomic outcomes. The adjustment process in the model arising from a resource price shock emphasises a spending (or wealth) effect, an income effect, a revenue effect, a current account effect and an exchange rate effect, which facilitate a robust analysis of subsequent macroeconomic outcomes from such a shock as well as related policy responses.

In particular, we focus on strongly mixed equilibria. We provide conditions that are necessary and sufficient for a game to have such an equilibrium.

We have used panel data that is comprised of 4022 firms from 1996 to 2000. We have found that Korean firms have been quick to embrace organizational restructuring to adapt to a new business environment brought about by IT, which seems to be the major source of the success of Korean firms. We have also found that: (i) there is no substantial difference in productivity gains between IT-producing firms and IT-using firms; (ii) productivity growth is more robust to business cycles in an IT-driven economy than in the traditional economy; and (iii) efficiency improvement attributed to organizational transformation plays a greater role in productivity growth as IT applications become more widespread.","[Yuhn, Ky-hyang] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Park, Seung R.] Korea Econ Res Inst, Dept Ind Studies, Seoul, South Korea",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Yuhn, KH (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",yuhn@fau.edu; psr@keri.org,,,,,,,56,6,7,1,18,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1351-3958,,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

This research, however, has been called into question on both modeling grounds for and failing to utilize comprehensive fixed effects. Others have found that when these factors are accounted for, imports rise by significant amounts. This paper seeks to reconcile these findings. I find that the WTO has a larger, though uneven, impact on exports than imports. The results indicate that the WTO frequently causes imports and exports to move in opposite directions negating any increase in overall trade. The regressions with and without fixed country effects generally demonstrate pattern consistency for generalized results that are robust to change. Owing to the finding that imports rise modestly or even fall without country effects while exports rise, the results imply that countries may not be as interested in liberalizing trade as selling to the world.","Peking Univ Campus, HSBC Sch Business, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",HSBC Holdings,"Balding, C (通讯作者)，Peking Univ Campus, HSBC Sch Business, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",cbalding@szpku.edu.cn,,,,,,,27,6,6,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Drawing on a recently collected nationally representative dataset in the US, this paper estimates the causal effect of repeating kindergarten on the retained children's academic performance. Since we observe children being held back only when they enroll in schools that permit kindergarten retention, this paper jointly models the choice of enrolling in a school that allows kindergarten retention, the decision of repeating kindergarten, and children's academic performance in higher grades. A control function approach is developed to estimate the resulting double-hurdle treatment model, which accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in the retention effect. A nearest-neighbor matching estimator is also implemented. Holding children back in kindergarten is found to have positive but diminishing effects on their academic performance up to third grade.

In the context of the new Phillips curve, we show that frictional growth, i.e. the interplay between lags and growth, generates an inflation-unemployment trade-off in the long run. We thus argue that a holistic framework, such as the chain reaction theory (CRT), should be used to jointly explain the evolution of inflation and unemployment.

This paper presents a simple model with limited international risk sharing that can account for the empirical real exchange rate response. When faced with a country-specific rise in government purchases, local households experience a negative wealth effect; they thus work harder, and domestic output increases. Under balanced trade (financial autarky) this supply-side effect is so strong that the terms of trade worsen, and the real exchange rate depreciates. In a bonds-only economy, an increase in government purchases triggers a real exchange rate depreciation, if the rise in government purchases is sufficiently persistent and/or labor supply is highly elastic.","[Kollmann, Robert] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Kollmann, Robert] Univ Paris 12, Dept Econ, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Kollmann, Robert] CEPR, London EC1V ODG, England",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Kollmann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, CP 114,50 Av F Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",robert_kollmann@yahoo.com,,,,,,,36,22,26,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This creation of 'national champions' occurs not only because the government may have a bias against foreign takeover, but also because consumer welfare gains associated with foreign acquisitions decrease with globalization. Endogenizing the government bias through lobbying efforts of the domestic firms, the paper shows that the bias does not need to be very strong before the government promotes domestic champions provided that barriers to trade are low.","Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Duisburg, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Südekum, J (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Duisburg, Germany.",jens.suedekum@uni-due.de,,,,,,,26,4,4,0,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

These discussions took place in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis that is the consequence of the bust of an house price bubble that took place in the US and spread out to most developed countries. Crucial to the success of such policy is the ability of the macro-prudential authority to identify in due time such imbalances, generally featured by asset price boom-bust cycles. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting house price booms according to alternative identification strategies and assess their robustness. In addition, we try to disentangle costless or low-cost from costly house price booms. Resorting both to a non-parametric approach and a discrete-choice (logit) model, we analyze the ability of a set of indicators to robustly explain costly house price booms. According to our results, real long term interest rates, total investment, real credit and real stock prices tend to increase the probability of a costly house price boom.","[Borgy, Vladimir; Clerc, Laurent; Renne, Jean-Paul] Banque France, Direct Gen Etud & Relat Int, F-75049 Paris 01, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,,vladimir.borgy@banque-france.fr; laurent.clerc2@banque-france.fr; jean-paul.renne@banque-france.fr,,"Renne, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-0797-2457",,,,,28,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-15339-6,,,,2010,,,,,,,359,383,,10.1007/978-3-642-15340-2_16,0.0,,,25,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS93,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300025200016,0

An anagram game was employed as the experimental task. Results show that productivity was similar and statistically indistinguishable under the three schemes. In contrast, whether one considers the number of overclaimed words, the number of work/pay periods in which overclaims occur, or the number of participants making an overclaim at least once, target-based compensation produced significantly more cheating than either of the other two systems. While earlier research has compared cheating under target-based compensation with cheating under non-performance-based compensation, which offers no financial incentive to cheat, this is the first study that compares cheating under target-based schemes to cheating under other performance-based schemes. The results suggest that cheating as a response to incentives can be mitigated without giving up performance pay altogether.","[Cadsby, C.

Pay adjustments are decomposed into components arising from three sources: a scheme based on the external labour market comparisons, a scheme derived from the changes in firm and manager characteristics, and transitory pay adjustments. The stochastic frontier model is used to test how these pay components affect firm productivity. Empirical results suggest that the pay adjustments based on the comparison between managers' actual pay and their market-clearing pay are positively related to the output and technical efficiency of the firms, whereas this productivity-boosting effect cannot be seen for other components. This paper shows the importance of the external labour market in connecting managerial pay to firm productivity. and provides a model for the research of managerial pay in an environment where the compensation structure does not have apparent stock incentives.

Using a single-period framework, education expenditure raises the productivity of individuals via a human capital production function. The social welfare function is based on individuals' (indirect) utilities. Education creates a substantial fiscal spillover whereby the increase in human capital gives rise to higher labour earnings and thus higher income tax revenue, thereby allowing greater government expenditure on all items than would otherwise be possible. A higher inequality of exogenous ability levels is found to increase all types of expenditure, but only the transfer increases in relative terms. Higher inequality aversion leads to an increase in transfer payments in absolute and relative terms, at the expense of the other two components. However, there is little sensitivity to inequality aversion. An increase in the elasticity of the wage with respect to basic ability leads to lower education spending.","[Creedy, John; Moslehi, Solmaz] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Creedy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,5,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2010,,194,,,,,41,63,,,,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,791AV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292633100002,0

Such tests answer a specific although quite limited question: can one reject the null hypothesis that one variable does not help predict another? If one can reject, there is said to be Granger causality, GC. Although the limitations of GNC tests are well known, they are often not emphasised in the applied literature and so may be forgotten. This paper considers the econometric and methodological issues involved and illustrates them with data for the US and other countries. There are three main issues. First, the tests may not be informative about the substantive issue, the interaction of military expenditure and the economy, since Granger causality does not correspond to the usual notion of economic causality. To determine the relationship of the two notions of causality requires an identified structural model. Second, the tests are very sensitive to specification. GNC testing is usually done in the context of a vector autoregression, VAR, and the test results are sensitive to the variables and deterministic terms included in the VAR, lag length, sample or observation window used, treatment of integration and cointegration and level of significance. Statistical criteria may not be very informative about these choices. Third, since the parameters are not structural, the test results may not be stable over different time periods or different countries.","[Smith, Ron P.] Univ London, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Dunne, J.

The new strategy provides a practical approach to incorporating long-run structural relationships from economic theory in a structural cointegrating VAR (CVAR) model. The structure of a CVAR model of the macroeconomy accommodates a description of production technology and output determination, arbitrage conditions, long-run solvency requirements and accounting identities and stock-flow relations. This leads to five long-run equations: the relative purchasing power parity (PPP), the interest rate parity (IRP), the output relationship (GR), the real money market equilibrium condition (MD), and the interest rate relationship - Fisher inflation parity (FIP). We apply this modelling strategy to the Czech and Slovak economies. The data are quarterly and run from the first quarter 1995 to the third quarter of 2009. The domestic variables are real money stock, real gross domestic product, the nominal interest rate, the rate of inflation and the ratio of the domestic prices. Further endogenous variables are the nominal exchange rate, the ratio of the foreign price level, foreign real GDP, the foreign interest rate. We are able to identify the long-run structure amongst those variables and to test over-identifying restrictions on the cointegrating vectors. We also investigate the long-run properties of the model and estimate its short-run dynamics. We compare these results for the Czech and Slovak economies.","[Hanclova, Jana] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Math Methods Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic; [Lukacik, Martin; Szomolanyi, Karol] Univ Econ, Fac Econ Informat, Dept Operat Res & Econometr, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",Technical University of Ostrava; University of Economics Bratislava,"Hanclová, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Math Methods Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",jana.hanclova@vsb.cz; lukacik@euba.sk; szomolan@euba.sk,"Lukáčik, Martin/V-8935-2017; Lukáčik, Martin/JBJ-7471-2023; Hanclova, Jana/D-7723-2013; Szomolányi, Karol/AAJ-7458-2020; Hanclova, Jana/AAJ-8363-2020; Szomolányi, Karol/AGR-8260-2022","Lukáčik, Martin/0000-0002-1699-6450; Lukáčik, Martin/0000-0002-1699-6450; Hanclova, Jana/0000-0002-0939-6852; Szomolányi, Karol/0000-0003-3749-7148",Czech Science Foundation [402/08/1015],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This research work was supported by the grant no. 402/08/1015 (Macroeconomic Models of the Czech Economy and Economies of the other EU Countries) of the Czech Science Foundation.,,9,9,9,0,6,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,208,+,,,,,,2,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900036,0

Using a general equilibrium two-country, two-sector (tradable and nontradable) model of the world economy with production I show that low diversification occurs because variations in relative prices (i) increase the riskiness of foreign assets and (ii) facilitate risk-sharing across countries. Large and volatile capital flows are necessary to take advantage of international risk premia differentials that Occur in response to productivity changes in the nontradable sector. I characterize the optimal portfolio holdings, the evolution of the investment opportunity set, the risk premium, and the dynamics of capital flows using a new methodology for solving dynamic general equilibrium models with incomplete markets and portfolio choice.

In FuzzME, a goals tree is the basic structure of evaluation. Within the goals tree, the aggregation of partial fuzzy evaluations is done either by one of fuzzified aggregation operators or by a fuzzy expert system. The choice of the appropriate mode of aggregation depends on the relationships among evaluation criteria.

Thus, it uses univariate and multivariate time series models subject to stochastic shifts to study currency pressures. Results suggest consistency with the reduced-volatility goal. Nonetheless, in line with other studies, factors such as the foreign exchange gap with respect to its trend also induce foreign exchange intervention.","[Humala, Alberto; Rodriguez, Gabriel] Cent Reserve Bank Peru, Res Dept, Lima, Peru; [Rodriguez, Gabriel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Lima, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Rodríguez, G (通讯作者)，Cent Reserve Bank Peru, Res Dept, Lima, Peru.",gabriel.rodriguez@bcrp.gob.pe,"Rodríguez, Gabriel/F-3230-2012","Rodríguez, Gabriel/0000-0003-1174-9642",,,,,20,16,19,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

A theoretical investigation and a simulation of the German case,APPLIED ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOCIAL-SECURITY,"This article investigates the possibilities and restrictions of inter-generational income development for ageing and stagnating economies. In a first step, the basic logic of ageing will be investigated in a simple dynamic model. In particular, the investigation points out the existence of the demographic distribution mass and its meaning for inter-generational income development. It proves that the demographic distribution mass makes it possible for wages and pensions to grow simultaneously in an ageing and stagnating economy. In a second step, the development of wages and pensions is simulated for the German case through to the year 2050. It is demonstrated that (under normal circumstances) it can be expected that the burden from ageing can almost always be over-compensated by the economic growth of the respective year. Against this background, ageing appears to be rather a problem of acceptance and income distribution than that of real income reductions.","Aarhus Sch Business, Ctr Org Renewal & Evolut CORE, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Kesting, P (通讯作者)，Aarhus Sch Business, Ctr Org Renewal & Evolut CORE, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",kesting@microec.hhl.de,,,,,,,30,0,0,2,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In developing and implementing policy and marketing strategies for successful commercialization of a GM product, it is important to assess factors affecting consumers' purchase intention as for GM products. This study assesses consumers in China and Korea regarding their response to credence goods such as food products with GM characteristics. By conceptualizing the main determinants of consumers' choice behaviour for credence goods with structural equation modelling (SEM), the paper provides insights regarding future strategies and recommendation for marketing and policy development of GM products in these countries.

The issue documents, for nine countries, the level and the evolution, over time and over the life cycle, of several dimensions of economic inequality, including wages, labor earnings, income, consumption, and wealth. After describing the motivation and the common methodology underlying this empirical project, we discuss selected results, with an emphasis on cross-country comparisons. Most, but not all, countries experienced substantial increases in wages and earnings inequality, over the last three decades. While the trend in the skill premium differed widely across countries, the experience premium rose and the gender premium fell virtually everywhere. At a higher frequency, earnings inequality appears to be strongly counter-cyclical. In all countries, government redistribution through taxes and transfers reduced the level, the trend and the cyclical fluctuations in income inequality. The rise in income inequality was stronger at the bottom of the distribution. Consumption inequality increased less than disposable income inequality, and tracked the latter much more closely at the top than at the bottom of the distribution. Measuring the age-profile of inequality is challenging because of the interplay of time and cohort effects. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The impact of formality on firm profitability,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Informal sector; Entrepreneurial ability; Tax registration,INFORMAL SECTOR; ECONOMICS,"This paper estimates the impact of registering for taxes on firm profits in Bolivia, the country with the highest levels of informality in Latin America. A new survey of micro and small firms enables us to control for a rich set of measures of owner ability and business motivations that can affect both profits and the decision to formalize. We identify the impact of tax registration on business profitability using the distance of a firm from the tax office where registration occurs, conditional on the distance to the city center, as an instrument for registration. Proximity to the tax office provides firms with more information about registration, but is argued to not directly affect profits. We find tax registration leads to significantly higher profits for the firms that the instrument affects. However, we also find some evidence of heterogeneous effects of tax formality on profits. Tax registration appears to increase profits for the mid-sized firms in our sample, but to lower profits for both the marginal smaller and larger firms, in contrast to the standard view that formality increases profits. We show that owners of large firms who have managed to stay informal are of higher entrepreneurial ability than formal firm owners, in contrast to the standard view (correct among smaller firms) that informal firm owners are low ability.

We find that real M1 and real M2 and their determinants, namely real income and short-term domestic interest rate, are cointegrated, both for individual countries as well as for the panel. Long-run elasticities suggest that consistent with theory, real income positively and nominal interest rate negatively impact real money demand. Our test for panel Granger causality suggests short-run bidirectional causality between M1 and M2 and their determinants.

This motivates us to do this based on time-series analysis, taking Indian textile industry as an example, which is currently at its crucial stage as a critical industry in an emerging economy, with the phasing out of Multi Fibre Arrangement in 2005. This study documents existence of cointegration between capital and output, negative impact of employment shocks on output changes, substitutability between changes in capital and labour, negative effect of shocks to changes in capital stock on productivity and negative effect of employment shocks on future productivity. These results are in line with the general perceptions about this industry and with the standard neoclassical propositions, as explained in this article.","Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Narayanan, BG (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",badrinarayanang@gmail.com,"Narayanan, Badri G/P-6015-2014; Gopalakrishnan, Badri Narayanan/AAQ-3140-2020","Narayanan, Badri G/0000-0001-9628-8173; Gopalakrishnan, Badri Narayanan/0000-0001-9628-8173",,,,,31,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find strong evidence of a regime shift in the volatility of the four markets, and the SWARCH model appears to outperform standard generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) family models. The evidence suggests that, compared with the A-share markets, B-share markets stay in a high-volatility state longer and are more volatile and shift more frequently between high- and low-volatility states. In addition, the relative magnitude of the high-volatility compared with that of the low-volatility state in the B-share markets is much greater than the case in the two A-share markets. B-share markets are found to be more sensitive to international shocks, while A-share markets seem immune to international spillovers of volatility.

Citizens' motivation for participation in civil society organizations can have both individualistic and collectivistic trend, therefore the results of the carried out research that are presented in this article have also been analyzed according to the two trends mentioned. This article presents the part of the results - those that were obtained having generalized the motivation for participation of citizens of Lithuania in the aspect of expression of individualistic motives. Such a choice was made because the results of research on motivation of collectivistic trend have been presented in previous publications (see Tijunaitiene, Neverauskas, Balciunas, 2009a, b; Tijunaitiene, Neverauskas, 2009; Tijunaitiene, 2009b). The research employed mixed strategy - triangulation: first, by making use of quantitative methodology by Simmons and Birchall (2003, 2004a, b, 2005) it was attempted to identify individualist and collectivist stimuli that determine people's motivation for participation in civil society organizations. Then it was tried to gauge the expression of motivation according to different social-demographic characteristics and to systematically analyze the results obtained. The results of quantitative research having been obtained, we decided to conduct one more, additional qualitative research in order to validate the results of another research (quantitative in this case). Therefore an in-depth semi-structured expert interview was carried out. Motivation for participation is explicated by Mutual Incentives Theory (MIT) developed by Simmons and Birchall (2003, 2004a, b, 2005) and used as quantitative methodology for this research. The theory combines two sociopsychological theories of motivation: individualistic and collectivistic. Thus, the theory encompasses both individualistic and collectivistic incentives. The individualistic stimuli are expressed in MIT in terms of benefit and investment. The most important concepts in the theory of individualistic trend (social exchange) are psychological and economic rewards (benefits) as well as psychological and economic losses that are named by different authors by terms of investments, costs or losses. Therefore this theory of individualistic trend is based on idea that the process of social exchange takes place because of estimated and calculated benefit that an individual expects from relationship. The results of the empirical research have confirmed that rational choice approach which social exchange theory is also based on is implemented within the structure of incentives for those participating in civil society organizations, i.e., people participate partially because of the anticipated and calculated benefit that an individual expects from the exchange. However, for respondents the costs of participation are less important than the benefit they receive from it. Therefore the investments of time as well as conditional financial and other investments are not an obstacle to participation, though these are clearly identified by those who are active and participate.","[Tijunaitiene, Rigita; Balciunas, Sigitas] Siauliai Univ, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai University,"Tijunaitiene, R (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Architektu Str 1, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",rigita@smf.su.lt; balciunas@cr.su.lt,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,6,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We use both ARCH and GARCH models to estimate price conditional heteroscedasticity and find evidence of a time-varying property in the volatilities of the house price series. We then use the SWARCH model and find there are three volatility states in the price series. Our estimations suggest the UK housing markets are relatively stable and different states do not switch very often. The magnitude of high price volatility is as high as 20.99 times of the low volatility for the older housing market and 14 times of the low volatility for the new housing market. In addition, the older housing market is less efficient than the new housing market, since the impacts of events on the volatility state of the older house prices is more lasting than in new housing market.","[Chen, Ming-Chi; Ma, Tai] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University,"Chen, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",mcchen@finance.nsysu.edu.tw,"Ma, TAI/B-7034-2009; Tsai, I-Chun/H-6503-2018","ma, tai/0000-0002-6681-3544; Tsai, I-Chun/0000-0001-8277-2327",,,,,16,22,25,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, certain lack of clarity remains in relation to the defining elements and the dynamics of RSI, which make it difficult to operationalize and to articulate properly the concept for policy purposes. This lack of clarity is motivated by the fact that the concept of RSI is influenced by a number of theories and approaches, in particular institutional, systemic and evolutionary approaches to innovation and learning. As a result of this mix of influences, the concept of RSI derives different and even conflicting theoretical assumptions and policy rationales. The paper advocates a more coherent evolutionary articulation of regional systems and a better understanding of the complexity surrounding policy processes.","Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Uyarra, E (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Harold Hankins Bldg,Booth St W, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Elvira.uyarra@mbs.ac.uk,,"uyarra, elvira/0000-0003-3144-1741",,,,,104,155,178,1,135,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We find that prices of MCRs and Dotcoms both go down with time, but prices of MCRs decrease in a significantly faster speed, implying that difference in the average prices between the two types of retailers is getting smaller with time. We also compare the price dispersion and its dynamics between MCRs and Dotcoms. We find that the price dispersion among MCRs is much bigger than that among Dotcoms at the beginning. But such a difference gets smaller with time as the price dispersion among Dotcoms becomes bigger. Our results suggest that the two types of retailers will not only charge similar average prices in long term, but also have similar price dispersions. But our findings show that price dispersion among all retailers goes up with time, indicating that prices do not converge in the Internet market. Branding makes significant difference on both the price and the price dispersion.","[Xing, Xiaolin] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Xing, Xiaolin] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Jiangnan University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Xing, XL (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi, Peoples R China.",xiailinx@pitt.edu,,,,,,,35,6,7,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

With increasing interests from construction firms in implementing an integrated management system (IMS) which combines OHSAS 18001, ISO 14001 and ISO 9001, it is timely to assess, manage and control the risks resulted from OHS, environment and quality issues under this new integrated scheme. In this study, the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is employed to analyze risk management for OHS, environment and quality management under an IMS in a local case study in China. FMEA is known to be a systematic procedure for the analysis of a system to identify the potential failure modes, and their causes and effects on system performance in engineering management. The analysis is performed at the early stage of a system so that removal or mitigation of the failure mode is most cost effective method. On the basis of risk priority numbers calculated from occurrence, severity, and detection of potential risks, twenty potential risk factors are graded, and their levels of acceptability are determined The acceptability of risks is defined into four scenarios: acceptable, moderate, undesirable, and unacceptable. The findings indicate that five major potential risks, including Roof related falls, Elevator shaft falls, Holes in flooring on construction site, Hit by falling objects, and Run over by operating equipment, are graded to be unacceptable. These events are considered the most risky in construction. In practice, these unacceptable risks can be minimized through prevention or protection. The main goal of risk management is to keep the risks at an acceptable level by maintaining the tolerable risks and following the programs in moving unacceptable risks to an acceptable level. Risk management must involve risk mitigation measures so as to fulfill OHS, environmental and quality management programs, leading to a reduction of risk levels. All these are designed to avoid accidents, incidents, injury, or occupational diseases. In the event of an accident that has already occurred, a necessary part of risk management is the management of crisis for minimizing losses/impacts. Accordingly, measures for risk management for the twenty potential risk factors of OHS, environment and quality are recommended It is revealed that training programs are prioritized to be the most effective measures in integrated risk management. Effective training helps personnel carry out various activities, establish a positive safety attitude, and integrate safety with environmental and quality goals. Comparing to other countries, training is believed to have a significant role in the construction industry of China due to the fact that the percentage of construction workers being trained is very low. This paper then proposes a methodology for contractors who implement the management system to integrate risk management in the pursuit of continuous improvement in project management. To achieve that, an integrated risk management is tied with a Deming's cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act) (P-D-C-A), in which it is necessary to add audits and management review for attaining continuous improvement.","[Zeng, Sai X.] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Sch Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China; [Tam, Chun M.] City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Sci & Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tam, Vivian W.

Unfortunately, notably because interest rates must be positive, the Taylor principle cannot be satisfied for all interest rates, and as a consequence global determinacy may not prevail even though there exists a locally determinate equilibrium. We propose here a simple alternative to the Taylor principle, which takes the form of a new condition on interest rate rules that ensures global determinacy. An important feature of the policy package is that it does not rely at all on any of the fiscal policies associated with the fiscal theory of the price level, which has so far been the main alternative for determinacy.","PSE & CEPREMAP, Paris, France",,"Bénassy, JP (通讯作者)，PSE & CEPREMAP, Paris, France.",benassy@pse.ens.fr,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1742-7355,,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

We assume both types of insurers must provide the basic plan, insurance is compulsory, and there is a minimum premium regulation. When we compare the equilibriums pre and post introduction of the basic health insurance plan, we find that an implicit subsidy mechanism operates that gives some solidarity to the system, even though no explicit risk compensation mechanism is introduced. For this implicit subsidy mechanism to operate, it is fundamental that not only the price of the basic plan is regulated but also the quality of the services included in such plan, and that the regulator is able to guarantee private insurers do offer the minimum plan to all risk types.","[Willington, Manuel] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Econ & Negocios, ILADES, Santiago, Chile; [Beteta, Edmundo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Lima, Peru",Universidad Alberto Hurtado; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Willington, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Econ & Negocios, ILADES, Erasmo Escala 1835, Santiago, Chile.",mwilling@uahurtado.cl,"Willington, Manuel/ABD-8214-2020; Willington, Manuel/H-4035-2018","Willington, Manuel/0000-0002-2803-6641; Willington, Manuel/0000-0002-2803-6641",,,,,24,1,2,0,5,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

It shows that constrained investment, in the sense that it requires liquidity or that adjustment to the stock of capital is costly, is enough to induce indeterminacy if monetary policy follows a strictly passive interest rate rule. Determinacy of equilibrium is ensured under an active monetary policy stance. These results change when production externalities are introduced into the model so as to mimic the pricing channel in New Keynesian models. In this case, a policy stance that ensures determinacy is either active or strictly passive. In view of the contradicting results for the passive stance and the similar results for the active stance it is recommended that central banks act according to the active stance.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Gliksberg, B (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",baruchg@mscc.huji.ac.il,,,,,,,14,5,5,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We ran experiments where subjects played one of four coordination games in constant pairings, where the incentives to teach were varied along two dimensions-the short run cost of teaching and the long run benefit to teaching. We show which aspects of the game lead subjects to adopt long run teaching strategies, and show that subjects try to manipulate their opponent's actions to pull them out of a situation of coordination failure. We also show that extending a model of decision making by introducing a forward-looking component helps to track teachers' behaviour more accurately, and describes the way players behave in a more unified way across both teachers and learners.","[Hyndman, Kyle] So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Terracol, Antoine] Univ Paris 01, Univ Lille, CNRS, EQUIPPE, Paris, France; [Terracol, Antoine] Univ Paris 01, Univ Lille, CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France",Southern Methodist University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Universite de Lille; Universite de Lille; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Hyndman, K (通讯作者)，So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, 3300 Dyer St,301R, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",hyndman@smu.edu; terracol@univ-paris1.fr; jonathan.vaksmann@univ-paris1.fr,,"Hyndman, Kyle/0000-0003-3666-8734; Terracol, Antoine/0000-0001-9937-4114",,,,,40,19,22,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Based on the Euler equation of non-Japanese firms' learning-curve optimization, we estimate the marginal cost function and then calculate Japanese price-cost margins by using nonparametric estimation. Our estimation results show that the price-cost margins of Japanese firms were set far above the learning-curve optimization margins but still lower than the marginal costs on average. Hence we can infer that the STA could not push the price above the average Japanese marginal cost but facilitate the Japanese firms to collude to set the price-cost margins by taking account of learning-by-doing effects. This empirical finding and no significant spillover effect are combined with other observations to imply that the STA might have enabled later-entering non-Japanese firms to rapidly expand their market shares and get a foot in the door of the R&D competition for new generational DRAM.

Corrections are also introduced for occupational selection, and two key variables are instrumented: education and work experience. Although there are still wage differences between men and women, the introduction of controls for actual work experience and the instrumentation of this work experience and education bring the hourly wage gap down to some 11% to 18%, figures much lower than those reported in earlier studies for Chile.

Investigation and prosecution becomes faster under the leniency program by about 1.5 years. Finally, we consider sufficient conditions for the destabilizing effect of leniency that regard the number and duration of detected cartels.

Simulation results indicate that students are sufficiently forward-looking that publishers cannot consistently raise revenue by accelerating current revision cycles.","[Chevalier, Judith] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago,"Chevalier, J (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,11,67,87,0,41,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

Health advocates and lobbyists would like to see similar laws mandating nutrition information in the restaurant and fast-food market as well. In fact, New York City has already taken a step forward and now requires all chain restaurants with 15 or more establishments anywhere in US to show calorie information on their menus and menu board. The benefits were estimated to be as much as 150,000 fewer obese New Yorkers over the next five years. The implied benefits of the presence of nutrition information are that consumers will be able to observe such information and then make informed (and hopefully healthier) food choices. In this study, we use the latest available dataset from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2006) to explore whether reading such nutrition information really has an effect on body weight outcomes. In order to deal with the inherent problem of cross-sectional datasets, namely self-selection, and the possible occurrence of reverse causality we use a propensity score matching approach to estimate causal treatment effects. We conducted a series of tests related to variable choice of the propensity score specification, quality of matching indicators, robustness checks, and sensitivity to unobserved heterogeneity, using Rosenbaum bounds to validate our propensity score exercise. Our results generally suggest that reading nutrition information does not affect body mass index. The implications of our findings are also discussed.","[Drichoutis, Andreas C.] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Lazaridis, Panagiotis] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Athens 11855, Greece",University of Ioannina; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Agricultural University of Athens,"Drichoutis, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece.",adrihout@cc.uoi.gr; rnayga@uark.edu; t.lazaridis@aua.gr,"Drichoutis, Andreas/AAM-6580-2020; Drichoutis, Andreas/G-2275-2011","Drichoutis, Andreas/0000-0002-4082-4560;",,,,,36,27,32,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2009,62.0,4,,,,,500,525,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00448.x,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,509QK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271033000005,0

Competition authorities view list pricing and discounting as a procompetitive practice. We modify the standard Bertrand-Edgeworth duopoly model to include list pricing and a subsequent discounting stage. Both firms first simultaneously choose a maximum list price and then decide whether to discount, or not, in a subsequent stage. We show that list pricing works as a credible commitment device that induces a pure strategy outcome. This is true for a general class of rationing rules. Further unlike the dominant firm interpretation of a price leader, the low capacity firm may have incentives to commit to a low price and in this sense assume the role of a leader.

This view fails to pay sufficient attention to the supply-side forces that drive emigration from poor to rich countries. European mass migrations before 1914 suggest that emigration typically traces out what is sometimes called the 'migration hump' and what we call an 'emigration life cycle'. This paper examines the forces that underlay the mass migration from pre-1914 Europe and compares them with the experience since 1970. Despite the great importance of restrictive immigration policy today, we find the same forces at work in poor source countries today as a century ago. Our results also suggest that, contrary to popular belief, emigration pressure from the Third World is beginning to ease.","[Hatton, Timothy J.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Hatton, Timothy J.] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Williamson, Jeffrey G.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Williamson, Jeffrey G.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Australian National University; University of Essex; Harvard University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hatton, TJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,16,3,4,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Banks extend loans to firms in an environment of monopolistic competition by setting their loan rates in a staggered way, which means that the adjustment of the aggregate loan rate to a monetary policy shock is sticky. We estimate the model for the euro area by adopting a minimum distance approach. Our findings exhibit that (i) financial costs are an important factor for price changes, (ii) frictions in the loan market have an effect on the propagation of monetary policy shocks as the pass-through from a change in money market rates to loan rates is incomplete, and (iii) the strength of the cost channel is mitigated as banks shelter firms from monetary policy shocks by smoothing loan rates.

When cost differences are large enough the game becomes a war of attrition that yields Stackelberg behavior where the high cost firm will delay choosing a location until the low cost firm commits to its position. We find interaction effects between timing and the degree of product differentiation and compute timing/location and mixed strategy equilibria through a range of marginal cost differences. The firms maximally differentiate with moderate cost differences; with somewhat greater cost differences there is intermediate differentiation, and; with large cost differences there is a blockading monopoly. The low cost firm always commits to entry immediately whereas the high cost firm either enters immediately, shortly after the low cost leader, or never, depending on the cost differences. Finally, we find that in equilibrium the duopoly is sustained for a larger range of cost differentials and that differentiation is greater than the social optimum. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this way, we reveal the countries that are more useful in predicting growth in other member countries along with the ones that are more receptive to other countries' financial developments. Our results suggest that financial variables are useful leading indicators for euro area growth at a joint level, albeit at different horizons, ranging from one to six quarters.

The key aspect is that rewards have informational content. When the principal obtains a private subjective signal about the agent's performance, she may pay discretionary bonuses to provide credible feedback to the agent. In accordance with the often observed compression of ratings, we show that in equilibrium the principal communicates the agent's interim performance imperfectly, i.e., she does not fully differentiate good and bad performance. Furthermore, we show that small rewards can have a large impact on the agent's effort, provided that the principal's stake in the project is small. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In the latter case, the funded country shares both in the costs and the benefits of the reform. However, if a Pareto-improving pension reform is feasible in the PAYG country, a Pareto improvement in the funded country is not guaranteed.","[Adema, Yvonne; Meijdam, Lex; Verbon, Harrie A.

As a comparison of the family situations of children of various ages shows, the frequency of single-parent families is higher in Russia where these children are more likely to live in multi-generation households. The probability is increasing in both countries that the children born to couples living together (whether married or not) - and especially the children born during the 1980s in Russia - will, before they come of age, see their parents separate. In both countries, the parents of the children most exposed to the risk of separation share some characteristics: their mother formed a couple at a young age, her partner has at least one other child or is older, or she did not spend her whole childhood with both her parents.

We argue that the understanding of how BITs affect FDI requires recognizing that multinational enterprises (MNEs) are not Stateless and that their investment return may well depend on the quality of political relations between the home and host countries. Using bilateral FDI data and event data to measure political interactions between countries, we show that the effect of the entry into force of a BIT crucially depends on the quality of political relations between the signatory countries; it increases FDI more between countries with tense relationships than between friendly countries. We also find evidence that BITs and good domestic institutions are complementary. BITs should therefore be understood as a mechanism for host governments to credibly commit not to expropriate investors in the future. Journal of Comparative Economics 37 (3) (2009) 372-386.

The more goals and the more perfect the referee, the more drastic are the measures needed to maintain competitive balance. Taking into account that the optimal level of competitive balance is lower in open leagues than in closed leagues, the combined effect of these factors may explain why in U.S. team sports special measures are in force to maintain competitive balance, which are absent in Europe.

This paper extends a two-country model of inter- and intra-industry trade to a rich environment featuring technological differences, skill differences and the possibility of international labor mobility. The model is used to explain the patterns of trade and migration as countries remove barriers to trade and to labor mobility. We parameterize the model to match the features of the Western and Eastern European members of the EU and analyze first the effects of the trade liberalization which occurred between 1989 and 2004, and then the gains and losses from migration which are expected to occur if legal barriers to labor mobility are substantially reduced. The lower barriers to migration would result in significant migration of skilled workers from Eastern European countries. Interestingly, this would not only benefit the migrants and most Western European workers but, via trade, it would also benefit the workers remaining in Eastern Europe. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Incremental cost sharing: Characterization by coalition strategy-proofness. Soc. Choice Welfare 16 (2), 279-320]. For many fundamental cost-sharing applications, however, Moulin mechanisms provably suffer from poor budget-balance, poor economic efficiency, or both. We propose acyclic mechanisms, a new framework for designing truthful and approximately budget-balanced cost-sharing mechanisms. Acyclic mechanisms strictly generalize Moulin mechanisms and offer three important advantages. First, it is easier to design acyclic mechanisms than Moulin mechanisms: many classical primal-dual algorithms naturally induce a non-Moulin acyclic mechanism with good performance guarantees. Second, for important classes of cost-sharing problems, acyclic mechanisms have exponentially better budget-balance and economic efficiency than Moulin mechanisms. Finally, while Moulin mechanisms have found application primarily in binary demand games, we extend acyclic mechanisms to general demand games, a multi-parameter setting in which each bidder can be allocated one of several levels of service.

The founders of structuralism conceived a systemic, multidimensional and dynamic approach. They applied it to the study of improvements in, and the social distribution of, labour productivity generated in the central economies and the effects of these on the societies of the periphery. This outlook challenges the notion of markets as self-regulating systems that return to stable equilibrium positions, presenting them rather as a quantitative expression of the national or international power status of contracting parties. Different development styles and processes progressively alter the power structure of social systems and these changes are reflected in the dynamic of relative market prices.","[Di Filippo, Armando] Univ Chile, Inst Int Studies, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Di Filippo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Inst Int Studies, Santiago, Chile.",armando.difilippo@gmail.com,,,,,,,69,6,8,0,6,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2009,,98,,,,,175,196,,,,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,532ZD,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272789400010,0
J,"Frankel, JA",,,,"Frankel, Jeffrey A.",,,NEW ESTIMATION OF CHINA'S EXCHANGE RATE REGIME,PACIFIC ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The present paper updates the question: what precisely is the exchange rate regime that China has put into place since 2005, when it announced a move away from the US dollar peg? Is it a basket anchor with the possibility of cumulatable daily appreciations, as was announced at the time? We apply to this question a new approach of estimating countries' de facto exchange rate regimes, a synthesis of two techniques. One is a technique that has been used in the past to estimate implicit de facto currency weights when the hypothesis is a basket peg with little flexibility. The second is a technique used to estimate the de facto degree of exchange rate flexibility when the hypothesis is an anchor to the US dollar or some other single major currency. Because the RMB and many other currencies today purportedly follow variants of band-basket-crawl, it is important to have available a technique that can cover both dimensions, inferring weights and inferring flexibility. The synthesis adds a variable representing 'exchange market pressure' to the currency basket equation, whereby the degree of flexibility is estimated at the same time as the currency weights. This approach reveals that by mid-2007, the RMB basket had switched a substantial part of the US dollar's weight onto the euro. The implication is that the appreciation of the RMB against the US dollar during this period was due to the appreciation of the euro against the dollar, not to any upward trend in the RMB relative to its basket.","Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Frankel, JA (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, 79 JFK St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jeffrey_frankel@harvard.edu,,,,,,,18,58,62,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

In this paper, we show that the effects of social security reforms on aggregate labor supply are invariant to plausible values of the IES, but the effect of such reforms on the profile of hours over the life-cycle is highly sensitive to the IES. We first establish these results analytically in a simple partial-equilibrium setting and then demonstrate their robustness in a general equilibrium model calibrated to match key U.S. macroeconomic indicators. We find that the aggregate effects are similar regardless of the wide range of the values of IES used in calibrated economics. However, social security reform leads to a large reallocation of hours worked over the life-cycle, from early years to later working years, and the size of this reallocation significantly increases with the IES.

We find empirical evidence that good information of macro aggregates reduces sovereign risk by enhancing the repayment ratio conditional on default, while having an insignificant effect on the default probability. The estimation accounts for selection bias by using a cross-country panel data of 69 developing countries for 1989-2002. Careful consideration is taken to establish information quality of macro aggregates as an exogenous institutional variable. Results are robust to controlling for various governance factors, income levels, and regional factors, etc. Linking information quality to creditors' bargaining power is more consistent with our findings than linking poor information quality to information asymmetry.","Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Lee, SJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, 21st St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",seung.j.lee@frb.gov,,"Lee, Seung Jung/0000-0002-5926-9237",,,,,26,7,7,0,2,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The Finnish comprehensive school reform of 1972-1977 replaced the old two-track school system with a uniform nine-year comprehensive school and shifted the selection of students to vocational and academic tracks from age 11 to age 16. We estimate the effect of this reform on the intergenerational income elasticity using a representative sample of males born between 1960 and 1966. The identification strategy relies on a differences-in-differences approach and exploits the fact that the reform was implemented gradually across the country during a six-year period. The results indicate that the reform reduced the intergenerational income elasticity by 23% from the pre-reform elasticity of 0.30 to post-reform elasticity of 0.23. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Two different classes of decision rules could generate this behavior: rules that are optimal conditional on utility functions departing from risk neutrality, or heuristics derived from limited cognitive processing capacities and satisficing. To discriminate between these possibilities, we conducted an experiment that consists of a search task as well as a lottery task designed to elicit utility functions.

The expected lifetime utility of the representative household is used as the welfare criterion. The model is solved using second-order approximation methods. We find that under benchmark parameterization, an exchange rate rule delivers lower standard deviations of GDP and inflation compared to an interest rate rule, when the economy has a high degree of openness. However, despite that, an exchange rate rule is welfare inferior to an interest rate rule since it delivers lower mean terms of trade, which leads to lower mean consumption and higher mean labor hours. On the other hand, when the elasticity of substitution for export is high, an exchange rate rule is welfare superior to an interest rate rule, regardless of the degree of openness, as the differences in mean terms of trade for the two classes of rules become smaller.

This paper investigates the economic rationales for public intervention to control obesity. We present new empirical evidence showing that family background is related to obesity among young European adults. This evidence provides a strong basis for intervention on equity grounds, particularly targeted towards children. The case for intervention on efficiency grounds is less clear-cut and in most cases the evidence is relatively weak. We find insufficient evidence that information deficiencies are important, as the majority of Europeans appear to be aware of the bad consequences of obesity on health. We also find that the potential health insurance externality - non-obese effectively subsidizing obese individuals - is small. In support of policy intervention, we show that there are product and labour market imperfections. Obese employees earn less than the non-obese. We also find that there is a remarkably high proportion of individuals with self-control problems, who fail to stick to their self-declared weight-related plans.

We distinguish between a structural effect, which increases accountability, and a cyclical effect which may be disruptive. Since the effects are offsetting, neither can be analysed in isolation. We implement an econometric analysis on more than 80 developing countries using positive changes in the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment of the World Bank and the International Country Risk Guide as signalling improvements in economic policy and governance. We find that both structural and cyclical effects matter. The cyclical effect suggests that mid-term is the best moment for policy change. We investigate the structural effect by comparing different frequencies of elections. Except at the extremes, a higher frequency of elections improves both policy and governance net of any cyclical effect. The important exception to this benign net effect is if the electoral process is badly conducted. Badly conducted elections have no structural efficacy for policy improvement. A reasonable interpretation of our results is that honest elections increase accountability and thereby discipline governments to improve economic policy and governance, but that if candidates can win by fraud this chain is broken. -Lisa Chauvet and Paul Collier.","[Chauvet, Lisa] DIAL, IRD, Paris, France; Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, CSAE, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); University of Oxford,"Chauvet, L (通讯作者)，DIAL, IRD, Paris, France.",,"Chauvet, Lisa/J-8760-2016","Chauvet, Lisa/0000-0002-1918-4124",,,,,32,28,30,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Theory also predicts that if valuations are not common knowledge, then since it is weakly dominated to bid your valuation, bidders will bid less and earn positive profits. Hence, rational players in an auction game should prefer less public information. We are perhaps more used to seeing these results in the equivalent Bertrand setting. In our experimental auction, we find that individuals without information on each other's valuations earn more profits than those with common knowledge. However, given a choice between the two sets of rules, approximately half the individuals preferred to have the public information. We discuss possible explanations, including showing that there is a correlation between ambiguity aversion and a preference for having more information in the auction. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

While protectionism is seen as a possible dangerous outcome of the crisis, the extent of protectionism inherent to the strengthening and globalisation of intellectual property rights (IPRs) associated, in particular, with the signing of the Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement is not generally perceived as one of its possible causes. Indeed, IPRs have acted as 'super-tariffs'. They have particularly raised the cost of investments for countries that had neither abundant cheap labour nor high amounts of intellectual property resources. Moreover, IPRs may have later exerted negative effects even on IP-rich firms, as the proliferation of conflicting rights has led firms to increasingly inhibit each other's investments. The resulting investment strike has manifested itself as a saving glut and has mainly affected the USA in a situation aggravated by inadequate regulations. If intellectual monopolies are one of the causes of the crash, the remedies should not only focus on monetary policy, financial regulations or even on standard Keynesian policies. Aggregate demand stimulus should be coupled with policies that decrease the level of intellectual monopolisation of the economy.","[Pagano, Ugo] Univ Siena, Dept Econ, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Pagano, U (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ, Piazza San Francesco 7, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",pagano@unisi.it,"Rossi, Maria Alessandra/AAH-8756-2021","Pagano, Ugo/0000-0002-9917-5091",,,,,40,55,59,2,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Our analysis reveals the crucial role played by the relative magnitude of the market interest rate to other parameters (including the parameter of time preference, the age-specific mortality and the wage growth rate) in determining the age profile of VOT, and the difference in VOT that is caused by the insurance scheme.","[Sun, Guang-Zhen] Univ Macau, Dept Econ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Macao, Peoples R China; [Sun, Guang-Zhen; Ng, Yew-Kwang] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",University of Macau; Monash University,"Sun, GZ (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Dept Econ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Macao, Peoples R China.",gzsun@umac.mo,"Ng, Yew-Kwang/AAM-1664-2021","Ng, Yew-Kwang/0000-0001-5669-9883",,,,,21,1,1,1,6,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

Aid substitutes for domestic savings, has no effect on the financial account, and leads to unaccounted capital flight.

A statistical analysis was provided to close this gap. The results show a slowdown in the contribution of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth and low growth of labor productivity of the sector. A negative impact of quality of inputs used by the sector was observed in the contribution of TFP, TFP per unit of labor and labor productivity growth in comparison with other productivity indictors of the sector.

While the bank lending channel view of the monetary policy would have suggested an increase in loans to firms in this context, the demand for bank corporate lending, however, slowed down, suggesting that monetary policy was not effective in this area. This article analyses how the financing behaviour of Spanish firms during 1992-2003 is related to their liquidity holdings and how this relationship may affect the effectiveness of the bank lending channel. The empirical evidence provided suggests that firms holding high liquid assets may replace bank lending by other sources of financing. Hence, higher liquidity holdings allow firms to invest in attractive investment projects in the event of a tightening of monetary conditions.","[Carbo Valverde, Santiago; Lopez del Paso, Rafael] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Eco & Empresari, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Carbo Valverde, Santiago] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA",University of Granada; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Valverde, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Eco & Empresari, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus Univ Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",scarbo@ugr.es; lopezdelpaso@yahoo.es,,"Carbo Valverde, Santiago/0000-0001-5357-599X",,,,,45,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-5469,1435-5477,,SPAN ECON REV,Span.

In this game, two individuals simultaneously choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner is the person whose chosen number is the closest to 2/3 of the average of the two numbers. The weakly dominant strategy is zero. Because of the simplicity of the game, the widespread failure of subjects to choose the weakly dominant strategy has been interpreted as evidence of some fundamental inability to behave strategically. By contrast, we find that subjects' behavior reflects a lack of understanding of the game form, which we define as the relationships between possible choices, outcomes and payoffs. To a surprising degree, subjects seem to have little understanding of the experimental environment in which they are participating. If subjects do not understand the game form, the experimental control needed for testing game theory is lost. The experiments reported here demonstrate that the failure to act strategically is related to how the game is presented. We test how well subjects are able to recognize the game under a variety of different presentations of the game. Some subjects fail to recognize the game form when it is presented abstractly. When the game is transformed into a simple isomorphic game and presented in a familiar context, subjects do choose weakly dominant strategies. While our results confirm the ability of subjects to make strategic decisions, they also emphasize the need to understand the limitations of experimental subjects' ability to grasp the game as the experimenter intends. Given these limitations, we provide suggestions for better experimental control.","[McConnell, Margaret; Plott, Charles R.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Chou, Eileen] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL USA; [Nagel, Rosemarie] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ, ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",California Institute of Technology; Northwestern University; Pompeu Fabra University; ICREA,"Plott, CR (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",cplott@hss.caltech.edu,"Nagel, Rosemarie/C-6311-2013","Nagel, Rosemarie/0000-0001-6599-0664",ICREA Funding Source: Custom,ICREA(ICREA),,,30,66,74,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Yet in December 1997 Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer declared that Korea suffered from a systemic breakdown of economic relations so complete that only radical economic restructuring could restore prosperity. The IMF attached what it called extreme structural conditionality to its loan agreements with Korea, demanding a complete and rapid transition from Korea's traditional East Asian economic model to a globally integrated neoliberal model. We subject the IMF's assertion that the allocative efficiency of the Korean economy had collapsed by 1997 to a number of empirical tests. The evidence does not support the IMF's systemic breakdown claim. We conclude that the IMF's imposition of extreme structural conditionality on Korea is best understood as an illegitimate and antidemocratic exercise of power designed to meet the needs of the IMF's key constituents rather than those of the majority of Korea's people.","[Crotty, James] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Lee, Kang-Kook] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Econ, Kyoto, Japan",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Ritsumeikan University,"Crotty, J (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 34 Potwine Lane, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",crotty@econs.umass.edu; kangkooklee@gmail.com,,,,,,,47,10,11,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

This paper pursues two approaches to modeling consumption dynamics and measuring how much society dislikes fluctuations, one statistical and one economic. The statistical approach estimates the properties of consumption and calculates the costs of having consumption fluctuating around its mean growth. The paper finds that persistence is a crucial determinant of the costs and that the high persistence in the data severely distorts conventional measures. It shows how to compute valid estimates and confidence intervals. The economic approach uses a calibrated model of optimal consumption and measures the costs of eliminating income shocks. This uncovers a further cost of uncertainty, through its impact on precautionary savings and investment. The two approaches lead to costs of fluctuations that are higher than the common wisdom, between 0.5% and 5% of per capita consumption.

Numerous studies have considered the strategic incentives of various forms of arbitration, most notably final offer arbitration (FOA). While previous work focused exclusively on optimal offers, in reality disputants make a series of perhaps interrelated choices. This paper considers FOA disputants making an additional investment decision regarding their case. We consider four cases distinguished by the sequence and observability of choices. The theoretical results indicate that it is socially optimal for disputants to make publicly observable offers prior to investment decisions.

We use a one-shot Public Goods game to explore the effect of sex and a group's sex composition on the voluntary provision of public goods in a Nairobi slum. Sex heterogeneity hurts the voluntary provision of public goods because women-but not men-contribute less in mixed-sex than same-sex groups. Women contribute as much as men in same-sex groups.

Although implemented by a weaker solution concept, behavior in the dynamic Vickrey auction with the public dropout information comes significantly closer to the theoretical prediction of sincere bidding, bidding one's valuations, than either the static Vickrey auction or the dynamic auction without dropout information. This suggests a possible tradeoff between the simplicity and transparency of a mechanism and the strength of its Solution concept when agents are still learning and/or when players are not fully rational. Drawing on results from related single-unit and multi-unit demand auctions, and the results of a new single-unit demand auction experiment, we provide important insights into the behavioral mechanism underlying the superior performance of the Ausubel auction with feedback information.

During the second half of the nineteenth century the Mortgage Bank's credit operations spurred the rapid expansion of irrigation in Chile's Central Valley and made possible a concomitant increase in agricultural exports. Despite the strong secular rise in credit during this period, the Mortgage Bank had to confront large external shocks, including three sudden stops of foreign capital in 1857, 1873, and 1890.

There has been much debate about the cross-sectional and time series patterns found in these data, particularly with respect to the relationship between SWB and relative status. Part of this debate concerns how well SWB data measure true utility or preferences. In a recent paper, Daly, Wilson, and Johnson (2008) propose using data on suicide as a revealed preference (outcome-based) measure of well-being and find strong evidence that reference-group income negatively affects suicide risk. In this paper, we compare and contrast the empirical patterns of SWB and suicide data. Despite no obvious aggregate relationship between the two series-either time series or cross-sectionalwe find a strikingly strong and consistent relationship in the determinants of SWB and suicide in individual-level, multivariate regressions. This latter result cross-validates suicide and SWB micro data as useful and complementary indicators of latent utility.

Our model augments the extant literature on transfers, and is more consistent with the limited available empirical evidence on heterogeneous and changing transfers' patterns among east African pastoralists.

We show that an optimal mechanism induces only the largest exporters to participate in negotiations over any product, thus providing a rationalization for the Principal supplier rule. We also show that, through this channel, equilibrium tariffs vary according to the Herfindahl-Hirschman index of export shares: higher concentration in a sector reduces free riding and thus causes a lower tariff.

At each year, the credit network is regarded as a weighted bipartite graph where edges correspond to the relationships and weights refer to the amounts of loans. Reduction in the supply of credit affects firms as debtor, and failure of a firm influences banks as creditor. To quantify the dependency and influence between banks and firms, we propose a set of scores of banks and firms, which can be calculated by solving an eigenvalue problem determined by the weight of the credit network. We found that a few largest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors are significant by using a null hypothesis of random bipartite graphs, and that the scores can quantitatively describe the stability or fragility of the credit network during the 25 years.","[Fujiwara, Yoshi; Souma, Wataru] ATR NiCT CIS Appl Network Sci Lab, Kyoto, Japan; [Aoyama, Hideaki] Kyoto Univ, Dept Phys, Kyoto 606, Japan; [Ikeda, Yuichi] Hitachi Ltd, Hitachi Res Lab, Ibaraki, Japan; [Iyetomi, Hiroshi] Niigata Univ, Dept Phys, Niigata 95021, Japan",Kyoto University; Hitachi Limited; Niigata University,"Fujiwara, Y (通讯作者)，ATR CIS Appl Network Sci Lab, Kyoto 6190288, Japan.",yoshi.fujiwara@gmail.com,"Souma, Wataru/L-3652-2018","Souma, Wataru/0000-0002-1051-4350",,,,,12,13,14,1,8,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 16,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,20097,,,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20LU,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208142300001,0

Inspiration for a climate-technology revolution is often drawn from the Apollo space program or the Manhattan Project, but averting dangerous climate change cannot be solved by a single new technology, deployed by a single government. The technological changes needed to address climate change fundamentally will have to be pervasive; they will have to involve markets; and they will have to be global in scope. My focus in this paper is not on the moderate emission reductions that can be achieved using existing technologies, but on the breakthrough technologies that are needed to reduce emissions dramatically. The challenges are formidable. Indeed, it is possible that the revolution needed to dramatically reduce emissions of greenhouse gases will fail. Should the climate change abruptly, the incentive to engineer the climate will be strong. There will be a climate-technology revolution, but its nature will depend on the institutions we develop to address the challenge we face.","[Barrett, Scott] Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Barrett, Scott] Johns Hopkins Univ, Paul H Nilze Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC USA",Columbia University; Johns Hopkins University,"Barrett, S (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,37,68,76,0,13,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Several findings emerged from fixed-effect panel regressions with country-specific time-trends. First, the impacts of socioeconomic variables vary across different gender-age groups. Second, in general, better economic conditions such as high levels of income and higher economic growth were found to reduce the suicide rate, while income inequality increases the suicide rate. Third, the suicide rate is more sensitive to economic factors captured by real GDP per capita, growth rate of real GDP per capita, and the Gini index than to social factors represented by divorce rate, birth rate. female labor force participation rate, and alcohol consumption. Fourth, female and elderly suicides are more difficult to be accounted for. Finally, in accordance with general beliefs, Japan's suicide problem is very different from those of other OECD countries.

However, from the viewpoint of economic methodology there are still substantial reasons why NEBE is irrelevant for economic theory. This paper argues that they will only become an essential part of economics if they are embedded into a fully-fledged institutional and evolutionary paradigm. I develop a Neo-Veblenian theory of the individual that starts out from the observation that modern brain sciences do not support the notion of the brain to be an integrated and consistent rational decision apparatus. An evolutionary explanation is offered for this, which reinstates Veblen's distinction between adaptation as engineering optima and social selection. Individual identity does only emerge through communication and interaction among brains, in particular via language. The concept of the extended brain is proposed, which is applied to define human individuality as a social phenomenon. Thus, the systematic unity of neuroeconomics and institutional economics is established.","Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sino German Sch Governance, Frankfurt, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Herrmann-Pillath, C (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sino German Sch Governance, Frankfurt, Germany.",c.herrmann-pillath@frankfurt-school.de,,"Herrmann-Pillath, Carsten/0000-0001-6078-0078",,,,,115,8,8,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Whether or not one finds empirical Support for sustainability is related to the econometric technique employed: conventional Unit-root tests typically fail to reject the existence of a unit root in the current-account imbalances of our sample of five crisis-affected Asian countries. However, using nonlinear unit-root tests we reject the existence of a unit root in favour of nonlinear mean reversion. Thus, contrary to what some others have claimed, the Asian crisis was not caused by these countries' current-account deficits, as their current accounts were on sustainable paths. We thus reject the existence of any threshold in current-account adjustment. These results also provide support for the intertemporal approach to the current account. In addition. we find that dramatic improvements in these countries' current-account deficits around 1998 were caused by sharp real depreciations of their currencies. Finally, we provide some policy implications and recommendations. (C) 2008 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

When participation is restricted to all or nothing (intrinsic agency), the agent must choose between both principals' contracts and selecting her outside option. When the agent is afforded the additional possibilities of choosing only one contract (delegated agency), competition is more intense. The two games have distinct predictions for participation. Intrinsic agency always induces more distortion in participation relative to the monopoly outcome, and equilibrium allocations are discontinuous for the marginal consumer. Under delegated agency, relative to monopoly, market participation increases (respectively, decreases) when contracting variables are substitutes (respectively, complements) on the intensive margin. Equilibrium allocations are continuous for the marginal consumer and the range of product offerings is identical to both the first-best and the monopoly outcome.","[Martimort, David] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Stole, Lars] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Chicago,"Martimort, D (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",martimor@cict.fr; lars.stole@gsb.uchicago.edu,,,,,,,26,32,35,1,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0741-6261,,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

It considers how, among other things, the vulnerability of a migrant's life at the destination, their link to relatives back home, and the time spent at the destination affect remittances. The paper finds that migrants act as risk-averse economic agents and send remittances back to the household of origin as part of an insurance exercise in the face of economic uncertainty. Remittances are also found to be driven by a migrant's labor market earnings level. The paper highlights the important role of remittances in providing an effective means of risk-coping and mutual support within the family.","[Niimi, Yoko] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines; [Thai Hung Pham] Natl Econ Univ, Fac Trade, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Reilly, Barry] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9SN, E Sussex, England",Asian Development Bank; National Economics University - Vietnam; University of Sussex,"Niimi, Y (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines.",yniimi@adb.org; hungpt68@gmail.com; b.m.reilly@sussex.ac.uk,"Reilly, Barry/AAN-8101-2021","Reilly, Barry/0000-0003-0606-4585",,,,,34,28,33,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

In particular, the complicated web of hub-and-spoke type of overlapping free trade agreements (FTAs) can result in high costs for verifying rules of origin. As an alternative policy option to avoid the negative effect of trade deflection, customs unions (CUs) should be examined. Most of the theoretical analyses on the formation of CUs highlight stronger positive welfare effects compared to FTAs. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support the second-best theory of customs unions. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap by applying two methodologies: an ex ante simulation approach and an ex-post econometric approach. We quantitatively estimate the trade effect of CUs and FTAs by adopting a Gravity regression analysis. In general, we find that a CU is a superior type of RTA to an ETA in terms of creating more intra-bloc trade. In addition to analyzing the trade effects of RTAs according to type, we quantitatively evaluate the welfare and output effects of CUs for East Asia (an ASEAN+3 CU and a China-Japan-Korea CU) compared to FTAs by applying a computable general equilibrium model analysis. The Fast Asian CUs adopt a system of common external tariffs (CET) based on simple-averaged, import-weighted, consumption-weighted, and minimum rates, Overall, we find that the ASEAN+3 CU with the minimum CET are the most desirable type of RTA for both Fast Asian member countries and the world economy as a whole.","[Park, Innwon] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Park, Soonchan] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Econ & Int Trade, Kong Ju 314701, South Korea",Korea University; Kongju National University,"Park, I (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",iwpark@korea.ac.kr; spark@kongju.ac.kr,"Park, Innwon/I-6310-2019","Park, Innwon/0000-0001-8567-7907",,,,,50,8,10,0,17,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Many countries cope with this problem by overriding the election results when such parties are elected. We demonstrate that the alternative approach of containing these parties within the democratic system is more effective. We show that, as the probability of state's intervention in the next elections increases, an ideological party implements a more extreme policy in equilibrium. This hurts the median voter. Our main result shows that from the median voter's perspective, the optimal intervention scheme can be implemented by committing not to intervene and adjusting election times appropriately.

In the second study, thirsty subjects who consume beverage sips immediately, rather than with a delay, show greater relative overspending, consistent with quasi-hyperbolic discounting models. The parameter estimates of overspending obtained from the second study, but not the first, are in range of several empirical studies of saving (with an estimated beta = 0.6-0.7).","[Brown, Alexander L.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Singapore Publ Serv Commiss, Singapore, Singapore",California Institute of Technology,"Brown, AL (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",abrown@hss.caltech.edu; eczk@singnet.com.sg; camerer@hss.caltech.edu,,"Brown, Alex/0000-0002-5582-5304",,,,,68,75,89,0,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The model is constructed to yield testable implications for the dynamics of prices, productivity and markups as functions of openness to trade at a sectoral level. The theory lends itself naturally to a difference in differences estimation, with international differences in trade openness at the sector level reflecting international differences in the competitive structure of markets. Predictions are derived for the effects of both domestic and foreign openness on each economy. Using disaggregated data for EU manufacturing over the period 1989-1999 we find short run evidence that trade openness exerts a competitive effect, with prices and markups falling and productivity rising. The response of profit margins to openness has implications on the conduct of monetary policy. Consistent with the predictions of some recent theoretical models we find some, albeit weaker, support that the long run effects are more ambiguous and may even be anti-competitive. Domestic trade liberalization also appears to induce pro-competitive effects on overseas markets. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Simon, 1978 Economics Nobel Prize laureate, talked about satisficing (his neologism) rather than optimizing as being what economists really need. Indeed, optimization might be an unsuitable solution procedure (in that it suggests a unique optimal solution) for problems where many solutions could be satisfactory. We think that looking for an applicable monetary policy is a problem of this kind because there is no unique way in which a central bank can achieve a desired inflation (unemployment, etc.) path. We think that it is viability theory, which is a relatively young area of mathematics, that rigorously captures the essence of satisficing.

We use this measure, which we call annualized comprehensive wealth, to investigate spend-down behavior among a panel of older households in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from 1998 to 2006. Our analysis indicates that for most retired households, comprehensive wealth balances decline much more slowly than their remaining life expectancies, so that the predominate trend is for real annualized wealth to rise significantly with age over the course of retirement. Comparing the estimated age profiles for annualized wealth with profiles simulated from several different life-cycle models, we find that a model that takes into account uncertain longevity, random medical expenses, and intended bequests lines up best with the broad patterns of rising annualized wealth in the HRS.

But there is no consensus in the literature as to the labour market consequences of such job choice by unemployed individuals. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we investigate the implications of the initial job-finding strategies pursued by the jobless for their short- and medium-term employment stability. At first sight, it appears that taking an offer of regular employment provides the greatest degree of employment continuity for the jobless. However, closer inspection indicates that the jobless who take up atypical employment are not only more likely to be employed 1 month and 1 year later than those who continue to search, but also to enjoy employment continuity that is not less favourable than that offered by regular, open-ended employment.","[Surfield, C.

While gravity variables explain most of the variation of FDI inflows, the bilateral effective average tax rate (beatr) is roughly equally important to other cost-related factors. The semi-elasticity of FDI with respect to taxes is about -4.3. This value is above those of earlier studies in absolute terms and can partly be attributed to using the beatr instead of the statutory tax rate. Our results indicate that tax-lowering strategies of CEEC governments seem to have an important impact on foreign firms location decisions.","[Bellak, Christian; Leibrecht, Markus] Univ Econ & BA, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",,"Bellak, C (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & BA, Augasse 2-6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",christian.bellak@wu-wien.ac.at,,,,,,,37,70,87,3,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

For this purpose New Keynesians applied reductionism characteristic of the model of perfect competition. Simultaneously, New Keynesian models reveal different systemic imperfections contradictory to the idea of representative agent. Simple aggregation of (incomparable by assumption) individual results seems to be an obvious paradox. New Keynesian theoretical constructions were divided into three groups: 1) imperfect competition models and heterogeneity of agents, goods and/or transactions; 2) models of heterogeneity between homogenous groups of agents; 3) models of continuum of homogenous agents. Against this background it was shown that reductionism misrepresented the core of Keynesian thought and deprived it of its originality and distinction as compared to the classical approach.","Uniwersytet Ekon Poznaniu, Katedra Teorii & Hist Ekon, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Bludnik, I (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekon Poznaniu, Katedra Teorii & Hist Ekon, Poznan, Poland.",izabela.bludnik@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,0,Polskie Towarzystwo Ekonomiczne,Warszawa,"ul.

We base our index on best practice using a number of widely recognised sources. Using hand-collected publicly available data for 1999 and 2007, we calculate a corporate governance score for every listed company. Comparing the scores, we find an overall improvement in corporate governance during the period, which coincided with Estonia's accession to the EU. We find evidence that some corporate governance practices are better in cross-listed firms and those which were already in existence in 1989 and which were subsequently privatised.

We consider a straightforward extension of Laffont and Tirole's model that admits optimal contracts of the forms that prevail in practice.

The main objective of the article is to examine free circulation of labour five years after the first round of EU enlargement. Although the second round of 2007 brought about also important changes, time is too short to analyse their trends. Therefore, the main focus is on immigration pattern of the 8 East-European Member States to those destinations, where as a result of their 'open door policy', the inflow was substantial, i.e. Ireland and the UK. Up to 2007 major impact on overall labour market outcomes in the host economies could not be found (for example, Irish data confirmed that in the first years of 2000s immigration was primarily demand-driven). It remains to be seen, however, what the impacts of the current economic and financial crisis would be.

A decline was observed in the differential, mainly driven by an increasing percentage of women holding a college degree. However, there is a persistent, if not increasing, wage gap which cannot be explained by observed productivity characteristics ( discrimination component), this being especially important among high paid women without college degree. This fact contributed to reinforce the well known glass ceilings phenomenon among these females. On the contrary, discrimination appeared to decline among women holding a university degree, as well as among low paid female workers, mitigating the sticky floors problem in this last case.","[Gradin, Carlos; del Rio, Coral] Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Gradín, C (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain.",,"del Rio, Coral/M-5560-2019; GRADIN, CARLOS/AAH-9326-2019","del Rio, Coral/0000-0002-3173-3624; GRADIN, CARLOS/0000-0001-7744-0707",,,,,40,8,8,0,11,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2009,,189,,,,,9,46,,,,,,38,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,472US,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268158500001,0

RD spillovers weighted by the distance and the volume of trade flows between regions cause positive effects on a region's patents. However, distance matters more than the intensity of trade flows and the RD spillover effects between regions are bounded: spillovers from closer regions perform better than spillovers from distant regions.

The dynamics of self-employment varies between areas characterized by different labour market conditions, entrepreneurial traditions and other structural factors. This article analyses self-employment spells in Finland with a large register-based data set from the period 1987 to 2002. The main aim is to investigate the role of region-specific factors as compared with individual-specific and other factors on the duration of self-employment spells. First, the descriptive analysis shows that the exit rates from self-employment and the length of self-employment spells depend upon location (urban versus rural area) and the cyclical trends in the economy. Second, self-employment duration is modelled using discrete time survival analysis. It is found that rural areas have significantly lower exit rates in the first years of self-employment than urban areas.","[Haapanen, Mika; Tervo, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla,"Haapanen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, POB 35, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",mphaapan@econ.jyu.fi,"Haapanen, Mika/M-6646-2019","Haapanen, Mika/0000-0003-2964-3352; Tervo, Hannu/0000-0002-2979-994X",,,,,33,43,49,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This lag-choosing procedure has been suggested by Hatemi-J (1999). The results based on the Monte Carlo simulations show that combining the LR test with SBC and HQC causes a substantial increase in the success rate of choosing the optimal lag order compared to cases when only SBC or HQC are used. This appears to be the case irrespective of homoscedasticity or conditional heteroscedasticity properties of the error-term in small sample sizes.

As in the literature, when all firms are exporters in the pre- and post-formation, bilateralism can be an equilibrium outcome.

Methodologically, the paper makes an interdisciplinary approach, in a post-modern view on the trade relations, considering the European issues of the knowledge based economy. It grounds on the fact that the industrial revolutions are facts in the history of the mankind economy, and the new economy passed from the production optics to the service optics: from a few decades we speak about the service revolution. Globalization is also a service revolution, not a new industrial one. The industrial revolutions were the ground for those evolutions, but they already passed. The paper assumes a larger point of view, but also based on a marketing approach, and the ethical valences are reminded for economists, in opposition with the traditional productivity approach of the market. The indicator and principle of servicity that we are pointing out is focused on intellectual (immaterial) factor can be applied at firms' level and also for macroeconomic government. This is a base also for developments on economic growth, seeing growth as being better induced by amplifying immaterial resources, rather than growing the material ones, like in the traditional industrial view; just novelty and innovation are the real plus of utility and surplus of values. Conclusions are in the field of the knowledge society. An important challenge of our times is making companies to be responsible: it is passing to the servicity optics.","[Jivan, Alexandru] W Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ Sci, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,,alexandrujivan@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,150,157,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS68,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287983800022,0

In most countries, the evidence indicates the existence of a kinked supply curve, which implies that positive demand shocks feed predominantly into prices while negative demand shocks mainly affect output. This suggests that the high variability of aggregate demand in Caribbean countries, frequently exposed to shocks, tends to create an upward bias on inflation and a downward bias on real output growth, on average, over time. The analysis highlights the benefits of eliminating structural rigidities responsible for the kinked nature of the supply curve, and points to the dangers of pro-cyclical macroeconomic policies.","IMF, Western Hemisphere Dept, Caribbean Div 2, Washington, DC USA",International Monetary Fund,"Kandil, M (通讯作者)，IMF, Western Hemisphere Dept, Caribbean Div 2, Washington, DC USA.",mkandil@imf.org,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,3,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

This study confirms this view for the U. S.; for the U. S. economy as a whole the distortion of location choice appears to be small. However, for the four percent or so of Americans induced, by regional differences in fiscal policy, to relocate, the location distortion may range from .5 to 1.5 percent of the present value of their lifetime consumption - which is not small. In addition, the results suggest that location distortions rise geometrically with the size of regional fiscal differences.","[Raffelhueschen, Bernd; Hagist, Christian] Univ Freiburg, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Kotlikoff, Laurence J.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",University of Freiburg; Boston University,"Raffelhüschen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",bernd.raffelhueschen@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,,"Hagist, Christian/0000-0002-6322-3178",,,,,32,0,0,0,2,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2009,,189,,,,,47,79,,,,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,472US,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268158500002,0

With loans accounting for the largest share of the assets of Lithuanian banks, the credit risk is the main individual source of risk. With the current recession of the world economy and the respective situation in Lithuania, when the economy of the country started to recede at the end of 2008, it is obvious that in the future the processes of development of economy of Lithuania will surely be a major influence on the credit risk and results of activities of the bank system of the country, therefore evaluation of this effect under current conditions becomes critical. The importance of research of the influence of macroeconomic processes on the sorts of risks incurred by the bank sector is also proved by the abundance of theoretical research. Testing of the credit risk of the Lithuanian bank sector upon change of risk factors is carried out combining the models used in research performed by M Sorge (2004), M A. Segoviano Basurto, P. Padilla (2007) and other scientists. The research covers five phases: the first phase - modeling of macroeconomic scenarios performing an analysis of the current macroeconomic situation of the country, analyzing expert evaluations and establishing the main risk factors. During the second phase indicators describing the quality of bank loan portfolio are evaluated performing an evaluation of the current quality of loan portfolio and calculating the probability of default according to loan sectors. The third phase covers the establishment of macroeconomic indicators influencing the change of the probability of default and the net profit of banks by selecting macroeconomic indicators that can influence the change of the probability of default according to loan sectors and the net profit of banks, by eliminating the seasonal fluctuations of the selected indicators, by evaluating correlation between macroeconomic indicators and the probability of default as well as the net profit, by defining the parameters of explanatory macroeconomic variables, by employing the model of linear regression and verifying reliability. The fourth phase is the research of the influence of macroeconomic scenarios on the credit risk of the bank sector by providing a prognosis of explanatory macroeconomic variables under the formulated macroeconomic scenarios and evaluating the influence of the macroeconomic scenarios on the probability of default according to loan sectors and the net profit of banks. The research is completed with a prognosis of the reserves accumulated by banks for covering the probable losses on the basis of different scenarios: scenario 1- expensive loans, i.e. the rate of interest for loans in litas remains very high, scenario 2 dropping real estate prices. Evaluation of the credit risk of the bank sector combining the models created by M Sorge (2004) & M A. Segoviano Basurto, P. Padilla (2007) helps to raise the most relevant questions of the macroeconomic state for the current period, and the integration of the analysis of the indicators of financial stability into the critical testing of the bank system and drawing up of macroeconomic prognosis helps to form an efficient future activity strategy for the bank sector or an individual financial institution. The results of the research showed that in case the macroeconomics of the country develops according to scenario 2 the Lithuanian bank system would face deficit of capital for coveringthe probable losses, therefore the banks of the country should accumulate more capital in order to be able to avoid such risk in the future.","[Lakstutiene, Ausrine; Breiteryte, Aiste; Rumsaite, Dalia] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Lakstutiene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ausrine.lakstutiene@ktu.lt; aistiki7@yahoo.com; dalia.rumsaite@ktu.lt,,,,,,,42,5,5,0,9,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

A static, computable general equilibrium trade model with explicit representation of agricultural production and energy use is used to simulate a series of new scenarios in which 1997 baseline import tax and export subsidy trade barrier equivalents are scaled back. Findings indicate that with trade liberalization agricultural output declines, energy use increases, and carbon emissions rise. Global welfare rises revealing an overall increase in efficiency; however, gains to poorer nations come at the expense of richer nations. An increase in the use of polluting inputs such as coal in developing countries suggests poorer nations will risk environmental degradation with the lowering of trade barriers.","[Lee, Donna J.] ENTRIX Inc, Nat Resource & Environm Management Consultants, Gainesville, FL USA; [Zhang, Jian] Univ Hawaii Econ Res Org, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI USA",Cardno Entrix Inc.,"Lee, DJ (通讯作者)，ENTRIX Inc, Nat Resource & Environm Management Consultants, Gainesville, FL USA.",dlee@ENTRIX.com,,,,,,,26,6,6,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Between-group inequality increased in the 1990s as clerical wages grew slowly, whereas blue collars' wages remained nearly constant. Within-group inequality increased only if measured by daily wages. The covariance structure analysis shows that inequality comes from persistent differentials among older workers and from high income volatility for younger cohorts. Within inequalities in office and manual workers are driven by the growth of permanency for the older cohorts (individual abilities, say experience, matter more) and by the growth of income volatility for the younger cohorts (luck in the labour market). Within each group, low paid workers during their career acquire earning gains for their abilities and reduce differentials with respect to high paid workers.","[Lilla, Marco; Staffolani, Stefano] Univ Politecn, Ancona, Italy",,"Lilla, M (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn, Ancona, Italy.",m.lilla@univpm.it,,"staffolani, stefano/0000-0003-2504-9145",,,,,34,6,6,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By pointing to the structural complexity of small arms supply chains, it highlights challenges that multiple channels of supply pose for governments seeking to curb the flow of small arms into illicit stocks.","[Markowski, Stefan; Koorey, Stephanie; Hall, Peter] Australian Def Acad, Univ New S Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Brauer, Jurgen] Augusta State Univ, James M Hull Coll Business, Augusta, GA USA; [Markowski, Stefan; Koorey, Stephanie; Hall, Peter] Univ New S Wales, Australian Def Acad, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Brauer, Jurgen] Augusta State Univ, James M Hull Coll Business, Augusta, GA USA",Australian Defense Force Academy; University of New South Wales Sydney; University System of Georgia; Augusta University; Australian Defense Force Academy; University of New South Wales Sydney; University System of Georgia; Augusta University,"Markowski, S (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Def Acad, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",s.markowski@adfa.edu.au,,"Brauer, Jurgen/0000-0002-6316-9271",,,,,29,12,12,3,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

In particular, they are strongly specialized in self-contained sectors. Recent economic literature has shown that institutions contribute to explaining this pattern. In this paper, we argue that the degree of self-containment itself is endogenous to institutions. Ceteris paribus a given sector will therefore have different levels of interactions with the rest of the economy across countries depending on the quality of institutions. We provide supportive evidence using a simultaneous equation approach on data on sectoral trade, country-specific input-output linkages, and institutional strength.","[Martincus, Christian Volpe] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Gallo, Andres] Univ N Florida, Coggin Coll Business, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA",Inter-American Development Bank; State University System of Florida; University of North Florida,"Martincus, CV (通讯作者)，Inter Amer Dev Bank, Stop W0610,1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",christianv@iadb.org; agallo@unf.edu,,"Gallo, Andres/0000-0003-4643-8107",,,,,45,8,8,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,,2009,62.0,1,,,,,129,149,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00427.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,395GK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262512400007,0

Consequently, this has increased the concentration of the most deprived households in the worst urban neighbourhoods. The UK Governments have attempted to tackle the physical, social and economic consequences of these changes through a variety of mechanisms and policy initiatives with varying degrees of success. The current objective can be interpreted as an attempt to implement regeneration projects or create sustainable communities/places through multi-agency or partnership programmes. The nature and extent of urban problems are now very well documented; there has been a considerable learning process in the development of different urban regeneration programmes. Over the 20th and the beginning of 21st centuries, the nature of urban regeneration policy has changed direction several times and has applied different focuses. Today, a sustainable community is a key issue in an ambitious Government programme umbrella. As an objective of the present programme, the UK Government introduced the Sustainable Community Plan in 2003, describing a vision of how our communities are to be developed over next 20 years economically, socially and environmentally, while respecting the needs of future generations. The paper assesses how closely the Regeneration Programme is aligned to the Sustainable Communities Plan. The research within several surveys focuses on sustainable communities and urban regeneration, both have certain parallels and functional overlaps.","[McDonald, Sally] Halton Borough Council, Kingsway WA8 7QF, Widnes, England; [Malys, Naglis] Univ Manchester, MIB, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England; [Maliene, Vida] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Fac Technol & Environm, Sch Built Environm, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England",University of Manchester; Liverpool John Moores University,"McDonald, S (通讯作者)，Halton Borough Council, Kingsway WA8 7QF, Widnes, England.",v.maliene@ljmu.ac.uk,"Malys, Naglis/Y-6961-2018","Malys, Naglis/0000-0002-5010-310X",,,,,26,63,70,4,57,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-8619,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Opportunities for regulatory capture exist when independent regulators are vulnerable to political pressure. There is therefore a case for external multilateral policy restraint to deter policymakers from reneging on policies. This study estimates the impact of the telecommunications commitments of the WTO on a panel data set of 160 developing countries ( including 26 small island developing states) during the period 1995-2006. Preliminary evidence is that the credibility of telecommunications reform in small island developing states is enhanced via commitments to WTO telecommunications agreements that lock in domestic reforms. No evidence was found that signing on to bilateral investment treaties enhanced the credibility of telecommunications reform in small island developing states.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Ofa, SV (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"'Ofa, Siope/A-7080-2009","'Ofa, Siope/0000-0001-8016-6913",,,,,62,1,1,0,4,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

Taking the capital stock destruction and total factor productivity (TFP) as given, a standard neoclassical optimal growth model can account for the growth patterns of postwar Japanese capital stock, output, consumption, and investment. The decline in labor during the rapid growth period can be attributed to an income effect that occurs as household consumption rises above its subsistence level in this period.","Sophia Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Sophia University,"Otsu, K (通讯作者)，Sophia Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",k-otsu@sophia.ac.jp,,,,,,,22,4,4,0,4,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

This confirms that it is essential to include adjustment costs in the empirical analysis of RD productivity, as suggested by Jones and Williams (1998) and Comin (2002, 2004).","[Romero-Jordan, Desiderio] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain; [Felix Sanz-Sanz, Jose] Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Alvarez-Ayuso, Inmaculada] Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Complutense University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Romero-Jordán, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain.",desiderio.romero@urjc.es,"romero-jordán, desiderio/L-4219-2014; romero-jordán, desiderio/AAZ-2424-2020; SANZ-SANZ, JOSE FELIX/H-8042-2015; ALVAREZ AYUSO, INMACULADA/K-5808-2014","romero-jordán, desiderio/0000-0002-5699-5364; SANZ-SANZ, JOSE FELIX/0000-0002-5633-8807; ALVAREZ AYUSO, INMACULADA/0000-0003-0495-623X",,,,,22,1,1,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Export development has contributed significantly in terms of capital inflows, employment, expansion of industry and widening the production base. Export has also allowed domestic industries to achieve some economies of scale, which otherwise would not have been possible due to the limited domestic market size. Nowadays the results, changes and dynamics of foreign trade are best indices to evaluate capabilities of national companies to compete in open global economy. Lithuanian industry restructuring process, forced by global market competition and economic integration to European Union, presented the market failures and imperfections in the industry of Lithuania, especially in the areas of management, progress of science and technique, information technologies and communications. Lithuanian industry does not have higher technologies in such level as developed countries. The significance of low value-added industries in Lithuania is obvious, nevertheless, performance of relatively high-value added productions is important for improving export development in the future. In considering results of restructuring of industry, the most common approach is to evaluate the degree of export specialization of the country and main changes of export volumes. One of the most applied tools to measure the export specialization of industry has been the revealed comparative advantage index (RCA), suggested by Balassa (1965), which represents foreign trade relative prices and prevailing factor as well product market distortions. Large differences in country sizes can cause problems when applying the RCA across countries, for instance, if export of particular commodity forms a very large share of total domestic export, but forms a very small component of total world export, extremely high indicator values will be recorded. Such modified indices are presented in modern theories. This paper presents Lithuanian export competitiveness in 2000-2007 with trade based modified indices of revealed comparative advantage. Lithuanian export competitiveness is also compared with other small Baltic states: Latvia and Estonia. Results of RCA study reveal competitive advantage in several commodities. This paper analyses the changes in the pattern of Baltic States export specialization and provides an analysis of the shifting export specialization at product category level and links this analysis to the export potential. In the presence of growing trade liberalization, competitive pressures, and the changing structure of world demand, it is important to reassess the factors that influence the export competitiveness.","Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Saboniene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",Asta.Saboniene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,30,44,45,1,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The results show that China urban medical insurance system is facing serious liability risk and a huge financial deficit may appear in the future, which will affect the sustainability of our health care system. Then we propose several strategies to minimize the liability risk, such as turning the system from pay-as-you-go system into partial accumulation system , delaying the retirement age and raising the contribution rate for the medical insurance fund.

In particular, the alternatives and choice of a respondent in a real-world setting are observed, and the respondent is asked whether he/she would choose the same alternative or switch to another alternative if the attributes of the chosen alternative were less desirable in ways specified by the researcher and/or the attributes of non-chosen alternatives were more desirable in specified ways. This construction, called statedpreference off revealed-preference (SP-off-RP), is intended to increase the realism of the stated-preference task, relative to standard SP exercises, but creates endogeneity. In this paper, we present a series of Monte Carlo exercises that explore estimation on this type of data, using an estimator that accounts for the endogeneity. The results indicate that, when the variance in the processing error by respondents is the same for SP-off-RP data as for standard SP data, the two solicitation methods provide about the same level of efficiency in estimation, even though the SP-off-RP data contain endogeneity that the estimator must handle while the SP data do not involve endogeneity. For both solicitation methods, efficiency rises, as expected, as the variance of the processing error decreases. These results imply that, if respondents are able to answer SP-off-RP questions more accurately than standard SP questions (and hence have lower variance of processing error), then SP-off-RP data are more efficient that standard SP data. This implication needs to be viewed cautiously, since (i) the actual processing error for each solicitation method is not measured in the current study, and (ii) the results are for the specific data generation processes that are used in the Monte Carlo exercises.","[Train, Kenneth E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wilson, Wesley W.] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Oregon,"Train, KE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",train@econ.berkeley.edu; wwilson@uoregon.edu,"Wilson, Wesley W/A-4256-2013",,Navigation and Economics Technology Program of the Institute for Water Resources,Navigation and Economics Technology Program of the Institute for Water Resources,The authors gratefully acknowledge research support from the Navigation and Economics Technology Program of the Institute for Water Resources.,,17,28,32,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

The analysis suggests the greater the density of SOEs present in a province, the more they enjoy favouritism, the lower is the proportion of bank loans that go to private companies, and the longer it takes for private firms to get access to land. There is also a negative correlation between SOE growth and private sector growth. But most importantly, the greater the density of SOEs in a particular province, the lower the GDP (and GDP per capita) growth recorded by that province.

The study finds that, compared with non-military spending, military spending exerts only a minimal positive impact on real GDP. Over a 10-year period, a 1% increase in non-military spending increases GDP by 1.6%.

Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) specification with a time-dependent parameter model is used to obtain three types of inflation uncertainties, namely, impulse uncertainty, structural uncertainty and steady-state uncertainty. It has been observed that the impulse uncertainty has negative but the structural uncertainty has positive impact on both short-term and long-term interest rates. Both of these effects are statistically significant. The influence of steady-state uncertainty on interest rates is positive, but the level of significance depends on the inclusion of output gap. Without the inclusion of output gap, the effect is insignificant, whereas the effect becomes significant when output gap is introduced.","[Yuksel, E.] Cankaya Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-06530 Ankara, Turkey; [Akdi, Y.] Ankara Univ, Dept Stat, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Cankaya University; Ankara University,"Yuksel, E (通讯作者)，Cankaya Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-06530 Ankara, Turkey.",yuksel@cankaya.edu.tr,"Akdi, Yılmaz/AAG-9276-2020; Yüksel Haliloğlu, Ebru/AHH-2914-2022","Akdi, Yılmaz/0000-0003-0188-0970; Yuksel Haliloglu, Ebru/0000-0001-8267-0339",,,,,44,1,1,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

By a strategic approach starting from the HEROM econometric model (the Romanian version of the HERMIN model) the study tries to assess the macroeconomic effects of structural funds on foreign trade in cases of different absorption rates, finding that these funds have a stronger impact on export growth as compared to that of imports.

Industries where import tariffs have been reduced the most have experienced the highest increase in specialization. Moreover, trade liberalization has helped India improve its comparative advantage in industries with medium-to high-technology content, as well as in some cif the industries enjoying the most robust growth in global demand.

The risk premium on foreign loans depends on the debtincome ratio. We show that an increase in the rate of an ITC leads to an increase in aggregate consumption, capital accumulation, foreign debt and output in the long run. Despite the fact that there is insignificant long-run effect, employment exhibits significant transitional dynamics. Moreover, our results show that the accumulation of foreign debt exhibits non-monotonic adjustment. Particularly, an increase in the ITC leads to a current account deficit followed by a surplus. Along with this non-monotonicity, our model also explains the positive correlation between savings and investment during the transitional periods.

We first show that the prevalence of an oppositional culture in the minority group cannot always be sustained in equilibrium. Indeed, because the size of the majority group is larger, there is an imposed process of exposition to role models from the majority group that favors the diffusion of mainstream values in the minority community. In spite of this, an oppositional culture in the minority group can nevertheless be sustained in steady state if there is enough cultural segmentation in terms of role models, or if the size of the minority group is large enough, or if the degree of oppositional identity it implies is high enough. We also demonstrate that the higher the level of harassment and the number of racist individuals in the society, the more likely an oppositional minority culture will emerge. We finally show that ethnic identity and socialization effort can be more intense in mixed rather than segregated neighborhoods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This suggests why big-bang reforms that affect only the initial state can fail, while gradualist approaches that can sustain the risk dominance of upholding rules may be more effective.

We have panel data so we can ask how far time invariant unobservables, market ability for short, matters in the determination of earnings. We also have information on whether the individual is own self-employed, self-employed with employees, a private or public sector wage employee and the size of the enterprise in which wage employees work or which the self-employed owns. We find, mirroring work on developed economies, that unobserved individual market ability is by far the most important factor explaining the variance of earnings. With controls for such ability the gap between private wage employment and civil servants is about 50%. With controls for enterprise size we find that wage employees earn the same as the self-employed in both Ghana and Tanzania. Enterprise size matters. At most half of the OLS effect of size on earnings can be explained by unobservable ability. Workers in the largest firms are the high earners with wage rates which exceed those of civil servants. These results all assume exogenous movement. We find evidence that endogeneity bias may be serious and may be understating the extent of both the size effect and the private sector wage (negative) premium. The implications of our results for understanding the nature of formal and informal employment in Africa are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The reason for this is that the competition among poorly diversified interrelated divisions creates incentives for regional leaders to pursue policies that inhibit industrial growth in neighboring regions in order to make their own region look better from the point of view of the center. We use a unique episode in Soviet history, when a traditional Soviet unitary-form (U-form) hierarchy was replaced by a multidivisional-form (M-form) organization, namely, Khrushchev's Sovnarkhoz reform. First, we demonstrate that during this reform regional leaders were subjected to relative performance evaluation, which created incentives to generate industrial growth. Second, we show that these career concerns resulted in higher growth in regions with sufficiently diversified and, therefore, self-contained economies, and lower growth in highly specialized regions.

One difference between these two legal origins is the procedure of evidence collection for a trial: It is adversarial in common law and inquisitorial in civil law. The adversarial system delegates the collection of evidence to a larger extent to lawyers than the inquisitorial system does. The paper presents a model of law and finance in which investors use courts to enforce their financial contracts with entrepreneurs. Investors are willing to lend more if courts collect evidence more efficiently. Financial markets are more developed in the adversarial than in the inquisitorial system if investors are richer than entrepreneurs or if lawyers are more productive than judges.

Data based on consistent definitions and measurement methods that have recently become available are used to that end. In addition, we analyse the impact of new policy initiatives to introduce market-based instruments and new institutions to address land degradation and water scarcity problems. We find that the decline in cultivated area has accelerated in the beginning of the new century. Ecological recovery programs, not urbanization and industrialization, are the major factors causing this decline. Ecological recovery programs are also a major force behind the increase in forest land area and the reduction of water erosion. Modest successes can be observed in the protection of wetlands and (until the mid-1980s) for the average quality of cultivated land. On the other hand, degradation of natural grassland and wind erosion have become much more severe in recent decades. In northern China, particularly in the 341 (Hai and Luan, Huai and Huang) river basins, the availability of water has tightened. Groundwater tables have fallen considerably in the Hai river basin, because farmers increasingly rely on groundwater for irrigation. Evidence on other parts of northern China is mixed. Pollution of surface water is getting worse since the beginning of the 1990s in two major lakes in southern China and until recently in the rivers in northern China. Water quality problems in the larger rivers in southern China are less severe and getting less. These problems are to a large extent caused by agriculture-based non-point source pollution, especially in the major lakes and reservoirs. The sloping land conversion program, water pricing, and the establishment of water user associations and payments for environmental service projects are used as cases to examine the introduction of market-based instruments and new institutions. We argue that less government interference in the implementation of these instruments and institutions is likely to enhance ecological as well the economic benefits. Moreover, supportive measures to improve the functioning of land and labor markets are usually needed to ensure the sustainability of the impact of interventions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

First, they target the consensus issue in a way that tends to underestimate the agreement among economists, and second, they fail to offer information about how much economists' agreed - upon position matches the actual policy, which is what, ultimately, most economists care for most. In this paper, I introduce a redesigned survey that attempts to remedy both shortcomings at once by asking about preferred direction of policy changes in selected areas. Based on data from such survey undertaken among economists in the Czech Republic, I specifically ask about 1) the degree of consensus, and 2) the existence of a gap between such consensus and actual policy. The analysis of the survey data lends support to notions that 1) there is a solid, though not universally convincing consensus (regarding policy changes), 2) there is a gap in most areas of policy between what economists see as desirable and what the policy/makers practice.","[St'astny, Dan] Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [St'astny, Dan] NYU, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"St'astny, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",StastnyD@vse.cz,"Stastny, Dan/HTM-1443-2023",,,,,,27,0,0,0,8,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In the long-run health care spending and income are bi-directional Granger causality, while there is uni-directional Granger causality running from relative price to health care spending and income. In addition, we also extend the study to examine the dynamic interaction between the variables in the system through the forecast error variance decomposition and impulse response function analyses. In line with the finding of Granger causality, all the variables behaved endogenously in the long-run.

Discovered through the exploration of this paper, the fact that international trade as a discipline is losing strength in the institutional realm, remains in the domain of its parent discipline's research paradigm, and lacks self-evaluation is noticeable and challenging. Despite the problems and indolence of the current state of the discipline, this paper argues that the contemporary trend of the international trade environment provides a great opportunity to mature the discipline.

Our analyses also show that the impact was transmitted to East Asian industries through triangular trade, in which Chinese mainland imports parts and components from neighboring East Asian economies and then exports final products to the US and EU markets.

Given the current political debate on this issue, we try to shed light on employment and retirement behaviour of Austrian couples when income support is provided and pension benefits are reduced. Using a sample of married couples with both partners aged 50-65, we find that the proposed reform increases the labour supply of middle-income men whereas the effects on women are weaker. However, somehow surprisingly, we find that these reforms have an increasing effect on unemployment/inactivity probabilities which in turn is outweighed by a decreasing effect on the retirement probabilities in case of women.

This paper provides a unifying framework allowing to study the wage implications of multinational enterprise (MNE) activities, pointing to the importance of controlling for both labor market imperfections and productivity spillovers from foreign to local firms. Results show that increased MNE activities increase average wages in the local economy while contributing to a larger wage dispersion between the MNE and local firms. While the results pertaining to average wages depends heavily on the frictions in the labor market, how much the wage dispersion alters also depends on the extent of productivity spillovers from the MNEs to the local firms and the complementarity between domestic and foreign capital.

Giving the existence of proper system wise medians of the residuals from different equations, we apply the weighted median regression with the weights obtained from the covariance matrix of the equations obtained from ordinary SURE method. The benefit of this model in our case is that the SURE estimators utilise the information present in the cross regression (or equations) error correlation and hence more efficient than other estimation methods like the OLS method. The Seemingly Unrelated Median Regression Equations (SUMRE) models produce results that are more robust than the usual SURE or single equations OLS estimation when the distributions of the dependent variables are not normally distributed or the data are associated with outliers. Moreover, the results are also more efficient than is the cases of single equations median regressions when the residuals from the different equations are correlated. A theorem is derived and indicates that even if there is no statistically significant correlation between the equations, using SUMRE model instead of SURE models will not damage the estimation of parameters.

Suitable modifications of the algorithm allow to deal with the (non-RE) case in which the policymaker and the private sector hold different beliefs or probabilities over regime change.

To answer this question, we develop a two stage-two country game where environmental regulators set the amount of emission allowances and the level of monitoring effort to achieve full compliance while the regulated firms choose actual emissions and the number of permits to be held. Various, possibly conflicting, spillovers between countries arise in a decentralized setting. We show that decentralization is socially harmful if no asymmetry among institutional settings is introduced and can be suboptimal even when decentralization features lower monitoring costs than a centralized setting. Lower monitoring costs are therefore necessary, but not sufficient, to justify decentralization. Also, our analysis reveals that welfare can be higher under decentralization even if the corresponding environmental quality is worse than under centralization. Indeed, better environmental quality is sufficient but not necessary for higher welfare under decentralization.

Moreover, the possibility of investment in a bypass network by the entrant has a positive effect on the incumbent's incentive to upgrade quality. We show that a regulator cannot achieve the first best with a constant access tariff. If he wants to design an alternative welfare improving access tariff, he should set an access fee increasing (decreasing) in quality if the business-stealing effect of quality upgrades is weak (strong). The analysis suggests that if the entrant's investment costs are declining or its market share is increasing over time, it is not always optimal to require the incumbent to lease facilities at cost-based prices.","[Vareda, Joao] Autoridade Concorrencia, P-1050037 Lisbon, Portugal; [Vareda, Joao] Inst Super Tecn, Inst Sistemas & Robot, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Autoridade da Concorrencia; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Vareda, J (通讯作者)，Autoridade Concorrencia, Ave Berna 19, P-1050037 Lisbon, Portugal.",joao.vareda@concorrencia.pt,,"Vareda, Joao/0000-0001-8803-0447",,,,,22,6,6,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

To do this, I use as a natural experiment a reform implemented in Colombia during the mid-1990s. In particular I employ a differences-in-differences estimation based on an endogenous switching-regression model that accounts for self-selection into coverage. My results indicate that, for females, a 10% increase in contributions reduces the relative wages of covered workers by 7.2%.

The distinction between these two spaces typically induces non-consequentialist motives. The dynamic derivation of the Sure Thing Principle is studied in this framework. When these two spaces are substantially different, there exists a class of preferences that satisfy dynamic consistency and, at the same time, rationalize violations of the Sure Thing Principle. Consequently, it is possible to use non-expected utility preferences to study problems with dynamic consistency, as long as preferences belong to the previous class and as long as problems refer to information structures, defined as partitions over the set that serves to model events.","Univ Toulouse 1 Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Vergopoulos, V (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse 1 Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA, 1-21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",vassili.vergopoulos@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Once factor income inflows are distinguished from outflows, empirical evidence suggests a non-significant effect of inflows in terms of income smoothing as opposed to a positive and significant role of factor income outflows. Factor income outflows also appear to be robust with respect to positive output shocks, while neither factor inflows nor factor outflows provide insurance against negative output shocks. In terms of the determinants of income smoothing, results indicate that an increase in foreign equity and debt liabilities positively affect the extent of smoothing via factor income outflows. Whereas, contrary to the current literature, an increase in foreign asset holding does not have a positive impact on smoothing via factor income inflows. European investors' tendency of allocating a sizeable portion of their assets within the Euro zone is shown to undermine income smoothing. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, globalization has led to a greater homogenization of status markers across societies. Given severe budget constraints in developing countries and lax enforcement of intellectual property rights, we contend that people are more likely to use deceptive status signaling strategies with a strong desire to keep up with the Joneses located in developed countries. We investigate empirically what strategies are used in Tunisia and France to satisfy some status needs. Using survey data in Tunisia and France, we show that Tunisian students are more likely to adopt deceptive status signals by consuming fakes compared to French students.

The analysis focuses on the role of learning. Economies of diversification are defined based on a certainty equivalent and its decomposition into three components: expected profit (capturing scope effects), the risk premium (measuring the cost of risk aversion), and the value of information associated with learning. For each component, the influence of scale effects, trans-ray concavity effects, and income effects on economies of diversification are examined. By integrating risk, scope and the role of information, the analysis provides new insights into the microeconomics of diversification. While scope economies and risk aversion can provide general incentives for diversification, we argue that information and learning can give incentives to specialize.

It also covers contributions that highlight the crucial role of budget institutions in determining the extent to which the political motivations to generate deficits are indeed translated into poor fiscal outcomes.

This article argues that the Baltic States can potentially better share their transition experience and increase their development impact by engaging in development cooperation in partnership with other donors and by participating in policy dialogue and budget support when possible and appropriate.

The main finding of the study is that the inflation threshold effect is highly significant and robust in China. Above the 2.50 percent threshold, every 1-percentage point increase in the inflation rate impedes economic growth by 0.61 percent; below this threshold, every 1-percentage point increase in the inflation rate stimulates growth by 0.53 percent. This indicates that high inflation harms economic growth, whereas moderate inflation benefits growth.

The diversity of participants as well as the occurrence of extreme socio-political events yields a market with complex price evolution. This paper uses entropy methods to monitor the evolution of crude oil price movements. As the complexity of the price can depend of the time horizon, entropy computations are performed for different time scales via low-pass filtering of the price difference dynamics. The results are interpreted in term of relative market efficiency concepts in the sense that high entropy values should be related to a more complex and, hence, less predictable market evolution. It is shown that the highest market efficiency is found for small time scales up to one or two weeks. The multiscale entropy pattern for high time scales, longer than one quarter, is interesting as it shows alternating periods of high and low entropy levels. Interestingly, this alternating pattern has a dominant spectral component of about 4.3 years, which could be related to macroeconomic (Kitchin) business cycles. It is shown that U.S. recessions in the recent 25 years are coincident with periods of reduced entropy levels, meaning that during economic downturn the long-run market complexity is drastically reduced. The possible effects of extreme events (e.g., Iraq War) are analyzed in terms of the relative market efficiency, suggesting that some events have affected the short-term but not the long-term market complexity. Overall, these results show that methods based on entropy concepts can shed light on the structure of crude oil markets as well as on its link to macroeconomic conditions and socio-political extreme events.

We compare the heavily bombed districts to other districts controlling for district demographic and geographic characteristics, and use an instrumental variable approach exploiting distance to the 17th parallel demilitarized zone.

Using innovation accounting in a structural vector autoregressive model, it is established that monetary authorities in Malawi employ hybrid operating procedures and pursue both price stability and high growth and employment objectives. Two operating targets of monetary policy are identified, viz., bank rate and reserve money, and it is demonstrated that the former is a more effective measure of monetary policy than the latter. The study also illustrates that bank lending, exchange rates and aggregate money supply contain important additional information in the transmission process of monetary policy shocks in Malawi. Furthermore, it is shown that the floatation of the Malawi Kwacha in February 1994 had considerable effects on the country's monetary transmission process. In the post-1994 period, the role of exchange rates became more conspicuous than before although its impact was weakened, and the importance of aggregate money supply and bank lending in transmitting monetary policy impulses was enhanced. Overall, the monetary transmission process evolved from a weak, blurred process to a somewhat strong, less ambiguous mechanism.

We examine a setting in which evolution designs agents with utility functions that must mediate intertemporal choices, and in which there is an incentive to condition current utilities on the agent's previous experience.

The extraction of the nonrenewable resources leads to emissions that increase the probability of a catastrophe. We find that, in contrast to the constant-probability case, the endogenous probability of a catastrophe implies that some nonrenewable resources might optimally be left in the ground. The larger the effect of the fossil energy use on the probability of a catastrophe, the fewer nonrenewable resources should be extracted and the earlier should be the switch to the renewable substitute. The richer a country, the earlier it should shift to the energy substitute. In the trade-off between higher consumption and a higher probability of catastrophe, even small probability changes are likely to be more important for the planner than higher consumption.","Banque Cent Luxembourg, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Schumacher, I (通讯作者)，Banque Cent Luxembourg, 2 Blvd Royal, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",ingmar.schumacher@bcl.lu,,"Schumacher, Ingmar/0000-0003-2339-982X",,,,,17,5,5,2,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We find statistically significant positive peer effects that are roughly half as large as the own effect of prior fitness on current fitness.

Moreover, we identify a wide range of empirically relevant cases where Formula Apportionment is superior to Separate Accounting, independent of the magnitude of the concealment cost of profit shifting.

J,"Tatoutchoup, D; Gaudet, G",,,,"Tatoutchoup, Didier; Gaudet, Gerard",,,The impact of recycling on the long-run forestry,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY; DEFORESTATION; LAND,"Interest in recycling of forest products has grown in recent years, one of the goals being to conserve trees or possibly increase their number to compensate for positive externalities generated by the forest and neglected by the market. This paper explores the issue as to whether recycling is an appropriate measure to attain such a goal. We do this by considering the problem of the private owner of an area of land, who, acting as a price taker, decides how to allocate his land over time between forestry and some other use, and at what age to harvest the forest area chosen. Once the forest is cut, he makes a new land allocation decision and replants. He does so indefinitely, in a Faustmann-like framework. The wood from the harvest is transformed into a final product that is partly recycled into a substitute for the virgin wood, so that past output affects the current price. We show that in such a context, increasing the rate of recycling will result in less area being devoted to forestry. It will also have the effect of increasing the harvest age of the forest, as long as the planting cost is positive. The net effect on the flow of virgin wood being harvested to supply the market will as a result be ambiguous. An important point, however, is that recycling will result in fewer trees in the long run, not more. It would therefore be best to resort to other means if the goal is to conserve the area devoted to forestry.","[Tatoutchoup, Didier] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; Univ Montreal, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Tatoutchoup, D (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",gerard.gaudet@umontreal.ca,"Gaudet, Gérard/B-1267-2008","Gaudet, Gerard/0000-0002-6898-0338",,,,,8,5,6,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

We point out that China's current account surplus as a share of global GDP in recent years resembles that of Germany's. Yet, an important difference is that the Euro block's current account inclusive of Germany has overall been balanced, whereas emerging Asia's current account inclusive of China has mostly been characterized by sizable surpluses. We further find that both China and Germany's current account surpluses seem to be accounted for by common factors. However we have reasons to doubt the long run viability of these current account trends in future decades. Demographic transitions in China and Germany are projected to reduce their surpluses, and this effect is stronger for Germany. We also discuss plausible reasons to doubt the extent to which the Euro block will move towards significant surplus in the coming years.","[Aizenman, Joshua; Sengupta, Rajeswari] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Aizenman, Joshua] NBER, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Aizenman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, E2,1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jaizen@ucsc.edu; rsengupt@ucsc.edu,,,,,,,14,11,12,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This provides a simple link between returns to scale in R&D and industry polarization, including shake-outs. A novelty is that exit may be triggered by positive opportunities in a strategic setting.

However, for Australia, the potential welfare gain from risk sharing is almost similar to the gain it obtains if Australia attains full risk sharing with the rest of the OECD countries or with New Zealand alone. We also break down output using the framework of Sorensen and Yosha (1998) to quantify the extent and channels of risk sharing across PICs. For PICs, income-smoothing channels (net factor income and current transfers) play a significant role in buffering the output shock compared to the performance of those channels on smoothing the output shock for OECD countries. Domestic savings also smooth a fair portion of shocks to output, but the extent is much lower compared to that of OECD countries. Further, we analyze the effect of remittances and foreign aid on income smoothing for the PICs excluding Australia and New Zealand. Income smoothing via remittances is highly volatile and significant in recent years, while foreign aid seems to be a stronger and more stable channel for smoothing domestic output shocks for PICs.

We then modify the general model by considering the possibility that recruits with high civilian productivity are also more capable soldiers and find that, under such circumstances, conscription may be a more benign form of manpower mobilization than previously understood.

Even though the technological components of CCS-separation of CO(2) from emissions, transport, and secure storage-are all in use somewhere in the economy, they do not currently function together in the manner required for large-scale CO(2) reduction. The challenge for CCS to be considered commercial is to integrate and scale up these components. Significant challenges remain in growing CCS from the megaton level where it is today to the gigaton level where it needs to be to help mitigate global climate change. These challenges, none of which are showstoppers, include lowering costs, developing needed infrastructure, reducing subsurface uncertainty, and addressing legal and regulatory issues.

We assume that such investments increase the merging parties' marginal cost of production and show that they therefore reinforce the effect of divestitures on post-merger competition. As a consequence, if the competition authority does not take restructuring investments into account while fixing the remedies, the size of the divestiture will be too large and hence over-fix the competition issue.

To this end, we employ a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which public education expenditures, financed by distorting taxes, enhance the productivity of private education choices. We then calculate the welfare implications of competing operating targets using a state-contingent instrument rule for public education spending. Our main findings are: (i) there can be important cyclical effects of different resource allocation policies depending on the operating target used and the degree of macroeconomic uncertainty; (ii) it is important to use an operating target which is as close as possible to the heart of the market imperfection that justifies policy action; (iii) policy action should not be monotonic in the degree of macroeconomic uncertainty.

First it reviews some recent benefit/cost estimates for human capital intervention in LAC, suggesting some investments in which the returns appear quite high. Then it turns over to how much increases in schooling attainment targeted to the poor would reduce poverty and income inequality.

Firms with high-quality products engage in exporting, firms with intermediate-quality products serve the domestic market, and inefficient firms with low-quality products exit the market. Trade liberalization, measured by a reduction in trade costs or a decline in foreign market entry costs, generates a reallocation of resources from low-quality to high-quality products and exit of inefficient firms. However, it has ambiguous effects on the average global quality level, long-run growth, and welfare. An increase in the rate of population growth or in the intensity of trade-related knowledge spillovers accelerates economic growth. The laissez-faire equilibrium is inefficient, and this leaves room for welfare-improving government intervention. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that institutionalized ruling parties allow autocrats to make credible commitments to investors. Such parties promote investment by solving collective-action problems among a designated group, who invest with the expectation that the autocrat will not attempt their expropriation. We derive conditions under which autocrats want to create such parties, and we predict that private investment and governance will be stronger in their presence.

Our results for individual countries suggest that the only country for which exchange rates and stock prices are cointegrated over the entire period is Korea where there is a weak long-run unidirectional Granger causality running from exchange rates to stock prices. Employing the panel LM cointegration test with multiple structural breaks, we find that exchange rates and stock prices are not cointegrated.

We find that in the absence of excuses to stop volunteering, subjects volunteer longer without working less productively.

We find little evidence that gender differences in remittances are attributable to behavioral differences between men and women, and this finding is invariant to whether the homoscedastic or heteroscedastic tobit is used in estimation.","[Niimi, Yoko] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines; [Reilly, Barry] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9RF, E Sussex, England",Asian Development Bank; University of Sussex,"Niimi, Y (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines.",yniimi@adb.org,"Reilly, Barry/AAN-8101-2021","Reilly, Barry/0000-0003-0606-4585",,,,,42,1,2,1,13,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

This article counters by highlighting the primary source of differences between Veblen and Marx: their methods. Veblen's generalized conceptions of monopoly and technology, for example, misread the specificity of the systemic logic of capitalism. These dynamics are fully captured only in Marx's movement from simple, abstract laws to complex, concrete reality, where non-economic factors are not reduced to the economic, but rather intervene at a later moment of the concretization process.","York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Penner, D (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",dpenner@yorku.ca,,,,,,,51,1,1,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

We note that Post-Keynesian Institutionalist theories of financial markets have provided a general theory that has been repeatedly validated by recent real-world events from the stock market bubble and crash of 1987 to the current global financial crisis. After reviewing the psychological and institutional behavioral foundations of the Post Keynesian-Institutionalist theories that are rooted in the analyses of John Maynard Keynes, Paul Davidson, and John Kenneth Galbraith, we explain why developments in behavioral finance appear to have limited potential for making substantive contributions to those behavioral foundations.","[Raines, J.

We show that hosting a mega-event increases exports. This effect is statistically robust, permanent and large; trade is over 20% higher for host countries. Interestingly, unsuccessful bids to host the Olympics have a similar impact on exports. We conclude that the Olympic effect on trade is attributable to the signal a country sends when bidding to host the games, rather than the act of actually holding a mega-event. We develop an appropriate formal model and derive conditions under which liberalising countries will signal through a mega-event bid.","[Rose, Andrew K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Rose, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",arose@haas.berkeley.edu,"Rose, Andrew/I-1578-2014","Rose, Andrew/0000-0003-1100-1212",,,,,16,149,163,4,60,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

This new approach not only captures binary relations between agents but also high-order relations among subsets of them. The model allows us to characterize the minimal structures of cooperation survival in a spatial Prisoners' Dilemma game in a Moore neighborhood and helps explain the existence of persistent islands of cooperation in hostile environments. The dynamic behavior shows an increase in the fraction of cooperators relative to the standard spatial Prisoners' Dilemma game.,"[Urbano, Amparo] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Fac Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Urbano, Amparo] Univ Valencia, ERI CES, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Urbano, A (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Fac Econ, Campus Dels Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain.",amparo.urbano@uv.es,"Urbano, Amparo/F-8534-2016","Urbano, Amparo/0000-0002-2971-9612",,,,,27,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

The empirical evidence suggests that either outcome is possible. This paper surveys a variety of hypotheses and supporting evidence for why some countries benefit and others lose from the presence of natural resources. These include that a resource bonanza induces appreciation of the real exchange rate, deindustrialization, and bad growth prospects, and that these adverse effects are more severe in volatile countries with bad institutions and lack of rule of law, corruption, presidential democracies, and underdeveloped financial systems. Another hypothesis is that a resource boom reinforces rent grabbing and civil conflict especially if institutions are bad, induces corruption especially in nondemocratic countries, and keeps in place bad policies. Finally, resource rich developing economies seem unable to successfully convert their depleting exhaustible resources into other productive assets. The survey also offers some welfare-based fiscal rules for harnessing resource windfalls in developed and developing economies.
