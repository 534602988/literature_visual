The distribution, performance and life time of religions can thus be studied having in mind heterogeneous interacting agent modeling. We present a comprehensive analysis of 58 so-called religions (to be better defined in the main text) as measured through their number of adherents evolutions, between 1900 and 2000, data taken from the World Christian Trends (Barrett and Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30 - AD 2200: Interpreting the Annual Christian Megacensus, William Carey Library, 2001): 40 are considered to be presently growing cases, including 11 turn overs in the twentieth century; 18 are presently decaying, among which 12 are found to have had a recent maximum, in the nineteenth or the twentieth century. The Avrami-Kolmogorov differential equation which usually describes solid state transformations, like crystal growth, is used in each case in order to obtain the preferential attachment parameter introduced previously (Europhys Lett 77:38002, 2007). It is not often found close to unity, though often corresponding to a smooth evolution. However large values suggest the occurrence of extreme cases which we conjecture are controlled by so-called external fields. A few cases indicate the likeliness of a detachment process. We discuss a few growing and decaying religions, and illustrate various fits. Some cases seem to indicate the lack of reliability of the data, but others some marked departure from Avrami law. Whence the Avrami evolution equation might be surely improved, in particular, and somewhat obviously, for the decaying religion cases. We point out two major difficulties in such an analysis: (1) the precise original time of apparition of a religion, (2) the time at which there is a maximum number of adherents, both information being necessary for integrating reliably any evolution equation.","[Ausloos, Marcel; Petroni, Filippo] Univ Liege, GRAPES, B-4000 Liege, Belgium",University of Liege,,marcel.ausloos@ulg.ac.be; fpetroni@gmail.com,"Petroni, Filippo/AAM-5876-2020; Petroni, Filippo/K-3366-2012; Ausloos, Marcel/AAC-8812-2020","Petroni, Filippo/0000-0001-8467-8481; Ausloos, Marcel/0000-0001-9973-0019",,,,,30,3,3,1,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",,,978-4-431-53852-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,289,312,,10.1007/978-4-431-53853-0_15,0.0,,,24,"Business; Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Physics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Physics,BTS33,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000287957900015,0

This is done under two different equivalent martingale measures. We also present a multivariate Levy process where the marginal probability distribution follows a GNIG Levy process. The main contribution is, however, a stochastic process which is characterized by autocorrelation in moments equal and higher than two, here a multivariate specification is provided as well. The main tool for achieving this is to add an integrated Feller square root process to the dynamics of the second moment in a time-deformed Browninan motion.

The concept of temperature in complex socio-economic networks is also introduced as a way of accounting for the external stresses to which such systems are submitted. This external stress can change dramatically the structure of the communities in a network. We analyze here a trade network of countries exporting 'miscellaneous manufactures of metal.' We determine the community structure of this network showing that there are 27 communities with diverse degree of overlapping. When only communities with less than 80% of overlap are considered we found five communities which are well characterized in terms of geopolitical relationships. The analysis of external stress on these communities reveals the vulnerability of the trade network in critical situations, i.e., economical crisis.

The model can be used to describe a long-run cointegrating relationship, the tightness of which varies along with time. Heteroskedasticity in the errors is modeled nonparametrically and is assumed to be generated by a smooth function of time. We show that it can be consistently estimated by the kernel method. Given consistent estimates for error variances, the cointegrating relationship can be efficiently estimated by the usual generalized least squares (GLS) correction for heteroskedastic errors. It is shown that the U. S. money demand function, both for M1 and M2, is well fitted to such a cointegrating model with an increasing trend in error variances. Moreover, we found that the bilateral purchasing power parities among the leading industrialized countries such as the United States, Japan, Canada, and the United Kingdom have been changed somewhat conspicuously over the past thirty years. In particular, it appears that they all have generally become more tightened during the period.","[Kim, Chang Sik] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Joon Y.] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Kim, CS (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",skimcs@skku.edu,,,Korea Research Foundation,Korea Research Foundation(National Research Foundation of Korea),"This is a substantially revised and extended version of the article written by the second author and Jonghan Park, the first draft of which was completed in 1999 and circulated under the title Longrun Relationships Evolving over Time.

Six such companies in pharmaceutical industry in China were identified. Based on the annual reports of these companies, data envelope analysis (DEA) is carried out to explore the function of co-opetition strategy on their R&D efficiency and productivity growth. The results show that more than half of the samples reach efficiency and 66.7 percent of them improve their productivity through cooperating with competitors, which demonstrates that co-opetition strategy can play a significant positive role in improving companies' efficiency and productivity as long as it is properly planned and managed.","[Li Wei] Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Econ & Management, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China; [Li Gen-dao] Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China",Chongqing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Jilin University,"Li, W (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Econ & Management, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China.",,"Li, Gendao/J-1547-2017","Li, Gendao/0000-0002-7518-0080",,,,,28,0,0,0,9,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1586,1593,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100213,0

In OASIS-5, a large pivotal trial in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), subcutaneous fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily was noninferior to subcutaneous enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily (both agents were administered over a mean of about 5 days in combination with antiplatelet therapy) in reducing death or ischaemic events at 9 days, and the efficacy was maintained for up to 6 months (study end). However, fondaparinux was associated with a significantly lower rate of bleeding than enoxaparin in the first 9 days, and at 3 and 6 months. This lower rate of bleeding led to lower long-term mortality and morbidity with fondaparinux than with enoxaparin. In modelled cost-utility analyses conducted from a healthcare payer perspective in Spain, France and the US with a lifetime horizon, fondaparinux once daily was predicted to be cost effective relative to enoxaparin twice daily with regard to the incremental cost per QALY gained. In Spain and the US, fondaparinux dominated enoxaparin (i.e. was less costly and more effective) and, in the French analysis, the incremental cost per QALY gained with fondaparinux versus enoxaparin was well within recommended thresholds. Results of short-term (6-month) cost analyses in the US and France also favoured fondaparinux over enoxaparin. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that base-case conclusions were robust over a range of parameter estimates and assumptions, including plausible variations in baseline risk of a cardiac event or baseline risk of bleeding. In conclusion, in patients with NSTE-ACS receiving antiplatelet therapy, fondaparinux was cost effective relative to enoxaparin in cost-utility analyses in Europe and the US. This cost advantage primarily reflects the lower rate of bleeding with fondaparinux than with enoxaparin and the lower rate of mortality and morbidity over the long term.","[McKeage, Kate; Lyseng-Williamson, Katherine A.] Adis, Wolters Kluwer Business, Auckland 0754, New Zealand",Adis International,"McKeage, K (通讯作者)，Adis, Wolters Kluwer Business, 41 Centorian Dr,Private Bag 65901,Mairangi Bay,N, Auckland 0754, New Zealand.",demail@adis.co.nz,,"Lyseng-Williamson, Katherine/0000-0002-5104-1158",,,,,20,4,5,1,6,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,8,,,,,687,698,,10.2165/11205130-000000000-00000,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,640NZ,20617858.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281059600007,0

In this study, independent but not identically distributed losses are considered. The minimum loss amount is considered increasing over time. A Monte Carlo simulation algorithm is presented and several quantiles are estimated. The same approximation is used for modeling the maximum and aggregate worldwide economy losses caused by very rare and very extreme events such as 9/11, the Russian rouble crisis, and the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.

The economic burden of severe disease is substantial, including hospitalization costs and out-of-pocket expenses. RSV prophylaxis with either RSV immune globulin intravenous (RSV-IGIV) or palivizumab has been shown to be effective in reducing RSV-related hospitalizations. Motavizumab, a new enhanced-potency humanized RSV monoclonal antibody, is presently in clinical trials. RSV-IGIV and palivizumab are associated with high acquisition costs. Cost-effectiveness analyses are therefore of great importance in helping to determine who should receive RSV prophylaxis. Six studies have analysed the cost effectiveness of RSV-IGIV, 14 have analysed the cost effectiveness of palivizumab and five have analysed the cost effectiveness of both agents, two of which directly compared palivizumab with RSV-IGIV. The cost effectiveness of motavizumab has not been studied. Significant variation exists in the modelling used in these analyses. Many studies have examined short-term benefits such as reducing hospitalizations and associated costs, while fewer studies have examined long-term benefits such as QALYs or life-years gained. The payer and society have been the most common perspectives used. The endpoints examined varied and generally did not account for the potential impact of RSV prophylaxis on RSV-related complications such as asthma. While some studies have reported acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios for RSV prophylaxis, the majority failed to show cost savings or cost-effectiveness ratios below commonly accepted thresholds for either RSV-IGIV or palivizumab. Cost effectiveness of RSV prophylaxis tended to be more favourable in populations with specific risk factors, including premature infants weeks' gestational age, and infants or children aged <2 years with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease. Comparing the results of economic analyses of the two agents suggests palivizumab may be the more cost-effective option in the population for which RSV prophylaxis is recommended. Over time, the acquisition cost of RSV prophylaxis agents, a major cost driver, may decrease, and more acceptable outcomes of economic analyses may result. Albeit important, the results of economic analyses are not the only tool that decision makers rely on, as population-specific risk factors, and efficacy and safety data must be considered when developing treatment guidelines and making clinical decisions.","[Prescott, William A., Jr.; Doloresco, Fred; Brown, Jack; Paladino, Joseph A.] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Prescott, William A., Jr.] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Doloresco, Fred; Brown, Jack] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Publ Hlth & Hlth Profess, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Prescott, WA (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, 313 Cooke Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",prescott@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,65,43,48,1,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,4,,,,,279,293,,10.2165/11531860-000000000-00000,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,579AI,20131925.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000276338000002,0

When used as prediction intervals, coverage is poor when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, but improves slowly as sample size increases. We show that prediction intervals estimated by bagging yield much better coverages than the conventional approach, even with low signal-to-noise ratios. We also present a bootstrap method that gives confidence interval estimates for (conditional) expectations of efficiency, and which have good coverage properties that improve with sample size. In addition, researchers who estimate PSF models typically reject models, samples, or both when residuals have skewness in the wrong direction, i.e., in a direction that would seem to indicate absence of inefficiency. We show that correctly specified models can generate samples with wrongly skewed residuals, even when the variance of the inefficiency process is nonzero. Both our bagging and bootstrap methods provide useful information about inefficiency and model parameters irrespective of whether residuals have skewness in the desired direction.","[Wilson, Paul W.] Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Simar, Leopold] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Clemson University; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Wilson, PW (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, 222 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",pww@clemson.edu,,"Wilson, Paul W/0000-0002-9865-033X","Belgian Government [P5/24, P6/03]; Clemson University Research Foundation",Belgian Government; Clemson University Research Foundation,"Research support from the Inter-university Attraction Pole, Phase V (No. P5/24) and Phase VI (No. P6/03) from the Belgian Government, and from the Clemson University Research Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.

The purpose of this project was to compile an inventory of various types of,access with evidence development' (AED) schemes, examining characteristics of the technologies to which they have been applied, the uncertainty they sought to address, the terms of arrangements of each scheme, and the policy outcomes. It also aimed to identify issues related to such schemes, including advantages and disadvantages from the perspectives of various stakeholder groups. A comprehensive search, review and appraisal of peer-reviewed and 'grey' literature were performed, followed by a facilitated workshop of academics and decision makers with expertise in AED schemes. Information was extracted and compiled in tabular form to identify patterns or trends. To enhance the validity of interpretations made, member checking was performed. Although the concept of AED is not new, evaluative data are sparse. Despite varying opinions on the 'right' answers to some of the questions raised, there appears to be consensus on a 'way forward' - development of methodological guidelines. All stakeholders seemed to share the view that AEDs offer the potential to facilitate patient access to promising new technologies and encourage innovation while ensuring effective use of scarce healthcare resources. There is no agreement on what constitutes 'sufficient evidence', and it depends on the specific uncertainty in question. There is agreement on the need for 'best practice' guidelines around the implementation and evaluation of AED schemes. This is the first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of methods that have been used to address uncertainty concerning a new drug or other technology. The analysis reveals that, although various approaches have been experimented with, many of them have not achieved the ostensible goal of the approach. This article outlines challenges related to AED schemes and issues that remain unresolved.","[Stafinski, Tania; Menon, Devidas] Univ Alberta, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V2, Canada; [McCabe, Christopher J.] Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Alberta; University of Leeds,"Stafinski, T (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, 3021 114 St, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V2, Canada.",tanias@ualberta.ca,"McCabe, Christopher J/E-2051-2016",,Canadian Institutes of Health Research Funding Source: Medline,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),,,107,103,107,0,26,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,2,,,,,113,142,,10.2165/11530820-000000000-00000,0.0,,,30,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,561YO,20085389.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000275016200004,0

The results in this study suggest that: (1) R&D fund input should be strengthened to boost the export performance of our hi-tech products; (2) Overseas technologies should be imported and fully utilized to accelerate the transition of domestic products no matter it is low cost commodities or high value-added goods; (3) Improvement of workers' remuneration could increase the export of high-tech products in the short run.","[Yang Zheng-pei; Xu Er-ming] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Xie Wen-jie] Bank Beijing, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Yang, ZP (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,10,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1464,1468,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100198,0

We assume that a life table, providing a best-estimate assessment of annuitants' future mortality is available to the insurer; conversely, the insurer has no access to data sets and the methodology underlying the construction of the life table. Nonetheless, the insurer is aware that, in the presence of mortality risks, a stochastic approach is required. The (projected) life table, which provides a deterministic description of future mortality, should then be used as the basic input of a stochastic model. The model we propose focuses on the annual number of deaths in a given cohort, which we represent allowing for a random mortality rate. To this purpose, we adopt the widely used Poisson model, first assuming a Gamma-distributed random parameter, and second introducing time-dependence in the parameter itself Further, we define a Bayesian-inferential procedure for updating the parameters to experience in some situations. The setting we define does not demand advanced analytical tools, while allowing for process and longevity risk in a rigorous way. The model is then implemented for capital allocation purposes. We investigate the amount of the required capital for a given life annuity portfolio, based on solvency targets which could be adopted within internal models. The outcomes of such an investigation are compared with the capital required according to some standard rules, in particular those proposed within the Solvency 2 project.","[Olivieri, Annamaria] Univ Parma, Fac Econ, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Olivieri, Annamaria] Univ Parma, Dept Econ, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Pitacco, Ermanno] Univ Trieste, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Math, I-34127 Trieste, Italy",University of Parma; University of Parma; University of Trieste,"Olivieri, A (通讯作者)，Univ Parma, Fac Econ, Via JF Kennedy 6, I-43100 Parma, Italy.",annamaria.olivieri@unipr.it; ermanno.pitacco@econ.units.it,"Olivieri, Annamaria/AAJ-2613-2021","Olivieri, Annamaria/0000-0002-8461-3634",MUR,"MUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))",Financial support from the Italian MUR is gratefully acknowledged.

In order to quantify how much variation between insurance policies that is captured by the rating factors, one may use the coefficient of determination, R-2, the estimated proportion of total variation explained by the model. We introduce a novel coefficient of individual determination (CID), which excludes noise variance and is defined as the estimated fraction of total individual variation explained by the model. We argue that CID is a more relevant measure of explained variation than R2 for data with Poisson variation. We also generalize previously used estimates and tests of overdispersion and introduce new coefficients of individual explained and unexplained variance. Application to a Swedish three year motor TPL data set reveals that only 0.5% of the total variation and 11% of the total individual variation is explained by a model with seven rating factors, including interaction between sex and age. Even though the amount of overdispersion is small (4.4% of the noise variance) it is still highly significant. The coefficient of variation of explained and unexplained individual variation is 29% and 81% respectively.","[Hossjer, Ola; Eriksson, Bengt; Jarnmalm, Kajsa; Ohlsson, Esbjorn] Stockholm Univ, Dept Math, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Hössjer, O (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Math, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",ola@math.su.se,,"Hossjer, Ola/0000-0003-2767-8818",Swedish Research Council [621-2005-2810],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"Ola Hossjer's work was supported by the Swedish Research Council, contract number 621-2005-2810.

The variables modelled are the prices of risk-free zero-coupon bonds - both index-linked and conventional - and of equities, as well as the inflation rate. The model is developed in discrete (nominally annual) time, but allowance is made for processes in continuous time subject to continuous rebalancing. It is based on a model of the market portfolio comprising all the above-mentioned asset categories. The risk-free asset is taken to be the one-year index-linked bond. It is assumed that, conditionally upon information at the beginning of a year, market participants have homogeneous expectations with regard to the forthcoming year and make their decisions in mean-variance space. For the purposes of illustration, a descriptive version of the model is developed with reference to UK data. The parameters produced by that process may be used to inform the determination of those required for the use of the model as a predictive model.

Several studies have described the impact of FMS on patients' functionality, disability and quality of life. Other studies have reported on the burden to patients, healthcare payers and society. This review brings the existing evidence together and concludes that the patient burden of fibromyalgia is very high in comparison with many other conditions. The burden to healthcare payers and society is important as well, and can be mostly explained by factors not directly related to the treatment of FMS. Data suggest that the cost before diagnosis may even be higher than the cost after diagnosis. It is very likely that the combination of symptoms not only complicates the recognition and treatment of FMS, but also magnifies the burden of FMS.

We assess whether differences in the results and conclusions of the various studies are due to differences in methodological and modelling choices, and/or the way parameter uncertainty was taken into account, or whether these are merely the result of genuine country/region-specific differences. No unambiguous single answer emerged as to whether universal rotavirus vaccination is or is not cost effective. The relevance and merits of each study need to be assessed within its context. This is illustrated by the fact that comparisons of different analyses for a single country show that one of the most important explanations for the variations in results and conclusions seems to be the use of different information sources for the estimation of input parameters. Future Studies should gather reliable and relevant information focusing on the most influential input parameters, i.e. rotavirus mortality (and efficacy against rotavirus deaths) for low- and middle-income countries, and a range of variables for high-income countries, including the incidence and cost of rotavirus hospitalization. Moreover, if no information is available for an important input parameter, the impact of a wide range of values should be explored rather than excluding it from the analysis or specifying a single-point value. Furthermore, future analyses may have to consider ways of accounting for herd immunity (e.g. by using a dynamic model).","[Bilcke, Joke; Beutels, Philippe] Univ Antwerp, CHERMID, CEV, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Beutels, Philippe] Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Antwerp; University of Sydney,"Bilcke, J (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, CHERMID, CEV, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",joke.bilcke@ua.ac.be,"Bilcke, Joke M/A-7082-2012; Bilcke, Joke/AAC-8932-2019; Beutels, Philippe/A-1919-2010","Bilcke, Joke/0000-0001-5720-5291; Beutels, Philippe/0000-0001-5034-3595",European Commission project POLYMOD [SP22-CT-2004-502085],European Commission project POLYMOD(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This review was made possible through independent research funding from the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (strategic basic research project, Simulation models of infectious disease transmission and control processes [SIM113]).

In the report we argued that the impact of the decoupling on the farm production in Lithuania could be different from the one in the old EU member states. The main reasons for that included: phasing-in of CAP payments, nonbinding quota and particularities of Lithuanian agriculture (dairy farming). The hypothesis of our thesis was that the direct impact of the decoupling on the farm production in Lithuania was negligible but the indirect (positive) impact (through farm investments) was notable. To research the topic we did the farm survey. The construction of the farm survey (the questionnaire) was based on the economic theory which served as a background and a theoretical justification for the study. We interviewed thirty-one farmers which had six or more cows per farm. The analysis of results of survey led to the confirmation of our thesis hypothesis. However, in this paper we do not present the analytical part of the research. We focus on the theoretical background and the methodological framework of the study.

We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the absence of utility-based arbitrage, and for the existence of a solution to the primal problem. We consider two utility-based methods which can be used to price contingent claims. Firstly we investigate marginal utility-based price processes (MUBPP's).

As EU moves towards a more liberalised agricultural trade environment, Baltic states' dairy sectors still have significant unresolved internal problems which are a legacy of command economies, the privatisation period and policies of recent years. These problems impede the sectors' competitiveness now and are expected to affect it more so in the future. Problem solving or mitigation may be carried out using protectionist measures. Author concludes that the existing agricultural policy does not set an articulated strategy for the dairy sector. Author proposes that a well justified agricultural sector strategy based on scientific research would help politicians avoid distributing support money to gain political support, instead of maximising economic benefit to the society. A number of protectionist measures exist that may be used to facilitate dairy sector development. Most appropriate ones which may bring about sustainable improvement are those directly affecting production and trade, such as targeted state assistance tied to fulfilment of desirable policy goals: To ensure a significant policy impact the principle of financial resources concentration must be observed. Using the logical framework analysis methodology, author identifies major shortcomings in existing support programming practices that may diminish the impact of a sound policy. A review of implications on possible use of protectionism measures resulting from long and medium-term global trends in the dairy sector is presented. It is concluded that while present socioeconomic recession conditions prevail, it is possible to implement an effective dairy sector policy using protectionism measures if policy programming is improved.","[Ozolins, Janis] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,ozolins.janis@apollo.lv,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,3,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,245,251,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BNL14,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845200042,0

The word silk sounds luxury and class. Silk is the queen of textile and the naturally produced animal fiber. Till today, no other fabric can match it in luster and elegance. As long as human desire for silk garments continues, the demand for sericulture activity remains. Natural sheen, inherent affinity for dyes and vibrant colours, high absorbance, light weight, resilience and excellent drape etc. have made silk, the irresistible and inevitable companion of the eve all Over the world. Chemically speaking, the silk is made of proteins secreted in the fluid state by a caterpillar, popularly known as silkworm, Bombyx mori L. Sericulture means cultivation of silkworms, which finally produces silk. Traditionally, Indian economy is largely dependent on the success of agriculture and allied farm activities as more than 70 per cent of the people's livelihood security is depending on this sector. Sericulture being an agro-based enterprise plays a predominant role in shaping the economic destiny of the rural people and fits very well in India's rural structure, where agriculture continues to be the main occupation. Sericulture occupies a very important position in the Indian economy.

A literature search for studies of medication review of older people in primary care by pharmacists yielded 16 reports of studies in English, and only ten of these were randomized controlled trials. Extracting meaningful conclusions from the data was problematic because of variations in the nature of the review described, the populations studied, the outcome data measured and the evaluation criteria used. There is a dearth of economic measurement and often inadequate descriptions of the interventions performed. Those interventions that were described in detail varied in the skills, training and approach of the pharmacists. Therefore, there was no possibility of aggregating results of studies, and the review conclusions are based on trends and impression rather than meta-analysis. There was no suggestion in any reports that patients were harmed by the interventions, and some consistency in suggesting that falls and hospital admissions might be reduced with modest cost savings, at least in terms of drug costs. No studies reported a benefit in terms of mortality, mental capacity or activities of daily living. The authors conclude that clinical medication review is probably of value and may be cost effective, but propose a large-scale, long-term, multicentre, collaborative clinical trial with carefully chosen (and clearly described) interventions and outcome measures to confirm this.","[Zermansky, Arnold G.; Silcock, Jonathan] Univ Leeds, Sch Healthcare, Leeds LS2 9UT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Zermansky, AG (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Healthcare, Leeds LS2 9UT, W Yorkshire, England.",a.g.zermansky@leeds.ac.uk,"Silcock, Jonathan/AAB-1856-2020","Silcock, Jonathan/0000-0002-4920-9249; Zermansky, Arnold/0000-0001-9067-0822",,,,,34,28,29,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,1,,,,,11,24,,10.2165/00019053-200927010-00003,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,420EZ,19178121.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000264273000003,0

If, at maturity, the portfolio value is below the guaranteed level, a third party will refund the investor up to the guarantee. In exchange for this protection, the third party imposes a limit on the risk exposure of the fund manager, in the form of a convex monetary risk measure. The fund manager therefore tries to maximize the investor's utility function subject to the risk-measure constraint. We give a full solution to this non-convex optimization problem in the complete market setting and show in particular that the choice of the risk measure is crucial for the optimal portfolio to exist.

However, while the employment rate of married women more than doubled during the last 50 years, that of unmarried women remained almost constant. To empirically analyze these trends, we estimate a female dynamic labor supply model using an extended version of Eckstein and Wolpin (1989) to compare the various explanations in the literature for the observed trends. This dynamic model provides a much better fit to the life-cycle employment pattern than a static version of the model and a standard static reduced form model (Heckman (1979)). The main finding using the dynamic model is that the rise in education levels accounts for about 33 percent of the increase in female employment, and the rise in wages and narrowing of the gender wage gap account for another 20 percent, while about 40 percent remains unexplained by observed household characteristics. We show that this unexplained portion can be empirically attributed to cohort-specific changes in preferences or the costs of child-rearing and household maintenance. Finally, the decline in fertility and the increase in divorce rates account for only a small share of the increase in female employment rates.","[Eckstein, Zvi] Tel Aviv Univ, Eitan Bergals Sch Econ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Eckstein, Zvi] Interdisciplinary Ctr Herzliya, IL-46150 Herzliyya, Israel; [Lifshitz, Osnat] Tel Aviv Jaffa Acad Coll, IL-6086 Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University; Reichman University,"Eckstein, Z (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Eitan Bergals Sch Econ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",eckstein@post.tau.ac.il; osnatlif@gmail.com,,,Pinhas Sapir Center for Development at Tel Aviv University,Pinhas Sapir Center for Development at Tel Aviv University,"This paper is based on the Walras-Bowley Lecture given at the Econometric Society Meeting, June 19, 2008 in Pittsburgh.

With this we consistently take into account the possibility of default of all names in the portfolio, that is neglected in the standard market approach.

Workers exhibit permanent differences in ability while firms are identical. Negative aggregate productivity shocks induce job destruction by driving the surplus of matches with low ability workers to negative values. Endogenous job destruction coupled with worker heterogeneity thus provides a mechanism for amplifying productivity shocks that offers an original solution to the unemployment volatility puzzle (Shimer (2005)). Moreover, positive or negative shocks may lead employers and employees to renegotiate low wages up and high wages down when agents' individual surpluses become negative. The model delivers rich business cycle dynamics of wage distributions and explains why both low wages and high wages are more procyclical than wages in the middle of the distribution.","[Robin, Jean-Marc] Sciences Po, Dept Econ, F-75007 Paris, France; [Robin, Jean-Marc] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Robin, JM (通讯作者)，Sciences Po, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.",jeanmarc.robin@sciences-po.fr,,,,,,,26,36,44,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2011,79.0,5,,,,,1327,1355,,10.3982/ECTA9070,0.0,,,29,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,822KZ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000295046300001,0

The use of these instruments comes with benefits, such as a reduction of moral hazard and higher transparency. However, at the same time, it introduces basis risk as a crucial key risk factor, since the index and the company's losses are usually not fully dependent. The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of basis risk on an insurer's solvency situation when an industry loss warranty contract is used for hedging. Since previous literature has consistently stressed the importance of a high degree of dependence between the company's losses and the industry index, we extend previous studies by allowing for non-linear dependencies between relevant processes (high-risk and low-risk assets, insurance company's loss and industry index). The analysis shows that both the type and degree of dependence play a considerable role with regard to basis risk and solvency capital requirements and that other factors, such as relevant contract parameters of index-linked catastrophic loss instruments, should not be neglected to obtain a comprehensive and holistic view of their effect upon risk reduction.

I argue here that their model misses, in fact, two important features of the data. First, the distribution of the size of price changes in the data is very dispersed. Second, in the data many price changes are temporary. I study an extension of the simple menu-cost model to a multiproduct setting in which firms face economies of scope in adjusting posted and regular prices. The model, because of its ability to replicate this additional set of microeconomic facts, predicts real effects of monetary policy shocks that are much greater than those in Golosov and Lucas and nearly as large as those in the Calvo model. Although episodes of sales account for roughly 40% of all goods sold in retail stores, the model predicts that these episodes do not contribute much to the flexibility of the aggregate price level.","NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Midrigan, V (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 19 W 4th St,6th Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA.",virgiliu.midrigan@nyu.edu,,,,,,,53,148,185,1,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JUL,2011,79.0,4,,,,,1139,1180,,10.3982/ECTA6735,0.0,,,42,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,786SN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000292328300006,0

In particular, I focus on a continuous-time version of a benchmark insurance problem where a risk-averse agent would like to borrow from a risk-neutral lender to stabilize his utility. The agent privately observes a persistent state variable, typically either income or a taste shock, and he makes reports to the principal. I give verifiable sufficient conditions showing that incentive-compatible contracts can be written recursively, conditioning on the report and two additional state variables: the agent's promised utility and promised marginal utility of the private state. I then study two examples where the optimal contracts can be solved in closed form, showing how persistence alters the nature of the contract. Unlike the previous discrete-time models with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) private information, the agent's consumption under the contract may grow over time. Furthermore, in my setting the efficiency losses due to private information increase with the persistence of the private information, and the distortions vanish as I approximate an i.i.d. environment.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Williams, N (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, William H Sewell Social Sci Bldg,1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",nmwilliams@wisc.edu,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I thank Dilip Abreu, Katsuhiko Aiba, Narayana Kocherlakota, Rui Li, Chris Sleet, and Ted Temzelides for helpful comments.

We perform an event study of price movements after jumps to analyse if investors' reactions are affected by psychological biases. We employ recent non-parametric methods based on intraday returns to separate large price movements that are related to unexpected news from those merely caused by periods of high volatility. In general, we find evidence for irrational pricing, which can be associated with investors' optimistic behavior in a bull market and the pessimism prevailing in a bear market.

The purpose of this article is to compare within the scope of CER the value of implementation and drug trials. Implementation trials have limitations similar to drug trials in terms of generalizability of results outside the trial setting and ability to identify best practice. However, in contrast to drug trials, implementation trials do not provide value in terms of ruling out harm, as implementation strategies are unlikely to cause harm in the first place. Still, implementation trials may provide good value when there is a high error probability in deciding whether implementation will be cost effective or if costs associated with making an erroneous decision are high. Yet the low risk of implementation programmes to cause harm may also allow for alternative approaches to identify best implementation practice, perhaps outside the scope of rigorous trials and testing. One such approach that requires further investigation is a competitive market for quality of care, where implementation programmes may be introduced without prior evaluation.","[Gandjour, Afschin] Louisiana State Univ, Pennington Biomed Res Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70808 USA; [Gandjour, Afschin] Univ Cologne, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Cologne, Germany; [Gandjour, Afschin] Rice Univ, James A Baker Inst Publ Policy 3, Houston, TX USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Pennington Biomedical Research Center; University of Cologne; Rice University,"Gandjour, A (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Pennington Biomed Res Ctr, 6400 Perkins Rd,Suite G3047, Baton Rouge, LA 70808 USA.",gandjour@gmx.com,"Gandjour, Afschin/I-8963-2019",,,,,,37,3,4,1,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,7,,,,,555,561,,10.2165/11588330-000000000-00000,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,793CC,21534639.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000292797000002,0

Avoiding exacerbations and subsequent hospitalizations is an important clinical aim and can avoid significant costs associated with the disease. International guidelines recommend the addition of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to a long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) for patients with severe to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbations. Objective: To evaluate retrospectively over a 3-month period, the cost effectiveness of budesonide/formoterol added to tiotropium bromide (tiotropium) compared with placebo added to tiotropium in COPD patients eligible for ICS/LABA combination therapy, based on the CLIMB study (NCT00496470). Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis of data from the 12-week, randomized, double-blind CLIMB study of COPD patients (n = 659; eligible for ICS/LABA; aged >= 40 years) comparing budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort (R) Turbuhaler (R) 320/9 mu g twice daily) added to tiotropium (18 mu g daily) or placebo added to tiotropium was conducted. A severe exacerbation was defined as a requirement for systemic glucocorticosteroids and/or ED visit and/or hospitalization. The effectiveness variable used for this analysis was the number of severe exacerbations avoided. Direct costs (medications, hospitalizations, ED and GP visits) were calculated by applying year 2009 unit costs from Australia ($A), Canada ($Can) and Sweden (Swedish krona [SEK]) to the study's pooled resource use. One-way sensitivity analyses for each country's mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and sensitivity to overall exacerbations were conducted. Bootstrapping was performed to estimate the variation around resource use, exacerbations and each country's mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Results: The mean number of severe exacerbations per patient 3-month period was 0.11 in the budesonide/formoterol added to tiotropium arm and 0.29 in the placebo added to tiotropium arm - a 62% reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations. Treatment with budesonide/formoterol added to tiotropium costs less in Australia and Canada (-$A90 [-(sic)58] and -$Can4.51 [-(sic)3]) and only slightly more in Sweden (SEK444 [(sic)43]), i.e. the savings associated with fewer exacerbations more than offset the additional budesonide/formoterol drug cost in Australia and Canada, and partially offset it in Sweden. In the Australian and Canadian perspectives, budesonide/formoterol added to tiotropium was a dominant treatment (fewer exacerbations at a lower cost) compared with placebo added to tiotropium. In Sweden, the estimated incremental cost per avoided exacerbation was SEK2502 ((sic)244.40). Conclusion: Budesonide/formoterol added to tiotropium was the dominant strategy compared with placebo added to tiotropium based on a 12-week study in COPD patients eligible for ICS/LABA combination therapy in Australia and Canada, and appears to be a cost-effective strategy in Sweden.","[Mittmann, Nicole] Univ Toronto, Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Hlth Outcomes & PharmacoEcon HOPE Res Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Hernandez, Paul] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Med, Div Respirol, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Mellstrom, Carl; Brannman, Lance] AstraZeneca Res & Dev, Lund, Sweden; [Welte, Tobias] Hannover Med Sch, Dept Resp Med, D-3000 Hannover, Germany",University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Research Institute; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; Dalhousie University; AstraZeneca; Hannover Medical School,"Mittmann, N (通讯作者)，2075 Bayview Ave,E240, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada.",nicole.mittmann@sunnybrook.ca,,,AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),"The authors thank Linda Hartman and Sofie Arnetorp of AstraZeneca, Lund, Sweden, for their statistical and health economic input and Dr Manda Gent of MediTech Media Ltd, Manchester, UK, who provided medical writing assistance, funded by AstraZeneca.

A unique limitation is the paucity of child-specific preference-based measures. A single, valid, preference-based measure of utility that can be used in children of all ages does not exist. Thus, the ability to derive a QALY for use in cost-utility analysis (CUA) is compromised. This paper presents and discusses existing and novel options for deriving utilities for paediatric health states for use in CUAs. While a direct elicitation may be preferred, a child's ability to complete a standard gamble or time trade-off task is hampered by cognitive and age limitations. The abstract notions contained in indirect instruments such as the EQ-5D and Health Utilities Index may also pose challenges for young children. Novel approaches to overcome these challenges include the development of age-appropriate instruments such as the EQ-5D-Y, the development of new child-specific utility instruments such as the Child Health Utility-9D and the re-calibration of existing adult instruments to derive preference weights for health states from children themselves. For children aged <6 years, researchers have little choice but to use a proxy reporter such as parents. While parents may be reliable reporters for physical activity limitations and externally manifest symptoms, their ability to accurately report on subjective outcomes such as emotion is questionable. Catalogues of utility weights for a range of conditions are increasingly becoming available but retain many of the same limitations as valuing health states from children or from proxies. Given the dynamic relationship in quality of life (QOL) between family members when a child is ill, it seems appropriate to consider a 'family perspective' rather than an individual perspective in child health state valuation. In a collective approach, health state utilities derived from multiple family members may be combined mathematically. Alternatively, in a unitary approach, a single utility estimate may be determined to represent the family's perspective. This may include deriving utilities through parent-child dyad estimation or by using a household model that combines the utility weights of the patient and family members, incorporating reciprocal QOL effects. While these various approaches to child health state valuation represent novel research developments, the measurement challenges and threats to validity persist. Given the importance of non-health benefits to child health, especially in the domains of education and public policy, it may be worthwhile to consider an approach that allows incorporation of externalities to produce a cost-benefit analysis. The use of discrete-choice methods to assess willingness to pay for novel child health interventions holds promise as a means to produce meaningful economic evidence. Regardless of the approach taken, the highest degree of methodological rigour is essential. The increasing attention being paid by health economic researchers to the measurement challenges of paediatric health state valuation can only increase the value of child health economic evidence for decision making.","Hosp Sick Children, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Ungar, Wendy J.] Univ Toronto, Dept Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Toronto,"Ungar, WJ (通讯作者)，Hosp Sick Children, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.",wendy.ungar@sickkids.ca,,"Ungar, Wendy/0000-0002-0762-0101",Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute,Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute,"This work was supported by in-kind support from the Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute.

Requiring an impartial observer to be indifferent as to which individual should face similar risks restricts her social welfare function, but still allows her to accommodate fairness. Requiring an impartial observer to be indifferent between identity and outcome lotteries, however, forces her to ignore both fairness and different risk attitudes, and yields a new axiomatization of Harsanyi's utilitarianism.","[Grant, Simon] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA; Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Exeter EX4 4ST, Devon, England; Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel",Rice University; University of Queensland; Kyoto University; Yale University; University of Exeter; Tel Aviv University,"Grant, S (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",simongrant1962@gmail.com; kajii@kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp; Benjamin.Polak@yale.edu; z.safra@ex.ac.uk,"Kajii, Atsushi/F-9404-2010; KAJII, Atsushi/H-6818-2013","Kajii, Atsushi/0000-0002-2497-522X;",Inamori Foundation; Israel Science Foundation [1299/05]; Henry Crown Institute of Business Research; [90152298],Inamori Foundation; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); Henry Crown Institute of Business Research;,"We thank John Broome, Jurgen Eichberger, Marc Fleurbaey, Edi Karni, Bart Lipman, Philippe Mongin, Stephen Morris, Heve Moulin, Klaus Nehring, David Pearce, John Quiggin, John Roemer, John Weymark, three referees, and a co-editor for many helpful comments.

An agent enjoys the benefit of public goods produced by other agents who are (directly or indirectly) connected to him. There is a cost to maintain a link as well as to produce a public good. Because agents can choose the amount of public goods, the value of a link is endogenously determined. We consider two different models of sequential bargaining games through which a contract on allocations is established. In the first model, we allow agents to propose a pure allocation and show that there is no symmetric stationary perfect equilibrium for sufficiently patient agents. In the second model, agents are allowed to propose a distribution on allocations. As a result, we find a symmetric stationary perfect equilibrium in which probabilistic choices are made on an equivalent class of allocations. Subsequently, we characterize core allocations, which consist of a minimally connected network and an effort profile, in which at most one agent does not produce the maximum amount of public good.","Korea Inst Publ Finance, Seoul, South Korea",,"Cho, M (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Publ Finance, 28 Bangjungmal Gil 79-6 Garak Dong, Seoul, South Korea.",mhcho@kipf.re.kr,"Cho, Myeonghwan/ISB-7048-2023","Cho, Myeonghwan/0000-0001-5717-1925",,,,,17,6,10,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

In particular, Kim and Hardy (2007) showed that the bias can be corrected for the Conditional Tail Expectation (CTE, a.k.a. Tail-VaR or Expected Shortfall) using the bootstrap. This article extends their result to the distortion risk measure (DRM) class where the CTE is a special case. In particular, through the exact bootstrap, it is analytically proved that the bias of the empirical estimate of DRM with concave distortion function is negative and can be corrected on the bootstrap, using the fact that the bootstrapped loss is majorized by the original loss vector. Since the class of DRM is a subset of the L-estimator class, the result provides a sufficient condition for the bootstrap bias correction for L-estimators. Numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the bootstrap bias correction. Later a practical guideline to choose the estimate with a lower mean squared error is also proposed based on the analytic form of the double bootstrapped estimate, which can be useful in estimating risk measures where the bias is non-cumulative across loss portfolio.

This review evaluates current issues in the management of HIV-infected, treatment-experienced patients. It may provide guidance in selecting active, tolerable drug combinations that promote a reasonable quality of life, full adherence and a durable treatment response. Current treatment guidelines and clinical trial data were reviewed to identify reasons for treatment failure and to summarize therapy options for treatment-experienced and highly treatment-experienced patients. Current treatment options include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and inhibitors of viral fusion, entry and integration. The use of NRTIs may be limited by resistance and short- and long-term toxicities. Resistance has restricted the NNRTI class with cross-resistance preventing their sequential use. Etravirine, a next-generation NNRTI, however, demonstrates effective virological suppression in patients with baseline NNRTI resistance. Boosted Pis are key components of ART for treatment-experienced patients. The newer boosted Pis tipranavir and darunavir have demonstrated impressive activity in patients with resistance to NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs, as well as in less treatment-experienced patients for darunavir. The fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide has demonstrated efficacy in heavily treatment-experienced patients, although injection-site reactions can be problematical. The recently approved integrase inhibitor raltegravir has also shown impressive potency and tolerability in highly treatment-experienced patients. Finally, the entry inhibitor maraviroc has also been approved recently, although its use is somewhat limited by the need for HIV tropism testing. The availability of potent next-generation PIs, NNRTIs, integrase and entry-inhibitors may offer improved therapy for treatment-experienced patients, including those with multiresistant virus. These new drugs may reduce HIV immunological and clinical progression and in doing so may also reduce treatment costs.","[Hill, Andrew M.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Pharmacol, Liverpool L69 3GF, Merseyside, England; [Hill, Andrew M.] Tibotec BVBA, Mechelen, Belgium; [Boyd, Mark A.] Univ New S Wales, Natl Ctr HIV Epidemiol & Clin Res, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia",University of Liverpool; Johnson & Johnson; University of New South Wales Sydney; Kirby Institute,"Hill, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Dept Pharmacol, 70 Pembroke Pl, Liverpool L69 3GF, Merseyside, England.",microhaart@aol.com,,"Boyd, Mark/0000-0002-6848-3307","Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services, Beerse, Belgium; Tibotec","Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services, Beerse, Belgium; Tibotec","The authors acknowledge Julia Woodman and Caroline Waterhouse (medical writer and senior editorial assistant, Gardiner-Caldwell Communications, Macclesfield, UK) for their editorial support.

Those drugs that are expensive and provide modest benefits will be less likely to receive a government price subsidy. There is concern that the cost-effectiveness hurdle will limit access to new cancer treatments because of their high costs and modest benefits. Objective: To test the hypothesis that Ceteris paribus, cancer drugs are less likely to receive a recommendation for reimbursement on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) than non-cancer drugs. Methods: We reviewed public summary documents (PSDs) on all major submissions considered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) from July 2005 to March 2008. Each PSD includes summary information on the clinical, economic and utilization considerations of the PBAC in arriving at a recommendation. A total of 227 PSDs were reviewed, from which 243 PBAC recommendations were identified. Logistic regression was used to determine the effects of drug type (cancer vs non-cancer) and other potentially confounding variables on the outcome of PBS approval versus non-approval. Results: There were 243 PBAC recommendations in 227 published PSDs: 108 for rejection (44%), 10 deferrals (4%) and 125 (51%) recommendations for listing. Recommendations for listing were made somewhat more often for non-cancer drugs than for cancer drugs: 104/191 (54%) versus 21/52 (40%), respectively; p=0.07. Based on the results for univariable analyses, there is evidence that four variables have some association (p <0.25) with PBAC approval, but only type of application, economic modelling and estimated cost to the PBS remained statistically significant at p<0.05 in the multivariable model. No interaction terms were statistically significant. Cancer drug submissions tend to have a modelled economic evaluation and have a higher cost per QALY than non-cancer drugs (29% vs 15% of cancer and non-cancer drugs, respectively had a reported modelled cost per QALY of more than Australian dollars [$A]45 000; p < 0.001). Submissions that include a modelled economic evaluation and have a higher cost per QALY get approved less often than submissions without an economic modelling (p = 0.04). However, after adjusting for economic modelling, there is no statistical difference between cancer and non-cancer drugs in terms of gaining recommendation for PBS listing. Conclusion: The RBAC applies decision criteria equitably to cancer and non-cancer drugs, in that cancer drugs are neither favoured nor disadvantaged but they are more expensive and target a smaller population than non-cancer drugs. Further debate and research is needed to determine society's willingness to pay for a QALY and whether this differs between drugs for cancer and other indications or for interventions that differ on criteria other than cost effectiveness.","[Chim, Lesley; Kelly, Patrick J.; Salkeld, Glenn; Stockler, Martin R.] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Chim, Lesley] AstraZeneca Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Stockler, Martin R.] Univ Sydney, Clin Trials Ctr, Natl Hlth & Med Res Council NHMRC, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Stockler, Martin R.] Sydney Canc Ctr RPA, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Stockler, Martin R.] Concord Hosp, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney; AstraZeneca; University of Sydney; Concord Repatriation General Hospital,"Chim, L (通讯作者)，5 Alma Rd, N Ryde, NSW 2213, Australia.",lesley.chim@astrazeneca.com,"Kelly, Patrick/AAC-4226-2022; Stockler, Martin R/N-3859-2016","Kelly, Patrick/0000-0003-2912-1706; Kelly, Patrick/0000-0002-5015-0977",Roche; Pfizer; GlaxoSmithKline; Merck; Novartis,Roche(Roche Holding); Pfizer(Pfizer); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Merck(Merck & Company); Novartis(Novartis),"Professor Glenn Salkeld has received an honorarium from Pfizer for teaching in a short course.

Because of the high prevalence of RLS in the general population, it is necessary to evaluate the economic impact of RLS. Objective: To determine the health economic burden of patients with RLS in Germany. Methods: A total of 519 RLS patients (mean age: 65.2 +/- 11.1 years) in different stages of disease were recruited in five health centres (university hospitals, district hospitals and office-based neurologists) by applying the diagnostic criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. A questionnaire was administered that assessed healthcare resource consumption as well as socioeconomic, demographic, clinical and health status. In addition, the International RLS severity scale (IRLS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), EQ-5D and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were addressed in the assessment. Direct and indirect costs ((sic), year 2006 values) were derived from various German economic resources and calculated from the perspective of the healthcare and transfer payment providers. Results: We calculated average total costs over the 3-month observation period. It was determined that average total costs were (sic)2090 for this period. The average direct medical and non-medical costs from the perspective of the health insurance provider were determined to be (sic)780, with (sic)300 attributed to drug costs and (sic)354 to hospitalization costs. Average total indirect costs amounted to (sic)1308 and were calculated based on productivity loss, using the human capital approach. As cost-driving factors we identified disease severity according to the IRLS (p < 0.01) and ESS (p < 0.04). Health-related quality of life was determined to be substantially affected by RLS; the mean EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) was 55.6, considerably lower than that of the age-matched general population. Conclusion: RLS places a notable financial burden on society as well as on patients and their families. More detailed studies are needed to evaluate the health economic impact of this disorder.","[Dodel, Richard; Reese, Jens-Peter; Oertell, Wolfgang H.; Stiasny-Kolster, Karin] Univ Marburg, Dept Neurol, D-35039 Marburg, Germany; [Happe, Svenja] Univ Gottingen, Dept Clin Neurophysiol, Gottingen, Germany; [Happe, Svenja] Klinikum Bremen Ost, Dept Clin Neurophysiol, Bremen, Germany; [Mayer, Geert] Hephata Klin, Dept Neurol, Schwalmstadt, Germany; [Wasem, Juergen] Univ Duisburg Essen, Lehrstuhl Med Mangement, Essen, Germany; [Giani, Guido] Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Biometr & Epidemiol, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Giani, Guido] Univ Dusseldorf, Sch Publ Hlth, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Geraedts, Max] Univ Witten Herdecke, Sch Med, Inst Hlth Syst Res, Witten, Germany; [Trenkwalder, Claudia] Paracelsus Elena Klin, Kassel, Germany",Philipps University Marburg; University of Gottingen; Klinikum Bremen-Ost; University of Duisburg Essen; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Witten Herdecke University,"Dodel, R (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Dept Neurol, Rudolf Bultmannstr 8, D-35039 Marburg, Germany.",dodel@med.uni-marburg.de,"Trenkwalder, Claudia/ABD-6559-2021; Trenkwalder, Claudia/AHD-1232-2022; Wasem, Juergen/AAT-8398-2021; Geraedts, Max/AAU-3664-2020","Trenkwalder, Claudia/0000-0001-6407-1199; Wasem, Juergen/0000-0001-9653-168X",German Ministry of Education and Research [01GI9901/1],German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The authors thank J.

These articles were published in 34 different journals, mostly based outside of Nigeria, between 1988 and 2009. On average, each article was written by four authors. Most first authors had medical/clinical affiliations and resided in Nigeria at the time of publication of the study. Based on a 1 to 10 scale, with 10 indicating the highest quality, the mean quality score for all studies was 7.29 (SD 1.21) and 59% of the articles were of fair quality (score 5-7); 5% were of even lower quality. The quality of articles was statistically significantly (p <= 0.05) related to the country of residence of the primary author (non-Nigeria = higher), country of the journal (non-Nigeria = higher). primary objective of the study (economic analysis = higher) and type of economic analysis conducted (economic evaluations higher than cost studies).

This paper shows how price constraints affect the profitability, stock returns and R&D spending of EU and US firms. Compared with EU firms, US firms are more profitable, earn higher stock returns and spend more on R&D. We tested the relationship between price regulation and R&D spending, and estimated the costs of tight EU price regulation. Although results show that EU consumers enjoyed much lower pharmaceutical price inflation, we estimated that price controls cost EU firms 46 fewer new medicines and 1680 fewer research jobs during our 19-year sample period. Had the US used controls similar to those used in the EU, we estimate it would have led to 117 fewer new medicines and 4368 fewer research jobs in the US.","[Golec, Joseph] Univ Connecticut, Dept Finance, Sch Business, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Vernon, John A.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Vernon, John A.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of Connecticut; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Golec, J (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Finance, Sch Business, 2100 Hillside Rd,Unit 1041F, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",jgolec@business.uconn.edu,,,,,,,33,24,28,1,37,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,8,,,,,615,628,,10.2165/11535580-000000000-00000,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,640NZ,20617857.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281059600002,0

The approach we propose is based on the empirical characteristic function estimation procedure with an approximate optimal weight function. The approximate optimal weight function is obtained through an Edgeworth/Gram-Charlier expansion of the logarithmic transition density of the Markov process. We derive the estimating equations and demonstrate that they are similar to the approximate maximum likelihood estimation (AMLE). However, in contrast to the conventional AMLE our approach ensures the consistency of the estimator even with the approximate likelihood function. We illustrate our approach with examples of various Markov processes.

Traditionally, the parameters of the Market Share Attraction Model are estimated via a Maximum Likelihood (ML) procedure, assuming that the data are drawn from a conditional Gaussian distribution. However, if the distribution is unknown, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation may seriously fail (Vapnik, 1982). One way to tackle this problem is to introduce a linear loss function over the errors and a penalty on the magnitude of model coefficients. This leads to qualities such as robustness to outliers and avoidance of the problem of overfitting. This kind of estimation forms the basis of the SVR technique, which, as we will argue, makes it a good candidate for estimating the Market Share Attraction Model. We test the SVR approach to predict (the evolution of) the market shares of 36 car brands simultaneously and report promising results.","[Nalbantov, Georgi I.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Res Inst Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Nalbantov, Georgi I.; Franses, Philip Hans; Groenen, Patrick J.

Our result therefore provides a plausible story behind the selection made by Cho and Kreps's (Q J Econ 102:179-221, 1987) D1 criterion on this class of games. Second, we examine a version of Crawford and Sobel (Econometrica 50:1431-1451, 1982) model with costly signaling, where standard refinements have no effect.

We combine the dynamic programming (DP) solution algorithm with the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm into a single algorithm that solves the DP problem and estimates the parameters simultaneously. As a result, the computational burden of estimating a dynamic model becomes comparable to that of a static model. Another feature of our algorithm is that even though the number of grid points on the state variable is small per solution-estimation iteration, the number of effective grid points increases with the number of estimation iterations. This is how we help ease the curse of dimensionality. We simulate and estimate several versions of a simple model of entry and exit to illustrate our methodology. We also prove that under standard conditions, the parameters converge in probability to the true posterior distribution, regardless of the starting values.","[Imai, Susumu] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 5M2, Canada; [Jain, Neelam] City Univ London, Dept Econ, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Jain, Neelam] No Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Ching, Andrew] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada",Queens University - Canada; City University London; Northern Illinois University; University of Toronto,"Imai, S (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, 233 Dunning Hall,94 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 5M2, Canada.",imais@econ.gueensu.ca; njain@niu.edu; andrew.ching@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,SSHRC; FQRSC,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); FQRSC,"We are very grateful to the editor and the anonymous referees for insightful comments.

J,"Plat, R",,,,"Plat, Richard",,,Stochastic portfolio specific mortality and the quantification of mortality basis risk,INSURANCE MATHEMATICS & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Portfolio specific mortality; Stochastic mortality models; Mortality basis risk; Longevity risk; Solvency 2,MODEL,"in the last decade a vast literature on stochastic mortality models has been developed. However, these models are often not directly applicable to insurance portfolios because: (a) For insurers and pension funds it is more relevant to model mortality rates measured in insured amounts instead of measured in the number of policies. (b) Often there is not enough insurance portfolio specific mortality data available to fit such stochastic mortality models reliably. Therefore, in this paper a stochastic model is proposed for portfolio specific mortality experience. Combining this stochastic process with a stochastic country population mortality process leads to stochastic portfolio specific mortality rates, measured in insured amounts. The proposed stochastic process is applied to two insurance portfolios, and the impact on the Value at Risk for longevity risk is quantified. Furthermore, the model can be used to quantify the basis risk that remains when hedging portfolio specific mortality risk with instruments of which the payoff depends on population mortality rates.

To evaluate whether the existence of social connections is beneficial to the firm's overall performance, we explore how the effects of social connections vary with the strength of managerial incentives and worker's ability. To do so, we combine panel data on individual worker's productivity from personnel records with a natural field experiment in which we engineered an exogenous change in managerial incentives, from fixed wages to bonuses based on the average productivity of the workers managed. We find that when managers are paid fixed wages, they favor workers to whom they are socially connected irrespective of the worker's ability, but when they are paid performance bonuses, they target their effort toward high ability workers irrespective of whether they are socially connected to them or not. Although social connections increase the performance of connected workers, we find that favoring connected workers is detrimental for the firm's overall performance.","[Bandiera, Oriana] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Barankay, Iwan] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Rasul, Imran] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Pennsylvania; University of London; University College London,"Bandiera, O (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",o.bandiera@lse.ac.uk; barankay@wharton.upenn.edu; i.rasul@ucl.ac.uk,,,ESRC; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-538-28-1001] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Financial support from the ESRC is gratefully acknowledged.

To exploit this fact requires knowledge of the relevant conditional cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the LR statistic, but the statistic is a function of the smallest characteristic root of an (m + 1)square matrix and is therefore analytically difficult to deal with when m > 1. We show in this paper that an iterative conditioning argument used by Hillier (2009) and Andrews, Moreira, and Stock (2007 Journal of Econometrics 139, 116-132) to evaluate the c.d.f. in the case m = 1 can be generalized to the case of arbitrary m.

For some classes of insurance contracts, in a particular period, it is possible to have a record of whether or not there is a claim on the policy, the types of claims made on the policy, and the amount of claims arising from each of the types. A typical example is automobile insurance where in the event of a claim, we are able to observe the amounts that arise from say injury to oneself, damage to one's own property, damage to a third party's property, and injury to a third party. Modeling the frequency and the severity components of the claims can be handled using traditional actuarial procedures. However, modeling the claim-type component is less known and in this paper, we recommend analyzing the distribution of these claim-types using multivariate probit models, which can be viewed as latent variable threshold models for the analysis of multivariate binary data. A recent article by Valdez and Frees [Valdez, E.A., Frees, E.W., Longitudinal modeling of Singapore motor insurance. University of New South Wales and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Working Paper. Dated 28 December 2005, available from: http://wwwdocs.fce.unsw.edu.au/actuarial/research/papers/2006/Valdez-Frees-2005.pdf] considered this decomposition to extend the traditional model by including the conditional claim-type component, and proposed the multinomial logit model to empirically estimate this component. However, it is well known in the literature that this type of model assumes independence across the different outcomes. We investigate the appropriateness of fitting a multivariate probit model to the conditional claim-type component in which the outcomes may in fact be correlated, with possible inclusion of important covariates. Our estimation results show that when the outcomes are correlated, the multinomial logit model produces substantially different predictions relative to the true predictions; and second, through a simulation analysis, we find that even in ideal conditions under which the outcomes are independent, multinomial logit is still a poor approximation to the true underlying outcome probabilities relative to the multivariate probit model. The results of this paper serve to highlight the trade-off between tractability and flexibility when choosing the appropriate model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We show that such frequency dependence implies that the relationship between the dependent variable and this explanatory variable is nonlinear. Past efforts to detect frequency dependence have not been satisfactory; for example, we note that the two-sided bandpass filtering used in such efforts yields inconsistent estimates of frequency dependence where there is feedback in the relationship. Consequently, we provide an explicit procedure for partitioning an explanatory variable into frequency components using one-sided bandpass filters. This procedure allows us to test for and quantify frequency dependence even where feedback may be present. A distinguishing feature of these new models is their potentially tight connection to macroeconomic theory; indeed, they are perhaps best introduced by reference to the frequency dependence in the marginal propensity to consume posited by the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) of consumption theory. An illustrative empirical application is given, in which the Phillips Curve relationship between inflation and unemployment is found to be negligible at low frequencies, corresponding to periods18 months, but inverse at higher frequencies, just as predicted by Friedman and Phelps in the 1960s.","[Ashley, Richard] Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Verbrugge, Randal J.] US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; United States Department of Labor,"Ashley, R (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",ashleyr@vt.edu,,,,,,,30,18,18,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Using a panel-data of 21 countries over the period 1981-2005, every five years, our econometric analysis find that the strength of intellectual property rights has a significant non-linear effect on country-level R&D investment, i.e. there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between them, meaning that strengthening of intellectual property rights would negatively affect domestic R&D expenditure after a turning point. We also find that positive linear relationship is existed between levels of R&D investment and other discussed institutions respectively, such as property rights; the quality of education system and economic freedom, etc.. The results suggest that institutional differences are important determinants for different levels of R&D investment across countries.","[Deng, Haibin; Liao, Jinzhong] Hunan Univ, Coll Econ & Trade, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,,hnudhb@126.com; liaojinzhong@sina.com.cn,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,4,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,815,820,,,,,,6,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600139,0

The aim of this review was to explore the upper limits that American society is paying and appears willing to pay to prevent cancer, by enforced environmental regulations and implemented clinical practice guidelines. Cost-effectiveness studies of clinical and environmental cancer-prevention policies and programmes were identified through a comprehensive literature review and confirmed to be officially sanctioned and implemented, enforced or funded. Data were collected in 2005-6 and analysed in 2007. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for clinical prevention policies ranged from under $US2000 to over $US6 00 0000 per life-year saved (LYS), exceeding $US100 000 per LYS for only 11 of 101 guidelines. Median ICERs for tobacco-related ($US3978/LYS), colorectal ($US22 694/LYS) and breast ($US25 687/LYS) cancer prevention were within generally accepted ranges and tended not to vary greatly, whereas those for prostate ($US73 603/LYS) and cervical ($US125 157/LYS) cancer-prevention policies were considerably higher and varied substantially more. In contrast, both the median and range of the environmental policies were enormous, with 90% exceeding $US100 000 per LYS, and ICERs ranging from $US61 004 to over $US24 billion per LYS. Notwithstanding a relatively large and accessible literature evaluating the cost effectiveness of clinical and environmental cancer-prevention policies as well as the availability of ICERs for the policies identified in this Study, the apparent willingness to pay to prevent cancer in the US still varies greatly and can be extremely high, particularly for many of the environmental cancer-prevention policies.","[Hunt, Timothy L.] Idaho State Univ, Coll Pharm, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA; [Luce, Bryan R.; Page, Matthew J.; Pokrzywinski, Robin] United BioSource Corp, Bethesda, MD USA",Idaho; Idaho State University; United Biosource Corporation,"Hunt, TL (通讯作者)，Idaho State Univ, Coll Pharm, Campus Box 8333, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA.",,,,Pfizer,Pfizer(Pfizer),"The authors thank Tammy Tengs for permission to use her Cancer Cost-Effectiveness Database, Charlie Garlow of the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, the US Environmental Protection Agency for consulting on enforcement of environmental regulations and Eldon Spackman of United BioSource Corporation for his help with reviewing the literature.

This article describes the current level of data availability regarding the costs of AD in Europe, summarizes and compares findings from previous studies in different countries, and discusses the applicability of available data for modelling purposes. A literature review was conducted for papers in any language reporting data on costs of care for patients with diagnosed dementia or possible/probable AD. Only papers reporting patient-level data on costs were included. A total of 16 studies were identified: from the Nordic region (4), the UK (3), Spain (3), France (2), Italy (2), Belgium (1) and Germany (1). There is large variation in total cost estimates, depending on, for example, differences in study methodology, setting, type and severity of patients included, range of costs assessed and the choice of principle for valuing informal care. The median value for total annual care costs in all studies was (sic)28 000 (range (sic)6614-(sic)64426) [year 2005 values]. Few studies assessed aspects of disease severity other than cognitive function. The costs of AD in Europe are substantial and increase with disease severity. Methodological differences between studies make comparison across countries and healthcare systems difficult, and there is a need to standardize methods for assessing and valuing informal care. Patient-level information on resource use is required to analyse determinants of care costs and predict the impact of therapeutic interventions. More data are needed to support future economic evaluations of therapies for AD.","[Jonsson, Linus] i3 Innovus, S-11164 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wimo, Anders] Karolinska Inst, NVS, Stockholm, Sweden",i3 Innovus; Karolinska Institutet,"Jönsson, L (通讯作者)，i3 Innovus, Klarabergsgatan 90,Hus D, S-11164 Stockholm, Sweden.",Linus.jonsson@i3innovus.com,"Jönsson, Linus/G-2253-2017; Wimo, Anders/ABA-2678-2021","Jönsson, Linus/0000-0001-5751-6292; Wimo, Anders/0000-0003-0963-5750",,,,,42,137,150,0,21,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,5,,,,,391,403,,,,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,485ZC,19586077.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269164000004,0

The asset correlation parameter, defined as an obligor's sensitivity to the ASRF, is a key driver within this approach, and its average values for different types of obligors are to be set by regulators. Specifically, for commercial real estate (CRE) lending, the average asset correlations are to be determined using formulas for either income-producing real estate or high-volatility commercial real estate. In this paper, the value of this parameter was empirically examined using portfolios of U. S. publicly-traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) as a proxy for CRE lending more generally. CRE lending as a whole was found to have the same calibrated average asset correlation as corporate lending, providing support for the recent U. S. regulatory decision to treat these two lending categories similarly for regulatory capital purposes. However, the calibrated values for CRE categories, such as multi-family residential or office lending, varied in important ways. The comparison of calibrated and regulatory values of the average asset correlations for these categories suggests that the current regulatory formulas generate parameter values that may be too high in most cases.","Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, Econ Res Dept, San Francisco, CA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Lopez, JA (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, Econ Res Dept, 101 Market St, San Francisco, CA USA.",jose.a.lopez@sf.frb.org,,"Martinez-Lopez, Jose Angel/0000-0002-6871-7265",,,,,22,5,5,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The null hypothesis is the Constant Conditional Correlation generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model in which volatility of an asset is described only through lagged squared innovations and volatility of its own. The alternative hypothesis is an extension of that model in which volatility is modelled as a linear combination not only of its own lagged squared innovations and volatility but also of those in the other equations while keeping the conditional correlation structure constant. This configuration enables us to test for volatility transmissions among variables in the model. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed test has satisfactory finite-sample properties. The size distortions become negligible when the sample size reaches 2500. The test is applied to pairs of foreign exchange returns and individual stock returns. Results indicate that there seem to be volatility interactions in the pairs considered, and that significant interaction effects typically result from the lagged squared innovations of the other variables.","[Nakatani, Tomoaki] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Nakatani, Tomoaki; Terasvirta, Timo] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ Stat, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Terasvirta, Timo] Univ Aarhus, Sch Econ & Management, CREATES, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Hokkaido University; Stockholm School of Economics; CREATES; Aarhus University,"Nakatani, T (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Kita 9,Nishi 9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.",naktom2@gmail.com; tterasvirta@econ.au.dk,"Nakatani, Tomoaki/A-4270-2012; Terasvirta, Timo/J-1621-2019","Nakatani, Tomoaki/0000-0003-4916-7322; Terasvirta, Timo/0000-0002-0947-2114",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [P2005-0033:1]; Danish National Research Foundation,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"This research has been supported by the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation, Project No. P2005-0033:1, and the Danish National Research Foundation.

The decision makers' valuation of a unit of health gain, or ceiling ratio (lambda), is important in CEA as the relative value against which acceptability is defined, although values are usually chosen arbitrarily in practice. Reference case estimates for lambda are useful to promote consistency, facilitate new developments in decision analysis, compare estimates against benefit-cost ratios from other economic sectors, and explicitly inform decisions about equity in global health budgets. The aim of this article is to discuss values for lambda used in practice, including derivation based on affordability expectations (such as $US150 perdisability-adjusted life-year [DALY]), some multiple of gross national income or gross domestic product, and preference-elicitation methods, and explore the implications associated with each approach. The background to the debate is introduced, the theoretical bases of current values are reviewed, and examples are given of their application in practice.

Other techniques are required to achieve stable and accurate results. In this paper, we review robust estimators for volatilities and correlations and identify those best suited for use in risk management. The selection criteria were that the estimator should be stable to both fractionally small departures for all data points (fat tails), and to fractionally large departures for a small number of data points (outliers). Since risk management typically deals with thousands of time series at once, another major requirement was the independence of the approach of any manual correction or data pre-processing. We recommend using volatility t-estimators, for which we derived the estimation error formula for the case when the exact shape of the data distribution is unknown. A convenient robust estimator for correlations is Kendall's tau, whose drawback is that it does not guarantee the positivity of the correlation matrix. We chose to use geometric optimization that overcomes this problem by finding the closest correlation matrix to a given matrix in terms of the Hadamard norm. We propose the weights for the norm and demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm on large-scale problems.","[Tchernitser, Alexander] BMO Financial Grp, Enterprise Risk & Portfolio Management, Market Risk, Toronto, ON M5X 1A1, Canada; [Rubisov, Dmitri H.] BMO Capital Markets, Toronto, ON M5X 1H3, Canada",,"Tchernitser, A (通讯作者)，BMO Financial Grp, Enterprise Risk & Portfolio Management, Market Risk, 1 1st Canadian Pl,3rd Floor, Toronto, ON M5X 1A1, Canada.",alexander.tchernitser@bmo.com,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Based on systematic identification of risk events, we construct FHC fault tree from the top event to basic events. Through quantitative analysis of FTA, the minimal cut sets, namely the most critical and fragile part of the system is determined. Eventually, through a series of back-forward logic computation (OR& AND), the failure probability of the top event can be finally deduced. To avoid the system failure and reduce the loss of risk, it is necessary to take measures according to the intermediate or basic events within minimal cut sets.

Understanding the development trend of karst rocky desertification is of fundamental importance in rocky desertification management and control. More attention should be paid to karst areas with potential rocky desertification. In this paper, ARCGIS software was used to discribe the historical and current situation of potential rocky desertification spatial pattern in the middle and lower reaches of Houzhai stream, a typical karst plateau area. Remote sensing images from the study area, collected in 1987, 1995 and 2004 were used for spatial pattern simulation of potential rocky desertification subdivided into six types: none, extreme slightly, slightly, moderately, severely and extreme severely. The results showed that the potential rocky desertification landscape distributed unevenly; a little more than half of the area showed gradual rocky desertification trend and about 60% of those regions had emarkable rocky desertification trend; Slightly potential rocky desertification was increasing all the time, while the other five types of potential rocky desertification had different change tendencies during different stages. Then based on CA-Markov model, the potential rocky desertification spatial pattern was predicted. Verification with investigation based on map in 2004 indicated that 87.2% of the simulation was consistant with real data. Therefore the model is robust in prediction potential rocky desertification spatial pattern in this study area.","[Zhang, Panpan; Hui, Yuanman; Xiao, Duning; Li, Xiuzhen; Yin, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS",,zhangpanpan8482@yahoo.com.cn,"wang, zhiwen/JDV-9990-2023",,,,,,23,0,0,1,9,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,1214,1220,,,,,,7,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600207,0

However, the practice on electricity futures show that it can not efficiently prevent the fluctuation of market price, and even the electricity futures market may go to collapse. Up to now, none of literatures clears the questions. This paper gives the causes that lead up to the failure of electricity futures market by analyzing the internal interaction mechanism between electricity futures price and spot prices. First, electric power is not economically storable, as a result electricity futures exchange can not at all make an influence to electricity spot prices through inventory change; second, traders always modify the quotation on the basis of expectation about the state of electricity market in the future, so the expectation plays an important role for the prices of futures contracts. The paper concludes that the failure of electricity futures market can fundamentally be attribute to two reason: (1) non-storage of electric power, i.e. that electricity futures market inevitably goes to collapse if only the electricity can not be stored economically; (2) the instability of expectation, which will directly cause the fluctuation of prices in electricity market.","[Zhong-qun, Wu] N China Elect Power Univ, Sch Business & Adm, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,,zhongqunw@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,117,125,,,,,,9,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600019,0

The naive bootstrap is a bootstrap where the formula used in the bootstrap world to compute standard errors is the same as the formula used on the original data. Simulation evidence shows that the naive bootstrap can be much more accurate than the standard normal approximation. The larger the HAC bandwidth, the greater the improvement. This improvement holds for a large number of popular kernels, including the Bartlett kernel, and it holds when the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) bootstrap is used and yet the data are serially correlated. Using recently developed fixed-b asymptotics for HAC robust tests, we provide theoretical results that can explain the finite sample patterns. We show that the block bootstrap, including the special case of the i.i.d. bootstrap, has the same limiting distribution as the fixed-b asymptotic distribution. For the special case of a location model, we provide theoretical results that suggest the naive bootstrap can be more accurate than the standard normal approximation depending on the choice of the bandwidth and the number of finite moments in the data. Our theoretical results lay the foundation for a bootstrap asymptotic theory that is an alternative to the traditional approach based on Edgeworth expansions.","[Vogelsang, Timothy J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Goncalves, Silvia] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Michigan State University; Universite de Montreal,"Vogelsang, TJ (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 110 Marshall Adams Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",tjv@msu.edu,,,NSF [SES-0525707]; SSHRCC,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); SSHRCC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"For helpful comments and suggestions we thank an editor and two anonymous referees, Lutz Kilian, Guido Kuersteiner, Nour Meddahi, Ulrich Mueller, Pierre Perron, Yixiao Sun, Hal White, and seminar participants at Boston University, Queen's University.

Existing research has focused on using aggregate shocks to explain business cycles, arguing that individual firm shocks average out in the aggregate. I show that this argument breaks down if the distribution of firm sizes is fat-tailed, as documented empirically. The idiosyncratic movements of the largest 100 firms in the United States appear to explain about one-third of variations in output growth. This granular hypothesis suggests new directions for macroeconomic research, in particular that macroeconomic questions can be clarified by looking at the behavior of large firms. This paper's ideas and analytical results may also be useful for thinking about the fluctuations of other economic aggregates, such as exports or the trade balance.","[Gabaix, Xavier] New York Univ, Stern Sch Finance, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Gabaix, Xavier] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gabaix, X (通讯作者)，New York Univ, Stern Sch Finance, 44 W 4th St,Suite 9-190, New York, NY 10012 USA.",xgabaix@stern.nyu.edu,"Gabaix, Xavier/B-8227-2008",,NSF [DMS-0938185],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"For excellent research assistance, I thank Francesco Franco, Jinsook Kim, Farzad Saidi, Heiwai Tang, Ding Wu, and, particularly, Alex Chinco and Fernando Duarte.

In this paper a Generalised Additive Model is fitted to the market data. The statistical significance of different factors which may affect the cat bond prices is examined and the effect of these factors on the prices is measured.

In our model, a firm introduces sequentially two products whose qualities are positively correlated. We investigate whether there exist information spillovers from the first to the second market. We show that, when correlation is high, the equilibrium in market 2 depends on the quality reputation the firm has gained in market 1. Moreover, if a firm with a high-quality product 1 wants to separate from its low-quality counterpart, it needs to advertise more in this market than if the qualities of the two products are unrelated. This advertising level signals not only high quality in the first market, but also the likely quality of the second product. Thus, advertising in the first market has information spillovers in the second market.","[Pires, Cesaltina Pacheco] Univ Evora, Dept Gestao, CEFAGE UE, P-7000803 Evora, Portugal; [Catalao-Lopes, Margarida] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Super Tecn, CEG IST, Lisbon, Portugal",University of Evora; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Pires, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, Dept Gestao, CEFAGE UE, Largo Colegiais 2, P-7000803 Evora, Portugal.",cpires@uevora.pt,"Catalão-Lopes, Margarida/S-7435-2019; Pires, Cesaltina/A-3871-2010","Catalão-Lopes, Margarida/0000-0003-0849-6568; Pires, Cesaltina/0000-0001-8024-8935","Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) [FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-011871, FCT PTDC/EGE-ECO/101208/2008]",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),We are grateful to one anonymous referee and to the editor William Thomson for valuable comments.

Our theoretical framework is the same as that of Park and Phillips (2001, Econometrica 69, 117-161). We show that the limit behavior of the NLS estimator is largely determined by the relative orders of magnitude of the true and fitted models. If the estimated model is of different order of magnitude than the true model, the estimator converges to boundary points. When the pseudo-true value is on a boundary, standard methods for obtaining rates of convergence and limit distribution results are not applicable. We provide convergence rates and limit theory when the pseudo-true value is an interior point. If functional form misspecification is committed in the presence of stochastic trends, the convergence rates can be slower and the limit distribution different than that obtained under correct specification.","Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Cyprus,"Kasparis, I (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",kasparis@ucy.ac.cy,"KASPARIS, IOANNIS/S-1176-2017","KASPARIS, IOANNIS/0000-0002-9792-4183",,,,,31,5,5,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

We show that the presence of ambiguity often leads to an increase in the subjective project value, and entrepreneurs are more eager to invest.

The advent of effective but relatively expensive biological agents has increased the contribution of drugs to overall medical care costs. This has focussed interest on the relative cost effectiveness of rival therapies for IBD and, in particular, on the affordability of long-term biological therapy. The purpose of this article is to review the available literature on this topic and to identify areas for future research. Head-to-head trials of competing treatment options are uncommon and clinical trials have seldom addressed cost effectiveness. In UC, models have explored the cost utility of 'high-' versus 'standard-' dose 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) therapy and the theoretical impact of improved adherence with once-daily formulations. In CD, cost-utility models for anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) drugs versus standard care have suggested consistently that incremental benefits are achieved at increased overall cost. However, studies of varying design have produced a wide spectrum of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates, which highlights the challenges and limitations of existing modelling techniques.","[Bodger, Keith] Univ Liverpool, Dept Gastroenterol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Bodger, K (通讯作者)，Aintree Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Med, Ctr Clin Sci, Liverpool L69 3GA, Merseyside, England.",kbodger@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Bodger, Keith/0000-0002-1825-3239",Procter Gamble UK Ltd; Abbott Laboratories; Shire Pharmaceuticals,Procter Gamble UK Ltd(Procter & Gamble); Abbott Laboratories(Abbott Laboratories); Shire Pharmaceuticals,"Dr Bodger has received research support funding through grants/contracts with his employing institutions from Procter & Gamble UK Ltd, Abbott Laboratories and Shire Pharmaceuticals.",,73,34,39,0,18,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,5,,,,,387,401,,10.2165/11584820-000000000-00000,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,763KQ,21271748.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000290555600004,0

Typically, the assumption is made that relative treatment effects are constant across baseline risk, in which case relative risk (RR) or odds ratios (OR) could be applied to estimate ARD. The objective of this article is to establish whether such use of RR or OR allows consistent estimates of ARD. ARD is calculated from alternative framing of effects (e.g. mortality vs survival) applying standard methods for translating evidence with RR and OR. For RR, the RR is applied to baseline risk in the jurisdiction to estimate treatment risk; for OR, the baseline risk is converted to odds, the OR applied and the resulting treatment odds converted back to risk. ARD is shown to be consistently estimated with OR but changes with framing of effects using RR wherever there is a treatment effect and epidemiological risk differs from trial risk. Additionally, in indirect comparisons, ARD is shown to be consistently estimated with OR, while calculation with RR allows inconsistency, with alternative framing of effects in the direction, let alone the extent, of ARD. OR ensures consistent calculation of ARD in translating evidence from trial settings and across trials in direct and indirect comparisons, avoiding inconsistencies from RR with alternative outcome framing and associated biases. These findings are critical for consistently translating evidence to inform economic analysis and assessment of net clinical benefit, as translation of evidence is proposed precisely where the advantages of OR over RR arise.","[Eckermann, Simon] Univ Wollongong, Ctr Hlth Serv Dev, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Coory, Michael] Canc Council, Canc Epidemiol Ctr, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Willan, Andrew R.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Willan, Andrew R.] SickKids Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Wollongong; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids),"Eckermann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Ctr Hlth Serv Dev, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",seckerma@uow.edu.au,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [44868-08],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"The data, models and methodology used in this research are not subject to any proprietary interests.

While most macroeconomic time series appear to display an underlying trend, it is often far from clear whether this component is best modeled as a simple linear trend (so that long-run growth rates are constant) or by a more complicated nonlinear trend function which may, for instance, allow the deterministic trend component to evolve gradually over time. In this article, we consider the effects on unit root testing of allowing for a local quadratic trend, a simple yet very flexible example of the latter. Where a local quadratic trend is present but not modeled, we show that the quasi-differenced detrended Dickey-Fuller-type test of Elliott et al. (1996) has both size and power which tend to zero asymptotically. An extension of the Elliott et al. (1996) approach to allow for a quadratic trend resolves this problem but is shown to result in large power losses relative to the standard detrended test when no quadratic trend is present. We consequently propose a simple and practical approach to dealing with this form of uncertainty based on a union of rejections-based decision rule whereby the unit root is rejected whenever either of the detrended or quadratic detrended unit root tests rejects. A modification of this basic strategy is also suggested which further improves on the properties of the procedure. An application to relative primary commodity price data highlights the empirical relevance of the methods outlined in this article. A by-product of our analysis is the development of a test for the presence of a quadratic trend which is robust to whether the data admit a unit root.","[Taylor, A. M.

The mechanism is easy to implement and strategy-proof. However, this mechanism is inefficient, because all agents may be made better off by another mechanism that increases their chances of obtaining more preferred objects. This form of inefficiency is eliminated by a mechanism called probabilistic serial, but this mechanism is not strategy-proof. Thus, which mechanism to employ in practical applications is an open question. We show that these mechanisms become equivalent when the market becomes large. More specifically, given a set of object types, the random assignments in these mechanisms converge to each other as the number of copies of each object type approaches infinity. Thus, the inefficiency of the random priority mechanism becomes small in large markets. Our result gives some rationale for the common use of the random priority mechanism in practical problems such as student placement in public schools.","[Che, Yeon-Koo] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Che, Yeon-Koo] Yonsei Univ, YERI, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Kojima, Fuhito] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Columbia University; Yonsei University; Stanford University,"Che, YK (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 W 118th St,1016 IAB, New York, NY 10027 USA.",yeonkooche@gmail.com; fuhitokojima1979@gmail.com,"Koo, Yeon/Q-3792-2019","Kojima, Fuhito/0000-0002-1154-2652",KSEF's World Class University [R32-2008-000-10056-0],KSEF's World Class University,"We are grateful to Susan Athey, Anna Bogomolnaia, Eric Budish, Eduardo Faingold, Dino Gerardi, Johannes Horner, Mihai Manea, Andy McLennan, Herve Moulin, Muriel Niederle, Michael Ostrovsky, Parag Pathak, Ben Polak, Al Roth, Kareen Rozen, Larry Samuelson, Michael Schwarz, Tayfun Sonmez, Yuki Takagi, Utku Unver, Rakesh Vohra and seminar participants at Boston College, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Edinburgh, Harvard, Keio, Kobe, Maryland, Melbourne, Michigan, NYU, Penn State, Queensland, Rice, Rochester, Tokyo, Toronto, Yale, Western Ontario, VCASI, Korean Econometric Society Meeting, Fall 2008 Midwest Meetings, and SITE Workshop on Market Design for helpful discussions.

In such a modeling framework, the quadratic variation consists of a continuous and a JUMP component. This paper is about inference on the jump part of the quadratic variation, which can be estimated by the difference of realized variance and realized multipower variation. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it provides a bivariate asymptotic limit theory for realized variance and realized multipower variation in the presence of jumps. Second, this paper presents new, consistent estimators for the jump part of the asymptotic variance of the estimation bias. Eventually, this leads to a feasible asymptotic theory that is applicable in practice.

We consider econometric models defined by finitely many weak moment inequalities,2 which encompass many applications of economic interest. The objective of our inferential procedure is to cover the identified set with a prespecified probability.3 We compare our bootstrap procedure, a competing asymptotic approximation, and subsampling procedures in terms of the rate at which they achieve the desired coverage level, also known as the error in the coverage probability. Under certain conditions, we show that our bootstrap procedure and the asymptotic approximation have the same order of error in the coverage probability, which is smaller than that obtained by using subsampling. This implies that inference based on our bootstrap and asymptotic approximation should eventually be more precise than inference based on subsampling. A Monte Carlo study confirms this finding in a small sample simulation.","Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Bugni, FA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",federico.bugni@duke.edu,,,Robert Eisner Memorial Fellowship; Dissertation Year Fellowship,Robert Eisner Memorial Fellowship; Dissertation Year Fellowship,"1I am indebted to my advisors, Joel Horowitz, Rosa Matzkin, and Elie Tamer, for their guidance and support.

The incentives to independent directors are the main influencing factors in their responsibility fulfillment. From the perspective of independent directors, this paper studies the correlation between the allowance-incentives of independent directors and listed companies' illegal activities. Based on 61 listed companies with illegal activities in 2006, COX regression model has been adopted for analysis and shows that the allowance of independent directors has a highly positive correlation with listed companies' illegal activities. In other words, the higher allowance of the independent directors is paid, the more incidences of listed companies' illegal activities occur. This result severely challenges the current mechanism of unitary allowance incentives in China, since higher allowance fails to motivate the performance of the independent directors in preventing the legal violation of listed companies.","[Chen Wei-zheng; Cao Lun; Li Lin] Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China",Sichuan University,,,"Chen, Charles Weizheng/ABA-8539-2021",,,,,,25,0,0,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1146,1151,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100160,0

The study makes a conclusion that there is a unique ESS of the evolutionary game between the two groups; if each region's initial water right is adjusted according to ESS, the conflicts would be eliminated and harmonious and orderly environment for using water resource would be set up.","[Chen Yan-ping; Wu Feng-ping] Hohai Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China",Hohai University,,,"Wu, Fengping/GXN-4333-2022",,,,,,20,6,6,0,9,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1918,1923,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100259,0

A process equation that successfully explains daily price changes, for example, is unable to characterize the nature of hourly price changes. On the other hand, statistical properties of monthly price changes are often not fully covered by a model based on daily price changes. In this paper, we simultaneously model regimes of volatilities at multiple time scales through wavelet-domain hidden Markov models. We establish an important stylized property of volatility across different time scales. We call this property asymmetric vertical dependence. It is asymmetric in the sense that a low volatility state (regime) at a long time horizon is most likely followed by low volatility states at shorter time horizons. On the other hand, a high volatility state at long time horizons does not necessarily imply a high volatility state at shorter time horizons. Our analysis provides evidence that volatility is a mixture of high and low volatility regimes, resulting in a distribution that is non-Gaussian. This result has important implications regarding the scaling behavior of volatility, and, consequently, the calculation of risk at different time scales.","[Gencay, Ramazan] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Gradojevic, Nikola] Lakehead Univ, Fac Business Adm, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Selcuk, Faruk] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06533 Ankara, Turkey; [Whitcher, Brandon] Hammersmith Hosp, GlaxoSmithKline Clin Imaging Ctr, London, England",Simon Fraser University; Lakehead University; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; GlaxoSmithKline; Imperial College London,"Gençay, R (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",rgencay@sfu.ca,"Gencay, Ramazan/A-1905-2008","Gradojevic, Nikola/0000-0003-4001-3159; Whitcher, Brandon/0000-0002-6452-2399",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Ramo Gencay gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

Data in finance and insurance often cover a long time period. Therefore, the economic factors may induce some changes within the dependence structure. Recently, two methods have been proposed using copulas to analyse such changes. The first approach investigates changes within the parameters of the copula. The second determines the sequence of copulas using moving windows. In this paper we take into account the non-stationarity of the data and analyse the impact of (1) time-varying parameters for a copula family, and (2) the sequence of copulas, on the computations of the VaR and ES measures. We propose tests based on conditional copulas and the goodness-of-fit to decide the type of change, and further give the corresponding change analysis. We illustrate our approach using the Standard Poor 500 and Nasdaq indices in order to compute risk measures using the two previous methods.","[Guegan, D.] Univ Paris 01, PSE, CES, MSE, F-75013 Paris, France; [Zhang, J.] E China Normal Univ, Dept Stat, Shanghai 200063, Peoples R China",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; East China Normal University,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，E China Normal Univ, Dept Stat, Shanghai 200063, Peoples R China.",celine_chang_12@hotmail.com,,,,,,,21,28,36,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We derive analytical expressions for the Laplace transforms in time of the prices and sensitivities of single barrier options in an exponential Levy model with hyper-exponential jumps. Inversion of these single Laplace transforms yields rapid, accurate results. These results are employed to construct an approximation of the prices and sensitivities of barrier options in exponential generalized hyper-exponential Levy models. The latter class includes many of the Levy models employed in quantitative finance such as the variance gamma (VG), KoBoL, generalized hyperbolic, and the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) models. Convergence of the approximating prices and sensitivities is proved. To provide a numerical illustration, this transform approach is compared with Monte Carlo simulation in cases where the driving process is a VG and a NIG Levy process.

The most common outcome measure in this type of analysis is the QALY. In order to estimate QALYs, appropriate utility values are required. The objective of this review was to identify and critique utility values for schizophrenia-related health states. A critical appraisal was performed on utility values for schizophrenia identified in the systematic literature review that informed the economic analysis of the updated edition of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline on schizophrenia for England and Wales. Seven studies reporting utility values for schizophrenia were identified. The studies employed a variety of methods for generating utility values. None of the reported sets of utility values for schizophrenia were generated using the EQ-5D, which is a measure widely used in cost-utility analysis and preferred by NICE. Nevertheless, the EQ-5D may be less sensitive in capturing aspects of health-related quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. A condition-specific preference-based instrument may be more appropriate than a generic measure to inform cost-utility analyses of interventions for schizophrenia.","UCL, Natl Collaborating Ctr Mental Hlth, Ctr Outcomes Res & Effectiveness, Res Dept Clin Educ & Hlth Psychol, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Mavranezouli, I (通讯作者)，UCL, Natl Collaborating Ctr Mental Hlth, Ctr Outcomes Res & Effectiveness, Res Dept Clin Educ & Hlth Psychol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",i.mavranezouli@ucl.ac.uk,"MAVRANEZOULI, IFIGENEIA/C-2430-2008","MAVRANEZOULI, IFIGENEIA/0000-0001-9095-3566",NICE in the UK,NICE in the UK,"The systematic literature review of utility values for schizophrenia was undertaken to inform the updated edition of the NICE clinical guideline on schizophrenia, developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH), commissioned and funded by NICE in the UK.

Since the political system has been set up as ownership of the whole people in China, it is laid down clearly in the Constitution (latest amended in 2004) that predominant ownership of the means of production is public ownership. Accordingly, the people are endowed to obtain property income from government-owned capital and government-owned enterprises, which is the essence of public ownership, as well as major conceptually distinguishing point between socialist market economy and private ownership economy. Here we analyzed current income disparity in China as well as in other countries, especially the income system of civil servants in the United States. We compared the ratio of minimal wage to GDP per capita, the ratio of minimal wage to average wage, and the rate of minimal rage. Applying comparative analysis approach, we proposed suggestions on improving Chinese distribution system, focusing on public servants as well as state-owned enterprizes.

Heavy central bank interventions and government spending programs have been launched worldwide and especially in the USA and Europe, with the hope to unfreeze credit and bolster consumption. Here, we present evidence and articulate a general framework that allows one to diagnose the fundamental cause of the unfolding financial and economic crisis: the accumulation of several bubbles and their interplay and mutual reinforcement have led to an illusion of a perpetual money machine allowing financial institutions to extract wealth from an unsustainable artificial process. Taking stock of this diagnostic, we conclude that many of the interventions to address the so-called liquidity crisis and to encourage more consumption are ill-advised and even dangerous, given that precautionary reserves were not accumulated in the good times but that huge liabilities were.

The Diabetes Utility Index (R) (DUI) was developed as a brief, self-administered, diabetes mellitus-specific PBMH that can efficiently estimate patient-derived health state utilities. Objective: To describe the development of the valuation function for the DUI, and to report the validation results of the valuation function. Methods: Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) was used as the framework to develop a valuation function for the DUI. Twenty of 768 possible health states of the DUI classified as anchor states, single-attribute level states including corner states, and marker states were selected and described for preference elicitation interviews. Visual analogue scale and standard gamble (SG) exercises were used to measure preferences from individuals with diabetes recruited from primary care and community settings in and around Morgantown, WV, USA for the 20 health states defined by combinations of DUI attributes and severity levels. Data collected in the interviews were used to develop a valuation function that calculates utilities for the DUI health states and calculates attribute-level utilities. A validation survey of the valuation function was conducted in collaboration with the West Virginia University (WVU) Diabetes Institute. Results: A total of 100 individuals with diabetes were interviewed and their preferences for various DUI health states measured. From data generated in the interviews, a DUI valuation function was developed on a scale where 1.00 = perfect health (PH) and 0.00 = the all worse 'pits' state, and adjusted to yield utilities on the conventional scale 1.00 = PH and 0.00 = dead. A total of 396 patients with diabetes who received care at WVU clinics completed a DUI mail validation survey (response rate = 33%). Clinical data consisting of International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, diagnosis codes and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(lc)) values for the respondents were merged with their responses to the DUI. The utilities calculated by the scoring function of the DUI compared favourably to cardinal SG utilities for three DUI health states for which both assessments were available. The DUI utility function slightly underestimated actual SG utilities for mild and moderate health states (mean absolute difference = 0.05). There was a small but significant correlation between DUI utility scores and average past year HbA(lc), values (r=-0.30; p<0.001). Respondents with two or more complications had significantly lower DUI utilities than those with no complications (p<0.001) or one complication (p=0.015). Insulin users had significantly lower DUI utilities than non-users (p<0.001), and those with HbA(lc), values <7% had significantly higher DUI utilities than those with HbA(lc) values of !7% (p<0.001). No significant association was found between DUI scores and age or sex. Conclusion: These results show evidence of the feasibility and validity of the DUL Further research is suggested to demonstrate the generalizability of these findings, to study the responsiveness of the DUI, and to examine the clinical meaningfulness of DUI change scores.","[Sundaram, Murali; Smith, Michael J.; Madhavan, Suresh] W Virginia Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Syst & Policy, Sch Pharm, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Revicki, Dennis A.] United Biosource Corp, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Res, Bethesda, MD USA; [Miller, Lesley-Ann] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Hobbs, Gerry] W Virginia Univ, Dept Stat, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University; United Biosource Corporation; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; West Virginia University,"Sundaram, M (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Syst & Policy, Sch Pharm, POB 9510, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",doctormurali@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,12,12,0,16,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,3,,,,,201,216,,10.2165/11313990-000000000-00000,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,571NH,20151725.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000275758300004,0

Method: The pharmacoeconomic appraisals conducted by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) between September 2006 and February 2009 were reviewed. The NCPE recommendations and subsequent reimbursement decisions by the Health Service Executive (HSE) were recorded. Recommendations made by the NCPE were compared with those of UK agencies. The duration of the NCPE pharmacoeconomic process and the time from marketing authorization to reimbursement was estimated. The budget impact assessments from the pharmaceutical companies were reviewed and compared for consistency. Results: The NCPE conducted 12 single technology appraisals during the study period. Eight of the medicines assessed were either recommended as a cost-effective use of resources or recommended with certain restrictions, and were funded by the HSE. Of the four medicines that were not considered cost effective, two were reimbursed after a price reduction was negotiated and the remaining two were not. The NCPE recommendations concurred with those of the UK agencies for the majority of appraisals, with the exception of sunitinib and lapatinib. The average duration of the NCPE process was 2.7 months. The average time from marketing authorization to reimbursement was 7 months. The review of budget impact assessments highlighted a high degree of variability between submissions. Conclusions: The findings of this review highlight the efficiency of the pharmacoeconomic process and the acceptance of the NCPE recommendations by the HSE for pricing and reimbursement decisions.

Objective: To compare the cost effectiveness of LTRAs versus ICS for patients initiating asthma controller therapy. Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 2-year, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial set in 53 primary-care practices in the UK. Patients aged 12-80 years with asthma and symptoms requiring regular anti-inflammatory therapy (n = 326) were randomly assigned to LTRAs (n = 162) or ICS (n = 164). The main outcome measures were the incremental costs per point improvement in the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, per point improvement in the Asthma Control Questionnaire and per QALY gained from the UK NHS and societal perspectives. Results: Over 2 years, resource use was similar between the two treatment groups, but the cost to society per patient was significantly higher for the LTRA group, at 711 pound versus 433 pound for the ICS group (adjusted difference 204; pound 95% CI 74, 308) [year 2005 values]. Cost differences were driven primarily by differences in prescription drug costs, particularly study drug costs. There was a nonsignificant (imputed, adjusted) difference between treatment groups, favouring ICS, in QALYs gained at 2 years of 0.073 (95% CI -0.143, 0.010). Therapy with LTRAs was, on average, a dominated strategy, and, at a threshold for willingness to pay of 30000 per QALY gained, the probability of LTRAs being cost effective compared with ICS was approximately 3% from both societal and NHS perspectives. Conclusions: There is a very low probability of LTRAs being cost effective in the UK, at 2005 values, compared with ICS for initial asthma controller therapy.

We propose a new break fraction estimator which, where a break in trend occurs, is consistent for the true break fraction at rate O-p(T-1). Unlike other available estimators, however, when there is no trend break, our estimator converges to zero at rate O-p(T-1/2). Used in conjunction with a quasi difference (QD) detrended unit root test that incorporates a trend break regressor, we show that these rates of convergence ensure that known break fraction null critical values are asymptotically valid. Unlike available procedures in the literature, this holds even if there is no break in trend (the break fraction is zero). Here the trend break regressor is dropped from the deterministic component, and standard QD detrended unit root test critical values then apply. We also propose a second procedure that makes use of a formal pretest for a trend break in the series, including a trend break regressor only where the pretest rejects the null of no break. Both procedures ensure that the correctly sized (near-) efficient unit root test that allows (does not allow) for a break in trend is applied in the limit when a trend break does (does not) occur.","[Taylor, A.

The usual Phillips-Perron and Dickey-Fuller type tests are indexed by bandwidth, lag length, etc., but have none of these three properties. It is shown that members of the family with d < 1 have higher asymptotic local power than the Breitung (2002) test, and when d is small the asymptotic local power of the proposed nonparametric test is relatively close to the parametric power envelope, particularly in the case with a linear time trend. Furthermore, generalized least squares (GLS) detrending is shown to improve power when d is small, which is not the case for the Breitung (2002) test. Simulations demonstrate that when applying a sieve bootstrap procedure, the proposed variance ratio test has very good size properties, with finite-sample power that is higher than that of the Breitung (2002) test and even rivals the (nearly) optimal parametric GLS detrended augmented Dickey-Fuller test with lag length chosen by all information criterion.","[Nielsen, Morten Orregaard] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Nielsen, MO (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Dunning Hall,Room 307,94 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",mon@econ.queensu.ca,,"Nielsen, Morten Orregaard/0000-0002-1337-9844",,,,,43,18,21,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

We study the so-called Tweedie EDF and test the sensitivity of the claims reserves and their mean square error of predictions (MSEP) over this family. Furthermore, we develop second order Taylor approximations for the claims reserves and the MSEPs for members of the Tweedie family that are difficult to obtain in practice, but are close enough to models for which claims reserves and MSEP estimations are easy to determine.

The benchmark rates are expressed as a percentage of the expected premium income that is available to cover the whole risk of the portfolio. The rates are assumed to be based on a compound process with a heavy tailed severity, such as Burr or Pareto distributions. In the absence of claim data these assumptions propagate the theoretical benchmark rate component of the regression model. Given the whole set of excess of loss reinsurance rates in a given market, the unknown parameters are estimated within the framework of quasi-likelihood estimation. This framework makes it possible to select a theoretical benchmark rate model and to choose a parsimonious submodel for describing the observed market rates over a 4-years observation period.

An interesting, consequence of the new theory is that the uniform asymptotic approximation provides the exact distribution of the OLS estimator in the model considered by Bergstrom (1962). This example appears to be the first instance in the statistical literature of a uniform approximation delivering an exact expression for a probability density.","[Phillips, Peter C.

The model shows that jump risk and endogenous default can have significant impacts on credit spreads, optimal capital structure, and implied volatility of equity options: (1) Jumps and endogenous default can produce a variety of non-zero credit spreads, including upward, humped, and downward shapes; interesting enough, the model can even produce, consistent with empirical findings, upward credit spreads for speculative grade bonds. (2) The jump risk leads to much lower optimal debt/equity ratio; in fact, with jump risk, highly risky firms tend to have very little debt. (3) The two-sided jumps lead to a variety of shapes for the implied volatility of equity options, even for long maturity options; although in general credit spreads and implied volatility tend to move in the same direction under exogenous default models, this may not be true in presence of endogenous default and jumps. Pricing formulae of credit default swaps and equity default swaps are also given. In terms of mathematical contribution, we give a proof of a version of the smooth fitting principle under the jump model, justifying a conjecture first suggested by Leland and Toft under the Brownian model.","[Kou, S.

Randomness models the stochastic variability of all possible Outcomes of a situation, and fuzziness relates to the unsharp boundaries of the parameters of the model. In this sense, randomness is largely an instrument of a normative analysis that focuses on the future, while fuzziness is more an instrument of a descriptive analysis reflecting the past and its implications. Clearly, randomness and fuzziness are complementary, and so a natural question is how fuzzy variables could interact with the type of random variables found in actuarial science.

In the past couple of decades a large number of crop production technologies evolved have been adopted by different categories of farmers of Haryana State in Northern India that has not only increased the farm production but the profits made by the farming community have improvised their standard of living and changed their way of life. The inherent and latent effects of intensive agriculture leading to higher crop production at the cost of lowering of water table, poor soil health and environmental degradation had called for the attention of the scientists, policy makers and the producers to look for newer strategies for having sustainable agriculture. Present study was conducted in Haryana State of Northern India that has three zones based on the rain fall irrigation facilities. Framers of the state have different cropping patterns and cropping intensity. Wheat production in the state increased to 10.05 million tonnes in 2008-09 from 10.02 million tonnes in 2007-08, the state also recorded an all-time high productivity of 42.68 quintals of wheat per hectare. A recent survey indicated that 40 per cent of the farmers in Haryana State have switched over to zero-tillage in wheat crop cultivation. Use of Zero Tillage has had reduced the cost of cultivation up to U.S. $ 50 per hectare and water used for one irrigation is also saved. The farmers in some districts of the State were earlier growing two crops of paddy followed by wheat cultivation have switched over to one crop of paddy followed by wheat and pulse crops so to save water which was intensively used for irrigating two paddy crops five years ago. The promotion of pulse crop cultivation has also improved soil health in the area. Majority of farmers having land holding up to four hectares practice mixed farming of crop and dairy husbandry that was found more sustainable and organic in nature as both these sub-systems of the farming were found complimentary and supplementary to each other and had symbiotic relationship. A few farmers have changed their cropping pattern and have adopted cultivation of paddy-wheat-sorghum, paddy-potato-maize. A large number of small farmers having land holding up to one hectare have recently adopted vermi compost in growing different crops. It is since June 2009 that to conserve water in paddy cultivation with the help of IRRI, Philippines and CIMMYT, Mexico trials have been initiated in different locations of the state to cultivate paddy without raising and transplanting paddy nursery and using direct seeding and broadcasting methods are being tried. In the present paper the approaches used and adopted for attaining sustainable agriculture that has led to agriculture in transition have been discussed.","[Gosain, Dalip K.] Deemed Univ, Natl Dairy Res Inst, Agr Sci & Dairy Training Ctr, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Dairy Research Institute,,gosaindk@yahoo.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,191,195,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BNL14,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845200032,0

Thus, their yields are risk-free rates of return, which allows the most recently issued U.S. Treasury securities to be used as a benchmark to price other fixed-income instruments. This article analyzes the time series properties of interest rates on U.S. Treasury benchmarks and related debt instruments by modelling the conditional mean and conditional volatility for weekly yields on 12 Treasury Bills and other debt instruments for the period January 8, 1982 to August 20, 2004. The conditional correlations between all pairs of debt instruments are also calculated. These estimates are of interest as they enable an assessment of the implications of modelling conditional volatility on forecasting performance. The estimated conditional correlation coefficients indicate whether there is specialization, diversification, or independence in the debt instrument shocks. Constant conditional correlation estimates of the standardized shocks indicate that the shocks to the first differences in the debt instrument yields are generally high and always positively correlated. In general, the primary purpose in holding a portfolio of Treasury Bills and other debt instruments should be to specialize on instruments that provide the largest returns. Tests for Stochastic Dominance are generally consistent with these findings, but find somewhat surprising rankings between debt instruments, with implications for portfolio composition. Thirty year treasuries, Aaa bonds, and mortgages tend to dominate the other instruments, at least to the second order.","[Slottje, Daniel] So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Maasoumi, Esfandiar] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung, Taiwan",Southern Methodist University; Emory University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; National Chung Hsing University,"Slottje, D (通讯作者)，So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",dslottje@mail.smu.edu,"McAleer, Michael/B-2978-2010; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008",,,,,,54,2,2,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

As a group, patients with NP have greater medical co-morbidity burden than age- and sex-adjusted controls, which makes determining the humanistic and economic burden attributable to NP challenging. Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) is substantially impaired among patients with NP. Patients describe pain-related interference in multiple HR-QOL and functional domains, as well as reduced ability to work and reduced mobility due to their pain. In addition, the spouses of NP patients have been shown to experience adverse social consequences related to NP. In randomized controlled trials, several medications have been shown to improve various measures of HR-QOL. Changes in HR-QOL appear to be tightly linked to pain relief, but not to the development of adverse effects. However, in cross-sectional studies, many patients continue to have moderate or severe pain and markedly impaired HR-QOL, despite taking medications prescribed for NP. The quality of NP treatment appears to be poor, with few patients receiving recommended medications in efficacious dosages. The substantial costs to society of NP derive from direct medical costs, loss of the ability to work, loss of caregivers' ability to work and possibly greater need for institutionalization or other living assistance. No single study has measured all of these costs to society for chronic NP. The cost effectiveness of various interventions for the treatment or prevention of different types of NP has been assessed in several different studies. The most-studied diseases are post-herpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy, for which tricyclic antidepressants (both amitriptyline and desipramine) have been found to be either cost effective or dominant relative to other strategies. Increasing the use of cost-effective therapies such as tricyclic antidepressants for post-herpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy may improve the HR-QOL of patients and decrease societal costs. Head-to-head clinical trials comparing NP therapies are needed to help assess the relative clinical efficacy of treatments, ideally using HR-QOL and utility outcomes. The full costs to society of NP, including productivity loss costs, have not been determined for chronic NP. Improved relative efficacy, utility and cost estimates would facilitate future cost-effectiveness research in NP.","[O'Connor, Alec B.] Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Med, New York, NY USA",University of Rochester,"O'Connor, AB (通讯作者)，Box MED HMD,601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.",alec_oconnor@urmc.rochester.edu,,"O'Connor, Alec/0000-0001-8181-5567",,,,,122,327,374,1,60,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,2,,,,,95,112,,10.2165/00019053-200927020-00002,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,432IS,19254044.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000265127300002,0

We found that high fractions of reversals exist in the normal state and that consecutive bursts exist in the excited state. In large drawdowns and drawups (draws), long draws tend to be 'democratic', short draws tend to be 'oligarchic' and medium-size draws stay in either 'democratic' or 'oligarchic' mode, while conditionally independent draws are rarely found.

This potentially important source of variation in modelling and other types of economic studies is often overlooked. The extent to which increased expenditures for an intervention can be offset by reductions in subsequent service costs can be directly related to the choice of cost definitions. Objective: To demonstrate how different cost definitions for direct medical costs can impact results and interpretations of a cost-effectiveness analysis. Methods: The IMS-CORE Diabetes Model was used to project the lifetime (35-year) cost effectiveness in the US of one pharmacological intervention,medication A' compared with a second 'medication B' (both unspecified) for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The complications modelled included cardiovascular disease, renal disease, eye disease and neuropathy. The model had a Markov structure with Monte Carlo simulations. Utility values were derived from the published literature. Complication costs were obtained from a retrospective database study that extracted anonymous patient-level data from (primarily private payer) adjudicated medical and pharmaceutical claims. Costs for pharmacy services, outpatient services and inpatient hospitalizations were included. Cost definitions for complications included charged, allowed and paid amounts, and for medications included both wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) and average wholesale price (AWP). Costs were reported in year 2007 values. Results: The cost-effectiveness results differed according to the particular combination of cost definitions employed. The use of charges greatly increased costs for complications. When the analysis incorporated WAC medication prices with charged amounts for complication costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for medication A versus medication B was $US6337 per QALY. When AWP prices were used with charged amounts, medication A became a dominant treatment strategy, i.e. lower costs with greater effectiveness than medication B. For both allowed and paid scenarios, there was a difference in the ICER of over $US10 300 per QALY when medication prices were defined by WAC versus AWP. Ratios of medication costs to cardiovascular complication costs ranged from under 0.45 to over 1.7, depending upon the combination of costing definitions. Conclusions: Explicitly addressing the cost-definition issue can help provide meaningful cost-effectiveness data to payers for policy development and management of healthcare expenditures. It can also help move the pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research fields forward in terms of both methodology and practical application.","IMS Consulting & Serv, Falls Church, VA 22046 USA",,"Tunis, SL (通讯作者)，IMS Consulting & Serv, 300 N Washington, Falls Church, VA 22046 USA.",stunis@us.imshealth.com,,,,,,,30,10,10,0,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,9,,,,,735,744,,10.2165/10899600-000000000-00000,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,507JE,19757867.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000270848500004,0

Objective: To describe the medical RU and cost burden of HZ in the first 90 days and the first year after diagnosis from the health insurer perspective and to stratify this burden for patients diagnosed with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and those who are immunocompromised. In addition, this study explores costs from the societal perspective as a result of work loss in the first year after diagnosis. Methods: The medical RU and cost data were obtained from the MarketScan(R) Research Database for the years 1998-2003. This database contains inpatient, outpatient and prescription drug data for approximately 14 million individuals of all ages, covered under a variety of fee-for-service and capitated provider reimbursement arrangements, including those with Medicare and private insurance. The work loss estimates were based on the MarketScan(R) Health and Productivity Management Database. Claims for services incurred between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2003 were screened to identify a cohort of HZ patients based on the presence of at least one International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code 053.xx. Each patient was assigned an index date based on the earliest observed occurrence of an HZ diagnosis. A cohort of PHN patients was identified as a subset of the HZ cohort with ICD-9 codes 053.12, 053.13, 053.19 or 729.2x in the period of 90 days to 12 months after the index date. Multivariable regression was used to compare HZ cases with matched controls after adjusting for demographic characteristics, insurance status, co-morbidities and medical expenditure in the 6 months prior to diagnosis for each of the endpoints. Separate regression models were developed, in which age and immune status were stratified. All costs were adjusted to March 2008 values using the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. Results: The average per patient cost of all HZ cases was $US605 in the first 90 days after diagnosis and $US1052 at I year. For the subset with PHN, the average per patient cost of HZ at I year was $US3815. For the subset with an immunocompromising condition, the average HZ cost at 1 year was $US1745. The majority of the costs were the result of outpatient visits and prescription drugs. The subset of HZ cases that had both absence hour and short-term disability (STD) records available had 26.5 absence hours and 2.9 STD days. Healthcare utilization, medical care costs and work loss all increased with age for all HZ cases. Conclusions: Based on the results from the present study, the direct medical cost burden of HZ in the US is high, exceeding $US1000 per HZ patient. This direct medical cost may be nearly twice as high in immunocompromised patients and four times as high in the Subset of HZ cases with PHN. The direct medical cost burden of HZ may exceed $US1 billion annually in the US. The majority of medical RU and cost burden is incurred by the elderly. Although many people with HZ may no longer be in the workforce, HZ does contribute to lost work time.","[White, Ronald R.; Singhal, Puneet K.; Segraves, Arthur W.] Global Human Hlth, Dept Global Outcomes Res, West Point, PA USA; [Lenhart, Greg] Thomson Healthcare, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Insinga, Ralph P.; Itzler, Robbin F.; Pellissier, James M.] Merck Res Labs, Dept Hlth Econ Stat, N Wales, PA USA",Merck & Company,"White, RR (通讯作者)，Merck & Co Inc, WP97-A217,POB 4, West Point, PA 19486 USA.",ron_white@merck.com,,,Merck Co.

At present, many problems lie in the medical circulation, such as the complex purchasing processes, the high transaction costs and drugs prices, and also serious commercial briberies. In order to solve these problems, since 2001, China has carried out the Centralist Tender for Drugs Purchase (CTFDP) in all medical institutions. Till now CTFDP has put into practice for nearly a decade, certain effects are obtained, but commercial briberies in Chinese medical circulation and the difficulty and high cost of getting medical problem are not solved thoroughly. Loopholes are still found which cause information distortion, such as the CTFDP system involve too much human factors, the evaluating system in CTFDP is unreasonable. In this article. the author will build two mathematical models to find out these related human factors and then analysis the CTFDP system.

The question arises what this means in terms of on-farm competitiveness of rapeseed relative to other crops. The agri benchmark cash crop network of farm economists, advisors and growers provides a international farm comparison on a uniform basis. The agri benchmark cost calculation shows that rapeseed production in 2007 was not covering total cost in most countries, which was mainly driven by an unfavorable price ratio between rapeseed and other crops, especially grains. But this analysis does not take into account the economic and agronomical value of rapeseed as previous crop. However, the benefits of a break crop are not unlimited and there must be a limit beyond which growers are encouraged to forego these benefits and move to a pure grain rotation. Even though crops like barley, rye, or sunflowers have been chosen as die next best alternative, rapeseed generates usually a lower gross margin than the respective alternative. To indicate the economic pressure on rapeseed production, the differences between the break-even price of rapeseed and the prices of the alternative crops are compared, which in many cases arc very high. On-farm competitiveness of different crops is driven by price ratios rather than by absolute prices. There are remarkable differences between the countries. In two of the German farms and on the British farm, rapeseed generates a gross margin comparable to the alternative crop only when the rapeseed price is two times higher. In contrast, on the Hungarian and Romanian farm the break-even ratio is in the range of 1:1.2.","[Zimmer, Yelto; Krug, Janina] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Farm Econ, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,,yelto.zimmer@vti.bund.de; janina.krug@vti.bund.de,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,292,296,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BNL14,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845200050,0

The approach is based on a relatively simple-to-implement set of estimating equations associated with the compensator for the jump measure, or its intensity, that only utilizes the weak assumption of regular variation in the jump tails, along with in-fill asymptotic arguments for directly estimating the large jumps. The procedure assumes that the large-sized jumps are identically distributed, but otherwise allows for very general dynamic dependencies in jump occurrences, and, importantly, does not restrict the behavior of the small jumps or the continuous part of the process and the temporal variation in the stochastic volatility. On implementing the new estimation procedure with actual high-frequency data for the S&P 500 aggregate market portfolio, we find strong evidence for richer and more complex dynamic dependencies in the jump tails than hitherto entertained in the literature.","[Bollerslev, Tim] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Bollerslev, Tim] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Todorov, Viktor] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Finance, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Northwestern University,"Bollerslev, T (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",boller@duke.edu; v-todorov@northwestern.edu,"Todorov, Viktor/KCX-9394-2024","Todorov, Viktor/0000-0002-2360-7812","NSF [SES-0957330]; CREATES; Danish National Research Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0957330] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); CREATES; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We would like to thank a co-editor and two anonymous referees for their detailed and thoughtful comments, which helped greatly improve the paper.

We study a perturbed joint fictitious play process with bounded memory and sample and a perturbed independent fictitious play process as in Young (Econometrica 61: 57-84, 1993). We show that in n-person games only strategies contained in the unique minimal p-best response set can be selected in the long run by both types of processes provided that the rate of perturbations and p are sufficiently low.

We show that, under a fixed premium rate, the optimal insurance policy is a generalized insurance layer (that is, either an insurance layer or a stop-loss insurance). This optimal insurance decision problem is resolved by first converting it into three different sub-problems similar to those in Jin and Zhou (2008); however, as we now demand a more regular optimal solution, a completely different approach has been developed to tackle them. When the premium is regarded as a decision variable and there is no risk loading, the optimal indemnity schedule in this form has no deductibles but a cap; further results also suggests that the deductible amount will be reduced if the risk loading is decreased. As a whole, our paper provides a theoretical explanation for the popularity of limited coverage insurance policies in the market as observed by many socio-economists, which serves as a mathematical bridge between behavioral finance and actuarial science.

In this paper we describe the conditions on the underlying information structure that are necessary and sufficient for informational herding and contrarianism. In a standard sequential security trading model, subject to sufficient noise trading, people herd if and only if, loosely, their information is sufficiently dispersed so that they consider extreme outcomes more likely than moderate ones. Likewise, people act as contrarians if and only if their information leads them to concentrate on middle values. Both herding and contrarianism generate more volatile prices, and they lower liquidity. They are also resilient phenomena, although by themselves herding trades are self-enforcing whereas contrarian trades are self-defeating. We complete the characterization by providing conditions for the absence of herding and contrarianism.","[Park, Andreas] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Sabourian, Hamid] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England",University of Toronto; University of Cambridge,"Park, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.",andreas.park@utoronto.ca; hamid.sabourian@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,"ESRC [RES-156-25-0023, R00429934339]; TMR",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); TMR,"This manuscript is a substantially revised and generalized version of our earlier paper Herd Behavior in Efficient Financial Markets.

Keyfitz (1985) introduced the concept of entropy, and analysed this in the context of continuous changes in life expectancy. He showed that a higher level of entropy indicates that the life expectancy has a greater propensity to respond to a change in the force of mortality than a lower level of entropy. In other words, a high level of entropy means that further reductions in mortality rates would have an impact on measures like life expectancy. In this paper, we apply this to the cost of annuities and show how it allows the sensitivity of the cost of a life annuity contract to changes in longevity to be summarized in a single figure index.

In this paper, we consider classical credibility models that can be embedded within the framework of mixed linear models. For inference about fixed effects and variance components, likelihood-based methods such as (restricted) maximum likelihood estimators are commonly pursued. However, it is well-known that these standard and fully efficient estimators are extremely sensitive to small deviations from hypothesized normality of random components as well as to the occurrence of outliers. To obtain better estimators for premium calculation and prediction of future claims, various robust methods have been successfully adapted to credibility theory in the actuarial literature. The objective of this work is to develop robust and efficient methods for credibility when heavy-tailed claims are approximately log-location-scale distributed. To accomplish that, we first show how to express additive credibility models such as Buhlmann-Straub and Hachemeister ones as mixed linear models with symmetric or asymmetric errors. Then, we adjust adaptively truncated likelihood methods and compute highly robust credibility estimates for the ordinary but heavy-tailed claims part. Finally, we treat the identified excess claims separately and find robust-efficient credibility premiums. Practical performance of this approach is examined - via simulations - under several contaminating scenarios. A widely studied real-data set from workers' compensation insurance is used to illustrate functional capabilities of the new robust credibility estimators. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

RVGE is associated with significant morbidity and mortality among children <5 years of age in developing countries. The protective efficacy of a two-dose oral series of rotavirus vaccine RIX4414 has been demonstrated in several well designed clinical trials conducted in developing countries, and the 'real-world' effectiveness of the vaccine has also been shown in naturalistic and case-control trials after the introduction of universal vaccination programmes with RIX4414 in Latin American countries. The WHO recommends universal rotavirus vaccination programmes for all countries. Numerous modelled cost-effectiveness analyses have been conducted with rotavirus vaccine RIX4414 across a wide range of low- and middle-income countries. Although data sources and assumptions varied across studies, results of the analyses consistently showed that the introduction of the vaccine as part of a national vaccination programme would be very (or highly) cost effective compared with no rotavirus vaccination programme, according to widely used cost-effectiveness thresholds for developing countries. Vaccine price was not known at the time the analyses were conducted and had to be estimated. In sensitivity analyses, rotavirus vaccine RIX4414 generally remained cost effective at the highest of a range of possible vaccine prices considered. Despite these favour- able results, decisions regarding the implementation of universal vaccination programmes with RIX4414 may also be contingent on budgetary and other factors, underscoring the importance of subsidized vaccination programmes for poor countries through the GAVI Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization).","Adis, Auckland 0754, New Zealand",Adis International,"Plosker, GL (通讯作者)，Adis, 41 Centorian Dr,Private Bag 65901, Auckland 0754, New Zealand.",demail@adis.co.nz,,,,,,,114,6,6,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,11,,,,,989,1009,,,,,,21,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,843RW,21988293.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000296691200007,0

The existing literature argues that the re-centred cumulative number of trades could be used as the appropriate stochastic clock of the market under which asset returns are virtually Gaussian. Using tick-data for FTSE-100 futures, we show that normality is not always recovered by conditioning on the re-centred number of trades. However, it can be shown that simply extending the approach to a nonlinear function can provide a better stochastic clock of the market.","[Velasco-Fuentes, Rafael; Ng, Wing Lon] Univ Essex, Ctr Computat Finance & Econ Agents CCFEA, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Velasco-Fuentes, R (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Ctr Computat Finance & Econ Agents CCFEA, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",r.a.velasco@gmail.com,,,National Council for Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACYT) [179358/194113],National Council for Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"Financial support has been provided by the National Council for Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACYT) under grant 179358/194113.

We show that the notion of Gateaux differentiability of certainty equivalents used in their paper has to be replaced by a different concept. Our approach allows us to address the important issue of normalization of aggregators in non-Brownian settings. We show that normalization is always feasible if the certainty equivalent of the aggregator is of the expected utility type. Conversely, we prove that in general Levy frameworks this is essentially also necessary, i.e. aggregators that are not of the expected utility type cannot be normalized in general. Besides, for these settings we clarify the relationship of our approach to stochastic differential utility and, finally, establish dynamic programming results.","[Kraft, Holger] Goethe Univ, Dept Finance, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Seifried, Frank Thomas] Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Math, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Kaiserslautern,"Kraft, H (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ, Dept Finance, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",holgerkraft@finance.uni-frankfurt.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Rheinland-Pfalz Cluster of Excellence 'Dependable Adaptive Systems and Mathematical Modeling',Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Rheinland-Pfalz Cluster of Excellence 'Dependable Adaptive Systems and Mathematical Modeling',"Holger Kraft gratefully acknowledges financial support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

This selects an essentially unique Markov-perfect equilibrium. With mild restrictions on the demand shocks, sequences of thresholds describe firms' equilibrium entry and survival decisions.

We develop identifiability conditions that are sufficient for a folk theorem; these conditions imply that there are PPXE in which the payoffs are approximately the same as if the monitoring structure and payoff functions were known. Finally, we define perfect type-contingently public ex post equilibria (PTXE), which allows players to condition their actions on their initial private information, and we provide its linear programming characterization.","[Fudenberg, Drew; Yamamoto, Yuichi] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Fudenberg, D (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dfudenberg@harvard.edu; yamamot@fas.harvard.edu,,,"NSF [0646816]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0646816] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Nageeb Ali, Susan Athey, Olivier Gossner, Michihiro Kandori, Larry Samuelson, Bill Sandholm, Satoru Takahashi, Joel Watson, Thomas Wiseman, and three referees for insightful comments, and NSF (Grant 0646816) for financial support.",,41,16,20,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2010,78.0,5,,,,,1673,1710,,10.3982/ECTA8565,0.0,,,38,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,663JQ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000282882700006,0

By constructing a valuation model, we first confirm that the conversion option may have positive values. We further find that the value of this option highly depends on the difference of the expected and actual mortality pattern after the insured individual converts his/her policy. Meanwhile, considering the general trend of mortality improvement, we incorporate this trend by applying the Lee-Carter model, hoping to provide a reasonable and fair valuation of the conversion option.

Providing careful definitions of the asset's market and fundamental price, we characterize all possible price bubbles in an incomplete market satisfying the no free lunch with vanishing risk (NFLVR) and no dominance assumptions. We show that the two leading models for bubbles as either charges or as strict local martingales, respectively, are equivalent. We propose a new theory for bubble birth that involves a nontrivial modification of the classical martingale pricing framework. This modification involves the market exhibiting different local martingale measures across time-a possibility not previously explored within the classical theory. Finally, we investigate the pricing of derivative securities in the presence of asset price bubbles, and we show that: (i) European put options can have no bubbles; (ii) European call options and discounted forward prices have bubbles whose magnitudes are related to the asset's price bubble; (iii) with no dividends, American call options are not exercised early; (iv) European put-call parity in market prices must always hold, regardless of bubbles; and (v) futures price bubbles can exist and they are independent of the underlying asset's price bubble. Many of these results stand in contrast to those of the classical theory. We propose, but do not implement, some new tests for the existence of asset price bubbles using derivative securities.","[Jarrow, Robert A.] Cornell Univ, Johnson Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Jarrow, RA (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Johnson Sch Management, 451 Sage Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",raj15@cornell.edu,"Shimbo, Kazuhiro/GRF-1644-2022",,NSF [DMS-0604020]; NSA [H98230-06-1-0079],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSA(National Security Agency),"The authors thank an anonymous referee for his insightful comments, especially with respect to the issues surrounding the choice of a numeraire.

Compared to the existing methods in the literature, COBS' main innovation lies in its incorporation of important constraints imposed by no-arbitrage, such as monotonically decreasing and boundary conditions for the discount function, positive forward and spot rates. In addition, by estimating the conditional median function. COBS is less sensible to outliers in reduced samples than other common methods in the literature. Estimation for high and low liquidity markets together with simulation exercises puts COBS in an intermediate position between usual parametric and nonparametric methods in the literature. It has more flexibility than parametric methods and, compared to other nonparametric methods, satisfies no-arbitrage constraints and generates parsimonious shapes of the term structure of interest rates.

Risk transfer to financial markets, with their major capacity for efficient risk pooling, is an area of significant development for a successful longevity product market. The structuring and pricing of longevity risk using modern securitization methods. common in financial markets, have yet to be successfully implemented for longevity risk management. There are many issues that remain unresolved for ensuring the successful development of a longevity risk market. This paper considers the securitization of longevity risk focusing on the structuring and pricing of a longevity bond using techniques developed for the financial markets, particularly for mortgages and credit risk. A model based on Australian mortality data and calibrated to insurance risk linked market data is used to assess the structure and market consistent pricing of a longevity bond. Age dependence in the securitized risks is shown to be a critical factor in structuring and pricing longevity linked securitizations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

There are significant differences in four aspects: acceptance of risk, mercantilism, innovativeness and proactiveness. On the other hand, we find Jiangxi entrepreneurs do better than Zhejiang entrepreneurs in acceptance of risk, perhaps this is because of the atmosphere of Jiangxi that need more adventurous. In addition, There are significant differences in mercantilism between entrepreneurs from Zhejiang and Jiangxi(T =-3.133, Sig:0.002).

Objectives: To evaluate the cost of achieving undetectable plasma HIV-RNA levels in highly treatment-experienced, HIV-1-infected adults receiving darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r 600 mg/100 mg twice a day) or control protease inhibitor (PI)-based HAART. Methods: The mean annual per-patient cost of DRV/r and control PI-based HAART was determined from the proportional use of antiretroviral agents in the DRV/r and control PI arms of the pooled POWER 1 and 2 trials, applying drug acquisition costs for 13 healthcare settings. The mean annual cost per patient of achieving undetectable plasma HIV-RNA levels (<50 copies/mL) was calculated by dividing the cost of each treatment by the proportion of patients with undetectable plasma HIV-RNA levels after 48 weeks in the DRV/r (45%) and control PI (10%) arms of the POWER trials. Results: Whereas absolute costs of treatment were 1-19% higher with DRV/r versus control PI-based HAART depending on the healthcare setting, the mean annual per-patient cost of achieving undetectable plasma HIV-RNA levels was 73-78% lower. These cost savings were maintained in the sensitivity analyses, adjusting for control PI and enfuvirtide use, and the number of active drugs in the background regimen. The incremental annual cost per additional patient achieving undetectable plasma HIV-RNA levels with DRV/r versus control PI-based HAART in POWER 1 and 2 (4148) pound compared favourably with that determined for enfuvirtide (137 pound 740; TORO trials) and tipranavir/ritonavir (32 pound 176; RESIST) versus control therapy. Conclusions: DRV/r-based HAART provided consistent reductions in the cost of achieving undetectable plasma HIV-RNA levels compared with control PI-based therapy in highly treatment-experienced patients across various healthcare settings. The incremental cost per additional patient achieving undetectable plasma HIV-RNA levels with DRV/r versus control PI-based HAART was also lower than that calculated for other treatment options in this population. These results suggest that DRV/r is an economically viable option for highly treatment-experienced patients.","[Smets, Erik] Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Serv LLC, B-2800 Mechelen, Belgium; [Hill, Andrew M.] Tibotec BVBA, Mechelen, Belgium; [Hill, Andrew M.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Pharmacol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Clotet, Bonaventura] Hosp Badalona Germans Trias & Pujol, Barcelona, Spain; [Clotet, Bonaventura] Iris Caixa Fdn, Barcelona, Spain; [Johnson, Margaret] Royal Free Hosp, London NW3 2QG, England; [Stoll, Matthias] Med Hosp Hannover, Dept Clin Immunol, Hannover, Germany; [Bellos, Nicholas] Southwest Infect Dis Associates, Dallas, TX USA",Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson; University of Liverpool; Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol; University of London; University College London; Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust; UCL Medical School,"Smets, E (通讯作者)，Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Serv LLC, Gen Wittelaan L11 B3, B-2800 Mechelen, Belgium.",ESMETS1@its.jnj.com,,,Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services; Tibotec; GlaxoSmithKline; Boehringer-Ingelheim; Gilead Sciences; Roche Pharmaceuticals; Merck Sharp and Dohme; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Abbott Laboratories,Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services; Tibotec; GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Boehringer-Ingelheim(Boehringer Ingelheim); Gilead Sciences(Gilead Sciences); Roche Pharmaceuticals(Roche Holding); Merck Sharp and Dohme(Merck & Company); Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Abbott Laboratories(Abbott Laboratories),"The authors would like to thank Tony Vangeneugden, Ben Van Baelen, Eric Lefebvre, Sabrina Spinosa-Guzman, Piet De Doncker and other members of the darunavir study team for their contributions.

However, the economic evaluation of vaccines is complicated by several features unique to vaccines, including the possibility of indirect (herd immunity) benefits and the shear breadth of vaccination strategies available to decision makers. As with the vaccines themselves, the modelling approaches applied to the economic evaluation of meningococcal vaccines have evolved to become increasingly complex. Despite such innovation, concerns remain about the quality of economic studies of meningococcal vaccines. This article reviews evaluations of meningococcal vaccine strategies in developed countries and provides recommendations for future work in this area. Four potentially problematic areas in the existing literature are identified indirect costs, herd immunity, quality of life and comparison programmes and approaches to these issues are discussed. Recommendations for reporting a 'minimum analysis profile' case are also made. Although comparisons across studies are difficult at best, recent work shows that incorporating the indirect benefits and costs of vaccination substantially improves cost effectiveness.","[Kauf, Teresa L.] Univ Florida, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Outcomes & Policy, Gainesville, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Kauf, TL (通讯作者)，POB 100496, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",tkauf@ufl.edu,,,,,,,45,12,12,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,6,,,,,449,461,,10.2165/11535280-000000000-00000,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,610FD,20465314.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000278715800002,0

This study estimates the cost effectiveness of darunavir with ritonavir (DRV/r) in this population over 5-year and lifetime time horizons in the USA. Methods: A Markov model was used to follow a treatment-experienced HIV-1 cohort through six health states, based on CD4 cell count: greater than 500, 351-500, 201-350, 101-200, 51-100 and 0-50 cells/min(3), and death. The magnitude of the CD4 cell count increase and duration of increasing and stable periods were derived from week 48 DRV/r clinical trial results (POWER 1 and 2). The treatment pathway assumed one regimen switch following treatment failure on the initial regimen. The use of antiretroviral drugs was based on usage in DRV/r clinical trials. US daily wholesale acquisition costs were calculated using the recommended daily doses. For each CD4 cell count range, utility values, HIV-1-related mortality rates and costs for medical resources (other than antiretroviral drug costs) were obtained from published literature. Non-HIV-1-related mortality rates were calculated by applying a relative risk value to the US general population age and gender-specific mortality rates. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and variability analysis were performed. Results: In a 5-year analysis, patients receiving DRV/r experienced 3.80 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incurred total medical costs of US$217 288, while those receiving control Pis experienced 3.60 QALYs and incurred costs of US$218 962. DRV/r was both more effective and less costly than control PIs. For the lifetime analysis, the QALYs and lifetime medical costs with DRV/r were 10.03 and US$565 358, compared with 8.76 and US$527 287 with control PIs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for DRV/r compared with control PIs was US$30 046. One-way sensitivity analyses for both time horizons indicated that the results were most sensitive to changes in the rate of CD4 cell count change during stable and declining periods (lifetime only), duration of stable period (5-year only) and HIV-1-related mortality rates. The results of the variability analysis were most sensitive to the model time horizon. Nevertheless, for all ranges and scenarios tested in these analyses, the incremental cost per QALY gained remained below US$50 000. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that there was a 0.921 and 0.950 probability of a cost-effectiveness ratio below US$50 000 per QALY for the 5-year and lifetime time horizon, respectively. Conclusions: DRV/r is predicted to be cost effective compared with control PI in highly treatment-experienced patients and is predicted to yield an average of 0.20 additional QALYs per treatment-experienced patient over 5 years and 1.27 additional QALYs over a lifetime in this population.","[Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Hlth Econ, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Smets, Erik] Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Serv LLC, Beerse, Belgium",Research Triangle Institute; Johnson & Johnson,"Mauskopf, J (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, Hlth Econ, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",jmauskopf@rti.org,,"Brogan, Anita/0000-0002-9003-994X; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548; Martin, Susan/0000-0002-9594-5036","Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services, Beerse, Belgium; Janssen Cilag","Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services, Beerse, Belgium; Janssen Cilag(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc)","The authors wish to thank the investigators and the patients and their families for their participation and support during the POWER studies.

To maximize benefits from public investments in CER, it is important to understand the value of CER from the perspectives of these stakeholders and how that affects their incentives to invest in CER This article provides a conceptual framework for valuing CER, and illustrates the potential benefits of such studies from a number of perspectives using several case studies We examine cases in which CER provides value by identifying when one treatment is consistently better than others, when different treatments are preferred for different subgroups, and when differences are small enough that decisions can be made based on price. We illustrate these findings using value-of-information techniques to assess the value of research, and by examining changes in pharmaceutical prices following publication of a comparative effectiveness study. Our results suggest that CER may have high societal value but limited private return to providers or payers. This suggests the importance of public efforts to promote the production of CER We also conclude that value-of-information tools may help inform policy decisions about how much public funds to invest in CER and how to prioritize the use of available public funds for CER, in particular targeting public CER spending to areas where private incentives are low relative to social benefits","[Meltzer, David] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Meltzer, David] Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Publ Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Conti, Rena] Univ Chicago, Dept Pediat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Meltzer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Dept Econ, 5841 S Maryland MC 2007, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,"Meltzer, David/C-2926-2009","Meltzer, David/0000-0003-2790-7393; Conti, Rena/0000-0002-4190-1839",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality through the Hospital Medicine and Economics Center for Education and Research in Therapeutics (CERT) [U18 HS016967-01]; National Institute of Aging [K24-AG31326],Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality through the Hospital Medicine and Economics Center for Education and Research in Therapeutics (CERT); National Institute of Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"Dr Meltzer would like to acknowledge financial support from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality through the Hospital Medicine and Economics Center for Education and Research in Therapeutics (CERT) U18 HS016967-01 (Meltzer.

The historical problem of Saint Petersburg paradox is reviewed and it is argued that the paradox is solved by decomposing the process into a combination of a fair gamble and an accompanied financial option. By generalizing this fair gamble it is shown that the gain loss distribution in this problem is closely related to the distribution of gain loss of business firms in the real world. Finally, I pose a serious question to the ordinary way of financing money to business firms with compound interest rates. Instead we introduce a new way of financing business firms without applying prefixed interest rates, in which financial stress is shared by all involved firms.

In this paper, we attempt to use fuzzy rough set theory to solve the problem. Under the framework of fuzzy rough set theory, the definitions of fuzzy equivalence relation, discernibility power and relative reduct are presented. Based on these definitions, influencing factors reduction model is established. Considering the case that the decision attribute is continuous, we redefine general discernibility matrix. Based on improved general discernibility matrix, a new heuristic algorithm for reduction is constructed.

In certain cases the latter terms are of small order relative to the former. The mean is shown to match that of the harmonic representation, where the latter is defined, and satisfies the required integration by parts rule. The advantages of our approach over the harmonic analysis include the facts that our formulas are valid for the full range of the long memory parameters and that they extend to non-Gaussian processes.","[Davidson, James] Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England; [Hashimzade, Nigar] Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Exeter; University of Reading,"Davidson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England.",james.davidson@exeter.ac.uk,"Hashimzade, Nigar/AAB-6977-2021; Hashimzade, Nigar/AAC-2436-2019","Hashimzade, Nigar/0000-0003-2035-5020;",,,,,18,3,3,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Using Legendre transform, dual theory and variable change technique, we derive the explicit solutions for the power and exponential utility functions in two different periods (before and after retirement). Each solution contains a modified factor which reflects an investor's decision to hedge the volatility risk. In order to investigate the influence of the modified factor on the optimal strategy, we analyze the property of the modified factor. The results show that the dynamic behavior of the modified factor for the power utility mainly depends on the time and the investor's risk aversion coefficient, whereas it only depends on the time in the exponential case.

In this model, an uncertain prospect, or Savage act, is assessed according to (a) a baseline expected-utility evaluation, and (b) an adjustment that reflects the individual's perception of ambiguity and her attitudes toward it. The adjustment is itself a function of the act's exposure to distinct sources of ambiguity, as well as its variability. The key elements of the VEU model are a baseline probability and a collection of random variables, or adjustment factors, which represent acts exposed to distinct ambiguity sources and also reflect complementarities among ambiguous events. The adjustment to the baseline expected-utility evaluation of an act is a function of the covariance of its utility profile with each adjustment factor, which reflects exposure to the corresponding ambiguity source. A behavioral characterization of the VEU model is provided. Furthermore, an updating rule for VEU preferences is proposed and characterized. The suggested updating rule facilitates the analysis of sophisticated dynamic choice with VEU preferences.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Siniscalchi, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 302 Andersen Hall,2003 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",marciano@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,63,85,96,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2009,77.0,3,,,,,801,855,,10.3982/ECTA7564,0.0,,,55,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,448MW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000266267700005,0

The specification is based on a Markov-switching model with Student-t innovations and K separate GJR(1,1) processes whose asymmetries are located at free non-positive threshold parameters. The model aims at determining whether or not: (i) structural breaks are present within the volatility dynamics; (ii) asymmetries (leverage effects) are present, and are different between regimes and (iii) the threshold parameters (locations of bad news) are similar between regimes. A novel MCMC scheme is proposed which allows for a fully automatic Bayesian estimation of the model. The presence of two distinct volatility regimes is shown in an empirical application to the Swiss Market Index log-returns. The posterior results indicate no differences with regards to the asymmetries and their thresholds when comparing highly volatile periods with the milder ones. Comparisons with a single-regime specification indicates a better in-sample fit and a better forecasting performance for the Markov-switching model.","Univ Fribourg, Dept Quantitat Econ, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland",University of Fribourg,"Ardia, D (通讯作者)，Univ Fribourg, Dept Quantitat Econ, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",david.ardia@unifr.ch,"Ardia, David/AAG-5821-2020","Ardia, David/0000-0003-2823-782X",Swiss National Science Foundation [FN PB FR1-121441],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This version has been written while the author was visiting the Econometric Institute, Erasmus University Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

This paper describes the approach that was taken in order to achieve these objectives, including characterisation of the rural labour market, consideration of rural development strategies, programmes and indicators, and an adaptation of the DPSIR model, and briefly discusses the application of the results in the later stages of the project.","[Fieldsend, Andrew] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,,fieldsend@aki.gov.hu,"Fieldsend, Andrew/N-6904-2017","Fieldsend, Andrew/0000-0002-9297-5870",,,,,18,0,0,0,0,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,51,57,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BNL14,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845200007,0

Materials and methods: Costs were estimated using administrative hospital data from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, which is linked to the Swedish National Diabetes Register. Data were available for 179 749 patients with diabetes in Sweden from 1998 to 2003 (mean and median duration of 6 years' follow-up). Costing of inpatient admissions was based on Nordic diagnosis-related groups (NordDRG). Multiple regression analysis (linear and generalizing estimating equation models) was used to estimate inpatient care costs controlling for age, sex and co-morbidities. The data on hospitalizations were converted to costs (E) using 2003 exchange rates. Results: The average annual costs (linear model) associated with inpatient admissions for a 60-year-old male in the year the first event first occurred were as follows: (sic)6488 (95% CI 5034, 8354) for diabetic coma; (sic)6850 (95% CI 6514, 7204) for heart failure; (sic)7853 (95% CI 7559, 8144) for non-fatal stroke; (sic)8121 (95% CI 7104, 9128) for peripheral circulatory complications; (sic)8736 (95% CI 8474, 9001) for non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI); (sic) 10 360 (95% CI 10 085, 10 643) for ischaemic heart disease; (sic) 11411 (95% CI 10 298, 12 654) for renal failure; and (sic)14 949 (95% CI 13 849, 16 551) for amputation. On average, the costs were higher when co-morbidity was accounted for (e.g. MI with co-morbidity was twice as costly as MI alone). Conclusions: Average hospital inpatient costs associated with common diabetes-related events can be estimated using panel data regression methods. These could assist in modelling of long-term costs of diabetes and in evaluating the cost effectiveness of improving care.","[Gerdtham, Ulf-G] Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Hlth Econ Unit, UMAS,CRC,Hlth Econ Program, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Gerdtham, Ulf-G] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Gerdtham, Ulf-G] Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Clarke, Philip; Hayes, Alison] Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Gudbjornsdottir, Soffia] Sahlgrens Univ Hosp, Ctr Diabet, Gothenburg, Sweden",Lund University; University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen; University of Sydney; Sahlgrenska University Hospital,"Gerdtham, UG (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Hlth Econ Unit, UMAS,CRC,Hlth Econ Program, Hs 33,Ing 72,Hus 28 Plan 12, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",ulf.gerdtham@med.lu.se,"; Gerdtham, Ulf-Goran/I-6766-2018","Clarke, Philip/0000-0002-7555-5348; Gerdtham, Ulf-Goran/0000-0002-0647-7817",Novo Nordisk Ltd; Svenska Diabetesforbundet [DIA2005-026]; Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research Visiting Fellowship; Chief Scientist Office [HERU1] Funding Source: researchfish,Novo Nordisk Ltd(Novo Nordisk); Svenska Diabetesforbundet; Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research Visiting Fellowship(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland),Funding for this paper was received from Novo Nordisk Ltd and Svenska Diabetesforbundet (DIA2005-026).

We do so by studying an eigenvalue problem associated with a positive eigenfunction for a conveniently chosen family of valuation operators. The members of this family are indexed by the elapsed time between payoff and valuation dates, and they are necessarily related via a mathematical structure called a semigroup. We represent the semigroup using a positive process with three components: an exponential term constructed from the eigenvalue, a martingale, and a transient eigenfunction term. The eigenvalue encodes the risk adjustment, the martingale alters the probability measure to capture long-run approximation, and the eigenfunction gives the long-run dependence on the Markov state. We discuss sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the relevant eigenvalue and eigenfunction. By showing how changes in the stochastic growth components of cash flows induce changes in the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, we reveal a long-run risk-return trade-off.","[Hansen, Lars Peter] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Scheinkman, Jose A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",University of Chicago; Princeton University,"Hansen, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",lhansen@uchicago.edu; joses@princeton.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-05-19372,, SES-03-50770, SES-0718407]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Comments from Jaroslav Borovicka, Rene Carmona, Vasco Carvalho, Junghoon Lee, Angelo Melino, Eric Renault, Chris Rogers, Mike Stutzer, Grace Tsiang, and Yong Wang were very helpful in preparing this paper.

The analytical framework of Bayesian modeling for threshold VAR models are developed. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and importance/rejection sampling methods are used to estimate the parameters of the model and to obtain posterior samples. We propose reliable modeling procedures using Bayes factor, and the information-theoretic model selection criteria such as, Akaike's (1973) Information Criterion (AIC), Schwarz (1978) Bayesian Criterion (SBC), Information Complexity (ICOMP) Criterion of Bozdogan (1990, 1994, 2000), Extended Consistent (AIC) with Fisher Information (CAICFE), and the new Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) Criterion of Bozdogan and Ueno (2000). We study the performance of these criteria under different design of the simulation protocol with varying sample sizes in TVAR models. Our results show that these criteria perform well in small sample as well as large samples to avoid heavy computational burden in conventional procedures.","[Kwon, Yongjae] BB & T Corp, Winston Salem, NC 27104 USA; [Bozdogan, Hamparsum; Bensmail, Halima] Univ Tennessee, Dept Stat Operat & Management Sci, Knoxville, TN USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Kwon, YJ (通讯作者)，BB & T Corp, 200 West 2nd St, Winston Salem, NC 27104 USA.",ykwon@myspeedworks.com,"Bensmail, Halima/AAT-7858-2020",,,,,,25,1,2,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

This article compares the powers of recently proposed unit root tests in three-regime TAR models using Monte Carlo experiments. The following results are obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations: Kapetanios and Shin's (2006) Wsup, Wave, and Wexp statistics, which degenerate with respect to the threshold parameters under the null hypothesis, have a better power in the three-regime TAR process with a relatively narrow band of a unit root process and a small sample, whereas their statistics do not perform well when the threshold and sample size increase; Bec et al.'s (2004, BBC) sup W and Park and Shintani's (2005) inf-t statistics and their restricted models, which do not degenerate with respect to the threshold parameters in the limit, perform poorly in the three-regime TAR process with a small threshold even when compared with the Dickey-Fuller test, whereas their statistics perform better in the case of a large threshold; sup W, inf-t, and their restricted models perform much better when the sample size and threshold increase and the outer regimes have a rapid convergence. In order to substantiate the use of our Monte Carlo results for some of the applied work, we apply these tests to the real exchange rates for many countries.","Univ Ryukyus, Fac Law & Letters, Okinawa 9030213, Japan",University of the Ryukyus,"Maki, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ryukyus, Fac Law & Letters, 1 Senbaru, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.",maki@ll.u-ryukyu.ac.jp,,,KAKENHI [18730149]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18730149] Funding Source: KAKEN,"KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author would like to thank Hiroshi Yamada, Shin-ichi Kitasaka, three anonymous referees, and the seminar participants at Kobe University for helpful suggestions and comments.

Our contribution is twofold: first, we propose a sequential ordered probit (SOP) model which allows studying patient and impatient traders' choices separately; second, we consider two pieces of LOB information, the best quotes and the book beyond the best quotes. We find that both pieces of LOB information explain the degree of patience of an incoming trader and, afterwards, its order choice. Nonetheless, the best quotes concentrate most of the explanatory power of the LOB. The shape of the book beyond the best quotes is crucial in explaining the aggressiveness of patient (limit order) traders, while impatient (market order) traders base their decisions primarily on the best quotes. Patient traders' choices depend more on the state of the LOB on the same side of the market, while impatient traders mostly look at the state of the LOB on the opposite side. The aggressiveness of both types of traders augments with the inside spread. However, patient (impatient) traders submit more (less) aggressive limit (market) orders when the depth of the own (opposite) best quote and the length of the own (opposite) side of the book increase. We also find that higher depth away from the best ask (bid) quote may signal that this quote is 'too low (high)', causing incoming impatient buyers (sellers) to be more aggressive and incoming patient sellers (buyers) to be more conservative.","[Pascual, Roberto] Univ Islas Baleares, Dept Business, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Baleares, Spain; [Veredas, David] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Veredas, David] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Pascual, R (通讯作者)，Univ Islas Baleares, Dept Business, Ctra Valldemossa Km 7-5, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Baleares, Spain.",rpascual@uib.es,"Pascual, Roberto/AAS-2042-2020","Pascual, Roberto/0000-0001-8611-9421","European Commission [HPRN-CT-2002-00232]; Fulbright; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports; Spanish DGICYT [BEC2001-2552-C03-03, SEJ2004-07530-C04-04,, SEJ2007-67895-C04-03]","European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Fulbright; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports(Spanish Government); Spanish DGICYT(Spanish Government)","We wish to thank David Abad, Sonia Falconieri, Pierre Giot, Angelo Ranaldo, Andreu Sanso, Jose Vidal, and Klaus F.

Methods: We used data from a clinical trial performed in the Netherlands comparing two outpatient psycho therapies: schema-focused therapy (SFT) versus transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP). Costs were assessed with a cost interview. Outcome was the proportion of recovered patients measured with the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI-IV). We used three methods to adjust the costs for baseline differences: (i) mean difference adjustment, calculating total costs after baseline by adjusting the difference between groups with the difference of the mean baseline costs, (ii) delta adjustment, calculating the individual differences between patient baseline and the subsequent measurements (concerning incremental costs, this is the same as mean difference adjustment); and (iii) regression-based adjustment, adjusting total costs with a regression model, with total costs as the dependent variable and baseline costs as the independent variable. Results: Mean baseline costs were (sic)3339 for SFT and (sic)4238 for TFP, a mean difference of (sic)899. Total unadjusted follow-up costs were (sic)30822 for SFT and (sic)36812 for TFP. The fraction of recovered patients was 45% for SFT and 24% for TFP. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves show that mean difference and delta adjustments are different from the regression-based methods. Conclusions: Although the routine starting point of an analysis should always be an unadjusted analysis of the cost effectiveness, a baseline difference between treatment groups should be adjusted for. This should be done by reported patient characteristics or, when these are not sufficiently present, by baseline costs as a substitute. This adjustment should be carried out most preferably with a regression-based method.","[van Asselt, Antoinette D. I.; van Mastrigt, Ghislaine A. P.

Cost management by value chain analysis focuses on the essence of cost and provides a new concept for solving problems of cost management of construction enterprises. Value chain of construction industry and internal value chain, longitudinal value chain and transverse value chain of construction enterprises were analyzed by value chain theories and methods-and based on the review of the status quo of cost management of construction enterprises in China. Value chain cost management methods were proposed for construction enterprises.

In short, we call these models with convex moment predictions. Examples include static, simultaneous-move finite games of complete and incomplete information in the presence of multiple equilibria; best linear predictors with interval outcome and covariate data; and random utility models of multinomial choice in the presence of interval regressors data. Given a candidate value for ?, we establish that the convex set of moments yielded by the model predictions can be represented as the Aumann expectation of a properly defined random set. The sharp identification region of ?, denoted TI, can then be obtained as the set of minimizers of the distance from a properly specified vector of moments of random variables to this Aumann expectation. Algorithms in convex programming can be exploited to efficiently verify whether a candidate ? is in TI.

Inference about the trend parameters depends on the serial correlation structure of the data through the long-run variance (zero frequency spectral density) of the errors. Asymptotically pivotal tests can be obtained by the use of serial correlation robust standard errors that require an estimate of the long-run variance. The focus is on the class of nonparametric kernel estimators of the long-run variance. Tests based on these estimators present two problems for practitioners. The first is the choice of kernel and bandwidth. The second is the well-known overrejection problem caused by strong serial correlation (or a possible unit root) in the errors. We provide solutions to both problems by using the fixed-b asymptotic framework of Kiefer and Vogelsang (2005, Econometric Theory, 21, 1130-1164) in conjunction with the scaling factor approach of Vogelsang (1998, Econometrica 65, 123-148). Our results provide practitioners with a family of OLS-based trend function structural change tests that are size robust to the presence of strong serial correlation or a unit root. Specific recommendations are provided for the tuning parameters (kernel and bandwidth) in a way that maximizes asymptotic integrated power.","[Vogelsang, Timothy J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Vogelsang, TJ (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 110 Marshall Adams Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",tjv@msu.edu,,,,,,,38,17,18,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

A promising place for reliable estimation is rare macroeconomic disasters, which have a major influence on the equity premium. The premium depends on the probability and size distribution of disasters, gauged by proportionate declines in per capita consumption or gross domestic product. Long-term national-accounts data for 36 countries provide a large sample of disasters of magnitude 10% or more. A power-law density provides a good fit to the size distribution, and the upper-tail exponent, alpha, is estimated to be around 4. A higher alpha signifies a thinner tail and, therefore, a lower equity premium, whereas a higher coefficient of relative risk aversion, gamma, implies a higher premium. The premium is finite if alpha > gamma. The observed premium of 5% generates an estimated gamma close to 3, with a 95% confidence interval of 2 to 4. The results are robust to uncertainty about the values of the disaster probability and the equity premium, and can accommodate seemingly paradoxical situations in which the equity premium may appear to be infinite.","[Barro, Robert J.; Jin, Tao] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Barro, RJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, 218 Littauer Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rbarro@harvard.edu; tjin@fas.harvard.edu,,,"National Science Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0849496] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was supported by the National Science Foundation.

For completeness, we analyze the optimal reinsurance model under both binding and unbinding reinsurance premium constraints. By resorting to the Lagrangian approach based on the concept of directional derivative, explicit and analytical optimal solutions are obtained in each case under some mild conditions. We show that pure stop-loss ceded loss function is always optimal. More interestingly, we demonstrate that ceded loss functions, that are not always non-decreasing, could be optimal. We also show that, in some cases, it is optimal to exhaust the entire reinsurance premium budget to determine the optimal reinsurance, while in other cases, it is rational to spend less than the prescribed reinsurance premium budget.

We consider three different surplus distribution models and an asset allocation that consists of money market, bonds with different maturities, and stocks. In this setting, we combine actuarial and financial approaches by selecting a risk minimizing asset allocation (under the real world measure P) and distributing terminal surplus such that the contract value (under the pricing measure Q) is fair. We prove that this strategy is always possible unless the insurance contracts introduce arbitrage opportunities in the market. We then analyze differences between the different surplus distribution models and investigate the impact of the selected risk measure on the risk minimizing portfolio. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we present a new class of dynamic asset strategy, which respond to actual events. Hence they are referred to as 'reactive' strategies. They cannot be characterized as a series of specific asset allocations over time, but comprise rules for determining such allocations as the world evolves. Though they depend on how asset returns and other financial variables are modeled, they are otherwise objective in nature. The resulting strategies are optimal, in the sense that they can be shown to outperform all other strategies of their type when no asset allocation constraints are imposed. Where such constraints are imposed, the strategies may be demonstrated to be almost optimal, and dramatically more effective than static strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The financial market considered by the insurer consists of one risk-free asset and multiple risky assets whose price processes follow geometric Brownian motions. A general verification theorem is developed, and explicit closed-form expressions of the optimal polices and the optimal value functions are derived for the two problems. Economic implications and numerical sensitivity analysis are presented for our results. Our main findings are: (i) the optimal time-consistent policies of both problems are independent of their corresponding wealth processes; (ii) the two problems have the same optimal investment policies; (iii) the parameters of the risky assets (the insurance market) have no impact on the optimal reinsurance (investment) policy; (iv) the premium return rate of the insurer does not affect the optimal policies but affects the optimal value functions; (v) reinsurance can increase the mean-variance utility.

The approach provides a unified framework that allows us to compare various sets of structural assumptions found in the econometric literature. Moreover, general upper bounds are also derived for the risk of the estimator of the structural function. as well as that of its derivatives. It is shown that the bounds cover and extend known results given in the literature. Two important applications are also studied.

In particular, regimes are determined by the error correction term, and the transition between regimes is allowed to be discontinuous, as in, e.g., threshold cointegration. Several nonregular problems are resolved. First of all, consistency-square root n consistency for the cointegrating vector beta-is established for the least squares estimation of this general class of models. Second, the convergence rates are obtained for the least squares of threshold cointegration, which are n(3/2) and n for beta and gamma, respectively, where gamma denotes the threshold parameter. This fast rate for beta in itself is of practical relevance because, unlike in smooth transition models, the estimation error in beta does not affect the estimation of short-run parameters. We also derive asymptotic distributions for the smoothed least squares estimation of threshold cointegration.","London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Seo, MH (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.seo@lse.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Science Research Council,Economic and Social Science Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was supported through a grant from the Economic and Social Science Research Council.

In this paper, we propose a new asymmetric stochastic volatility model, based on the leverage and size effects. The model is a generalization of the exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model of Nelson (1991). We consider categories for asymmetric effects, which describes the difference among the asymmetric effect of the EGARCH model, the threshold effects indicator function of Glosten et al. (1992), and the negative correlation between the innovations in returns and volatility. The new model is estimated by the efficient importance sampling method of Liesenfeld and Richard (2003), and the finite sample properties of the estimator are investigated using numerical simulations. Four financial time series are used to estimate the alternative asymmetric stochastic volatility (SV) models, with empirical asymmetric effects found to be statistically significant in each case. The empirical results for SP 500 and Yen/USD returns indicate that the leverage and size effects are significant, supporting the general model. For Tokyo stock price index (TOPIX) and USD/AUD returns, the size effect is insignificant, favoring the negative correlation between the innovations in returns and volatility. We also consider standardized t distribution for capturing the tail behavior. The results for Yen/USD returns show that the model is correctly specified, while the results for three other data sets suggest there is scope for improvement.","[Asai, Manabu] Soka Univ, Fac Econ, Hachioji, Tokyo 1928577, Japan; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kyoto, Japan",Soka University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Kyoto University,"Asai, M (通讯作者)，Soka Univ, Fac Econ, 1-236 Tangi Cho, Hachioji, Tokyo 1928577, Japan.",m-asai@soka.ac.jp,"McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; Asai, Manabu/D-3044-2011","Asai, Manabu/0000-0002-6682-4622","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Australian Research Council; National Science Council, Taiwan; Australian Academy of Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20243017] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Australian Academy of Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors wish to acknowledge the insightful comments and suggestions of the Editor and a referee, and helpful discussions with Felix Chan, Neil Shephard, and Jun Yu, and seminar participants at Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei - Milan, National University of Singapore, University of Auckland, University of Melbourne, University of Milan-Bicocca, University of Venice Ca' Foscari, Ente Einaudi - Rome, and University Pompeu Fabra.

This is particularly true for costly orphan drugs because access depends primarily on co-payments, reimbursement policies and prices. The objective of this article is to identify differences in the availability of orphan drugs and in patient access to them in 11 pharmaceutical markets: Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland and the US. Methods: Four rare diseases were selected for analysis: pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), Fabry disease (FD), hereditary angioedema (HAE) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Indicators for availability were defined as (i) the indications for which orphan drugs had been authorized in the treatment of these diseases; (ii) the application date; and (iii) the date upon which these drugs received market authorization in each country. Indicators of patient access were defined as (i) the outcomes of technology appraisals; (ii) the extent of coverage provided by healthcare payers; and (iii) the price of the drugs in each country. For PAH we analysed bosentan, iloprost, sildenafil, treprostinil (intravenous and inhaled) as well as sitaxentan and ambrisentan; for FD we analysed agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta; for HAE we analysed icatibant, ecallantide and two complement C1s inhibitors; for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. Results: Most drugs included in this study had received market authorization in all countries, but the range of indications for which they had been authorized differed by country. The broadest range of indications was found in Australia, and the largest variations in indications were found for PAH drugs. Authorization process speed (the time between application and market authorization) was fastest in the US, with an average of 362 days, followed by the EU (394 days). The highest prices for the included drugs were found in Germany and the US, and the lowest in Canada, Australia and England. Although the prices of all of the included drugs were high compared with those of most non-orphan drugs, most of the insurance plans in our country sample provided coverage for authorized drugs after a certain threshold. Conclusions: Availability of and access to orphan drugs play a key role in determining whether patients will receive adequate and efficient treatment. Although the present study showed some variations between countries in selected indicators of availability and access to orphan drugs, virtually all of the drugs in question were available and accessible in our sample. However, substantial co-payments in the US and Canada represent important barriers to patient access, especially in the case of expensive treatments such as those analysed in this study. Market exclusivity is a strong instrument for fostering orphan drug development and drug availability. However, despite the positive effect of this instrument, the conditions under which market exclusivity is granted should be reconsidered in cases where the costs of developing an orphan drug have already been amortized through the use of the drug's active ingredient for the treatment of a common indication.","[Blankart, Carl Rudolf; Stargardt, Tom; Schreyoegg, Jonas] Univ Hamburg, Sch Business Econ & Social Sci, Inst Hlth Care Management & Hlth Econ, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Blankart, Carl Rudolf; Stargardt, Tom; Schreyoegg, Jonas] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Munich, Germany",University of Hamburg; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"Blankart, CR (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Sch Business Econ & Social Sci, Inst Hlth Care Management & Hlth Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",rudolf.blankart@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,"Schreyögg, Jonas/AAY-6182-2021; Blankart, Carl R/Q-7843-2018","Schreyögg, Jonas/0000-0001-8030-2161; Blankart, Carl R/0000-0001-6719-0038",Federal Ministry for Research and Education in Germany [BMBF 01FG09007],Federal Ministry for Research and Education in Germany,"This study was supported by a research grant from the Federal Ministry for Research and Education in Germany (grant number: BMBF 01FG09007).

Financial risk management metrics such as value at risk (VaR) can be illuminated by means of a regime-specific concept of directional entropy. This enables a change of measure via a rescaling function to an equivalent logistic distribution, one that has the same total and directional entropies at the chosen critical point. VaR rescaling adjusts the critical probability to capture the long tail entropy. The scaling function can be used as a comparative metric for tail length, or equivalent conditional value at risk, even where moments do not exist. Directional entropy can also be used to identify regions of maximal exposure to new information, which can actually increase entropy rather than collapse it.","[Bowden, Roger J.] Kiwicap Res Ltd, Wellington, New Zealand; [Bowden, Roger J.] Univ Ulm, Finsen Inst, Ulm, Germany",Ulm University,"Bowden, RJ (通讯作者)，Kiwicap Res Ltd, Wellington, New Zealand.",roger.bowden@kiwicap.co.nz,,,,,,,26,19,19,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In this paper, it is shown that, in a continuous-time market where the risky prices are described by Ito processes and the investment opportunity set is deterministic (albeit time-varying), any efficient portfolio must involve allocation to the risk-free asset at any time. As a result, the dynamic mean-variance efficient frontier, although still a straight line, is strictly above the entire risky region. This in turn suggests a positive premium, in terms of the Sharpe ratio of the efficient frontier, arising from dynamic trading. Another implication is that the inclusion of a risk-free asset boosts the Sharpe ratio of the efficient frontier, which again contrasts sharply with the single-period case.","[Chiu, Chun Hung; Zhou, Xun Yu] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xun Yu] Univ Oxford, Nomura Ctr Math Finance, Oxford OX1 3LB, England; [Zhou, Xun Yu] Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst Quantitat Finance, Oxford OX1 3LB, England",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Zhou, XY (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",zhouxy@maths.ox.ac.uk,"Chiu, Chun-Hung/V-3847-2019","Chiu, Chun Hung/0000-0002-0480-3586","RGC [CUHK 4175/03E, CUHK418605]; Croucher Senior Research Fellowship; Oxford start-up fund",RGC(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Croucher Senior Research Fellowship; Oxford start-up fund,"This research was supported by RGC Earmarked grants CUHK 4175/03E and CUHK418605, the Croucher Senior Research Fellowship, and an Oxford start-up fund.

However, specific recommendations about the type of NSAID or COX-2 could not be made due to high levels of uncertainty in the economic evaluation. Objective: To investigate the value of obtaining further evidence to inform the economic evaluation of NSAIDs, COX-2s and PPIs for people with OA. Methods: An economic evaluation with an expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analysis was conducted, using a Markov model with data identified from a systematic review. The base-case model used adverse event data from the three largest randomized trials of COX-2 inhibitors, and we repeated the analysis using observational adverse event data. The model was run for a hypothetical population of people with OA, and subgroup analyses were conducted for people with raised gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular (CV) risk. The EVPI was based upon the OA population in England approximately 2.8 million people. Of these, 50% were assumed to use NSAIDs or COX-2 selective inhibitors for 3 months per year and 56% of these were assumed to be patients with raised GI and CV risk. Results: The value of further information for this decision problem was very high. Population-level EVPI was (sic)85.1 million in the low-risk group and (sic)179.5 million in the high-risk group (2007-8 values). Expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) analysis showed that the groups of parameters for which further evidence was likely to be of most value were CV adverse event risks and all adverse event rates associated with the specific drugs celecoxib and ibuprofen. The value of perfect information remained high even when observational adverse event data were used. Conclusions: There is a very high value associated with obtaining further information on uncertain parameters for the economic evaluation of NSAIDs, COX-2 selective inhibitors and PPIs for people with OA. Obtaining further randomized or observational information on CV risks is likely to be particularly cost effective.","[Latimer, Nicholas] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Lord, Joanne] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [O'Mahony, Rachel] Royal Coll Phys London, NCC CC, London, England; [Dickson, John] Guisborough Primary Care Hosp, Redcar & Cleveland Primary Care Trust, Guisborough, England; [Conaghan, Philip G.] Univ Leeds, Sect Musculoskeletal Dis, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Conaghan, Philip G.] NIHR Leeds Musculoskeletal Biomed Res Unit, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; Brunel University; University of Leeds; Leeds Biomedical Research Centre,"Latimer, N (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",n.latimer@sheffield.ac.uk,"; Lord, Joanne/H-1417-2011","Conaghan, Philip/0000-0002-3478-5665; Lord, Joanne/0000-0003-1086-1624; Latimer, Nicholas/0000-0001-5304-5585",Pfizer; Wyeth; Novartis; NICE,Pfizer(Pfizer); Wyeth(Wyeth); Novartis(Novartis); NICE,"All authors were members of the Guideline Development Group (PGC chaired the Group, JD was the clinical advisor, RLG was NCC-CC project manager, NL was the NCC-CC health economist, JL was the NICE technical advisor and RO was the NCC-CC research fellow).

In this approach, the filter is first set up directly in continuous-time; since the filter is expressed over a continuous range of lags, we also refer to them as continuous-lag filters. The second step is to discretize the filter itself. This approach applies to different problems in signal extraction, including trend or business cycle analysis, and the method allows for coherent design of discrete filters for observed data sampled as a stock or a flow, for nonstationary data with stochastic trend, and for different sampling frequencies. We derive explicit formulas for the mean squared error (MSE) optimal discretization filters. We also discuss the problem of optimal interpolation for nonstationary processes - namely, how to estimate the values of a process and its components at arbitrary times in-between the sampling times. A number of illustrations of discrete filter coefficient calculations are provided, including the local level model (LLM) trend filter, the smooth trend model (STM) trend filter, and the Band Pass (BP) filter. The essential methodology can be applied to other kinds of trend extraction problems. Finally, we provide an extended demonstration of the method on CPI flow data measured at monthly and annual sampling frequencies.","[Trimbur, Thomas M.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [McElroy, Tucker] US Bur Census, Washington, DC 20233 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Trimbur, TM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, 20th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",thomas.m.trimbur@frb.gov,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We consider two cases of inhomogeneous portfolios. In the first case, we treat a portfolio whose assets have uniform default correlation and non-uniform default probabilities. We obtain the default probability distribution and study the effect of inhomogeneity. The second case corresponds to a portfolio with inhomogeneous default correlation. Assets are categorized into several different sectors and the inter-sector and intra-sector correlations are not the same. We construct the joint default probabilities and obtain the default probability distribution. We show that as the number of assets in each sector decreases, inter-sector correlation becomes more important than intra-sector correlation. We study the maximum values of the inter-sector default correlation. Our generalization method can be applied to any correlated binomial default distribution model that has explicit relations to the conditional default probabilities or conditional default correlations, e.g. Credit Risk+, implied default distributions.

We propose to estimate the parameter by a constrained version of an unrestricted semiparametrically efficient estimator. The main requirement for applying this method is that the initial unrestricted estimator converges in distribution. Apart from this, additional regularity conditions on the data generating process or the likelihood function, are not required. Hence the method is applicable to a broad range of models where the parameter space is constrained by inequality constraints, such as the conditional duration models. In a simulation study involving conditional duration models, the overall performance of the constrained estimator was better than its competitors, in terms of mean squared error.

The covariance is defined as a simple cross product of the returns, with weights that decay logarithmically slowly. The key general properties of the covariance matrices are the following. The spectrum of the covariance is very static, except for the top three to 10 eigenvalues, and decay exponentially fast toward zero. The mean spectrum and spectral density show no particular feature that would separate 'meaningful' from 'noisy' eigenvalues. The spectrum of the correlation is more static, with three to five eigenvalues that have distinct dynamics. The mean projector of rank k on the leading subspace shows that a large part of the dynamics occurs in the eigenvectors. Together, this implies that the reduction of the covariance to a few leading static eigenmodes misses most of the dynamics. Finally, all the analysed properties of the dynamics of the covariance and correlation are similar. This indicates that a covariance estimator correctly evaluates both volatilities and correlations, and separate estimators are not required.","Swissquote Bank, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland",,"Zumbach, G (通讯作者)，Swissquote Bank, Chemin Cretaux 33, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland.",gilles.zumbach@swissquote.ch,,,,,,,18,8,10,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We address these findings by studying a decision maker who has recursive, nonexpected utility preferences over compound lotteries. The decision maker has preferences for one-shot resolution of uncertainty if he always prefers any compound lottery to be resolved in a single stage. We establish an equivalence between dynamic preferences for one-shot resolution of uncertainty and static preferences that are identified with commonly observed behavior in Allais-type experiments. The implications of this equivalence on preferences over information systems are examined.

That is, the parameter eta is the expectation of omega inversely weighted by f(V vertical bar U), and it is the building block of various semiparametric estimators already proposed in the literature such as Lewbel (1998), Lewbel (2000b), Honore and Lewbel (2002), Khan and Lewbel (2007), and Lewbel (2007). The optimal bandwidth is derived by minimizing the leading terms of a second-order mean squared error expansion of an in-probability approximation of the resulting estimator with respect to h. The expansion also demonstrates that the bandwidth can be chosen on the basis of bias alone, and that a simple plug-in estimator for the optimal bandwidth can be constructed. Finally, the small sample performance of our proposed estimator of the optimal bandwidth is assessed by a Monte Carlo experiment.","Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Jacho-Chávez, DT (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Wylie Hall 251,100 S Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",djachoch@indiana.edu,,"Jacho-Chavez, David/0000-0003-3511-422X",,,,,34,3,3,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a semi-strong GARCH(l, 1) process to have a unique stationary solution. For the nonstationary semi-strong GARCH(l, 1) model, we prove that a local minimizer of the least absolute deviations (LAD) criterion converges at the rate root n to a normal distribution under very mild moment conditions for the errors. Furthermore, when the distributions of the errors are in the domain of attraction of a stable law with the exponent kappa is an element of (1, 2), it is shown that the asymptotic distribution of the Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) is non-Gaussian but is some stable law with the exponent kappa is an element of (0, 2). The asymptotic distribution is difficult to estimate using standard parametric methods. Therefore, we propose a percentile-t subsampiing bootstrap method to do inference when the errors are independent and identically distributed, as in Hall and Yao (2003). Our result implies that the least absolute deviations estimator (LADE) is always asymptotically normal regardless of whether there exists a stationary solution or not, even when the errors are heavy-tailed. So the LADE is more appealing when the errors are heavy-tailed.

The results show that the health spending risk drives household portfolios to shift from risky equities to safer assets and enhances the demand for annuities due to their increasing-with-age superiority over bonds in hedging against life-contingent health spending and longevity risks. Households with higher income have a greater incremental demand for life annuities. The annuities in turn provide greater leverage for equity investment in the remaining asset portfolios.

Therefore, networks could shape knowledge of an organization and create added value. Each network is formed around an overriding mission, which also determines the organizational and operating methods of the network, requirements for participants and the criteria for corresponding software to support its work. The creation of knowledge networks may create the conceptual structure for rethinking knowledge management models. The architecture of knowledge networks includes a set of tools used within social relations. These tools include both organizational tools and information and communications tools, which are used to provide various capabilities and improve knowledge processes and the process of building knowledge networks.

This study estimates the cost effectiveness of DRV/r from a US societal perspective when compared with LPV/r in treatment-experienced patients with a profile similar to those TITAN patients who had one or more International AIDS Society - USA (IAS-USA) primary protease inhibitor (PI) resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) at baseline. This population had less advanced HIV disease and a broader range of previous PI exposure/failure (0-2 PIs) at enrolment than those in the darunavir phase IIb POWER trials. Methods: An existing Markov model containing six health states defined by CD4 cell count range (>500, 351-500, 201-350, 101-200, 51-100 and 0-50 cells/mm(3)) and an absorbing state of death was adapted. Baseline demographics, CD4 cell count distribution and antiretroviral drug usage, virological response (at week 24), and immunological response estimates and matching transition probabilities were based on data collected directly from the one or more IAS-USA PI mutation subpopulation during the first 48 weeks of the TITAN trial, as well as from published literature. Patients were assumed to switch to a regimen containing tipranavir plus an optimized background regimen after treatment failure. For each CD4 cell count range or health state, the utility values, HIV and non-HIV-related mortality rates, and non-antiretroviral-related cost of HIV care estimates were derived from published literature. Unit costs were derived from official local sources. A lifetime horizon was taken in the base-case analysis. Results: The base-case analysis predicted discounted quality-adjusted survival gains of 0.493 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for DRV/r compared with LPV/r, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$23 057 per QALY gained over a lifetime horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 0.754 probability of an ICER below the threshold of US$50 000 per QALY gained. DRV/r remained cost effective over all parameter ranges tested in extensive one-way sensitivity analyses and variability analyses, which examined the impact of input parameter uncertainty and changes in model assumptions and treatment patterns, respectively. Shortening the model time horizon had the largest impact on the ICER, reducing it most notably to US$4919 with a 10-year time horizon. Conclusion: From a US societal perspective and based on an analysis of the patients with primary IAS-USA PI RAMs enrolled in the darunavir phase III TITAN trial, a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen containing DRV/r 600/100 mg bid is estimated to be a cost-effective therapy when compared with a HAART regimen containing LPV/r, for the management of treatment-experienced, PI-resistant, HIV-infected adults with a broad range of previous PI use/failure.","[Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Hlth Econ, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Smets, Erik] Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Serv LLC, Beerse, Belgium",Research Triangle Institute; Johnson & Johnson,"Mauskopf, J (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, Hlth Econ, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",jmauskopf@rti.org,,"Talbird, Sandra/0000-0003-4719-3703; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548; Brogan, Anita/0000-0002-9003-994X",Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services; Janssen-Cilag,Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services; Janssen-Cilag(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc),"The authors are grateful to Tony Vangeneugden, Ben Van Baden, Els De Paepe, Eric Lefebvre, Sabrina Spinosa-Guzman, Frank Tomaka, Piet De Doncker and the rest of the darunavir study team at Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, Mechelen, Belgium, for their contributions in analysing and generating the TITAN-specific efficacy data included in this analysis.

The market quotes for these options are typically used by exotic options traders to calibrate the parameters of the (risk-neutral) stochastic process for the underlying asset. Barrier options, of many different types, are also widely traded in all these markets but one important feature of the FX options markets is that barrier options, especially double-no-touch (DNT) options, are now so actively traded that they are no longer considered, in any way, exotic options. Instead, traders would, in principle, like to use them as instruments to which they can calibrate their model. The desirability of doing this has been highlighted by talks at practitioner conferences but, to our best knowledge (at least within the realm of the published literature), there have been no models which are specifically designed to cater for this. In this paper, we introduce such a model. It allows for calibration in a two-stage process. The first stage fits to DNT options (or other types of double barrier options). The second stage fits to vanilla options. The key to this is to assume that the dynamics of the spot FX rate are of one type before the first exit time from a 'corridor' region but are allowed to be of a different type after the first exit time. The model allows for jumps (either finite activity or infinite activity) and also for stochastic volatility. Hence, not only can it give a good fit to the market prices of options, it can also allow for realistic dynamics of the underlying FX rate and realistic future volatility smiles and skews. En route, we significantly extend existing results in the literature by providing closed-form (up to Laplace inversion) expressions for the prices of several types of barrier options as well as results related to the distribution of first passage times and of the 'overshoot'.","[Crosby, John] Univ Glasgow, Dept Econ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Carr, Peter] New York Univ, Bloomberg LP & Courant Inst, New York, NY USA",University of Glasgow; New York University,"Crosby, J (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Dept Econ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",johnc2205@yahoo.com,,,,,,,40,22,23,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Methods: Two approaches were used to evaluate the costs and benefits of prospective screening. First, the efficiency of HLA-B*5701 screening compared with no screening prior to abacavir initiation (intrinsic value of screening) was evaluated using a 60-day decision-tree model. Next, the practical value of screening was assessed using a lifetime discrete-event simulation model that compared HLA-B*5701 screening prior to abacavir use versus initiation with a tenofovir-containing regimen. Screening-effectiveness parameters were taken from an open-label trial that incorporated screening prior to abacavir initiation and other published studies. Treatment efficacy was derived from clinical trials. Modelling assumptions, costs ($US, year 2007 values) and other parameters were derived from published sources, primary data analysis and expert opinion. Multiple one-way sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainty. The primary outcome measure for the short-term screening versus no screening analysis was cost per patient. For the long-term analysis, outcomes were presented as QALYs. Costs and effects were discounted at 3% per year. Results: Over the first 60 days of treatment, prospective screening prior to abacavir initiation cost an additional $US17 per patient and avoided 537 HSRs per 10 000 patients. The per-patient cost of screening was sensitive to the cost of the genetic test, HSR costs and screening performance. In the lifetime model, screening-informed abacavir use was more effective and less costly than initiation with a tenofovir-containing regimen in the base case and in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Our results suggest that prospective HLA-B*5701 screening prior to abacavir initiation produces cost savings and should become a standard component of HIV care.","[Kauf, Teresa L.] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL USA; [Farkouh, Raymond A.; Earnshaw, Stephanie R.] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Watson, Maria E.] GlaxoSmithKline, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Maroudas, Penny; Chambers, Mike G.] GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, Middx, England",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Research Triangle Institute; GlaxoSmithKline; GlaxoSmithKline,"Kauf, TL (通讯作者)，POB 100496, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",tkauf@ufl.edu,,"Earnshaw, Stephanie/0000-0003-2975-6509","GlaxoSmithKline, Inc.

This study explores the relationship between modelled effect size, statistical precision, and efficiency gains achieved using variance reduction and an executable programming language. Methods: A published simulation model designed to model a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus based on the UKPDS 68 outcomes equations was coded in both Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and C++. Efficiency gains due to the programming language were evaluated, as was the impact of antithetic variates to reduce variance, using predicted QALYs over a 40-year time horizon. Results: The use of C++ provided a 75- and 90-fold reduction in simulation run time when using mean and sampled input values, respectively. For a series of 50 one-way sensitivity analyses, this would yield a total run time of 2 minutes when using C++, compared with 155 minutes for VBA when using mean input values. The use of antithetic variates typically resulted in a 53% reduction in the number of simulation replications and run time required. When drawing all input values to the model from distributions, the use of C++ and variance reduction resulted in a 246-fold improvement in computation time compared with VBA - for which the evaluation of 50 scenarios would correspondingly require 3.8 hours (C++) and approximately 14.5 days (VBA). Conclusions: The choice of programming language used in an economic model, as well as the methods for improving precision of model output can have profound effects on computation time. When constructing complex models, more computationally efficient approaches such as C++ and variance reduction should be considered; concerns regarding model transparency using compiled languages are best addressed via thorough documentation and model validation.","[McEwan, Phil; Tetlow, Anthony P.; Gordon, Jason P.] Cardiff Res Consortium Ltd, Cardiff CF24 0AB, S Glam, Wales; [Bergenheim, Klas] AstraZeneca, Lund, Sweden; [Yuan, Yong] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, New York, NY 10154 USA",AstraZeneca; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"McEwan, P (通讯作者)，Cardiff Res Consortium Ltd, Eastgate House,35-43 Newport Rd, Cardiff CF24 0AB, S Glam, Wales.",phil.mcewan@capita.co.uk,,,"AstraZeneca, Sweden; Bristol Myers Squibb, USA","AstraZeneca, Sweden(AstraZeneca); Bristol Myers Squibb, USA(Bristol-Myers Squibb)","This work was supported by an unrestricted grant from AstraZeneca, Sweden and Bristol Myers Squibb, USA.",,25,19,20,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,8,,,,,665,674,,10.2165/11535350-000000000-00000,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,640NZ,20524723.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281059600005,0

Objective: To determine whether DRV/r is cost effective compared with control PIs, from the perspective of Belgian, Italian, Swedish and UK reimbursement authorities, when used in treatment-experienced patients similar to those included in the POWER 1 and 2 trials. Methods: An existing Markov model containing health states defined by CD4 cell count ranges (>500, 351-500, 201-350, 101-200, 51-100 and 0-50 cells/mm(3)) and death was adapted for use in four European healthcare settings. Baseline demographics, CD4 cell count distribution and antiretroviral drug usage reflected those reported in the POWER I and 2 trials. Virological/immunological response rates and matching transition probabilities over the patient's lifetime were based on results from the POWER trials and published data. After treatment failure, patients were assumed to switch to a tipranavir-containing regimen plus OBR. For each CD4 cell count range, utility values and HIV-related mortality rates were obtained from the published literature. National all-cause mortality data and published data on the increased risk of non HIV-related mortality in HIV-infected individuals were taken into account in the model. Data from observational studies conducted in each healthcare setting were used to determine resource-use patterns and costs associated with each CD4 cell count range. Unit costs were derived from official local sources; a lifetime horizon was taken and discount rates were selected based on local guidelines. Results: In the base-case analysis, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains of up to 1.397 in Belgium, over 1.171 in Italy, 1.142 in Sweden and 1.091 in the UK were predicted when DRV/r-based therapy was used instead of control PI-based treatment. The base-case analyses predicted an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of (sic)11 438/QALY in Belgium, (sic)12 122/QALY in Italy, (sic)10 942/QALY in Sweden and (sic)16 438/QALY in the UK. Assuming an acceptability threshold of (sic)30 000/QALY, DRV/r-based therapy remained cost effective over all parameter ranges tested in extensive one-way sensitivity analyses. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed a 95% (Belgium), 97% (Italy), 92% (Sweden) or 78% (UK) probability of attaining an ICER below this threshold. Conclusion: From four European payer perspectives, DRV/r-based antiretroviral therapy is predicted to be cost effective compared with currently available control Pis, when both are used with an OBR in treatment-experienced, HIV-1-infected adults who failed to respond to more than one PI-containing regimen.","[Moeremans, Karen; Caekelbergh, Karin] IMS Hlth, Hlth Econ Outcomes Res, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Annemans, Lieven] Univ Ghent, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Lothgren, Mickael] Janssen Cilag AB, Stockholm, Sweden; [Allegri, Gabriele] Janssen Cilag SpA, Cologno Monzese, Italy; [Wyffels, Veronique] Janssen Cilag NV, Berchem, Belgium; [Hemmet, Lindsay] Tibotec, Buckingham, England; [Smets, Erik] Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Serv LLC, Mechelen, Belgium",Ghent University; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson,"Moeremans, K (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth, Hlth Econ Outcomes Res, Crayerstr 6, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",KMoeremans@be.imshealth.com,,,Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services; Janssen Cilag SpA (Italy); Janssen-Cilag NV (Belgium); Janssen-Cilag AB (Sweden); Johnson Johnson,Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services; Janssen Cilag SpA (Italy); Janssen-Cilag NV (Belgium); Janssen-Cilag AB (Sweden); Johnson Johnson(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USA),"The authors wish to thank the investigators and the patients and their families for their participation and support during the POWER studies.

Malaysia is an interesting small open economy to study because of the capital control measures imposed by the government following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. We establish foreign block exogeneity restrictions, both contemporaneously and in the lag structure to uncover the dynamic effects of monetary policy shocks on various domestic variables during the pre- and post-crisis periods and compare the impulse responses generated under the different policy regimes. The overall results suggest that the crisis and the major shift in the exchange regime have affected the Malaysian monetary transmission mechanism. In the pre- crisis period, the Malaysian monetary policy appear to be more vulnerable to foreign shocks then in the post-crisis period; while the various intermediate monetary channels played a significant role in influencing the price level and thus help to propagate the monetary shock. In the post crisis period however, these channels play a more domineering role in intensifying the effects on output.","[Raghavan, Mala; Silvapulle, Param; Athanasopoulos, George] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Monash University,,mala.raghavan@buseco.monash.edu.au; param.silvapulle@buseco.monash.edu.au; george.athanasopoulos@buseco.monash.edu.au,"Raghavan, Mala V/G-5496-2014","Raghavan, Mala V/0000-0002-4123-5004; Athanasopoulos, George/0000-0002-5389-2802",,,,,46,1,1,0,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1065,1075,,10.1109/ICMSE.2010.5719930,0.0,,,11,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100150,0

Toward an Economic Framework for Understanding Performance-Based Risk-Sharing Agreements for Innovative Medical Products,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HEALTH-CARE PROGRAMS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; DECISION-MAKING; UNCERTAINTY; GUARANTEE; PORTFOLIO,"This article examines performance-based risk-sharing agreements for pharmaceuticals from a theoretical economic perspective. We position these agreements Lis a form of coverage with evidence development. New performance-based risk sharing could produce a more efficient market equilibrium, achieved by adjustment of the price post-launch to reflect outcomes combined with a new approach to the post-launch costs of evidence collection. For this to happen, the party best able to manage or to bear specific risks must do so. Willingness to bear risk will depend not only on ability to manage it, but on the degree of risk aversion. We identify three related frameworks that provide relevant insights: value of information, real option theory and money-back guarantees. We identify four categories of risk sharing: budget impact, price discounting, outcomes uncertainty and subgroup uncertainty. We conclude that a value of information/real option framework is likely to be the most helpful approach for understanding the costs and benefits of risk sharing. There are a number of factors that are likely to be crucial in determining if performance-based or risk-sharing agreements are efficient and likely to become more important in the future: (i) the cost and practicality of post-launch evidence collection relative to pre-launch; (ii) the feasibility of coverage with evidence development without a pre-agreed contract as to how the evidence will be used to adjust price, revenues or use, in which uncertainty around the pay-off to additional research will reduce the incentive for the manufacturer to collect the information; (iii) the difficulty of writing and policing risk-sharing agreements; (iv) the degree of risk aversion (and therefore opportunity to trade) on the part of payers and manufacturers; and (v) the extent of transferability of data from one country setting to another to support coverage with evidence development in a risk-sharing framework. There is no doubt that - in principle - risk sharing can provide manufacturers and payers additional real options that increase overall efficiency. Given the lack of empirical evidence on the success of schemes already agreed and on the issues we set out above, it is too early to tell if the recent surge of interest in these arrangements is likely to be a trend or only a fad.","[Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London SW1A 2DY, England; [Garrison, Louis P., Jr.] Univ Washington, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Towse, A (通讯作者)，Off Hlth Econ, 12 Whitehall, London SW1A 2DY, England.",atowse@ohe.org,"Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014",,"UW School of Pharmacy Corporate Advisory Board; Amgen; General Electric Company; Eli Lilly Company; Genentech; Novartis AG; F.

Then with the application of the extension methods, the relationship between risks in the internationalization risk system is illustrated by divergent, correlative, implicative, expansive and conjugate analysis separately. Finally, safety measures from aspects of identifying the key risk factor, establishing the risk warning systems and setting up the risk security packages are put forward, which contribute to the effective risk control and the achievement of their internationalization objective successfully.","[Wu, Xianying; Zhu, Ziang] Harbin Engn Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Engineering University,,wuxianying@hrbeu.edu.cn; ziang59@163.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,HARBIN ENGINEERING UNIV,HARBIN,"ADMINISTRATION BLDG, 145 NANTONG ST, HARBIN, 150001, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-81133-740-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,173,179,,,,,,7,"Economics; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BWS77,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000294744000029,0

This paper based on the analysis of global ecological crisis, proposes the necessity and the importance of implementing the ecology civilized moral education to the university students, and elaborates the principle, the goal, the characteristic and the content of the university students' ecology moral education. The university student ecology moral education must insist on the scientific, practical, and comprehensive principle. Its ultimate goal is to build the university students' complete personality during the ecology moral education. Its essential feature is the humans and the nature's harmony in the value orientation, and the harmonious fusion in the behavior fosters the way. This paper focus on the primary coverage of the university students' moral education must include the ecological nature view, the harmonious development concept, and the healthy attitude towards to consumption.

This 'volatility induced by trend' constitutes a new stylized fact. The past price behaviour is measured by the product of two non-overlapping returns (of the form r x L[r] where L is the lag operator), and is different from the usual heteroskedasticity. The effect is studied empirically using USD/CHF foreign exchange data, in a large range of time horizons. On the modelling side, a set of ARCH based processes are modified in order to include the 'volatility induced by trend' effect, and their forecasting performances are compared. The aim is to understand the role and importance of the various terms that can be included in such a model. For a better forecast, it is shown that the main factor is the shape of the memory kernel (i.e. power law), and the next most important factor is the trend effect. The subtle role of mean reversion is also discussed.","RiskMetrics, CH-1213 Petit Lancy, Switzerland",,"Zumbach, G (通讯作者)，RiskMetrics, Av Morgines 12, CH-1213 Petit Lancy, Switzerland.",gilles.zumbach@riskMetrics.com,,,,,,,18,11,12,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Until recently, the consensus was that unobserved heterogeneity is very important and fertility is endogenous. Hyslop (1999) challenged this. Using a dynamic panel probit model of female labor supply including heterogeneity and state dependence, he found that adding autoregressive errors led to a substantial diminution in the importance of heterogeneity. This, in turn, meant he could not reject that fertility is exogenous. Here, we extend Hyslop (1999) to allow classification error in employment status, using an estimation procedure developed by Keane and Wolpin (2001) and Keane and Sauer (2005). We find that a fairly small amount of classification error is enough to overturn Hyslop's conclusions, leading to overwhelming rejection of the hypothesis of exogenous fertility.","[Keane, Michael P.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Keane, Michael P.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Sauer, Robert M.] Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England",University of Technology Sydney; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Bristol,"Keane, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, City Campus,POB 123,Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",michael.keane@uts.edu.au; robert.sauer@bristol.ac.uk,"Sauer, Robert M./G-6472-2012; Keane, Michael/R-6329-2019; Keane, Michael/O-2840-2013","Keane, Michael/0000-0002-3918-1377","Australian Research Council [FF0561843, DP0774247]; Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom [RES-00022-1529]; Australian Research Council [FF0561843, DP0774247] Funding Source: Australian Research Council; ESRC [RES-000-22-1529-A, RES-000-22-1529] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-1529-A] Funding Source: researchfish",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research is supported in part by the Australian Research Council, through a grant to Michael Keane (ARC Grants FF0561843 and DP0774247), and the Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom, through a grant to Robert Sauer (ESRC Grant RES-00022-1529).",,22,26,32,2,25,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2009,77.0,3,,,,,975,991,,10.3982/ECTA7642,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,448MW,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000266267700010,0

An analysis of this variance of realized variance for Sato processes shows that these processes may be suited to option contracts on realized volatility. Nonlinear pricing principles based on hedging to acceptability are outlined for the purpose of pricing structured transactions. It is shown that, typically, different products should be priced using different models. Pricing comparisons of Sato process prices with other standard models like Heston stochastic volatility, with and without jumps, VGSA, local volatility and local CGMY are also provided.

The WB yields a second-order asymptotic refinement under stochastic volatility provided we choose the external random variable used to construct the WB data appropriately.

Estonian RDP 2004-2006 period can be called as time for piloting the procedures where proposed indicators and methodologies for evaluation were applied and tested, baseline data collection started and continuous improvement of existing measures and elaboration of new measures took place. Estonia was one of the fewest countries who applied so-called whole-farm AE measure (environmentally friendly production scheme, EPS) within the RDP 2004-2006 period. Despite of its general requirements and their low impact on environment this basic AE measure contributed quite significantly to improvement and stabilization of the overall agricultural situation in the rural areas. The evaluation of RDP 2004-2006 in Estonia pointed out range of positive aspects but also weaknesses regarding chosen approach for AE scheme design in Estonia. On the one hand, some requirements of EPS (e.g. minimum 15% of legumes in the crop rotation) showed positive impact to soil fertility and to biodiversity. On the other hand, low requirements regarding fertilisation (e.g. total application of nitrogen as mineral fertilisers limited up to 170 kg ha(-1) of cultivated area) led to very high uptake of measure by bigger and more intensive farmers. One of the results showed increased use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides by AE farmers which is explicable by improved income of those farmers due to EU supports. Improved financial situation of farmers and market demand for agricultural products resulted in changed land use structure where area under arable crops increased and area of natural grasslands and permanent pastures decreased. Compulsory training component in current AE scheme has proven to be very useful facilitating farmers to better understand EU bureaucracy but also enhancing their knowledge in agri-environment related issues. AE impact studies coordinated by Agricultural Research Centre revealed that regional environmental and socio-economic conditions are very different all over Estonia, thus more narrow approach for AE scheme, which will take regional peculiarities into account, should be considered in future AE measure design. This is especially important in the light of changes in the common agricultural policy where pressure on supporting rural development will increase and more evidence is asked regarding agri-environment schemes delivering their value for money and achieving biodiversity targets.","[Koester, Tiina; Vask, Katrin; Viik, Eneli] Agr Res Ctr, Riia 24D, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Koorberg, Pille] Agr Res Ctr, Agrienvironm Monitoring Bur, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Selge, Iiri] Agr Res Ctr, EE-75501 Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia",,"Köster, T (通讯作者)，Agr Res Ctr, Riia 24D, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia.",tiina.koster@pmk.agri.ee; katrin.vask@pmk.agri.ee; pille.koorberg@pmk.agri.ee; iiri.selge@pmk.agri.ee; eneli.viik@pmk.agri.ee,"Viik, Eneli/GWV-3084-2022",,,,,,8,0,0,0,14,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,219,224,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BNL14,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845200037,0

However, comparison of these programs with regard to ease of implementing a model is lacking. Objectives: (i) to compare the assets and drawbacks of three commonly used software packages for Markov models with regard to ease of implementation; and (ii) to investigate how a technical model validation can be conducted by comparing the results of the three implementations. Methods: A Markov model on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was implemented in TreeAge, Microsoft(R) Excel and Arena(R) with the same assumptions on model structure, transition probabilities and costs. A hypothetical smoking cessation programme for patients in stage I was evaluated against usual care. The packages were compared with respect to time and effort for implementation, run-time, features for the presentation of results, and flexibility. Agreement between the packages on average costs and life-years gained and on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was considered for technical validation in the form of expected values (between TreeAge and Excel only) and Monte Carlo simulations. Results: Ease of implementation was best in TreeAge, whereas Arena(R) offered the highest flexibility. Deterministic results were in agreement between TreeAge and Excel, as were simulated values between all three packages. Conclusions: Excel offers an intuitive spreadsheet interface, but the acquisition of and the training in TreeAge or Arena(R) is worthwhile for more complex models. Double implementation is a practicable validation technique that should be conducted to ensure correct model implementation.","[Menn, Petra] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"Menn, P (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Ingolstaedter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",petra.menn@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Holle, Rolf/D-9333-2013",,,,,,19,16,18,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,9,,,,,745,753,,10.2165/11313760-000000000-00000,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,507JE,19757868.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000270848500005,0

In order to reduce the difficulty in dealing with the facts of correlation and multi-dimension of the financial indexes and meanwhile to ensure that the information is not lost, we introduced factor analysis to the mixed logit equation and thereby constructed a Factor Analysis Mixed Logit Model. Fifteen factors were extracted from original financial indexes, and four main factors which affect dramatically were selected to substitute the original financial indexes as explanatory variables. The empirical results showed that though prediction accuracy of the new method is a little lower than mixed logit model's, it can reach more than 80%.

A specific value of a given premium determines a value of the distortion parameter, which depends on the underlying loss distribution. Estimating the parameter, therefore, becomes a statistical inferential problem, which has been initiated by Jones and Zitikis [Jones, B.L., Zitikis, R., 2007. Risk measures, distortion parameters, and their empirical estimation.

Heavy-tailed losses do not fall into this framework as they rely on the extreme-value theory. In this paper, we concentrate on a special but important distortion premium, called the proportional-hazard premium, and propose an estimator for its distortion parameter in the case of heavy-tailed losses. We derive an asymptotic distribution of the estimator, construct a practically implementable confidence interval for the distortion parameter, and illustrate the performance of the interval in a simulation study.

Then, the variability and the covariance of an aggregate claim amount process is discussed. The distribution of the aggregate discounted claims is also examined. Finally, a closed-form expression for the non-ruin probability is derived in terms of a family of Appell polynomials. This formula holds for all claim distributions, even dependent.

In fact, this principle only implies (and it is implied by) quasiconvexity. For this reason, in this paper quasiconvex risk measures are studied.

Solutions for such graph games can be obtained by applying standard solutions to a modified or restricted game that takes account of the cooperation restrictions. We discuss Harsanyi solutions which distribute dividends such that the dividend shares of players in a coalition are based on power measures for nodes in corresponding communication graphs. We provide axiomatic characterizations of the Harsanyi power solutions on the class of cycle-free graph games and on the class of all graph games. Special attention is given to the Harsanyi degree solution which equals the Shapley value on the class of complete graph games and equals the position value on the class of cycle-free graph games. The Myerson value is the Harsanyi power solution that is based on the equal power measure.

We, in particular, establish the consistency and derive the limit distribution of the nonlinear least squares estimator under such endogeneity. For the regressions with various types of regression functions, it is shown that the estimator is consistent and has the same rate of convergence as for the case of the regressions with no endogeneity. Whether or not the limit distribution is affected by the presence of endogeneity, however, depends upon the functional type of the parameter derivative of regression function. If it is asymptotically homogeneous, the limit distribution of the nonlinear least squares estimator has an additional bias term reflecting the presence of endogeneity. On the other hand, the endogeneity does not have any effect on the nonlinear least squares limit theory, if the parameter derivative of regression function is integrable. Regardless of the presence of endogeneity, the least squares estimator has the same limit distribution in this case. To illustrate our theory, we consider the nonlinear regressions with logistic and power regression functions with integrated regressors that have contemporaneous correlations with the regression error.","[Chang, Yoosoon; Park, Joon Y.] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Chang, YS (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Wylie Hall Rm 105,100 S Woodlawn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",yoosoon@indiana.edu,,,"NSF [SES-0453069/0730152, SES-0518619]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are grateful to the Editor and two anonymous referees for their useful comments.

It then focuses on the problems of estimating slope coefficients in large panels, where cross-section units are subject to possibly a large number of unobserved common factors. It is established that the common correlated effects (CCE) estimator introduced by Pesaran remains asymptotically normal under certain conditions on factor loadings of an infinite factor error structure, including cases where methods relying on principal components fail. The paper concludes with a set of Monte Carlo experiments where the small sample properties of estimators based on principal components and CCE estimators are investigated and compared under various assumptions on the nature of the unobserved common effects.","[Chudik, Alexander] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Pesaran, M.

This is done by benchmarking three different neural network designs representing a Higher Order Neural Network (HONN), a Psi Sigma Network and a Recurrent Network (RNN) with three successful architectures, the traditional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), the Softmax and the Gaussian Mixture (GM) models. More specifically, the trading performance of the six models is investigated in a forecast and trading simulation competition on the EUR/USD time series over a period of 8 years. These results are also benchmarked with more traditional models such as a moving average convergence divergence technical model (MACD), an autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) and a logistic regression model (LOGIT). As it turns out, the MLP, the HONN, the Psi Sigma and the RNN models all do well and outperform the more traditional models in a simple trading simulation exercise. However, when more sophisticated trading strategies using confirmation filters and leverage are applied, the GM network produces remarkable results and outperforms all the other network architectures.","[Dunis, Christian L.; Laws, Jason; Sermpinis, Georgios] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool L3 5UZ, Merseyside, England",Liverpool John Moores University; University of Liverpool,"Laws, J (通讯作者)，Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool L3 5UZ, Merseyside, England.",j.laws@ljmu.ac.uk,,"Sermpinis, Georgios/0000-0002-7341-8913; Laws, Jason/0000-0002-0277-2018",,,,,36,35,37,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

However, it has essentially been overlooked in other subfields of economics and in the field of finance as a whole. A key element at stake is the definition of contiguity. In the context of financial markets, defining a metric distance is not a simple matter. In this article, we explore the notion of spatial dependency by formulating a spatial version of the capital asset pricing model (S-CAPM). Such a model specification makes it possible to account for alternative measures of distance between firms, such as market capitalization, the market-to-book, and other financial ratios. Our model is tested on a panel of 126 Latin American firms. In addition, we derive Value-at-Risk (VaR) measures from our S-CAPM formulation. We complement our discussion with Monte Carlo simulations aimed at quantifying the benefits of diversification in terms of VaR reduction.","[Fernandez, Viviana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Coll Engn, Min Ctr, Santiago 6904411, Chile; [Fernandez, Viviana] Trinity Coll Dublin, IIIS, Dublin, Ireland",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Trinity College Dublin,"Fernandez, V (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Coll Engn, Min Ctr, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 6904411, Chile.",vfernandez@ing.puc.cl,"Fernandez, Viviana/R-8935-2019; Fernandez, Viviana/HSE-4822-2023","Fernandez, Viviana/0000-0003-4726-2174; Fernandez, Viviana/0000-0003-4726-2174",FONDECYT [1070762],FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),Financial support from FONDECYT grant No. 1070762 is greatly acknowledged.

As a first step, we consider memory-m strategies whose action at time t depends only on the m previous observations at times t-m, ..., t-1. We introduce and study a simple model of market evolution, where strategies impact the market by their decision to buy or sell. We show that the effect of optimal strategies using memory m can lead to 'market conditions' that were not present initially, such as (1) market spikes and (2) the possibility for a strategy using memory m'>m to make a bigger profit than was initially possible.

The model improves on previous work in two respects: it covers optimal sequences of location decisions (rather than a single once-for-all choice) and it allows for many alternative location choices. The model is estimated using panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on white males with a high-school education. Our main conclusion is that interstate migration decisions are influenced to a substantial extent by income prospects. The results suggest that the link between income and migration decisions is driven both by geographic differences in mean wages and by a tendency to move in search of a better locational match when the income realization in the current location is unfavorable.","[Kennan, John; Walker, James R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kennan, John; Walker, James R.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kennan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jkennan@ssc.wisc.edu; walker@ssc.wisc.edu,,,National Science Foundation; NICHD,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"The National Science Foundation and the NICHD provided research support.

Most patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis develop SHPT, which is associated with disturbances in bone mineral metabolism and the development of fractures, cardiovascular disease and other clinical events. Standard treatment of SHPT includes phosphate binders and active vitamin D derivatives. However, standard treatment alone seldom achieves recommended target plasma or serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphorous. The addition of cinacalcet to standard therapy in patients with SHPT undergoing dialysis for ESRD improves the likelihood of achieving target biochemical levels compared with standard therapy alone. On the basis of association studies, improvements in these intermediate endpoints are likely to reduce the risk of clinical events, such as fractures and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, part of the acquisition cost of cinacalcet is likely to be offset by reductions in other healthcare resource use, such as reductions in costs associated with a lower likelihood of clinical events, as well as potential reductions in dosages of standard treatment. A number of pharmacoeconomic analyses across various country settings indicate that cinacalcet plus standard therapy is cost effective relative to standard therapy alone if dialysis costs are excluded, or that early initiation of cinacalcet is cost effective compared with delaying cinacalcet treatment until PTH levels become very uncontrolled. However, across analyses with cinacalcet, results were variable and not always favourable. This wide range of results stems from differences in selection of data sources used to populate the models, regional differences in healthcare resource use and costs, as well as other factors. Future cost-effectiveness analyses with cinacalcet should incorporate data on hard clinical outcomes from the EVOLVE study once this information becomes available.","Adis, Auckland 0754, New Zealand",Adis International,"Plosker, GL (通讯作者)，Adis, 41 Centorian Dr,Private Bag 65901, Auckland 0754, New Zealand.",demail@adis.co.nz,,,,,,,76,6,6,0,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,9,,,,,807,821,,10.2165/11207220-000000000-00000,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,822ST,21838333.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000295070600006,0

Fixed Income, 2000, 9, 43-54]. However, this model is limited in that its framework is completely static, failing to capture the dynamic evolution of the CDO. In general, portfolio credit derivatives are subject to two kinds of risk, a default event risk, when any underlying firm involved in the CDO fails to fulfill its obligations, and credit spread risk, due to the change of the default intensity over time. In dealing with either type of risk, it is absolutely necessary to develop a dynamic model incorporating the stochastic behavior of the macro-economic conditions and their influence on the default intensity. In this paper, a dynamic stochastic model is developed where the macro-economic conditions are assumed to follow a birth-death process, which would affect loss distributions characterized by a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP). By exploiting the stochastic structure of the MMPP, efficient computational procedures are established for evaluating time-dependent loss distributions and prices of the CDO. Numerical results are presented, demonstrating the potential usefulness of the model by estimating the underlying parameters based on real market data.","[Takada, Hideyuki] Mizuho DL Financial Technol Co Ltd, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1000004, Japan; [Sumita, Ushio; Takahashi, Kazuki] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan",University of Tsukuba,"Takada, H (通讯作者)，Mizuho DL Financial Technol Co Ltd, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1000004, Japan.",hideyuki-takada@ta2.so-net.ne.jp,,,,,,,10,0,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We model the defaultable stock price process as a time-changed Markov diffusion process with state-dependent local volatility and killing rate (default intensity). When the time change is a Levy subordinator, the stock price process exhibits jumps with state-dependent Levy measure. When the time change is a time integral of an activity rate process, the stock price process has local-stochastic volatility and default intensity. When the time change process is a Levy subordinator in turn time changed with a time integral of an activity rate process, the stock price process has state-dependent jumps, local-stochastic volatility, and default intensity. We develop two analytical approaches to the pricing of credit and equity derivatives in this class of models. The two approaches are based on the Laplace transform inversion and the spectral expansion approach, respectively. If the resolvent (the Laplace transform of the transition semigroup) of the Markov process and the Laplace transform of the time change are both available in closed form, the expectation operator of the time-changed process is expressed in closed form as a single integral in the complex plane. If the payoff is square integrable, the complex integral is further reduced to a spectral expansion. To illustrate our general framework, we time change the jump-to-default extended constant elasticity of variance model of Carr and Linetsky (2006) and obtain a rich class of analytically tractable models with jumps, local-stochastic volatility, and default intensity. These models can be used to jointly price equity and credit derivatives.","[Linetsky, Vadim] Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, McCormick Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Carr, Peter] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Northwestern University; New York University,"Linetsky, V (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, McCormick Sch Engn & Appl Sci, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",linetsky@iems.northwestern.edu,"Linetsky, Vadim/B-7474-2009",,"Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Moody's Investor Services; National Science Foundation [DMS-0802720]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [0802720] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Moody's Investor Services; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS))","This research was supported in part by the grants from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Moody's Investor Services, and the National Science Foundation under grant DMS-0802720.",,66,60,72,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

We then compare the asymptotic covariance matrix of the MILE obtained in this submodel with those of the M-estimators for the conditional quantile parameter that are consistent and asymptotically normal. Finally, we show that the minimum asymptotic covariance matrix of this class of M-estimators equals the asymptotic covariance matrix of the parametric submodel MILE.

The information about the uncertain duration can change during the play of the game. This is described by an uncertain duration process I similar to that defines the probability law of the signals that players receive at each stage about the duration. To each repeated game I and uncertain duration process I similar to is associated the I similar to-repeated game I(I similar to). A public uncertain duration process is one where the uncertainty about the duration is the same for all players. We establish a recursive formula for the value V (I similar to) of a repeated two-person zero-sum game I(I similar to) with a public uncertain duration process I similar to.

Gale, 1992). That paper introduces the innovation of treating as multi-dimensional the payoff of a player with a quota greater than one. This is done for the many-to-many matching model with additively separable utilities, for which the stability concept is defined. It is then proved, via linear programming, that the set of stable outcomes is nonempty and it may be strictly bigger than the set of dual solutions and strictly smaller than the core. The present paper defines a general concept of stability and shows that this concept is a natural solution concept, stronger than the core concept, for a much more general coalitional game than a matching game. Instead of mutual agreements inside partnerships, the players are allowed to make collective agreements inside coalitions of any size and to distribute his labor among them. A collective agreement determines the level of labor at which the coalition operates and the division, among its members, of the income generated by the coalition. An allocation specifies a set of collective agreements for each player.","[Sotomayor, Marilda] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Sotomayor, Marilda] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Brown University,"Sotomayor, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Av Prof Luciano Gualberto 908, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",marildas@usp.br,,,CNPq-Brazil,CNPq-Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),This paper was motivated from discussions with David Gale (1921-2008) in 1990.

Under the assumption that volatility is driven by an underlying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, we derive the integro-differential equation which the EDP function satisfies. Not surprisingly, no closed-form solution exists: however, assuming the driving OU process is fast mean-reverting, we apply the singular perturbation theory to obtain an asymptotic expansion of the Solution. Two integro-differential equations for the first two terms in this expansion are obtained and explicitly solved. When the claim size distribution is of phase-type, the asymptotic results simplify even further and we succeed in estimating the error of the approximation. Hyper-exponential and mixed-Erlang distributed claims are considered in some detail. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Jaimungal, Sebastian; Lin, X.

Lower CD4 cell counts have consistently been associated with higher direct costs of HIV patient care. The aim of this study was to analyze HIV costs of care in France at different levels of HIV-induced immune deficiency (as measured by the CD4 cell count) using recent data from treatment-experienced patients. Methods: This analysis used data from the French Hospital Database in HIV, containing data on approximately 50% of the French HIV population. Patients were included in the analysis if they had visited a participating centre from 2003 to 2005, had CD4 cell counts determined at least twice during the study period, and had been prescribed at least two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and two protease inhibitors since their first consultation. Resources consumed were counted and aggregated according to the CD4 cell count level. Standard costs were applied. Results: Periods with the lowest CD4 cell counts were associated with increased prescription rates of antiviral agents (other than anti-HIV agents), antiparasitic drugs and antimycobacterial agents. Antiretroviral treatments accounted for 80% of all medications prescribed during the study period. Hospitalization rates decreased with increasing CD4 cell counts, with 0.72 hospitalizations per patient-year for those with CD4 cell counts of 50 cells/mm(3) or less compared with 0.05 per patient-year for patients with CD4 cell counts greater than 500 cells/mm(3). There was a clear trend towards lower mean healthcare costs per patient-year with decreasing immune deficiency; from (sic)34286 to (sic)12 361. Conclusions: Our study showed an association between the degree of HIV-induced immune deficiency (measured by CD4 cell count) and the costs of managing HIV infection among highly pre-treated, HIV-infected individuals in France in the HAART era.","[Colin, Xavier; Lafuma, Antoine] Cemka, F-92340 Bourg La Reine, France; [Costagliola, Dominique] Univ Paris 06, UMR S 720, Paris, France; [Costagliola, Dominique] INSERM, Mixed Res Unit UMR S 720, Paris, France; [Lang, Jean-Marie] Strasbourg Univ Hosp, Clin Med A, Strasbourg, France; [Guillon, Pascal] Janssen Cilag SAS, Issy Les Moulineaux, France",Sorbonne Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); CHU Strasbourg; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Colin, X (通讯作者)，Cemka, 43 Blvd Marechal Joffre, F-92340 Bourg La Reine, France.",xavier.colin@cemka.fr,"Costagliola, Dominique/H-5849-2011","Costagliola, Dominique/0000-0003-0765-0869","Janssen-Cilag SAS, France; Jansen Cilag","Janssen-Cilag SAS, France; Jansen Cilag","The authors would like to thank Johann Fichou from Inserm for his contributions.

Objective: To assess the long-term costs and cost effectiveness of rituximab maintenance therapy after induction therapy versus current standard practice (observation) from the French National Health Service perspective. Methods: A lifetime transition model was developed comparing rituximab maintenance with observation PFS and OS were obtained from the EORTC 20981 trial with a median follow-up of 28 months and extrapolated from 2-year Kaplan-Meier curves using a Weibull distribution PFS and OS benefits of rituximab were conservatively assumed to last only 5 years.

In addition, we show that the INLR estimator remains consistent under these weaker smoothness assumptions if the support of the measurement error distribution expands with the sample size. In that case the estimator remains also asymptotically normal with a rate of convergence that is arbitrarily close to root n.

This paper takes the small and medium-sized enterprise board as the research object and carries out the research on the relationship between VC/PE and invested enterprise growth. Firstly, the growth rate of business income and net profit are selected as the quantitative indexes to measure the enterprise growth. Through the comparison and analysis, it is found that the enterprise with the VC/PE background will have a stronger growth capacity than the enterprise without such background. On the basis of the conclusion that VC/PE exerts advantageous influence upon the growth of enterprises, the shareholding ratio of VC/PE is regarded as the independent variable, return on equity, asset-liability ratio, total asset turnover ratio and total assets are taken as the control variables, the growth rate of business income and net profit are selected as the dependent variables. By utilizing the correlation analysis and regression analysis methods, the research indicates that the shareholding ratio of VC/PE will have a positive correlation with the growth capacity of the enterprise.","[Jiang Lei] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,619,624,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100087,0

These so-called embedded options are often dependent on or approximated by forward swap rates. In practice, these kinds of options are mostly valued by Monte Carlo simulations. However, for risk management calculations and reporting processes, lots of valuations are needed. Therefore, a more efficient method to value these options would be helpful. in this paper analytical approximations are derived for these kinds of options, based on an underlying multi-factor Gaussian interest rate model. The analytical approximation for options with direct payment is almost exact while the approximation for compounding options is also satisfactory. In addition, the proposed analytical approximation can be used as a control variate in Monte Carlo valuation of options for which no analytical approximation is available, such as similar options with management actions. Furthermore, it's also possible to construct analytical approximations when returns on additional assets (such as equities) are part of the profit sharing rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It is not known which of these represents the best value for money. Objective: To compare the cost effectiveness of home-based care (HBC), facility-based care (FBC) and mobile clinic care (MCC) for provision of ART in Uganda. Methods: Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using decision and Markov modeling of adult AIDS patients in WHO Clinical Stage 3 and 4 from the perspective of the Ugandan healthcare system. The main outcome measures were cost (year 2008 values), life expectancy in life-years (LY) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) measured as cost per QALY or LY gained over 10 years. Results: Ten-year mean undiscounted life expectancy was lowest for FBC (3.6 LY), followed by MCC (4.3 LY) and highest for HBC (5.3 LY), while the mean discounted QALYs were also lowest for FBC (2.3), followed by MCC (2.9) and highest for HBC (3.7). The 10-year mean costs per patient were lowest for FBC ($US3212), followed by MCC ($US4782) and highest for HBC ($US7033). The ICER was lower for MCC versus FBC ($US2241 per LY and $US2615 per QALY) than for HBC versus MCC ($US2251 per LY and $US2814 per QALY). FBC remained cost effective in univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: FBC appears to be the most cost-effective programme for provision of ART in Uganda. This analysis supports the implementation of FBC for scale-up and sustainability of ART in Uganda. HBC and MCC would be competitive only if there is increased access, increased adherence or reduced cost.","[Babigumira, Joseph B.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sethi, Ajay K.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI USA; [Smyth, Kathleen A.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Smyth, Kathleen A.] Univ Hosp Case Med Ctr, Neurol Outcomes Ctr, Cleveland, OH USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University Hospital,"Babigumira, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",babijo@u.washington.edu,"Babigumira, Joseph/T-4208-2019",,Fogarty International Center [D43 TW000011],Fogarty International Center(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)),This project was supported by NIH research grant # D43 TW000011 funded by the Fogarty International Center.

CEA typically adopts a system-wide perspective by focusing upon efficiency across groups in the allocation of scarce healthcare resources, whereas treatment decisions are made over individuals. However, patient preferences have been shown to have a direct impact on the outcome of an intervention via psychological factors or indirectly via patient adherence/compliance rates. Patient values may also be in conflict with the results of CEA through the valuation of benefits. CEA relies heavily on the QALY model to reflect individual preferences, although the healthy year equivalent offers an alternative measure that may be better at taking individual preferences into account. However, both measures typically use mean general population or mean patient values and therefore create conflict with individual-level preferences. For CEA to reflect practice, it must take into account the impact of individual patient preferences even where general population preferences are used to value the benefits of interventions. Patient preferences have implications for cost effectiveness through costs and outcomes, and it is important that cost-effectiveness models incorporate these through its structure (e.g. allowing for differing compliance rates) and parameter values, including clinical effectiveness. It will also be necessary to try to predict patient preferences in order to estimate any impact on cost effectiveness through analyses of revealed and stated preference data. It is recognized that policy makers are concerned with making interventions available to patients and not forcing them to consume healthcare. One way of moving towards this would be to adopt a two-part decision process: the identification of the most cost-effective therapy using mean general population values (i.e. the current rule), then also making available those treatments that are cheaper than the most cost-effective therapy.","[Brazier, John E.; Dixon, Simon] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Ratcliffe, Julie] Univ S Australia, Div Hlth Sci, Hlth Econ & Policy Grp, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",University of Sheffield; University of South Australia,"Brazier, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",j.e.brazier@shef.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017","Dixon, Simon/0000-0001-7394-7009; Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",UK MRC; MRC [MC_U145080960] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_U145080960] Funding Source: researchfish,UK MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),The authors have no conflicts of interest that are directly relevant to the content of this study.,,20,59,64,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,9,,,,,705,712,,10.2165/11314840-000000000-00000,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,507JE,19757864.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000270848500001,0

Many people say that FTA is Korean agricultural crisis. But we think that it is not a crisis but an opportunity. But to use it as opportunity, there are many things to be prepared necessarily. Even though Korea gets to the global levels on the agricultural products' technologies, it has many problems to overcome to advance into the world markets. It is possible for Korea to export to foreign countries after solving problems, keeping competitive advantage, and passing the international standards. Basically it has the economy of unit selling cost and brand power of the agricultural products. One of their serious problems is distribution structure. Not farmers but distributors make profits because of its structure though peasants cultivate farms. In some agricultural products, 30% - 40% margin of total cost is disappeared at the distribution process.(In a certain times, there is 100% or 200%) This article proposes the direct deal activation for farmers and consumers through farmers' competitive advantage as the method of solving wrong structural problems. Farmers' marketing with Korean strong IT technologies can solve existing structural problems. Then growth with overcoming crises will be replaced the infrastructure which can go agricultural products, agricultural tour, IT technologies. This paper, we present the compiler transformation of OpenMP code to an ordered collection of tasks, and the compile time as well as runtime mapping of the resulting task graph to threads for data reuse. The ordering of tasks is relaxed where possible so that the code may be executed in a more loosely synchronous fashion. Our current implementation uses a runtime system that permits tasks to begin execution as soon as their predecessors have completed.

This assessment is available through a novel model based approach, according to which an important class of highpass and bandpass filters, encompassing the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, are adapted to the particular time series under investigation. Via a suitable decomposition of the innovation process, it is shown that any linear time series with ARIMA representation can be broken down into orthogonal trend and cycle components, for which the class of filters is optimal. The main results then follow from Wiener-Kolmogorov (WK) signal extraction theory, whereas exact finite sample inferences are provided by the Kalman filter and smoother for the relevant state space representation of the decomposition.","[Proietti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, SEFEMEQ, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Proietti, T (通讯作者)，Dipartimento SEF & MEQ, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",tommaso.proietti@uniroma2.it,,"Proietti, Tommaso/0000-0001-5285-7522",Ministero dell'Istruzione; dell'Universita e della Ricerca [2002135473],"Ministero dell'Istruzione(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","The article was presented at the American Statistical Association 2004 Joint Statistical Meetings, Toronto, 8-12 August 2004, at the Econometric Seminars of Ente Luigi Einaudi, Rome, Dec. 2004, and at the Faculty of Economics and Politics, University of Cambridge, March 2005.

The hybrid method eliminates the time steps and provides a highly accurate and precise numerical solution that can be rapidly obtained. This method is superior to lattice methods when trying to solve barrier-style options. Previous studies have tried to solve barrier-style options; however, there have continually been several disadvantages. Very small time steps and stock node spaces are needed to avoid undesirable numerically induced oscillations in the solution of barrier option. In addition, all the intermediate option prices must be computed at each time step, even though one may be only interested in the terminal price of barrier-style complex options. The hybrid method may also solve more complex problems concerning barrier-style options with various boundary constraints such as options with a time-varying rebate. In order to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme, we compare our algorithm with several well-known pricing formulas of barrier-type options. The numerical results show that the hybrid method is robust, and provides a highly accurate solution and fast convergence, regardless of whether or not the initial asset prices are close to the barrier.","[Wang, Andrew Ming-Long; Liu, Yu-Hong; Hsiao, Yi-Long] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accountancy, Grad Inst Finance & Banking, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Wang, AML (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accountancy, Grad Inst Finance & Banking, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",wangml@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,"National Science Council, Taiwan [NSC 95-2416-H-006-014-]","National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We are grateful to the Editor-in-Chief and three anonymous referees for detailed comments that materially improved this paper.

Methods of RS, GIS and statistical analysis were employed. An integrated ecological risk index was built to analyze the ecological risk to landscape change in this region. The results show that the conversion of land type is mainly among agricultural land, construction land and forest land and it can strongly influence the characteristic and distribution of ecological risk, so the integrated ecological risk has been increasing from 1997 to 2008. With the economic development and urbanization course, the degree of land use will be increased and so is the ecological risk. So ecological construction and environmental protection should be adopted in this area for sustainable development.","[Wang, Wei; Hu, Yuanman; Liu, Weiling; Tai, Shanshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Dept Landscape Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS",,lnww2006@126.com,"Liu, Miao/AAH-9655-2021; Wang, Wei/JOZ-9069-2023; hu, yuan/HTL-4197-2023","Liu, Miao/0000-0002-3372-9186;",,,,,11,0,0,1,1,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,220,223,,,,,,4,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600036,0

These procedures offer alternative one-step estimators and tests that are asymptotically equivalent to their efficient two-step GMM counterparts. The basis for GEL estimation is via a smoothed version of the moment indicators using kernel function weights that incorporate a bandwidth parameter. Examples for the choice of bandwidth parameter and kernel function are provided. Efficient moment estimators based on implied probabilities derived from the GEL method are proposed, a special case of which is estimation of the stationary distribution of the data.

We propose an explicit and consistent framework for the valuation of insurance liabilities which incorporates the Solvency II approach as a special case. The proposed framework is based on replication over multiple (one-year) time periods by a periodically updated portfolio of assets with reliable market prices, allowing for limited liability in the sense that the replication can in general not always be continued. The asset portfolio consists of two parts: (1) assets whose market price defines the value of the insurance liabilities, and (2) capital funds used to cover risk which cannot be replicated. The capital funds give rise to capital costs; the main exogenous input in the framework is the condition on when the investment of the capital funds is acceptable. We investigate existence of the value and show that the exact calculation of the value has to be done recursively backwards in time, starting at the end of the lifetime of the insurance liabilities. We derive upper bounds on the value and, for the special case of replication by risk-free one-year zero-coupon bonds, explicit recursive formulas for calculating the value. In the paper, we only partially consider the question of the uniqueness of the value. Valuation in Solvency II and IFRS 4 is based on representing the value as a sum of a best estimate and a risk margin. In our framework, it turns out that this split is not natural. Nonetheless, we show that a split can be constructed as a simplification, and that it provides an upper bound on the value under suitable conditions. We illustrate the general results by explicitly calculating the value for a simple example.","Deloitte AG, Financial Risk Management, CH-8002 Zurich, Switzerland",Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited,"Möhr, C (通讯作者)，Deloitte AG, Financial Risk Management, Gen Guisan Quai 38, CH-8002 Zurich, Switzerland.",cmoehr@deloitte.ch,,,,,,,11,21,21,0,11,PEETERS,LEUVEN,"BONDGENOTENLAAN 153, B-3000 LEUVEN, BELGIUM",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,NOV,2011,41.0,2,,,,,315,341,,10.2143/AST.41.2.2136980,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,864FG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000298221800002,0

Several regularities stand out: (i) the number of French firms selling to a market, relative to French market share, increases systematically with market size; (ii) sales distributions are similar across markets of very different size and extent of French participation; (iii) average sales in France rise systematically with selling to less popular markets and to more markets. We adopt a model of firm heterogeneity and export participation which we estimate to match moments of the French data using the method of simulated moments. The results imply that over half the variation across firms in market entry can be attributed to a single dimension of underlying firm heterogeneity: efficiency. Conditional on entry, underlying efficiency accounts for much less of the variation in sales in any given market. We use our results to simulate the effects of a 10 percent counterfactual decline in bilateral trade barriers on French firms. While total French sales rise by around $16 billion (U.S.), sales by the top decile of firms rise by nearly $23 billion (U.S.). Every lower decile experiences a drop in sales, due to selling less at home or exiting altogether.","[Eaton, Jonathan] Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Kortum, Samuel] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Kramarz, Francis] ENSAE, CREST, F-92245 Malakoff, France",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Chicago; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Eaton, J (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, 608 Kern Grad Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jxe22@psu.edu; kortum@uchicago.edu; kramarz@ensae.fr,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0339085]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0820338] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Costas Arkolakis, Christopher Flinn, Jeremy Fox, Xavier d'Haultfoeuille, and Azeem Shaikh for extremely useful comments, and Dan Lu and Sebastian Sotelo for research assistance.

This elimination may take the form of starvation (the proportion of output consumed drops to zero), or may take the form of going broke (the proportion of asset held drops to zero), and these are not the same thing. Starvation may result from several causes, diverse beliefs being only one. We firstly identify and exclude these other possible causes, and then prove that starvation is equivalent to inferior belief, under suitable technical conditions. On the other hand, going broke cannot be characterized solely in terms of beliefs, as we show. We next present a remarkable example with two agents with different beliefs, in which one agent starves yet amasses all the capital, and the other goes broke yet consumes all the output-the hungry miser and the bloated bankrupt. This example also serves to show that although an agent may starve, he may have long-term impact on the prices. This relates to the notion of price impact introduced by Kogan et al. (Market selection, working paper, 2009), which we correct in the final section, and then use to characterize situations where asymptotically equivalent pricing holds.","[Nishide, Katsumasa] Yokohama Natl Univ, Int Grad Sch Social Sci, Hodogaya Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Rogers, L.

There has been considerable research on the GARCH models for dealing with these issues related to financial data. Since in practice the true error distribution is unknown, various quasi maximum likelihood methods based on different assumptions on the error distribution have been studied in the literature. However, the specification of the distribution family or in particular the shape parameter of the density function is often incorrect. This leads to an efficiency loss quite common in such estimation procedures. To avoid the inaccuracy, semi-parametric maximum likelihood approaches were introduced, where the estimators of the GARCH parameters are derived from the likelihood based on a non-parametrically estimated density function. In general, the semi-parametric likelihood function is trimmed for the extreme observations in order to derive a root n-consistent estimator. In this paper we consider the situation in which the untrimmed likelihood function is maximized to develop a new semi-parametric estimator. The resulting estimator is consistent, asymptotically Gaussian with a vanishing bias term, and a limiting variance-covariance matrix that attains the information lower bound. This work also provides insight into the efficiencies (bias-variability trade-off) of a general class of semi-parametric estimators of GARCH models.","[Di, Jianing] Johnson & Johnson PRD LLC, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Di, Jianing; Gangopadhyay, Ashis] Boston Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA; Boston University,"Di, JN (通讯作者)，Johnson & Johnson PRD LLC, 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.",jdi@its.jnj.com; ag@math.bu.edu,,,,,,,34,6,7,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

In this study, we analyse the capability of CDSs in predicting CDS prices of other companies in the same risk class or CDS prices of further time horizons. In doing so, we employ the basic forms of structural (the Merton model) and reduced-form (constant intensity) models in a cross-sectional and a time series setup. By utilizing a credit default swap dataset exclusively for estimation and out-of-sample prediction, our study also serves as a comparison between the basic forms of credit risk models. Finally, it contrasts the results with the performance of a new supervised learning forecasting technique, the Support Vector Machines Regression. We show that although the Merton and the constant intensity models handle default timing and interest rates differently, the prediction performance in cross-sectional and time series analyses is, on average, similar. In one-, five-, and 10-step-ahead predictions of time series, the machine learning algorithm significantly outperforms financial models.","[Guenduez, Yalin] Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Uhrig-Homburg, Marliese] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Finance Banking & Insurance, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany",Deutsche Bank; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Gündüz, Y (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",yalin.gunduz@bundesbank.de,"GUNDUZ, YALIN/JEF-5632-2023","Uhrig-Homburg, Marliese/0000-0003-1671-2566; Gunduz, Yalin/0000-0003-4173-3625",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are grateful to the German Research Foundation (DFG) for financial support through the Information Management and Market Engineering Program at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

The approximate biases are shown to vary in an additive and proportional way in relation to the number of exogenous variables, and they do not depend on the moments of the regressors under the correct specification of the model. This suggests a rule of thumb in testing for misspecification in GARCH models. We also extend the theoretical bias approximations given in Linton (1997) for the GARCH(1, 1). Because the expressions are not in closed form, we concentrate in detail, and for simplicity of interpretation, on the ARCH(1) model. At each stage, we check our theoretical results by simulation and generally, we find that the approximations are quite accurate for sample sizes of at least 50. We find that the biases are not trivial in some circumstances and we discuss how the bias approximations may be used, in practice, to reduce the bias. We also carry out simulations for the GARCH(1,1) model and show that the biases change as predicted by the approximations when the mean equation is augmented. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of our approach for U.S. monthly inflation rates.","[Iglesias, Emma M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Phillips, Garry D.

In a pivotal clinical trial, patients with peptic ulcer bleeding and high-risk stigmata who received intravenous esomeprazole for 72 hours following endoscopic haemostatic therapy were significantly less likely than those receiving intravenous placebo to experience recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding at days 3, 7 and 30. In addition, the need for repeat endoscopic haemostatic therapy, the total amount of blood transfused and the number of additional hospital days required because of rebleeding were significantly lower in intravenous esomeprazole recipients than in intravenous placebo recipients. All patients received oral esomeprazole for 27 days following intravenous study drug administration. Intravenous esomeprazole was generally well tolerated in the pivotal trial, with infusion-site reactions being among the most commonly reported adverse events. Two pharmacoeconomic analyses conducted from a healthcare payer perspective used decision-tree models with 30-day time horizons to examine the cost effectiveness and cost utility of intravenous esomeprazole in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers who had undergone endoscopic haemostatic therapy. With regard to the incremental cost per bleed averted, intravenous esomeprazole was predicted to be dominant in Spain and cost effective in Sweden and the US compared with no intravenous esomeprazole. Efficacy results and resource utilization data from the pivotal clinical trial were inputted into this model, and the results of the analysis were generally robust to plausible variations in key variables. In the cost-utility analysis, which was conducted in the UK and is available as an abstract and poster, esomeprazole was considered to be the most cost-effective treatment alternative, compared with omeprazole or pantoprazole. For this analysis, clinical outcomes data were obtained from a systematic review and mixed treatment comparison (given the absence of head-to-head trial data), and utility values were proxied from the literature. In conclusion, intravenous esomeprazole prevents peptic ulcer rebleeding in patients who have undergone endoscopic haemostatic therapy. Pharmaco-economic analyses support the use of intravenous esomeprazole following endoscopic haemostatic therapy in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding and high-risk stigmata.","Adis, Auckland 0754, New Zealand",Adis International,"Keating, GM (通讯作者)，Adis, 41 Centorian Dr,Private Bag 65901, Auckland 0754, New Zealand.",demail@adis.co.nz,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,6,,,,,535,543,,10.2165/11207430-000000000-00000,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,776BI,21568358.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291509100007,0

A modified QMLE (MQMLE) is also studied. This estimator is based on truncation of individual terms of the likelihood function and is related to the recent so-called self-weighted QMLE in Ling (2007b). We show that the MQMLE is asymptotically normal irrespectively of the existence of finite moments, as geometric ergodicity alone suffice. Moreover, our included simulations show that the MQMLE is remarkably well-behaved in small samples. On the other hand, the ordinary QMLE, as is well-known, requires finite fourth order moments for asymptotic normality. But based on our considerations and simulations, we conjecture that in fact only geometric ergodicity and finite second order moments are needed for the QMLE to be asymptotically normal. Finally, geometric ergodicity for AR-ARCH processes is shown to hold under mild and classic conditions on the AR and ARCH processes.","[Lange, Theis; Rahbek, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Lange, Theis; Rahbek, Anders] CREATES, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jensen, Soren Tolver] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; CREATES; University of Copenhagen,"Rahbek, A (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",anders.rahbek@econ.ku.dk,,"Lange, Theis/0000-0001-6807-8347",Danish Social Sciences Research Council [2114-04-001],Danish Social Sciences Research Council,"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Danish Social Sciences Research Council, Project Number 2114-04-001.",,40,12,12,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Furthermore, for Gaussian and Student t-copulas, tail dependence at sub-asymptotic levels is generally larger than in the limit, which can have serious consequences for estimation and evaluation of extreme risk. Finally, although correlation mixtures of Gaussian copulas inherit the property of asymptotic independence, at the same time they fall in the newly defined category of near asymptotic dependence.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group (ScHARR-TAG) at the University of Sheffield were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides details of the company's initial submission, the ERG's clarification questions and the ERG report submitted to NICE. The decision made by NICE is provided alongside a brief comment on additional results produced by a substantially different model, which were presented by the manufacturer after the production of the appraisal consultation document. The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical evidence and cost effectiveness of the technology based upon the manufacturer's submission to NICE. The clinical evidence was derived from two head-to-head, phase III, multi-arm, randomized, double blind, controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of febuxostat with fixed-dose allopurinol (300/100 mg/day) in patients with hyperuricaemia and gout. The ERG considered that the trials were of reasonable methodological quality and measured a clinically relevant range of outcomes. Although a simple pooled analysis of the individual patient-level data from the two trials was undertaken, the statistical approach for combining the data was considered inappropriate by the ERG as it failed to preserve randomization and introduced bias and confounding. There was substantial uncertainty in the relationships reported by the manufacturer regarding serum uric acid levels and the incidence of gout flares and underlying patient utility. The mathematical model developed was flawed and was not corrected despite ERG comments. It focused only on patients receiving febuxostat (80 mg/day titrated to 120 mg/day if necessary) with fixed-dose allopurinol (300/100 mg/day). Sequential treatment was not modeled, nor was titrating allopurinol to 900 mg/day, which is regarded as best practice. Numerous other errors were identified, which included the uncertain price of febuxostat being sampled within the probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Supplementary exploratory modelling addressing the position of febuxostat where patients were intolerant or contraindicated to allopurinol was provided to the NICE Appraisal Committee following the release of the appraisal consultation document. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that febuxostat be recommended as an option for the management of chronic hyperuricaemia in gout only for people who are intolerant to allopurinol or for whom allopurinol is contraindicated.","[Stevenson, Matt; Pandor, Abdullah] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Stevenson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",m.d.stevenson@shef.ac.uk,"Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [07/69/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 07/69/01) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment.

This paper provides an analytical demonstration of the consequences of multivariate stochastic covariation on the pricing of contingent claims and suggests a hedging strategy for full delta neutrality.","[Williams, Julian] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen AB24 7WQ, Scotland; [Ioannidis, Christos] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Aberdeen; University of Bath,"Williams, J (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen AB24 7WQ, Scotland.",julian.williams@abdn.ac.uk,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

More specifically, we design a filter for outliers and large jumps, and present a robust version of Mack's variance estimator. A combination of these guarantees a reasonable Mack and bootstrap error even for deficient data. Furthermore, a method is derived that allows us to remove the influence of fluctuations in earning patterns from the reserve risk estimate. It is thereby shown that the relation between underwriting and accident year based loss development patterns is given by a convolution. A numerically stable inversion thereof is obtained by means of a Tikhonov regularization. The reliability of the presented methods is verified with several loss triangles.","[Busse, Marc] SCOR Switzerland, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Busse, M (通讯作者)，SCOR Switzerland, Gen Guisan Quai 26, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland.",,,"Dacorogna, Michel/0000-0003-2176-9751",,,,,14,5,5,0,4,PEETERS,LEUVEN,"BONDGENOTENLAAN 153, B-3000 LEUVEN, BELGIUM",0515-0361,,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,NOV,2010,40.0,2,,,,,453,489,,10.2143/AST.40.2.2061124,0.0,,,37,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,710SK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286533700002,0

A popular approach for the calculation of the risk margin is the so-called cost-of-capital approach. A comprehensive cost-of-capital approach involves the consideration of multiperiod risk measures. Because multiperiod risk measures are rather complex mathematical objects, various proxies are used to estimate this risk margin. Of course, the use of proxies and the study of their quality raises many questions, see IAA position paper [8]. In the present paper we provide a first discourse on multiperiod solvency considerations for a general insurance liability runoff. Within a chain ladder framework, we derive analytic formulas for the risk margin which allow to compare the comprehensive approach to the different proxies used in practice. Moreover, a case study investigates and answers questions raised in [8].","[Salzmann, Robert; Wuethrich, Mario V.] ETH, Dept Math, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Salzmann, R (通讯作者)，ETH, Dept Math, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,22,14,15,0,7,PEETERS,LEUVEN,"BONDGENOTENLAAN 153, B-3000 LEUVEN, BELGIUM",0515-0361,,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,NOV,2010,40.0,2,,,,,415,451,,10.2143/AST.40.2.2061123,0.0,,,37,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,710SK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286533700001,0

Second, this paper looks into the price of catastrophe futures and spread option contracts that are based on a catastrophe index.

To this end, we develop a microscopic model of a stock market with finitely many heterogeneous economic agents, who trade in continuous time, giving rise to an end-ogeneous pure-jump process describing the evolution of stock prices over time. When the number of agents in the market is large, we show that the price process can be approximated by a diffusion, with price-dependent drift and volatility coefficients that are determined by small excess demands and trading volume in the microscopic model. We extend the microscopic model further by allowing for non-market interactions between agents, to model herd behavior in the market. In this case, price dynamics can be approximated by a process with stochastic volatility. Finally, we demonstrate how heavy-tailed stock returns emerge when agents have a strong tendency towards herd behavior.","[Pakkanen, Mikko S.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, POB 68, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Pakkanen, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, POB 68, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",msp@iki.fi,,"Pakkanen, Mikko/0000-0002-0696-4914",Academy of Finland [116747]; Finnish Cultural Foundation; Academy of Finland (AKA) [116747] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"I would like to thank an assistant editor and an anonymous referee for insightful comments.

It can be extended to the multivariate cases conveniently because the selection is achieved by using the one-dimensional radial distribution to capture the dependence structure for multivariate data. The Monte Carlo simulation experiments illustrate that the proposed approach works well in parameter estimation and model selection for both bivariate and multivariate cases.

When the portfolio is in a profitable situation, the insurer may pay a certain proportion of the premium income as tax payments. When the portfolio is below zero, the insurer could borrow money at a debit interest rate to continue his/her business. Meanwhile, the insurer will repay the debts from his/her premium income. The negative surplus may return to a positive level except that the surplus is below a certain critical level. In the latter case, we say that absolute ruin occurs. In this paper, we discuss absolute ruin quantities by defining an expected discounted penalty function at absolute ruin. First, a system of integro-differential equations satisfied by the expected discounted penalty function is derived. Second, closed-form expressions for the expected discounted total sum of tax payments until absolute ruin and the Laplace-Stieltjes transform (LST) of the total duration of negative surplus are obtained. Third, for exponential individual claims, closed-form expressions for the absolute ruin probability, the LST of the time to absolute ruin, the distribution function of the deficit at absolute ruin and the expected accumulated discounted tax are given. Fourth, for general individual claim distributions, when the initial surplus goes to infinity, we show that the ratio of the absolute ruin probability with tax to that without tax goes to a positive constant which is greater than one. Finally, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the absolute ruin probability of a modified risk model where the interest rate on a positive surplus is involved. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

By incorporating the natural fledging strategy of Cox and Lin (2007) and the two-factor stochastic mortality model of Cairns et al. (2006b), we calculate an optimize product mix for insurance companies to hedge against the systematic mortality risk under parameter uncertainty. To reflect the importance of required profit, we further integrate the premium loading of systematic risk. We compare the fledging results to those using the duration match method of Wang et al.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of more than 10 years of US experience with AED, both in the public and private healthcare sectors. Beginning with a discussion of the successes of private plans' conditional coverage for high-density chemotherapy for autologous bone marrow transplants for metastatic breast cancer and Medicare's conditional coverage of lung-volume-reduction surgery in the 1990s, the article moves on to describe how Medicare worked to codify AED as one of its coverage policy options in the early part of this decade. More recent private and public sector initiatives are also discussed, including an overview of barriers to implementing AED. Despite the complexity of political, financial and ethical issues faced in implementation, AED is now a permanent fixture of US coverage policy. Future initiatives within the Medicare programme and with private payers in the US are much more likely to succeed by relying upon the simple but consequential principles laid Out at a Summit convened in Banff, Alberta, Canada in 2009 and presented in another article in this issue.","[Mohr, Penny E.; Tunis, Sean R.] Ctr Med Technol Policy, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA",,"Mohr, PE (通讯作者)，Ctr Med Technol Policy, 401 E Pratt St,Suite 831, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.",penny.mohr@cmtpnet.org,,,,,,,30,41,41,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,2,,,,,153,162,,10.2165/11531050-000000000-00000,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,561YO,20085391.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000275016200006,0

One of the main clinical and economic consequences of osteoporosis is skeletal fractures. Objective: To assess the healthcare and work loss costs of US patients with non-vertebral (NV) osteoporotic fractures. Methods: Privately insured (aged 18-64 years) and Medicare (aged >= 65 years) patients with osteoporosis (ICD-9-CM code: 733.0x) were identified during 1999-2006 using two claims databases. Patients with an NV fracture (femur, pelvis, lower leg, upper arm, forearm, rib or hip) were matched randomly on age, sex, employment status and geographic region to controls with osteoporosis and no fractures. Patient characteristics and annual healthcare costs were assessed over the year following the index fracture for privately insured (n = 4764) and Medicare (n = 48 742) beneficiaries (Medicare drug costs were estimated using multivariable models). Indirect (i.e. work loss) costs were calculated for a subset of privately insured, employed patients with available disability data (n = 1148). All costs were reported in $US, year 2006 values. Results: In Medicare, mean incremental healthcare costs per NV fracture patient were $US13 387 ($US22 466 vs $US9079; p < 0.05). The most expensive patients had index fractures of the hip, multiple sites and femur (incremental costs of $US25 519, $US20 137 and $US19 403, respectively). Patients with NV non-hip (NVNH) fractures had incremental healthcare costs of $US7868 per patient ($US16 704 vs $US8836; p < 0.05). Aggregate annual incremental healthcare costs of NVNH patients in the Medicare research sample (n = 35 933) were $US282.7 million compared with $US204.1 million for hip fracture patients (n = 7997). Among the privately insured, mean incremental healthcare costs per NV fracture patient were $US5961 ($US11 636 vs $US5675; p < 0.05). The most expensive patients had index fractures of the hip, multiple sites and pelvis (incremental costs of $US13 801, $US9642 and $US8164, respectively). Annual incremental healthcare costs per NVNH patient were $US5381 ($US11090 vs $US5709; p < 0.05). Aggregate annual incremental healthcare costs of NVNH patients in the privately insured sample (n = 4478) were $US24.1 million compared with $US3.5 million for hip fracture patients (n = 255). Mean incremental work loss costs per NV fracture employee were $US1956 ($US4349 vs $US2393; p < 0.05). Among patients with available disability data, work loss accounted for 29.5% of total costs per NV fracture employee. Conclusion: The cost burden of NV fracture patients to payers is substantial. Although hip fracture patients were more costly per patient in both Medicare and privately insured samples, NVNH fracture patients still had substantial incremental costs. Because NVNH patients accounted for a larger proportion of the fracture population, they were associated with greater aggregate incremental healthcare costs than hip fracture patients.","[Pike, Crystal; Birnbaum, Howard G.; Schiller, Matt; Sharma, Hari] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Burge, Russel; Edgell, Eric T.] Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Burge, Russel] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Eli Lilly; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Birnbaum, HG (通讯作者)，111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",hbirnbaum@analysisgroup.com,"Burge, Russel/AAI-2390-2021","Burge, Russel/0000-0001-7907-6400",Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),This research project was funded by Eli Lilly and Company.

The traditional mean-variance framework for portfolio selection should, however, be revised when the investor's concern is the VaR instead of the standard deviation. This is especially true when asset returns are not normal. In this paper, we incorporate VaR in portfolio selection, and we propose a mean-VaR efficient frontier. Due to the two-objective optimization problem that is associated with the mean-VaR framework, an evolutionary multi-objective approach is required to construct the mean-VaR efficient frontier. Specifically, we consider the elitist non-dominated sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). From our empirical analysis, we conclude that the risk-averse investor might inefficiently allocate his/her wealth if his/her decision is based on the mean-variance framework.","[Tsao, Chueh-Yung] Chang Gung Univ, Dept Ind & Business Management, Tao Yuan, Taiwan",Chang Gung University,"Tsao, CY (通讯作者)，Chang Gung Univ, Dept Ind & Business Management, 259 Wen Hwa 1st Rd, Tao Yuan, Taiwan.",cytsao@mail.cgu.edu.tw,,,NSC [NSC95-2416-H-182-005-MY3],"NSC(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The author is grateful for research support from NSC grant No. NSC95-2416-H-182-005-MY3.,,27,11,14,3,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In this research, firstly the perspective for analyzing social vulnerability to large-scale flood hazard is presented by literature review. Then the assessment of social vulnerability to flood hazard is put forth, which employs spatial multi-criteria analysis approach. Finally sensitivity analysis induced by parameter uncertainty in the assessment model is analyzed, in which global sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo sampling is adopted to identify sensitive parameters contributing to model remarkably. Understanding the impacts of changes in parameter value is significant to enhance robustness in the method for measuring social vulnerability with respect to flood hazard.","[Zheng, Nanshan] China Univ Min & Technol, Key Lab Land Environm & Disaster Monitoring SBSM, Xuzhou, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology,,znshcumt@163.com; takara@mbox.kudpc.kyoto-u.ac.jp; yosuke@flood.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Yamashiki, Yosuke/D-3707-2009; Takara, Kaoru/AAR-5083-2020",,,,,,24,0,0,0,15,HARBIN ENGINEERING UNIV,HARBIN,"ADMINISTRATION BLDG, 145 NANTONG ST, HARBIN, 150001, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-81133-740-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,67,73,,,,,,7,"Economics; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BWS77,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000294744000013,0

We consider a decentralized model of trade, where agents may use money or credit to buy goods. When agents do not have access to credit and the real value of money balances is low, agents are more likely to be liquidity constrained. This makes them more concerned about their short-term earning prospects when making their consumption decisions and about their short-term spending opportunities when making their production decisions. This generates a coordination element in spending and production which leads to greater aggregate volatility and greater comovement across producers.","[Guerrieri, Veronica] Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lorenzoni, Guido] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Guerrieri, Veronica; Lorenzoni, Guido] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Guerrieri, V (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",veronica.guerrieri@chicagogsb.edu; glorenzo@mit.edu,,,,,,,27,24,30,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,NOV,2009,77.0,6,,,,,1751,1790,,10.3982/ECTA7231,0.0,,,40,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,527QC,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000272380600002,0

We estimate the presence and importance of hidden information and hidden action problems in a consumer credit market using a new field experiment methodology. We randomized 58,000 direct mail offers to former clients of a major South African lender along three dimensions: (i) an initial offer interest rate featured on a direct mail solicitation; (ii) a contract interest rate that was revealed only after a borrower agreed to the initial offer rate; and (ii) a dynamic repayment incentive that was also a surprise and extended preferential pricing on future loans to borrowers who remained in good standing. These three randomizations, combined with complete knowledge of the lender's information set, permit identification of specific types of private information problems. Our setup distinguishes hidden information effects from selection on the offer rate (via unobservable risk and anticipated effort), from hidden action effects (via moral hazard in effort) induced by actual contract terms. We find strong evidence of moral hazard and weaker evidence of hidden information problems. A rough estimate suggests that perhaps 13% to 21% of default is due to moral hazard. Asymmetric information thus may help explain the prevalence of credit constraints even in a market that specializes in financing high-risk borrowers.","[Karlan, Dean] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zinman, Jonathan] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Yale University; Dartmouth College,"Karlan, D (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, POB 208269, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",dean.karlan@yale.edu; jzinman@dartmouth.edu,,"karlan, dean/0000-0003-0164-1398",National Science Foundation; BASIS/USAID; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; FRBNY; Federal Reserve System,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); BASIS/USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); FRBNY; Federal Reserve System,"We are grateful to the National Science Foundation, BASIS/USAID, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for funding research expenses, and to the lender for implementing the experiment and financing the loans.

Specifically, for symmetric and non symmetric two-player games, a CSS in the interior of the continuous strategy space is equivalent to neighborhood half-superiority which, for a symmetric game, is connected to the half-dominance and/or risk dominance concepts. For non symmetric games where both players have a one-dimensional continuous strategy space, an interior CSS is shown to be given by a local version of dominance solvability (called neighborhood dominance solvable).

We can use the influence function to estimate the variance of the exact-bootstrap risk measure. We then extend the result to the L-estimator class, which includes the conditional tall expectation risk measure. The resulting formula provides an alternative way to estimate the variance of the bootstrapped risk measures, or the whole L-estimator class in an analytic form. A simulation study shows that this new method is comparable to the ordinary resampling-based bootstrap method, with the advantages of an analytic approach.","[Kim, Joseph H.

Over-contribution then is an outcome of utility maximization where utility depends on subjects' own payoffs as well as on the payoffs of other players. In this paper, I study to what extent this assumption of utility interdependence is responsible for over-contribution. I design three treatments where subjects' decisions cannot affect opponents' payoffs and thus utility interdependence cannot explain cooperative behavior. The main result is that while average contribution in these treatments is below the benchmark it nonetheless stays well above zero. Even when no one benefits from subjects' generosity the average contributions are as high as one third of the endowment and are only 25% below those in the benchmark level. This suggests that utility interdependence is not the main factor responsible for over-contribution.","Univ N Carolina Charlotte, Belk Coll Business, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Shapiro, DA (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina Charlotte, Belk Coll Business, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",dashapir@uncc.edu,,,Whitebox Fellowship,Whitebox Fellowship,"I would like to thank my dissertation advisor Shyam Sunder for his valuable suggestions that helped improve this paper.

By doing so, and using the exact sampling distribution of the ratio, it is straightforward to compute, examine, and compare the tests' critical values and power functions. It is shown that use of GLS detrending parameters other than those recommended in the literature can lead to substantial power improvements. The open and important question regarding the nature of the first observation is addressed.

We systematically summarized and analysed the published literature on per-patient costs of breast cancer, and highlight the perspectives, populations studied, time horizons and future directions for cost studies in breast cancer. This review included 29 US cost-of-illness studies for breast cancer. The estimates of lifetime per-patient costs of breast cancer ranged from $US20 000 to $US100 000. Payer perspectives were popular, while disease stages I and 11 were emphasized. The costs of initial and terminal therapy were greater than continuing care on a per-unit time basis, but continuing care accounts for the largest share of lifetime cost due to the relatively long survival of breast cancer patients. Costs of different surgeries were relatively similar (breast-conserving surgery vs mastectomy) but, all else equal, significant costs ($US23 000-31 000) were observed for patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who did not. Multiple studies confirmed that costs increased with increased stage of disease and costs decreased with increased age of diagnosis. The question remains whether or not lower costs for elderly patients are associated with lower quality of care. The patient, employer and societal perspectives were rarely presented. Experts in the field have recommended the societal perspective for US-based cost-effectiveness analyses. Most lifetime cost estimates were likely an underestimate for today's lifetime cost of treating breast cancer because of changes in practice patterns and improved survival. Further societal-based cost studies that differentiate costs by stage, age and treatment time (initial, continuing and terminal), and include the latest practice patterns would be valuable toward informing US-based cost-effectiveness studies for preventive as well as breast cancer treatment interventions.","[Campbell, Jonathan D.; Ramsey, Scott D.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Campbell, Jonathan D.; Ramsey, Scott D.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Ramsey, SD (通讯作者)，Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, 1100 Fairview Ave N,M3-B232, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",sramsey@fhcrc.org,"Campbell, Jonathan/C-1279-2015",,Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),"The authors were supported by a grant from Eli Lilly and Company to perform this research.

However, this approach could confound 'price effects' with 'country effects'. An alternative approach is to use multilevel modelling techniques to analyse healthcare resource use (HCRU) from the trial, and obtain country-specific total costs by applying country-specific unit costs to corresponding shrinkage estimates of differential HCRU. Methods: To illustrate the feasibility of this approach, we analysed data from twin multinational RCTs, which enrolled approximately 2000 individuals into three treatment arms for the management of patients with chronic respiratory disease. The models were implemented using Bayesian multilevel models, to reflect the hierarchical structure of the data while controlling for co-variates Lit the patient and country level. Results: This analysis showed that directly modelling the level of HCRU is a promising approach to facilitate cost-effectiveness analyses conducted alongside multinational RCTs, offering several advantages compared with the modelling of direct costs. Conclusions: It is argued that modelling the level of HCRU within the Bayesian framework avoids confounding the price effects with the country effects and facilitates the estimation of costs for several countries represented in the trial.","[Gauthier, Aline] I3 Innovus, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Manca, Andrea] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Anton, Susan] Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceut Inc, Ridgefield, CT 06877 USA",i3 Innovus; University of York - UK; Boehringer Ingelheim,"Gauthier, A (通讯作者)，3B Healey St, London NW1 8SR, England.",agauthier@amaris.com,,,Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH; i3 Innovus,Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH(Boehringer Ingelheim); i3 Innovus,"This study was sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH and conducted by i3 Innovus under contract.

Of these patients, 10-80% (average 70%) experience pain. Sativex (R) is a cannabis-based drug recently approved for neuropathic pain. Objectives: In this study, we determine individuals' preferences between two treatment options as well as the willingness to pay (WTP) for Sativex (R), expressed as the amount they would pay in insurance premiums to have access to that treatment. Methods: The WTP instrument comprised a decision board as a visual aid, and a questionnaire. A decision board helps clinicians standardize the presentation of treatment information. In this study, the decision board described two treatment options: a three-drug combination (gabapentin, amytriptyline, acetaminophen [paracetamol] {i.e. pills}) and the three-drug combination plus Sativex (R) (i.e. 'pills and oral spray'). Information on efficacy and adverse effects was taken from trial data; wording was guided by a panel of neurologists and tested for clarity on lay people. The instrument was administered to 500 participants from Canada's general population using the bidding game approach. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Results: Mean (SD) age of participants was 39 (13) years, with a female: male distribution of 56: 44. The decision board was presented in both English (85%) and French (15%). Of 500 interviewees, 253 (50.6%) chose the 'pills and oral spray'. Mean monthly WTP for the insurance premium for those who chose the 'pills and oral spray' was $Can8 (SD +/- 15, median 4, range 0-200). Conclusions: Assuming that 51 % of the general population are willing to pay additional premiums as reported in this study, the premiums collected would cover the cost of Sativex (R) for all Canadian MS patients experiencing pain, with a surplus.","[Iskedjian, Michael; Desjardins, Olivier; Piwko, Charles; Bereza, Basil; Einarson, Thomas R.] PharmIdeas Res & Consulting Inc, Oakville, ON L6M 2W1, Canada; [Iskedjian, Michael] PharmIdeas USA Inc, Buffalo, NY USA; [Jaszewski, Barbara] Bayer Healthcare, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Einarson, Thomas R.] Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON, Canada",Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals; University of Toronto,"Iskedjian, M (通讯作者)，PharmIdeas Res & Consulting Inc, 1175 N Serv Rd W, Oakville, ON L6M 2W1, Canada.",miskedjian@pharmideas.com,"Desjardins, Olivier/A-6634-2018",,Bayer Inc.,Bayer Inc.(Bayer AG),"The authors would like to acknowledge Dr Amiram Gafni, from McMaster University for scientific input in selected parts of the study, as well as Dr Adriana Costei and Rima Aziziyeh for their technical contribution.

Recently, the use of drug-eluting stents (DES) compared with the original bare metal stents (BMS) has increased ill many countries. Objective: To assess the cost effectiveness of DES versus BMS ill a real-world setting from the Belgian healthcare payer perspective. Methods: We developed a decision analysis model to estimate incremental costs (year 2004 or 2007 values [depending oil the Underlying variable]) and effectiveness. Incremental effectiveness was calculated by combining relative benefits from published meta-analyses with real-world observations from a Belgian registry. Probabilistic modelling and sensitivity analyses were performed. The model had a 1-year time horizon. Sixteen sub groups were created based oil the following characteristics: initial stent type, diabetic status, complex lesion and multi-vessel disease. Scenario analyses were performed for the influence on reinterventions and the duration of clopidogrel use. In each analysis, 1000 Monte Carlo simulations were performed. Results: The incremental costs for switching from BMS to DES are Substantial (approximately epsilon 1000), while the benefits, expressed as QALYs. are extremely small (on average <0.001 QALYs gained). This led to very high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: over epsilon 860000 per QALY gained ill all subgroups and scenario analyses. Conclusion: Comparing DES with BMS, no life-years are gained and small quality-of-life improvements are achieved for short periods, resulting, ill a high likelihood that DES are not cost effective.

But what is the true impact of health conditions in terms of on the-job productivity? This article examines the literature to assess the magnitude of presenteeism costs relative to total costs of a variety of health conditions. Searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL and PubMed were conducted in July 2008, with no starting date limitation, using 'presenteeism' or 'work limitations' as keywords. Publications on a variety of health conditions were located and included if they assessed the total healthcare and productivity cost of one or more health conditions. Literature on presenteeism has investigated its link with a large number of health conditions ranging from allergies to irritable bowel syndrome. The cost of presenteeism relative to the total cost varies by condition. In some cases (Such as allergies or migraine headaches), the cost of presenteeism is much larger than the direct healthcare cost, while in other cases (such as hypertension or cancer), healthcare is the larger component. Many more studies have examined the impact of pharmaceutical treatment on certain medical conditions and the resulting improvement in on-the-job productivity. Based on the research reviewed here, health conditions are associated with on-the-job productivity losses and presenteeism is a major component of the total employer cost of those conditions, although the exact dollar amount cannot be determined at this time. Interventions, including the appropriate use of pharmaceutical agents, may be helpful in improving the productivity of employees with certain conditions.","[Schultz, Alyssa B.; Chen, Chin-Yu; Edington, Dee W.] Univ Michigan, Hlth Management Res Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Edington, DW (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Hlth Management Res Ctr, 1015 E Huron St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.",dwe@umich.edu,,"Schultz, Alyssa/0000-0001-8149-066X",,,,,81,219,268,3,59,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,5,,,,,365,378,,10.2165/00019053-200927050-00002,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,485ZC,19586075.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269164000002,0

Consequently people in a certain distance may be wounded by the shockwave and the architectures in the dangerous range will be destroyed.

The range of calculation value produced by traditional method is larger than that produced by Monte Carlo method. This result is mainly because of random variable values in Monte Carlo method. The research verifies that Monte Carlo method can be effectively used to establish emergency decision-making model of production expansion in supply chains.

We assume that the reinsurance premium is calculated according to the expected value principle. Explicit solutions for the optimal reinsurance policies are derived over ceded loss functions with increasing degrees of generality. More precisely, we establish formally that under the VaR minimization model, (i) the stop-loss reinsurance is optimal among the class of increasing convex ceded loss functions; (ii) when the constraints on both ceded and retained loss functions are relaxed to increasing functions, the stop-loss reinsurance with an upper limit is shown to be optimal; (iii) and finally under the set of general increasing and left-continuous retained loss functions, the truncated stop-loss reinsurance is shown to be optimal. In contrast, under CVaR risk measure, the stop-loss reinsurance is shown to be always optimal. These results suggest that the VaR-based reinsurance models are sensitive with respect to the constraints imposed on both ceded and retained loss functions while the corresponding CVaR-based reinsurance models are quite robust.","[Chi, Yichun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Tan, Ken Seng] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Central University of Finance & Economics; University of Waterloo,"Chi, YC (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yichun_1982@hotmail.com; kstan@uwaterloo.ca,,"Chi, Yichun/0000-0001-9272-6471",National Natural Science Foundation of China [11001283]; 211 Project for Central University of Finance and Economics (the 3rd phase); Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities [IIJJD790004]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 211 Project for Central University of Finance and Economics (the 3rd phase); Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),Both authors would like to thank two referees for their valuable comments.

The cost of each seller is random, with common and private value components, and the seller receives a private signal about it. A Bayesian supply function equilibrium is characterized: The equilibrium is privately revealing and the incentives to rely on private signals are preserved. Supply functions are steeper with higher correlation among the cost parameters. For high (positive) correlation, supply functions are downward sloping, price is above the Cournot level, and as we approach the common value case, price tends to the collusive level. As correlation becomes maximally negative, we approach the competitive outcome. With positive correlation, private information coupled with strategic behavior induces additional distortionary market power above full information levels. Efficiency can be restored with appropriate subsidy schemes or with a precise enough public signal about the common value component. As the market grows large with the number of sellers, the equilibrium becomes price-taking, bid shading is on the order of 1/n, and the order of magnitude of welfare losses is 1/n2. The results extend to inelastic demand, demand uncertainty, and demand schedule competition. A range of applications in product and financial markets is presented.","[Vives, Xavier] Univ Navarra, IESE Business Sch, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Navarra; IESE Business School,"Vives, X (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, IESE Business Sch, Ave Pearson 21, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",XVives@iese.edu,"Vives, Xavier/B-1597-2013","Vives, Xavier/0000-0001-9110-9850","European Research Council under the European Community [230254]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation at the Public-Private Sector Research Center at IESE [CSD2006-00016, ECO2008-05155]; Barcelona GSE Research Network; Generalitat de Catalunya; European Research Council (ERC) [230254] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",European Research Council under the European Community(European Research Council (ERC)); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation at the Public-Private Sector Research Center at IESE; Barcelona GSE Research Network; Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"I am very grateful to the editor and four referees for their extensive comments and feedback.

A characterization of the set of Pareto-stable matchings for the roommate and the marriage models is provided in terms of individually rational matchings whose blocking pairs, if any, are formed with unmatched agents. These matchings always exist and give an economic intuition on how blocking can be done by non-trading agents, so that the transactions need not be undone as agents reach the set of stable matchings.

We know from Sordo (2009a) that the excess wealth order can be characterized in terms of a class of variability measures associated to the tail conditional distribution which includes, as a particular measure, the tail variance. Given that the tail conditional distribution is a particular distorted distribution, a natural question is whether this result can be extended to include other classes of variability measures associated to general distorted distributions. As we show in this paper, the answer is yes, by focusing on distorted distributions associated to concave distortion functions.

We first introduce a simplified physical model, the ideally liquid stock, to describe market price evolution and derive an operational definition of price volatility in non-stationary conditions. Using this model we perform an analysis of the information entropy which we compare with market data of stocks traded on the Italian stock exchange in Milan. This leads us to identify constraints to a procedure of entropy maximization and to describe the bulk of the volatility distribution on very general grounds. The nature of the two constraints we find is discussed and related to information available to all market participants.

Supervisors receive reports on proportions of performing and non-performing aggregate loan classes of individual banks-corporate, mortgage and consumer-often with very short history. The transition to different proportions of aggregate credit qualities can be seen as a Markov process and Christodoulakis [J. Credit Risk, 2007, 3(3), 25-39] proposed a simulation-based method for the estimation of transition probabilities under non-negativity constraints, based on the work of Kloek and van Dijk [Econometrica, 1978, 46(1), 1-19] and van Dijk and Kloek [J. Econometrics, 1980, 14, 307-328]. This paper provides Monte Carlo robustness checks for the performance of this estimator in comparison to Least Squares and Restricted Least Squares (OLS-R) in the presence of ultra-small samples. When true transition probabilities are very large or very small, the least squares estimators severely violate non-negativity restrictions, leading to a spuriously small bias as compared to Monte Carlo integration (MCI). This result is intensified for low volatility regimes and small samples. The bias of MCI diminishes in higher volatility regimes and larger samples, irrespective of the number of Bayesian replications. Regarding the accuracy statistics, we observe that the variance of every estimator increases in smaller samples and lower volatility regimes. MCI is revealed as more accurate or at least equivalent to OLS-R in all cases. Our empirical applications with real US and European data on aggregate credit portfolios revealed significant violations of non-negativity constraints by least squares methods, which contribute to favourable conclusions for MCI.","Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Christodoulakis, GA (通讯作者)，Manchester Business Sch, Crawford House,Booth St W, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",george.christodoulakis@mbs.ac.uk,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The study finds that most technical trading rules are able to capture the direction of market movements reasonably well and give significant positive returns both in long and short positions. But these returns cannot be exploited fully due to real world transaction costs. Although the transaction cost has come down over the years, various components of transaction costs due to the bid-ask spread, brokerage, etc. will never be zero. The trading rules based on short term moving averages may be able to detect trends in financial series very quickly, but those rules also generate a large number of trades causing higher transaction costs. Thus technical traders have to pay more attention to minimizing transaction costs while choosing a trading rule. Nevertheless, profit opportunities from technical analysis continue to remain an interesting and debatable issue in the Indian stock market.","Inst Management Technol, Nagpur 441502, Maharashtra, India",,"Mitra, SK (通讯作者)，Inst Management Technol, 35 Km Milestone,Katol Rd, Nagpur 441502, Maharashtra, India.",skmitra@imtnag.ac.in,,,,,,,14,23,23,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Methods: We conducted a web-based survey of a convenience sample of 35 outcomes directors of major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We asked them about their interpretation of, and experiences with, Section 114, as well as their views regarding the FDA's role in the matter, and whether the advent of comparative effectiveness research (CER) will affect the use of Section 114 promotions. Results: Of the 35 experts, 16 (46%) completed the survey. 81% stated they always or frequently consider using Section 114 when making promotional claims for drugs. 75% stated that the FDA should issue guidance on how to make such promotions to payers, especially what qualifies as healthcare economic information and competent and reliable scientific evidence. Most expected to use Section 114 to a greater extent in the future, and agreed that the increased focus on CER would increase Section 114 use. Conclusions: The survey suggests strong awareness about Section 114 among the outcomes directors and some use of the Section for promotional purposes. It also reflects a belief that CER will increase use of Section 114 promotions, and that guidance from the FDA is needed. More clarity and, ideally, flexible interpretation from the FDA is warranted, especially given the rise of CER.","[Neumann, Peter J.; Lin, Pei-Jung] Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Hughes, Tom E.] OptumInsight Life Sci, Market Access & Reimbursement, Eden Prairie, MN USA",Tufts Medical Center; Optum,"Neumann, PJ (通讯作者)，Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, 800 Washington St,Box 063, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",pneumann@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,,,Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),"Research supported by Eli Lilly and Company.

We find that the usefulness of covariance matrix estimators strongly depends on the ratio between the estimation period T and the number of stocks N, on the presence or absence of short selling, and on the performance metric considered. When short selling is allowed, several estimation methods achieve a realized risk that is significantly smaller than that obtained with the sample covariance method. This is particularly true when T/N is close to one. Moreover, many estimators reduce the fraction of negative portfolio weights, while little improvement is achieved in the degree of diversification. On the contrary, when short selling is not allowed and T>N, the considered methods are unable to outperform the sample covariance in terms of realized risk, but can give much more diversified portfolios than that obtained with the sample covariance.

The other participants used the MV rule without considering the FSD rule, although they could have used it.

This initial randomization assumption is motivated by the fact that market players cannot observe the solvency ratio accurately. We find that positive short spreads can be produced due to imperfect observation of the risk factor. The two models we have considered, the Randomized Merton (RM) and the Randomized Black-Cox (RBC) models, both have explicit expressions for the Probability of Default (PD) and Credit Spreads (CS). In the RM model, both PD and LGD are found to be of order root T, as the maturity T approaches zero. It therefore provides an example that has no well-defined default intensity but still admits positive short spreads. In the RBC model, the positive short spread is generated through the positive default intensity of the model. Because explicit formulas are available, these two Randomized Structure (RS) models are easily implemented and calibrated to market data. This is illustrated by a calibration exercise on Credit Default Swap (CDS) spread data of the Ford Motor Corporation.","[Yi, Chuang] Royal Bank Canada, Market & Trading Credit Risk, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tchernitser, Alexander] Bank Montreal BMO, Market Risk, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Hurd, Tom] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Bank of Canada; Bank of Montreal; McMaster University,"Yi, C (通讯作者)，Royal Bank Canada, Market & Trading Credit Risk, Toronto, ON, Canada.",chuang.yi@live.ca,,,,,,,17,0,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Although dependency models may be used for many risk management strategies, we focus on ratemaking. Motivation for this research comes from homeowners insurance and so, for the frequency portion, we consider binary response models. Specifically, we examine several multivariate binary regression models that have appeared in the biomedical literature, focusing on a dependence ratio model. For multivariate severity, we use Gaussian copulas to represent dependencies among gamma regressions. We calibrate competing models based on a representative sample of over 400,000 records and validate them using a held-out sample of over 350,000 records. We find that methods that allow for cross-dependencies among perils provide important economic value in pricing.","[Frees, Edward W.

It is known to characterize the Poisson, negative binomial and binomial distributions. In insurance, its main usefulness is to yield a simple recursive algorithm for the aggregate claims distribution. The present paper is concerned with the more general Lagrangian Katz family of distributions. That family satisfies an extended recursion which now depends on three parameters. To begin with, this recursion is derived through a certain first-crossing problem and two applications in risk theory are described. The distributions covered by the recursion are then identified as the generalized Poisson, generalized negative binomial and binomial distributions. A few other properties of the family are pointed out, including the index of dispersion, an extended Panjer algorithm for compound sums and the asymptotic tail behaviour. Finally, the relevance of the family is illustrated with several data sets on the frequency of car accidents. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we analyze data on claim counts provided by the General Insurance Association of Singapore, an organization consisting of most of the general insurers in Singapore. Our data comes from the financial records of automobile insurance policies followed over a period of nine years. Because the source contains a pooled experience of several insurers, we are able to study company effects on claim behavior, an area that has not been systematically addressed in either the insurance or the actuarial literatures. We analyze this intercompany experience using multilevel models. The multilevel nature of the data is due to: a vehicle is observed over a period of years and is insured by an insurance company under a fleet policy. Fleet policies are umbrella-type policies issued to customers whose insurance covers more than a single vehicle. We investigate vehicle, fleet and company effects using various count distribution models (Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated and hurdle Poisson). The performance of these various models is compared; we demonstrate how our model can be used to update a priori premiums to a posteriori premiums, a common practice of experience-rated premium calculations. Through this formal model structure, we provide insights into effects that company-specific practice has on claims experience, even after controlling for vehicle and fleet effects.","[Antonio, Katrien] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Frees, Edward W.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Valdez, Emiliano A.] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Amsterdam; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Connecticut,"Antonio, K (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.antonio@uva.nl; jfrees@bus.wisc.edu; valdez@math.uconn.edu,"FREES, EDWARD/KBC-8981-2024",,,,,,34,16,20,0,13,PEETERS,LEUVEN,"BONDGENOTENLAAN 153, B-3000 LEUVEN, BELGIUM",0515-0361,,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2010,40.0,1,,,,,151,177,,10.2143/AST.40.1.2049223,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,609AR,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000278627600006,0

We focus on holders of longevity exposures that have superior knowledge of the underlying demographic risks, but are willing to take them off their balance sheets because of capital requirements. In equilibrium, they transfer longevity risk to uninformed agents at a cost, where the cost is represented by retention of part of the exposure and/or by a risk premium. We use a signalling model to quantify the effects of asymmetric information and emphasize how they compound with parameter uncertainty. We show how the cost of private information can be minimized by suitably tranching securitized cashflows, or, equivalently, by securitizing the exposure in exchange for an option on mortality rates.

The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article summarizes the ERG's review of the evidence submitted by the manufacturer. A summary of the Appraisal Committee (AC) decision is provided. The ERG reviewed the clinical evidence in accordance with the decision problem defined by NICE. The analysis of the submitted model assessed the appropriateness of the manufacturer's approach to modelling the decision problem, the reliability of model implementation and the extent of conformity to published standards and prevailing norms of practice within the health economics modelling community. Particular attention was paid to issues likely to impact substantially on the base-case cost-effectiveness results. Clinical-effectiveness evidence was derived from a single randomized controlled trial (RCT). Results presented for clinical outcomes were strongly supportive of benefits resulting from the use of cetuximab. Cetuximab + platinum-based CTX with 5 fluorouracil (5-FU) extended median overall survival (OS) from 7.4 months in the CTX group to 10.1 months in the cetuximab + CTX group. Median progression-free survival rose from 3.3 months to 5.6 months, best overall response to therapy increased from 19.5% to 35.6%, disease control rate rose from 60% to 81.1% and median time to treatment failure was 4.8 months compared with 3.0 months. Exploratory subgroup analyses indicated significant OS benefits in 11 of 16 pre-planned analyses. The ERG identified a number of issues relating to the clinical-effectiveness results: consideration was limited to first-line use of cetuximab; patients in the trial were younger and fitter than those presenting in UK clinical practice; there was no evidence of survival advantage for patients with metastatic disease; there was no evidence of effectiveness in patients not cetuximab-naive; and the quality-of-life data were poor. The submitted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was considerably above the NICE threshold. The ERG questioned the submitted economic model on a number of grounds: the rationale for creating an economic model rather than direct analysis of trial data; the use of Weibull functions for survival models; inaccurate CTX costs; selection of health state utilities; inaccurate unit costs; and lack of mid-cycle correction. After amending the model, the ERG considered the use of cetuximab to be not cost effective for NICE at any price. The AC concluded that cetuximab in combination with platinum-based CTX should not be recommended for the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN. Patients already receiving this treatment for this indication should have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinician consider it appropriate to stop. This was the first appraisal to consider the end-of-life medicines criteria introduced by NICE in January 2009.","[Bagust, Adrian; Greenhalgh, Janette; Boland, Angela; Fleeman, Nigel; McLeod, Claire; Dickson, Rumona; Dundar, Yenal] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England; [Proudlove, Christine] NW Med Informat Ctr, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Shaw, Richard] Univ Liverpool, Sch Canc Studies, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool,"Greenhalgh, J (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Liverpool Whelan Bldg,Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England.",Janette.Greenhalgh@liv.ac.uk,"Dundar, Yenal/AAU-8336-2020; Dundar, Yenal/JZT-0760-2024","Dundar, Yenal/0000-0002-9847-1622;",National Institute for Health [08/40/01],National Institute for Health,This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 08/40/01) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment.

Objective: To determine whether there was a relationship between the source of funding and the reporting of positive results. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify economic evaluations of bisphosphonates for the treatment of osteoporosis. We extracted the source of funding, region of study, the journal name and impact factor, and all reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We identified which ICERs were under the thresholds of $US20 000, $US50 000 and $US100 000 per QALY. A quality score between 0 and 7 was also given to each of the studies. We used generalized estimating equations for the analysis. Results: The systematic review yielded 532 potential abstracts; 17 of these met our final eligibility criteria. Ten studies (59%) were funded by non-industry sources. A total of 571 ICERs were analysed. There was no significant difference between the number of industry- and non-industry-funded studies reporting ICERs below the thresholds of $US20 000 and $US50 000. However, industry-sponsored studies were more likely to report ICERs below $US100 000 (odds ratio = 4.69, 95% CI 1.77, 12.43). Studies of higher methodological quality (scoring >4.5 of 7) were less likely to report ICERs below $US20 000 and $U550000 than studies of lower methodological quality (scores <4). Methodological quality was not significantly different between studies reporting ICERs under $US100 000. Conclusions: In this relatively small sample of studies of bisphosphonates, the funding source (industry vs non-industry) did not seem to significantly affect the reporting of ICERs below the $US20 000 and $US50 000 thresholds. We hypothesize that methodological quality might be a more significant factor than the source of funding in differentiating which studies are likely to report favourable ICERs, with the higher-quality studies significantly less likely to report ICERs below $US20 000 and $US50 000 per QALY. Further research should explore this finding.","[Fleurence, Rachael L.] United BioSource Corp, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Spackman, D.

Well designed clinical trials indicate that varenicline is an effective aid to smoking cessation. During the last 4 weeks of treatment, carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence rates were generally significantly higher with varenicline than with placebo, bupropion sustained release (SR) or nicotine replacement therapy. Varenicline also reduced cravings, the reinforcing effects of smoking and some withdrawal symptoms. Another well designed trial demonstrated that extending varenicline therapy by an additional 12 weeks helped maintain abstinence in individuals who had quit smoking. Varenicline was generally well tolerated in clinical trials; nausea, the most commonly occurring adverse event, diminished over time. More data are needed regarding the potential for neuropsychiatric events in varenicline recipients. Some of these events may be associated with nicotine withdrawal, rather than varenicline, although neuropsychiatric events have been observed in individuals who continued to smoke whilst receiving varenicline. In modelled cost-effectiveness analyses based on data from clinical trials in participants receiving smoking cessation therapy, 12 weeks' treatment with varenicline was predicted to be cost effective from a healthcare payer perspective in numerous countries. With regard to the incremental costs per QALY or life-year gained, 12 weeks' treatment with varenicline consistently dominated bupropion SR and nicotine replacement therapy and was dominant over or considered cost effective relative to unaided cessation, regular brief counselling or nortriptyline in analyses based on Markov models. In additional modelled analyses from a healthcare payer perspective, administering varenicline for an additional 12 weeks in participants who had successfully quit smoking was estimated to have acceptable incremental costs per QALY gained relative to varenicline for 12 weeks and to dominate other smoking cessation options. Moreover, in Swedish analyses that also included societal costs for production and consumption, the incremental cost per QALY gained for varenicline versus bupropion SR, and for an additional 12 weeks of varenicline therapy versus varenicline for 12 weeks only, was below commonly accepted thresholds of cost effectiveness. A US decision-analytic model from the perspective of various US health insurance plans demonstrated that, after 2 years, varenicline was predicted to dominate bupropion SR, in terms of the incremental cost per additional smoking cessation. Varenicline was also dominant or cost effective versus nicotine replacement therapy, and cost effective versus unaided cessation. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results of cost-effectiveness studies were generally robust to plausible variations in key parameters. In conclusion, varenicline is an effective aid to smoking cessation. Varenicline was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, although more data are needed regarding the potential for neuropsychiatric events. The costs associated with varenicline are offset by direct savings associated with the reduction in smoking-related diseases. Despite their limitations, available pharmacoeconomic analyses from numerous countries support the use of varenicline for 12 or 24 weeks as a cost-effective treatment relative to other smoking cessation therapies in smokers who wish to quit smoking.","[Keating, Gillian M.; Lyseng-Williamson, Katherine A.] Adis Int Ltd, Auckland 10, New Zealand",Adis International,"Keating, GM (通讯作者)，Adis Int Ltd, 41 Centorian Dr,Private Bag 65901,Mairangi Bay,N, Auckland 10, New Zealand.",demail@adis.co.nz,,"Lyseng-Williamson, Katherine/0000-0002-5104-1158",,,,,92,28,28,0,19,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,3,,,,,231,254,,10.2165/11204380-000000000-00000,0.0,,,24,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,571NH,20108995.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000275758300006,0

We consider what role cost-effectiveness analysis alongside multinational trials should have in assisting reimbursement decisions at jurisdiction and national levels. Using the proposed framework as a benchmark to evaluate their relative pros and cons, we then describe and review the statistical approaches used in the multinational trial-based cost-effectiveness literature. The results of the review are used to define the desirable characteristics a statistical method for the analysis of data collected from different jurisdictions should have in order to be consistent with the proposed framework.

We present and prove closed form formulas for the value of the Bermudan put and call, with dividend, paid continuously at a constant rate, where a general number and not necessarily equal length intervals subdivide the time. Based on the obtained formulas and recent, efficient numerical integration techniques, to obtain values of the multivariate normal c.d.f., the Bermudan put and call option values are calculated for up to twenty subdividing intervals. The sequences of option values are smoothed by sums of exponential functions and the latters are used to predict the values of the American options. Numerical results are presented and compared with those, published in the literature. It is shown that the binomial method systematically overestimates the option price, and, according to our numerical results, so do many other methods.

Objective: This study modelled efficacy and safety data from the three clinical trials to evaluate the cost effectiveness to US Managed Care Organizations of add-on treatment with colesevelam for reducing diabetes-related complications. Methods: Three randomized controlled trials in patients with T2DM and one in hyperlipidaemia established that colesevelam lowered both glycaemic and lipid parameters in adult patients participating in the studies. The validated 'diabetic risk equation' (DRE) and the 'LIPID cardiovascular risk equation' (LCRE) were used to translate the observed clinical benefits (surrogate markers related to T2DM [glycosylated haemoglobin {HbA(1c)} and fasting plasma glucose] and cardiovascular disease [low-density lipoprotein cholesterol {LDL-C}]). Performing an appropriate economic evaluation required the use of both the DRE and the LCRE. These equations parameterize the clinical efficacy measures as continuous, facilitating their application to clinical trial results as well as the replication of other well established epidemiological data. Tobit regressions were applied to a large commercially available managed care administrative claims database (2000-6), Integrated Health Care Services (IHCS), to evaluate the incremental costs associated with each type of diabetic complication. Costs were inflated to 2010 values using the Healthcare Consumer Price Index, while second- and third-year cost savings were discounted at 5% to the current year. Bootstrap sampling with 5000 samples of 100 patients per cohort was conducted, varying the number of events avoided as well as their associated cost. Results: With established metformin-, insulin- or sulfonylurea-based therapies, the addition of colesevelam significantly reduced HbA(1c), by approximately 0.5% (p < 0.001) in all three studies. In addition, colesevelam reduced placebo-adjusted LDL-C by 12.8-16.7% (p < 0.001). Using the DRE and LCRE equations, the total savings from reductions in diabetes-related and cardiovascular events were $US3543, $US4074 and $US3855 for colesevelam added to metformin-, insulin- and sulfonylurea-based regimens in patients with normal lipid levels. After subtracting the cost of colesevelam, first-year savings were $US1326, $US1852 and $US1629 in the metformin, insulin and sulfonylurea studies, respectively, for patients with raised lipid levels. Conclusions: In adult patients with T2DM, the addition of colesevelam to metformin-, insulin- or sulfonylurea-based therapies significantly improves glycaemic control while also reducing LDL-C, and these improvements could translate into substantial cost reductions due to reductions in the rates of diabetes-related and cardiovascular complications.","[Simons, W.

To explore the temporal structure, we employ a new approach based on the return interval, which is defined as the time interval between two successive volatility values that are above a given threshold. We find that the distribution of the return intervals follows a scaling law over a wide range of thresholds, and over a broad range of sampling intervals. Moreover, this scaling law is universal for stocks of different countries, for commodities, for interest rates, and for currencies. However, further and more detailed analysis of the return intervals shows some systematic deviations from the scaling law. We also demonstrate a significant memory effect in the return intervals time organization. We find that the distribution of return intervals is strongly related to the correlations in the volatility.","[Wang, Fengzhong; Stanley, H.

First-line treatments are cryosurgery, topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and topical diclofenac. Where these are contraindicated or less appropriate, alternatives are imiquimod and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Objective: To compare the cost effectiveness of imiquimod and methyl aminolevulinate-based PDT (MAL-PDT) from the perspective of the UK NHS. Methods: A decision tree model was populated with data from a literature review and used to estimate costs and QALYs gained and incremental cost effectiveness over 1 year. The model simulated patients who were in secondary care, who had four to nine AK lesions, and for whom cryosurgery, 5-FU and diclofenac were contraindicated or considered less appropriate. Results: Over 1 year, imiquimod cost 174 pound less than MAL-PDT (year 2006 values) but resulted in 0.005 fewer QALYs gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of MAL-PDT over imiquimod was 34 pound 576. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there was a 75% probability that imiquimod was cost effective compared with MAL-PDT at a threshold of 20 pound 000 per QALY gained, falling to 73% at 30 pound 000. Conclusions: Imiquimod may be the more cost-effective treatment at conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds. A direct head-to-head study of MAL-PDT versus imiquimod is required to reduce uncertainty.","Univ E Anglia, Fac Hlth, Hlth Econ Grp, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Wilson, ECF (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Fac Hlth, Hlth Econ Grp, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",ed.wilson@uea.ac.uk,"Wilson, Ed/P-4310-2019; Wilson, Ed C F/N-9341-2014; Wilson, Ed/GXW-3327-2022","Wilson, Ed/0000-0002-8369-1577; Wilson, Ed C F/0000-0002-8369-1577; Wilson, Ed/0000-0002-8369-1577",Meda Pharmaceuticals Ltd,Meda Pharmaceuticals Ltd,"The author received a fee from Meda Pharmaceuticals Ltd to undertake this work.

Thereafter, we develop new bootstrap-corrected estimations for the optimal return and its asset allocation and prove that these bootstrap-corrected estimates are proportionally consistent with their theoretic counterparts.

The numerical simulation of such models is usually performed by Monte Carlo methods which suffer from a slow and erratic convergence, though. As alternatives to Monte Carlo simulation, we propose and investigate in this article the use of deterministic integration schemes, such as quasi-Monte Carlo and sparse grid quadrature methods. Numerical experiments with different ALM models for portfolios of participating life insurance products demonstrate that these deterministic methods often converge faster, are less erratic and produce more accurate results than Monte Carlo simulation even for small sample sizes and complex models if the methods are combined with adaptivity and dimension reduction techniques. In addition, we show by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) that ALM problems are often of very low effective dimension which provides a theoretical explanation for the success of the deterministic quadrature methods.

As mortality improvement has become an increasingly significant source of financial risk, it has become important to measure the uncertainty in the forecasts. Probabilistic confidence intervals provided by the widely accepted Lee-Carter model are known to be excessively narrow, due primarily to the rigid structure of the model. In this paper, we relax the model structure by considering individual differences (heterogeneity) in each age-period cell. The proposed extension not only provides a better goodness-of-fit based on standard model selection criteria, but also ensures more conservative Interval forecasts of central death rates and hence can better reflect the uncertainty entailed.

The Received May 2008 management has the possibility of investing part of the surplus in a risky asset. We consider that the risky asset is a stock whose price process is a geometric Brownian motion. Our aim is to find a dynamic choice of the investment policy which minimizes the ruin probability of the company. We impose that the ratio between the amount invested in the risky asset and the surplus should be smaller than a given positive bound a. For instance the case a = 1 means that the management cannot borrow money to buy stocks. [Hipp, C., Plum, M., 2000. Optimal investment for insurers.

Probab. 12, 890-907] solved this problem without borrowing constraints. They found that the ratio between the amount invested in the risky asset and the surplus goes to infinity as the surplus approaches zero, so the optimal strategies of the constrained and unconstrained problems never coincide. We characterize the optimal value function as the classical solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. This equation is a second-order non-linear integro-differential equation. We obtain numerical solutions for some claim-size distributions and compare our results with those of the unconstrained case. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Moore, KS",,,,"Moore, Kristen S.",,,Optimal surrender strategies for equity-indexed annuity investors,INSURANCE MATHEMATICS & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Optimal investment; Optimal stopping; Free boundary problem; Equity-indexed annuity,RISK,"An equity-indexed annuity (EIA) is a hybrid between a variable and a fixed annuity that allows the investor to participate in the stock market, and earn at least a minimum interest rate. The investor sacrifices some of the upside potential for the downside protection of the minimum guarantee. Because EIAs allow investors to participate in equity growth without the downside risk, their popularity has grown rapidly. An optimistic EIA owner might consider surrendering an EIA contract, paying a surrender charge, and investing the proceeds directly in the index to earn the full (versus reduced) index growth, while using a risk-free account for downside protection. Because of the popularity of these products, it is important for individuals and insurers to understand the optimal policyholder behavior. We consider an EIA investor who seeks the surrender strategy and post-surrender asset allocation strategy that maximizes the expected discounted utility of bequest. We formulate a variational inequality and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation that govern the optimal surrender strategy and post-surrender asset allocation strategy, respectively. We examine the optimal strategies and how they are affected by the product features, model parameters, and mortality assumptions. We observe that in many cases, the no-surrender region is an interval (w(i), w(u)); i.e., that there are two free boundaries. In these cases, the investor surrenders the EIA contract if the fund value becomes too high or too low. In other cases, there is only one free boundary; the lower (or upper) surrender threshold vanishes. In these cases, the investor holds the EIA, regardless of how low (or high) the fund value goes. For a special case, we prove a succinct and intuitive condition on the model parameters that dictates whether one or two free boundaries exist. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We apply the approximate results to the spatial autoregressive model and find that our results approximate the non-normal behaviours of the maximum likelihood estimator reasonably well. However, when the weights matrix becomes denser, the finite sample distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator departs more severely from normality and our results provide less accurate approximation.","[Bao, Yong] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ullah, Aman] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Bao, Y (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ybao@purdue.edu; aman.ullah@ucr.edu,"ullah, aman/JQW-5104-2023; Bao, Yong/R-7795-2016","ullah, aman/0000-0002-7822-9222; Bao, Yong/0000-0001-6513-1683",,,,,16,2,4,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1368-4221,,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Our general, local parametric approach particularly applies to general varying-coefficient parametric models, such as GARCH, whose coefficients may arbitrarily vary with time. Global parametric, smooth transition and change-point models are special cases. The method is based on an adaptive pointwise selection of the largest interval of homogeneity with a given right-end point by a local change-point analysis. We construct locally adaptive estimates that can perform this task and investigate them both from the theoretical point of view and by Monte Carlo simulations. In the particular case of GARCH estimation, the proposed method is applied to stock-index series and is shown to outperform the standard parametric GARCH model.","[Cizek, P.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & OR, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Haerdle, W.] Humboldt Univ, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Haerdle, W.] CASE, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Spokoiny, V.] Humboldt Univ, Weierstrass Inst, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Spokoiny, V.] CASE, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Tilburg University; Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis & Stochastics,"Cízek, P (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & OR, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",P.Cizek@uvt.nl; haerdle@wiwi.hu-berlin.de; spokoiny@wias-berlin.de,"Härdle, Wolfgang K/C-5963-2013; Spokoiny, Vladimir/AAF-4942-2021","Spokoiny, Vladimir/0000-0002-2040-3427; Cizek, Pavel/0000-0003-4120-7705; Hardle, Wolfgang Karl/0000-0001-5600-3014",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 649],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the SFB 649 'Economic Risk'.,,34,17,19,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1368-4221,,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

The paper first discusses limitations of previous generalizations. Then a state-space formulation is used to obtain a new multisignal generalization of the Jewitt (1988) conditions. Next, using the Mirrlees formulation, new multisignal generalizations of the convexity of the distribution function condition (CDFC) approach of Rogerson (1985) and Sinclair-DesgagnE (1994) are obtained. Vector calculus methods are used to derive easy-to-check local conditions for our generalization of the CDFC. Finally, we argue that the Jewitt conditions may generalize more flexibly than the CDFC to the multisignal case. This is because, with many signals, the principal can become very well informed about the agent's action and, even in the one-signal case, the CDFC must fail when the signal becomes very accurate.","Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Mississippi,"Conlon, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, University, MS 38677 USA.",jrconlon@olemiss.edu,,,,,,,26,43,46,0,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2009,77.0,1,,,,,249,278,,10.3982/ECTA6688,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,383ZG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000261712400009,0

Although Value at Risk as a risk measure has been criticized by some researchers for lack of subadditivity, it is still a central tool in banking regulations and internal risk management in the finance industry. In contrast, Expected Shortfall is coherent and convex, so it is a better measure of risk than Value at Risk. Expected Shortfall is widely used in the insurance industry and has the potential to replace Value at Risk as a standard risk measure in the near future. We have proposed regime switching models to measure value at risk and expected shortfall for a single financial asset as well as financial portfolios. Our models capture the volatility clustering phenomenon and variance-independent variation in the higher moments by assuming the returns follow Student-t distributions.","[Elliott, Robert J.] Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Elliott, Robert J.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Math, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Miao, Hong] Colorado State Univ, Finance & Real Estate Dept, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",University of Calgary; University of Adelaide; Colorado State University,"Elliott, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",relliott@ucalgary.ca,"Miao, Hong/A-7807-2014","Miao, Hong/0000-0001-7502-7433; Elliott, Robert/0000-0002-5486-6999",,,,,22,7,11,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In this study, firstly, the semi-variance real estate investment portfolio model with the risk preference coefficient is constructed. The return per unit of risk is the key factor to affect an investment decision. Secondly, a self-adaptive ant colony optimization (SACO) with changing parameters based on mean information entropy of the ant system has been employed to solve the constructed model, which overcomes the intrinsic weakness of premature of the basic ant colony optimization (ACO) and selecting parameters. Finally, a real-world case study is carried out to verify the performance of SACO, and indicates that SACO can generate better solution than GA.

The approach should be appealing to applied researchers for three reasons. First, econometric applications involving endogenous switching abound. Secondly, the approach requires neither linearity of the regression function nor full parametric specification of the model. It can, in fact, be applied under the minimal parametric assumptionsi.e., specification of only the conditional means of the outcome and switching variables. Finally, it is amenable to relatively straightforward estimation methods. Examples of applications of the method are discussed.","Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Dept Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Terza, JV (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Dept Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",jvt@ichp.ufl.edu,,,,,,,29,19,31,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the global Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimator are established under conditions comparable to those recently used in the corresponding linear case.

We analyze the properties of the stochastic dynamics, and show in particular that the log-spot prices possess a stationary distribution defined as a normal variance-mixture model. Furthermore, the stochastic volatility model allows for explicit forward prices, which may produce a hump structure inherited from the mean-reversion of the stochastic volatility. Although the spot price dynamics has continuous paths, the forward prices will have a jump dynamics, where jumps occur according to changes in the volatility process. We compare with the popular Heston stochastic volatility dynamics, and show that the Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard model provides a more flexible framework in describing commodity spot prices.

Bayesian inference based on simulated likelihood can be widely applied in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and financial econometrics. One way of generating unbiased estimates of the likelihood is through a particle filter. We illustrate these methods on four problems, producing rather generic methods.

The augmented system consists of the inverse probability weighted (IPW) original moment restriction and an additional conditional moment restriction which exhausts all other implications of the MAR assumption. The paper also investigates the value of additional semiparametric restrictions on the conditional expectation function (CEF) of the original moment function given always observed covariates. In the program evaluation context, for example, such restrictions are implied by semiparametric models for the potential outcome CEFs given baseline covariates. The efficiency bound associated with this model is shown to also coincide with that of a particular moment condition problem. Some implications of these results for estimation are briefly discussed.","[Graham, Bryan S.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Graham, Bryan S.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Graham, BS (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 19 W 4th St 6FL, New York, NY 10012 USA.",bryan.graham@nyu.edu,"Graham, Bryan S/H-4515-2011","Graham, Bryan/0000-0002-9637-5282",,,,,39,28,31,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2011,79.0,2,,,,,437,452,,10.3982/ECTA7379,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,720YI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000287318200003,0

We obtain a time-varying January effect that is, in general, positive and significant in both volatility regimes. However, this effect is larger in the high-volatility regime. In sharp contrast with most of the previous literature, we find two major results: (1) the January effect exists for all sizes of portfolio; (2) the negative correlation between the magnitude of the January effect and portfolio size fails across volatility regimes. Moreover, our evidence supports a slight decline in the January effect for all sizes of portfolio except the smallest, for which it is even larger.","[Agnani, Betty; Aray, Henry] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Granada 18011, Spain",University of Granada,"Aray, H (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus Cartuja S-N, Granada 18011, Spain.",haray@ugr.es,"Aray, Henry/L-7127-2014","Aray, Henry/0000-0001-6081-0441","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science; Junta de Andalucia [SEJ2007-62081/ECON, SEJ-2547]",Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"The authors would like to thank participants in the XVI International Tor Vergata Conference on Banking and Finance and two anonymous referees for comments.

However, to our knowledge, no published studies have yet evaluated the cost effectiveness of any treatments for CHB in a Canadian setting, where relative prices and management of CHB differ from those in Europe. Aim: Our objective was to determine the cost effectiveness of tenofovir DF compared with other nucleos(t)ide therapies licensed for CHB in Canada from the perspective of publicly funded healthcare payers. Methods: A Markov model was used to calculate the costs and benefits of nucleos(t)ide therapy in three groups of patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and -negative CHB: nucleos(t)ide-naive patients without cirrhosis; nucleos(t)ide-naive patients with compensated cirrhosis; and lamivudine-resistant patients. Disease progression was modelled as annual transitions between 18 disease states. Transition probabilities, quality of life and costs were based on published studies. Health benefits were measured in QALYs. The reference year for costs was 2007 and costs and outcomes were discounted at 5% per annum. Results: First-line tenofovir DF was the most effective nucleos(t)ide strategy for managing CHB, generating 6.85-9.39 QALYs per patient. First-line tenofovir DF was also the most cost-effective strategy in all patient subgroups investigated, costing between $Can43 758 and $Can48 015 per QALY gained compared with lamivudine then tenofovir. First-line tenofovir DF strongly dominated first-line entecavir. Giving tenofovir DF monotherapy immediately after lamivudine resistance developed was less costly and more effective than any other active treatment strategy investigated for lamivudine-resistant CHB, including second-line use of adefovir or adefovir + lamivudine. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated 50% confidence that first-line tenofovir DF is the most cost-effective nucleos(t)ide strategy for treatment-naive patients with CHB, at a $Can50 000 per QALY threshold, and confirmed that first-line tenofovir DF has the highest expected net benefits. Conclusions: First-line tenofovir DF appears to be the most cost-effective nucleos(t)ide treatment for both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic CHB patients in Canada, providing that society is willing to pay at least $Can48 015 per QALY gained, although sensitivity analyses highlighted uncertainty around the results.","[Dakin, Helen; Fidler, Carrie; Bentley, Anthony] Abacus Int, Bicester OX26 6HR, Oxon, England; [Dakin, Helen] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Dept Publ Hlth, Oxford, England; [Sherman, Morris; Fung, Scott] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Sherman, Morris; Fung, Scott] Univ Hlth Network, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Oxford; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto,"Dakin, H (通讯作者)，Abacus Int, 6 Talisman Rd, Bicester OX26 6HR, Oxon, England.",Helen.Dakin@abacusint.com,"Dakin, Helen A/X-2860-2018","Dakin, Helen A/0000-0003-3255-748X",Gilead Canada,Gilead Canada,The authors thank Christie Harper for design advice and editing assistance and Gilead Canada for funding the research.,,71,8,9,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,12,,,,,1075,1091,,10.2165/11589260-000000000-00000,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,856CG,22077579.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297613700006,0

A European Analysis,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COMPETITION; SAVINGS,"Background: After the expiry of patents for originator medicines, generic medicines can enter the market, and price competition may occur. This process generates savings to the healthcare payer and to patients, but knowledge about the factors affecting price competition in the pharmaceutical market following patent expiry is still limited. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the market share of generic medicines and the change of the medicine price, level in European off-patent markets. Methods: Data on medicine volumes and values for 35 active substances were purchased from IMS Health. Ex-manufacturer prices were used, and the analysis was limited to medicines in immediate-release, oral, solid dosage forms. Countries included were Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK, which constitute a mix of countries with low and high generic medicines market shares. Data were available from June 2002 until March 2007. Results: Market volume has risen in both high and low generic market share countries (+29.27% and +27.40%, respectively), but the cause of the rise is different for the two markets. In low generic market share countries, the rise was caused by the increased use of generic medicines, while in high market share countries, the rise was driven by the increased use of generic medicines and a shift of use from originator to generic medicines. Market value was substantially decreased in high generic market share countries (-26.6%), while the decrease in low generic market share countries was limited (-0.06%). In high generic market share countries, medicine prices dropped by 43.18% versus 21.56% in low market share countries. Conclusions: The extent to which price competition from generic medicines leads to price reductions appears to vary according to the market share of generic medicines. High generic market share countries have seen. a larger decrease in medicine prices than low market share countries.","[Dylst, Pieter; Simoens, Steven] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Ctr Pharmaceut Care & Pharmacoecon, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Dylst, P (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Ctr Pharmaceut Care & Pharmacoecon, O&N2,PO 521,Herestr 49, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",pieter.dylst@pharm.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,22,66,70,0,38,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,10,,,,,875,882,,10.2165/11585970-000000000-00000,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,833OR,21797288.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000295895300005,0

The day-of-the-week effects are measured for both unconditional and conditional expected returns and volatilities. Robustness of the results is analysed using two sub-periods. The conditional model accounts for asymmetry in first-order autocorrelation of both the common European market index and the country-specific indexes. The time period spans from January 2000 through December 2006. The results indicate that the asymmetry, especially in volatility, is a common characteristic carried by the European market index, whereas the conditional day-of-the-week effects are local, robust and country specific.","[Hogholm, Kenneth; Knif, Johan] Swedish Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance & Stat, HANKEN Sch Econ, FIN-65101 Vaasa, Finland; [Pynnonen, Seppo] Univ Vaasa, Dept Stat, FIN-65101 Vaasa, Finland",Hanken School of Economics; University of Vaasa,"Knif, J (通讯作者)，Swedish Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance & Stat, HANKEN Sch Econ, POB 287, FIN-65101 Vaasa, Finland.",johan.knif@hanken.fi,,,Evald and Hilda Nissi foundation; Broderna Ernst och Lars Krogius research foundation,Evald and Hilda Nissi foundation; Broderna Ernst och Lars Krogius research foundation,"The authors wish to thank the Evald and Hilda Nissi foundation and the Broderna Ernst och Lars Krogius research foundation for financial support.

The company can invest its surplus into a Black-Scholes risky asset and a risk free asset. We impose investment restrictions that only a limited amount is allowed in the risky asset and that no short-selling is allowed. We further assume that when the surplus level becomes negative, the company can borrow to continue financing. The ultimate objective is to seek an optimal investment strategy that minimizes the probability of absolute ruin, i.e. the probability that the liminf of the surplus process is negative infinity. The corresponding Hamilton-jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is analyzed and a verification theorem is proved; applying the NB method we obtain explicit expressions for the S-shaped minimal absolute ruin function and its associated optimal investment strategy. In the second part of the paper, we study the optimization problem with both investment and proportional reinsurance control. There the minimal absolute ruin function and the feedback optimal investment-reinsurance control are found explicitly as well. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, several methods of synthesizing data exist and the choice of method may affect the cost-effectiveness estimates. Objectives: To investigate the impact of the different methods of metaanalysis on final estimates of cost effectiveness from a probabilistic Markov model for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: We compared four different methods to synthesize data for the parameters of a cost-effectiveness model for COPD: frequentist and Bayesian fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) meta-analyses. These methods were applied to obtain new transition probabilities between stable disease states and new event probabilities. Results: The four methods resulted in different estimates of probabilities and their standard errors (SE). The effects of using different synthesis techniques were most prominent in the estimation of the SEs. We found up to 9-fold differences in SEs of the exacerbation probabilities and up to almost 3-fold differences in SEs of the transition probabilities. We found that the frequentist FE model produced the lowest SEs, whereas the Bayesian RE model produced the highest for all parameters. The estimates of differences between treatments in total costs, QALYs and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC) also varied depending on the synthesis method. The CEAC was 15% lower with a Bayesian RE model than with any of the other models. Conclusions: Health economic modellers should be aware that the choice of synthesis technique can affect resulting model parameters considerably, which can in turn affect estimates of cost effectiveness and the uncertainty around them.","[Oppe, Mark; Al, Maiwenn; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Oppe, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",oppe@bmg.eur.nl,"Al, Maiwenn J/E-3272-2014; Molken, Maureen PMH Rutten-van/G-8481-2014; Molken, Maureen Rutten-van/X-8712-2019","Al, Maiwenn J/0000-0001-9763-0436; Molken, Maureen PMH Rutten-van/0000-0001-8706-3159; Molken, Maureen Rutten-van/0000-0001-8706-3159",Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH,Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH(Boehringer Ingelheim),"This research was sponsored by an unrestricted grant from Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH.

One of the reasons for this is the practical difficulties in the estimation of these costs. While some methods have been proposed to estimate indirect medical costs in a standardized manner, these methods fail to take into account that not all costs in life-years gained can be estimated in such a way. Costs in life-years gained caused by diseases related to the intervention are difficult to estimate in a standardized manner and should always be explicitly modelled. However, costs of all other (unrelated) diseases in life-years gained can be estimated in such a way. We propose a conceptual model of how to estimate costs of unrelated diseases in life-years gained in a standardized manner. Furthermore, we describe how we estimated the parameters of this conceptual model using various data sources and studies conducted in the Netherlands. Results of the estimates are embedded in a software package called 'Practical Application to Include future Disease costs' (PAID 1.0). PAID 1.0 is available as a Microsoft (R) Excel tool (available as Supplemental Digital Content via a link in this article) and enables researchers to 'switch off' those disease categories that were already included in their own analysis and to estimate future healthcare costs of all other diseases for incorporation in their economic evaluations. We assumed that total healthcare expenditure can be explained by age, sex and time to death, while the relationship between costs and these three variables differs per disease. To estimate values for age-and sex-specific per capita health expenditure per disease and healthcare provider stratified by time to death we used Dutch cost-of-illness (COI) data for the year 2005 as a backbone. The COI data consisted of age-and sex-specific per capita health expenditure uniquely attributed to 107 disease categories and eight healthcare provider categories. Since the Dutch COI figures do not distinguish between costs of those who die at a certain age (decedents) and those who survive that age (survivors), we decomposed average per capita expenditure into parts that are attributable to decedents and survivors, respectively, using other data sources.","[van Baal, Pieter H.

Location profiles offer more detailed information than top location profiles, which in turn are better than policy profiles. We prove criteria to ensure that a better quality of risk profile leads to a lower price. These criteria are discussed with respect to standard exposure rating and an alternative method called 'burning cost-adjusted exposure rating', where the loss ratio is adjusted by means of the burning cost of a low reference layer. Further, we introduce a family of analytic exposure curves, the so-called EP exposure curves.

The term DWB is coined to reflect the duality between it and dynamic fund protection. Under the Black-Scholes framework and using results pertaining to reflected Brownian motion, we obtain explicit pricing formulas for the DWB payment stream and the maturity guarantee. These pricing formulas are also derived by means of Esscher transforms, which is another seminal contribution by Gerber to finance. In particular, we show that there are closed-form formulas for pricing European put and call options on a traded asset whose price can be modeled as the exponential of a reflected Brownian motion.

A generalization of the well-known Gerber-Shiu function is proposed by incorporating the maximum surplus level before ruin into the penalty function. For this wider class of penalty functions, we show that the generalized Gerber-Shiu function can be expressed in terms of the original Gerber-Shiu function (see e.g. [Gerber, Hans U., Shiu, Elias, S.W., 1998. On the time Value of ruin. North American Actuarial journal 2(1), 48-72]) and the Laplace transform of a first passage time which are both readily available. The generalized Gerber-Shiu function is also shown to be closely related to the original Gerber-Shiu function in the same MAP risk model subject to a dividend barrier strategy. The simplest case of a MAP risk model, namely the classical compound Poisson risk model, will be studied in more detail. In particular, the discounted joint density of the surplus prior to ruin, the deficit at ruin and the maximum surplus before ruin is obtained through analytic Laplace transform inversion of a specific generalized Gerber-Shiu function.

(2006). The surplus of an insurance company (before dividends) is modeled as a time-homogeneous Markov chain with possible changes of size +1, 0, -1. -2, -3..... If a barrier strategy is applied for paying dividends, it is shown that the dividends-penalty identity holds. The identity expresses the expected present value of a penalty at ruin in terms of the expected discounted dividends until ruin and the expected present value of the penalty at ruin if no dividends are paid. For the problem of maximizing the difference between the expected discounted dividends until ruin and the expected present value of the penalty at ruin, barrier strategies play a prominent role. In some cases an optimal dividend barrier exists. The paper discusses in detail the special case where the distribution of the change in surplus does not depend on the current surplus (so that in the absence of dividends the surplus process has independent increments). A closed-form result for zero initial surplus is given, and it is shown how the relevant quantities can be calculated recursively. Finally, it is shown how optimal dividend strategies can be determined; typically, they are band strategies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Despite great advances in cancer therapies, many of these patients develop non-curable metastases. The objective of cancer treatment in the metastatic setting is mainly to control symptoms and to prolong survival. The selection of the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen is affected by performance status, tumour biology, site and extent of the disease and the exposure to prior therapies. Recent developments in new kinds of cancer drugs have contributed not only to immense progress in clinical outcomes but also to dramatically increased treatment-related health costs. Cost-effectiveness analysis is a type of economic evaluation that compares costs and health outcomes of alternative intervention strategies in a systematic way. In this review, a systematic literature search was performed and the evidence on the cost effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapy for metastatic breast cancer was explored. Cost-effectiveness/-utility analysis of treatment regimens for metastatic breast cancer were identified using literature and reference searches (MEDLINE). Published reports on conventional and targeted cancer therapies were scrutinized and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were abstracted. Furthermore, the quality of reporting, as well as methodological and modeling issues, were extensively discussed. From full-text article reviews, six cost-effectiveness analyses on conventional therapies and seven studies on targeted therapies were included. Eight analyses were conducted in European countries, three in the US and two in Canada. The economic models were primarily (69%) based on clinical trial data. Results from sensitivity analyses and study perspectives were reported by all studies. Discount rates were mentioned in five articles (39%). The methods of reporting costs and effects varied considerably, as did trial design across conventional chemotherapies, which made it difficult to compare those analyses. The pharmacoeconomic studies came to different conclusions. The actual clinical evidence does not suggest one conventional chemotherapy regimen as superior. Studies on cytotoxic agents showed mainly favourable cost-effectiveness ratios. Targeted therapies indicated both favourable and non-favourable ratios. Currently, trastuzumab is the only antibody-based targeted therapy that is established in the clinic for the metastatic setting.","[Blank, Patricia R.] Univ Zurich, Inst Social & Prevent Med, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland; [Dedes, Konstantin J.] Univ Zurich Hosp, Dept Gynecol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [Szucs, Thomas D.] Univ Basel, Inst Pharmaceut Med, ECPM, Basel, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Zurich; University Zurich Hospital; University of Basel,"Blank, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Social & Prevent Med, Hirschengraben 84, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",patricia.blank@ifspm.uzh.ch,"Dedes, Konstantin/AAK-1281-2021","Blank, Patricia/0000-0002-0180-3468; Szucs, Thomas/0000-0003-0195-3316",,,,,59,19,19,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,8,,,,,629,647,,10.2165/11535560-000000000-00000,0.0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,640NZ,20524722.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281059600003,0

To this end, we study the statistics of the return intervals between gains (or losses) above a certain threshold Q. In the case of i.i.d. random numbers the probability density function (pdf) of the return intervals decays exponentially and the return intervals are uncorrelated. Here we show that the nonlinear correlations lead to a power law decay of the pdf and linear long-term correlations between the return intervals that are described by a power-law decay of the corresponding autocorrelation function. From the pdf of the return intervals one obtains the risk function W-Q (t; Delta t), which is the probability that within the next Delta t units of time at least one event above Q occurs, if the last event occurred t time units ago. We propose an analytical estimate of W-Q and show explicitly that the proposed method is superior to the conventional precursory pattern recognition technique widely used in signal analysis, which requires considerable fine-tuning and is difficult to implement.

The results shows that: if the two ports in the procession of regionalization implement non-cooperative game strategy profile, there is excessive competition when the two ports maximize its own profit to select optimal location of port area, moreover the best port charge is in proportion to port service quality. When cooperative game strategy profile is implemented, the location of the new port area will tend to disperse in order to adopt differential strategy, the difference between the optimal port charges is proportional to the intensity of network externality and the difference between the best service qualities, however is inversely proportional to the extent of compatibility and the difference between the distances to the port of destination. Furthermore, the optimal overall service quality of port regionalization depends on the network externality, compatibility and land's unit transportation cost, with no respect to the distance to the port of destination, the differentiation of the optimal service quality in positive correlation with the difference between the distances to the port of destination.","[Dong Gang] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China",Shanghai Maritime University,,,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,825,830,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100114,0

This is made difficult by the apparent lack of objective means to measure the balance and by limitations regarding each of the two items. Benefit is sometimes measured by surrogate indicators of a real clinical advantage. It is assumed to be applicable to individuals even though it is measured in populations, and is represented in different ways that may convey different messages to physicians and patients. Risks are also hard to predict on an individual level. They may also be overlooked or revealed later than benefit, thus biasing the balance for a long time. Their causal relationship with the treatment is often not fully established. The benefit-risk balance itself has no generally recognized measure. This is why benefits and risks are hard to compare; either one or both may occur in single patients, and a risk-benefit profile that is acceptable in severe diseases may not be acceptable in diseases with a favourable prognosis. Pharmacoeconomics offers promising methods of health outcomes modelling using QALYs that take into consideration quality of life as well as survival. Primarily conceived as a guide for establishing the value of a treatment, they may prove useful as a means of trading efficacy and safety. However, quality of life is not always - or adequately - assessed in clinical studies. It is also not clear which is the most appropriate model to calculate QALYs for clinical purposes and how it can be used as a predictive tool at the individual level.","Mario Negri Inst Pharmacol Res, I-20156 Milan, Italy",Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS,"Garattini, S (通讯作者)，Mario Negri Inst Pharmacol Res, Via Giuseppe La Masa 19, I-20156 Milan, Italy.",silvio.garattini@marionegri.it,"Garattini, Silvio/AAA-6390-2020","Garattini, Silvio/0000-0003-0647-9297",,,,,36,11,11,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,11,,,,,981,986,,10.2165/11537590-000000000-00000,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,677DL,20681742.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000283969200002,0

There are generally two directions one could proceed: combination of forecasts (CF) or combination of information (CI). CF combines forecasts generated from simple models each incorporating a part of the whole information set, while CI brings the entire information set into one super model to generate an ultimate forecast. Through linear regression analysis and simulation, we show the relative merits of each, particularly the circumstances where forecast by CF can be superior to forecast by CI, when CI model is correctly specified and when it is misspecified, and shed some light on the success of equally weighted CF. In our empirical application on prediction of monthly, quarterly, and annual equity premium, we compare the CF forecasts (with various weighting schemes) to CI forecasts (with principal component approach mitigating the problem of parameter proliferation). We find that CF with (close to) equal weights is generally the best and dominates all CI schemes, while also performing substantially better than the historical mean.","[Lee, Tae-Hwy] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Huang, Huiyu] PanAgora Asset Management, Boston, MA USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; Panagora Asset Management,"Lee, TH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",taelee@ucr.edu,,,,,,,42,42,47,0,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Then based on hypercycle theory and Nonaka's SECI model, we analyzed the three hierarchies of a knowledge-creating hypercycle: reaction cycle, catalytic cycle and catalytic hypercle, so as to understand the mechanism of how a company creates new knowledge. In analysis, we primarily focused on the coupling and cross catalysis amongst the elements of knowledge-creating process.

Second it estimates the terrain complexity with membership function rested on altitude and slope and sets up a relationship between terrain complexity and the construction of road investment, which analyses the effect of terrain conditions on road infrastructure investments. Third it proposes a regional direction to optimize road allocation according to both the road facilities stock of RA and unit Investment ratio of highway construction. The allocation of road facilities in the future should improve per capita RA and per economic output value of RA under the constraint of investment to achieve equalization in road construction versus socio-economic services.

Using monthly data from 1980 to 2008, the relationship between tax revenue, stock market as proxies by direct tax revenue and KLCI respectively and economic growth in Malaysia is modeled using the Granger causality and VECM framework. Results support Levine's theory and reveal that over the sample period both tax revenue and stock market affect pattern of economic growth in Malaysia. These findings indicate that strong growth can be achieved through booming of stock market activities and the high revenue collection.

Although decision makers frequently rely on models to evaluate the long-term costs and consequences associated with diabetes interventions, no recent article has reviewed the methods used in long-term cost-effectiveness models of diabetes treatment. The following databases were searched up to April 2008 to identify published economic models evaluating treatments for diabetes mellitus: OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Thomson's Biosis Previews, NHS EED via Wiley's Cochrane Library, and Wiley's HEED database. Identified articles were reviewed and grouped according to unique models. When a model was applied in different settings (e.g. country) or compared different treatment alternatives, only the original publication describing the model was included. In some cases, subsequent articles were included if they provided methodological advances from the original model. The following data were captured for each study: (i) study characteristics; (ii) model structure; (iii) long-term complications, data sources, methods reporting and model validity; (iv) utilities, data sources and methods reporting; (v) costs, data sources and methods reporting; (vi) model data requirements; and (vii) economic results including methods to deal with uncertainty. A total of 17 studies were identified, 12 of which allowed for the conduct of a cost-effectiveness analysis and a cost-utility analysis. Although most models were Markov-based microsimulations, models differed with respect to the number of diabetes-related complications included. The majority of the studies used a lifetime time horizon and a payer perspective. The DCCT for type I diabetes and the UKPDS for type 2 diabetes were the trial data sources most commonly cited for the efficacy data, although several non-randomized data sources were used. While the methods used to derive the efficacy data were commonly reported, less information was given regarding the derivation of the utilities or the costs. New interventions were generally deemed cost effective based on ten studies presenting results. Authors relied mostly on univariate sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of their models. Although diabetes is a complex disease, several models have been developed to predict the long-term costs and consequences associated with diabetes treatment. Combined with previous findings, this review supports the development of a reference case that could be used for any new diabetes models. Models could be enhanced if they had the capacity to deal with both first- and second-order uncertainty. Future research should continue to compare economic models for diabetes treatment in terms of clinical outcomes, costs and QALYs when applicable.","[Tarride, Jean-Eric; Hopkins, Robert; Blackhouse, Gord; Bowen, James M.; Bischof, Matthias; Von Keyserlingk, Camilla; O'Reilly, Daria; Xie, Feng; Goeree, Ron] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, PATH Res Inst, Hamilton, ON L8P 1H1, Canada; [Tarride, Jean-Eric; Hopkins, Robert; Blackhouse, Gord; Bowen, James M.; Bischof, Matthias; O'Reilly, Daria; Xie, Feng; Goeree, Ron] McMaster Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University; McMaster University,"Tarride, JE (通讯作者)，St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, PATH Res Inst, 25 Main St W,Suite 2000, Hamilton, ON L8P 1H1, Canada.",tarride@mcmaster.ca,"Bowen, James/L-3077-2019","Bowen, James/0000-0002-6457-2337",Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care,"Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care(Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Ontario)","No sources of funding were used to assist in the preparation of this review.

This paper stresses on the role of control environment when the decision makers design and make choice of the suitable management control system model for the company. After giving the definition and analysis of the external and internal environment, we review the literature on the evolution of management control system model issues to draw the consensus of the role of control environment in designing management control models. Much attention has been given to Chinese environment in this paper. And the environment of company management control in China is so diversified that there is no one-size-fits-all model.. Therefore we develop four models to suit for the various control environments, i.e. regulation control systems, budget control systems, evaluation control systems and incentive control systems. According to China's current situation of control environment, most companies require regulation control system model to implement strategies. Budget control system model are an advanced and feasible control model which is not suitable for all the companies. And so far, only a few companies can adopt the evaluation control system model while fewer companies can directly adopt the incentive control systems model. Overall, the understanding of the control environment is essential for the establishment and selection of internal control models.","[Zhang Xian-zhi] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Accounting Sch, Res Ctr Internal Control & Risk Management, Dalian 116025, Peoples R China",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics,,,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,11,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,439,447,,,,,,9,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100062,0

The model simulates the dynamic process of the separation of scientific research from material production and investigates its impacts on the efficiency of knowledge creation and economic growth. It is shown that the difference in transaction costs and the degree of economies of specialization in material production between economies can result in distinct paths in growth and thus the bifurcation of civilization.","[Zhou Hai-ou] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,,,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1719,1731,,,,,,13,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100231,0

If the distant past initialization is extended to the infinite past, the initial condition dominates the limit theory, producing a faster rate of convergence, a limiting Cauchy distribution for the least squares coefficient, and a limit normal distribution for the t-ratio. This amounts to the tail of the unit root process wagging the dog of the unit root limit theory. These simple results apply in the case of a univariate autoregression with no intercept. The limit theory for vector unit root regression and cointegrating regression is affected but is no longer dominated by infinite past initializations. The latter contribute to the limiting distribution of the least squares estimator and produce a singularity in the limit theory, but do not change the principal rate of convergence. Usual cointegrating regression theory and inference continue to hold in spite of the degeneracy in the limit theory and are therefore robust to initial conditions that extend to the infinite past.","[Phillips, Peter C.

While the classical approaches in Sparre Andersen models have their own merits, the approach presented in this paper has its advantages from the following perspectives. (1) The underlying surplus process has the flexibility to reflect a broad range of scenarios for surplus growth including dividend policies and interest returns. (2) The solution method provides a general framework to unify a great variety of existing ruin-related quantities such as Gerber-Shiu functions and the expected present value of dividends paid up to ruin, and facilitates derivations of new ruin-related quantities such as the expected present value of total claim costs up to ruin, etc. In the end, many specific examples are explored to demonstrate its application in renewal risk models.

It examines the effects of the replacement rates and population growth rate on the capital-labor ratio, pension benefits, consumption and utility, and finds the optimal replacement rate. It is shown that raising the individual account benefit replacement rate only induces the increase in the individual account benefits. Raising the social pool benefit replacement rate induces the increase in the social pool benefits and retirement-period consumption, while the decrease in the capital-labor ratio, individual account benefits, working-period consumption and utility. The fall in the population growth rate leads to the increase in the capital-labor ratio, social pool benefits, individual account benefits, working-period consumption and utility, and leads to a decrease in the retirement-period consumption. The optimal social pool benefit replacement rate depends on the individual discount factor, social discount factor, capital share of income and population growth rate, and it decreases in the case of falling population growth rates. It will do more good than harm to raise the individual account benefit replacement rate, reduce the social pool benefit replacement rate and strictly implement China's population policy.

When valuing options using lattice-type techniques such as finite-difference methods, the curse of dimensionality ensures that additional-state variables lead to exponential increases in computational effort. Monte Carlo methods are immune from this curse but, despite advances, require a great deal of adaptation to treat early exercise features. Here the multiunderlying asset Black-Scholes problem, including early exercise, is studied using the tools of singular perturbation analysis. This considerably simplifies the pricing problem by decomposing the multi-dimensional problem into a series of lower-dimensional problems that are far simpler and faster to solve than the full, high-dimensional problem. This paper explains how to apply these singular perturbation techniques and explores the significant efficiency improvement from such an approach.","[Duck, Peter W.] Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Newton, David P.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Widdicks, Martin] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",University of Manchester; University of Nottingham; Lancaster University,"Duck, PW (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",duck@ma.man.ac.uk,"Newton, David/JQI-8116-2023","Newton, David/0000-0003-0470-8113; Newton, David/0000-0001-6891-5686; Duck, Peter/0000-0002-7915-5982",Leverhulme Trust; EPSRC,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),Peter Duck gratefully acknowledges the Leverhulme Trust funding and Martin Widdicks gratefully acknowledges the EPSRC funding.,,28,2,3,2,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0960-1627,,,MATH FINANC,Math.

The proof is difficult because the approximating Gaussian stochastic process contains both a stationary and a nonstationary part, and so we have to extend existing results that only apply to either one or the other case.

Objective: To determine the cost effectiveness of providing a quadrivalent (6,11,16,18) HPV vaccine programme in adolescent females aged 12 years in addition to the existing cervical cancer screening programme in Belgium. Methods: A Markov state-transition model was developed for the Belgian context. in order to evaluate the long-term impact of vaccinating a cohort of girls aged 12 years alongside the existing screening programme. Women were followed until the age of 85 years. A vaccine that would prevent 100% of diseases associated with HPV-6, -11, -16 and -18, with lifetime duration of efficacy, 80% coverage, in conjunction with current screening, was compared with screening alone. For this analysis, 35% of cases of CIN-1, 55% of CIN-2/3, 75% of cervical cancer and 90% of genital warts were considered to be attributable to HPV-6, -11, -16 or -18. The model estimated lifetime risks and total lifetime healthcare costs, survival and QALYs for cervical cancer, CIN and genital warts. Outcomes validation was applied. Model outcomes also included incremental costs per life-year gained and incremental costs per QALY gained. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Belgian healthcare payer, and costs were in year 2006 values. Results: The model estimated a reduction in the lifetime risk of cervical cancer from 0.94% to 0.34%, therefore preventing 362 cases of cervical cancer and 131 related deaths in a cohort of 60 000 girls aged 12 years in Belgium. The base-case scenario suggests quadrivalent HPV vaccination in addition to current cervical screening in Belgium to be cost effective at (sic)10546 per QALY. This is within the accepted range of cost-effective interventions in Europe. This cost effectiveness is maintained for different parameter assumptions in the sensitivity analysis, with the exception of very high discount rates for costs and medical benefits, but, even in the worst case, ratios were still less than (sic)50 000 per QALY. Even when a separate scenario modelled the requirement for a booster vaccination to sustain a lifetime duration of protection, the results remained cost effective at (sic)17 388 per QALY. Conclusions: Vaccination with a quadrivalent HPV vaccine appears to be a cost-effective public health intervention in conjunction with the existing screening programme in Belgium. The additional costs of introducing vaccination to the established screening programme would be offset by the potential savings from not having to treat the diseases caused by HPV-6, -11, -16 or -18.","[Annemans, Lieven] Univ Ghent, Dept Publ Hlth, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Remy, Vanessa; Largeron, Nathalie] Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Lyon, France; [Oyee, James] Mapi Values, Bollington, England",Ghent University; Sanofi-Aventis; Sanofi France,"Rémy, V (通讯作者)，8 Rue Jonas Salk, F-69367 Lyon 07, France.",vremy@spmsd.com,,,Sanofi Pasteur MSD,Sanofi Pasteur MSD,"This research was supported by an unrestricted research grant from Sanofi Pasteur MSD.

Its incidence is rising worldwide. Patients can live many years, but FNHL is considered incurable. We systematically reviewed the English-language MEDLINE-indexed and non-indexed economic literature published in the past 10 years on FNHL, identifying 23 primary economic studies. The economic burden of FNHL is significant, but available data are generally limited to retrospective considerations of hospital-based direct treatment costs, with little information available regarding societal cost of illness. Most direct cost information originates from the US, with one estimate of $US36 000 for the per-patient incremental cost of FNHL care during the first year following diagnosis. The most studied treatment is rituximab, which may offer similar overall costs to fludarabine considering higher resource use with fludarabine complications. Nearly all cost-effectiveness models identified by this review evaluated rituximab for relapsed/refractory FNHL responding to chemotherapy induction. Rituximab is supported as a cost-effective addition to standard chemotherapy by two models in the UK and one in the US, as maintenance therapy instead of stem-cell transplant by one UK model, and as maintenance therapy instead of observation alone by one model each in France, Spain and Canada. The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence updated guidance on rituximab in February 2008, concluding that it is cost effective when added to induction chemotherapy, and when used as maintenance therapy. No studies of per-patient or national indirect costs of illness were identified, with the only study of indirect costs a Canadian survey documenting lost work productivity. Across all study types identified by our review, the most common focus was on the direct costs of rituximab. As new treatments for FNHL come to market, more real-life cost data are imperative to calculate their relative cost effectiveness.","[Foster, Talia] Abt Biopharma Solut Inc, HERQuLES, Lexington, MA 02421 USA; [Boye, Mark E.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",Eli Lilly,"Foster, T (通讯作者)，Abt Biopharma Solut Inc, HERQuLES, 181 Spring St, Lexington, MA 02421 USA.",talia.foster@abtbiopharma.com,,,"Abt Bio-Pharma Solutions, Inc.; Eli Lilly and Company","Abt Bio-Pharma Solutions, Inc.; Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly)","Funding for this work was provided by Eli Lilly and Company to Abt Bio-Pharma Solutions, Inc.

Several authorities in the US have recommended different treatments and school policies in order to control this disease. Recent concerns of emerging lice resistance worldwide raise the necessity to reassess the current recommendations. Objective: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis (from the US caregiver perspective) of three head lice treatments commonly used in the US, permethrin 1%, malathion 0.5% and the lice comb, in order to evaluate the cost effectiveness of different treatments in the current era, and to explore the effect of different factors in this analysis. Methods: We used a decision-tree model to represent the costs and effectiveness of the different treatment strategies. A patient/caregiver perspective was applied, with a time horizon of 2 weeks. Probabilities of treatment success or failure of the three treatments were based on the literature. Effectiveness was measured as the successful eradication of head lice, and costs - including the costs of the treatment, the physician co-pay and the costs of days out of school - were calculated. One-way and multi-way analyses were performed using decision analysis software (Treeage Pro Healthcare 2008). Results: Combing was dominated by permethrin 1%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of malathion 0.5% versus permethrin 1% was $US161.75 per cure. For caregivers whose willingness to pay is <$US161.75 per cure, permethrin 1% is the most cost-effective option. For those with a willingness to pay of >=$US161.75 per cure malathion 1% may offer the highest net monetary benefit. Twenty percent of the uncertainty in the model is due to variation in permethrin 1% resistance, and approximately 73% of the total variability of the model is attributed to the number of days the student has to be out of school because of the school's policy. Conclusions: Our study suggests that permethrin 1% was the most cost-effective treatment for those with a willingness to pay of <$US162 per cure. Sensitivity of lice to permethrin and the specific school head lice policy had major effects on the model. Thus, informing communities in a given geographical area about the degree of head lice resistance and sensitivity is necessary in order for the public to make a rational decision regarding treatment. Schools' head lice policies have a major effect on the cost of head lice treatments.","[Gur, Itzhak] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Family Med, Fac Med, Sch Med, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; [Gur, Itzhak; Schneeweiss, Ronald] Univ Washington, Dept Family Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Gur, I (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Family Med, Fac Med, Sch Med, POB 12272, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel.",gur008@gmail.com,,,"Advancement of Academic Family Medicine in Israel (AAFMI) Fellowship at the University of Washington; Seattle, WA, USA; American Physicians Fellowship for Medicine in Israel, Boston, MA, USA","Advancement of Academic Family Medicine in Israel (AAFMI) Fellowship at the University of Washington; Seattle, WA, USA; American Physicians Fellowship for Medicine in Israel, Boston, MA, USA","Dr Gur is a recipient of grants from the Advancement of Academic Family Medicine in Israel (AAFMI) Fellowship at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA, and The American Physicians Fellowship for Medicine in Israel, Boston, MA, USA.

Selected for analysis were summaries of EEs of interventions for bacterial and viral infections, and diseases of the digestive and respiratory tracts. The summaries were obtained from the EURONHEED. There were 346 studies that fulfilled the selection criteria. The statistical analyses consisted of a descriptive analysis and a bivariate inference analysis to assess associations between the different variables, essentially between the variables of country, year of publication and methodology applied. Of the summaries examined, approximately 50% focused on pharmacological interventions. The most frequent type of analysis was that of cost effectiveness. The technologies most evaluated referred to treatments (versus diagnosis or prevention technologies). The perspective was mostly that of the health service. The sensitivity analysis most applied was univariate and the model type mostly used was the decision-tree. Over the period assessed, there were significant differences between countries in the types of EE, the perspective from which the studies were performed and in the practice of discounting costs and health effects. Although there has been an improvement in methodologies since the year 2000, there are studies that still fail to take into account key elements of EE necessary for a study to be considered of high quality. For better appreciation of the potential capacity for the transfer of results of EEs between jurisdictions, the methodologies used in health EE studies in the different European countries need to be known in greater detail.","[Hutter, Florencia; Antonanzas, Fernando] Univ La Rioja, Dept Econ, Logrono 26004, Spain",Universidad de La Rioja,"Antoñanzas, F (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, Dept Econ, C La Ciguena 60, Logrono 26004, Spain.",fernando.antonanzas@unirioja.es,"Antonanzas, Fernando/F-4610-2016","Antonanzas, Fernando/0000-0001-6122-9130",Spanish Fund of Health Research [P1060282],Spanish Fund of Health Research,"This work was supported by the Spanish Fund of Health Research (project number P1060282).

The C-TAM-TPB model was utilized to examine those, collected data from 233 interviewers in their perceptions of SHE application. Overall, the results revealed that the effect of satisfaction was significant importance, but those usefulness, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control did not influence directly an individual's continuance intentions.

The numerical analysis illustrates that stochastic volatility will increase the implied option value and encourage the agent to exercise the option later.

The estimator converges to a normal distribution at the rate of root n and Monte Carlo simulations confirm its robustness to error distributions in finite samples.

To demonstrate the mechanics of this new method, we compared our calculation with the calculations of conventional ecological footprint and emergetic ecological footprint of a regional case. We select Dalian city of Liaoning province in northeast China, as an example for application of our study, and calculate ecological footprint, ecological carrying capacity, ecological overshoot, ecological footprint intensity index and ecological overshoot index.

Traditional finance methods for R&D project valuations, such as net present value analyses (NPV), incorporate information from these payer reimbursement signals to help determine which R&D projects should be continued and which should be terminated (in the case of the latter because they yield an NPV < 0). Because the influence these signals have for firm R&D investment decisions is so significant, we argue that it is important for reimbursement thresholds to reflect the economic value of the unit of health benefit being considered for reimbursement. Thresholds set too low (below the economic value of the health benefit) will result in R&D investment levels that are too low relative to the economic value of R&D (on the margin). Similarly, thresholds set too high (above the economic value of the health benefit) will result in inefficiently high levels of R&D spending. The US in particular, which represents approximately half of the global pharmaceutical market (based on sales), and which seems poised to begin undertaking cost effectiveness in a systematic way, needs to exert caution in setting policies that explicitly or implicitly establish cost-effectiveness reimbursement thresholds for healthcare products and technologies, such as pharmaceuticals.","[Vernon, John A.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Goldberg, Robert] Ctr Med Publ Interest, New York, NY USA; [Golec, Joseph] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Dept Finance, Storrs, CT USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Connecticut,"Vernon, JA (通讯作者)，1101C McGavran Greenberg,Campus Box 7411, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",vernon@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,37,15,16,0,21,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,10,,,,,797,806,,10.2165/11313750-000000000-00000,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,518XI,19803536.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271728700002,0

Based on this, we propose three factor GARCH models in the framework of GO-GARCH: independent-factor GARCH exploits factors that are statistically as independent as possible; factors in best-factor GARCH have the largest autocorrelation in their squared values such that their volatilities could be forecast well by univariate GARCH; and factors in conditional-decorrelation GARCH are conditionally as uncorrelated as possible. A convenient two-step method for estimating these models is introduced. Since the extracted factors may still have weak conditional correlations, we further propose factor-DCC models as an extension to the above factor GARCH models with dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) modelling the remaining conditional correlations between factors. Experimental results for the Hong Kong stock market show that conditional-decorrelation GARCH and independent-factor GARCH have better generalization performance than the original GO-GARCH, and that conditional-decorrelation GARCH (among factor GARCH models) and its extension with DCC embedded (among factor-DCC models) behave best.","[Zhang, Kun; Chan, Laiwan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, K (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",kzhang@cse.cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,50,39,41,3,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Energy is becoming an ever increasing hindrance to social and economic development. The increased production and consumption of energy to meet this new demand is causing the already unfavourable local ecological environment conditions to worsen. For the unforeseeable future we will continue to experience a negative correlation between supply and demand for energy, and environment restrictions. By balancing current energy needs with that of environment, we will be able to not only dramatically influence and improve energy safety locally, but we will also have the global benefit of improving relations with other countries. In this paper viable alternatives and unique approaches are discussed in depth, which will ultimately result in a formulation of a new strategy related to energy and environment probe into and analyzes energy and environment issues in China.","[Zhao, Guohao] Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China",Shanxi University Finance & Economics,,gzhao1958@yahoo.com.cn; xinrongli@126.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,1278,1282,,,,,,5,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600218,0

By using related party transactions as a direct measure for expropriation and the event study, we corroborated the negative value effect of expropriation in China's stock markets, and found that the controlling capability of controlling shareholders, ownership balancing, identity of controlling shareholders, stock incentives for the board/executives, and the proportion of tradable shares are significantly associated with expropriation.

Like almost all empirical work which relies on a production function to recover productivity measures, I do not observe physical output at the firm level. Therefore, it is imperative to control for unobserved prices and demand shocks. I develop an empirical model that combines a demand system with a production function to generate estimates of productivity. I rely on my framework to identify the productivity effects from reduced trade protection in the Belgian textile market. This trade liberalization provides me with observed demand shifters that are used to separate out the associated price, scale, and productivity effects. Using a matched plant-product level data set and detailed quota data, I find that correcting for unobserved prices leads to substantially lower productivity gains. More specifically, abolishing all quota protections increases firm-level productivity by only 2 percent as opposed to 8 percent when relying on standard measures of productivity. My results beg for a serious reevaluation of a long list of empirical studies that document productivity responses to major industry shocks and, in particular, to opening up to trade. My findings imply the need to study the impact of changes in the operating environment on productivity together with market power and prices in one integrated framework. The suggested method and identification strategy are quite general and can be applied whenever it is important to distinguish between revenue productivity and physical productivity.","[De Loecker, Jan] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [De Loecker, Jan] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"De Loecker, J (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",jdeloeck@princeton.edu,"De Loecker, Jan/N-6973-2014",,,,,,31,247,311,5,82,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2011,79.0,5,,,,,1407,1451,,10.3982/ECTA7617,0.0,,,45,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,822KZ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000295046300003,0

GPD plays an important role in modeling extreme quantiles for the wide class of distributions belonging to the maximum domain of attraction of an extreme value model. One of the main difficulty with this modeling approach is the choice of the threshold u, such that all observations greater than u enter into the likelihood function of the GPD model. Difficulties are due to the fact that GPD parameter estimators are sensible to the choice of u. In this work we estimate u, and other parameters, using suitable priors in a Bayesian approach. In particular, we propose to model all data, extremes and non-extremes, using a semiparametric model for data below u, and the GPD for the exceedances over u. In contrast to the usual estimation techniques for u, in this setup we account for uncertainty on all GPD parameters, including u, via their posterior distributions. A Monte Carlo study shows that posterior credible intervals also have frequentist coverages. We further illustrate the advantages of our approach on two applications from insurance.","[Cabras, Stefano] Univ Cagliari, Dept Math, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy; [Eugenia Castellanos, Maria] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Cl Tulipan 28933, Mostoles, Spain",University of Cagliari; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Cabras, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dept Math, Via Osped 72, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.",s.cabras@unica.it; maria.castellanos@urjc.es,"Cabras, Stefano/AAA-2477-2019; Castellanos, María Eugenia/E-9851-2016","Cabras, Stefano/0000-0001-6690-8378; Castellanos, María Eugenia/0000-0001-7920-2307","M.I.U.R.

The model is general enough to include economic risk, financial risk, insurance risk, and model risk. The insurance company invests its surplus in a bond and a stock index. The interest rate of the bond is stochastic and depends on the state of an economy described by a continuous-time, finite-state, Markov chain. The stock index dynamics are governed by a Markov, regime-switching, geometric Brownian motion modulated by the chain. The company receives premiums and pays aggregate claims. Here the aggregate insurance claims process is modeled by either a Markov, regime-switching, random measure or a Markov, regime-switching, diffusion process modulated by the chain. We adopt a robust approach to model risk, or uncertainty, and generate a family of probability measures using a general approach for a measure change to incorporate model risk. In particular, we adopt a Girsanov transform for the regime-switching Markov chain to incorporate model risk in modeling economic risk by the Markov chain. The goal of the insurance company is to select an optimal investment strategy so as to maximize either the expected exponential utility of terminal wealth or the survival probability of the company in the 'worst-case' scenario. We formulate the optimal investment problems as two-player, zero-sum, stochastic differential games between the insurance company and the market. Verification theorems for the HJB solutions to the optimal investment problems are provided and explicit solutions for optimal strategies are obtained in some particular cases.","[Elliott, Robert J.] Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Elliott, Robert J.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Math Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Siu, Tak Kuen] Macquarie Univ, Dept Actuarial Studies, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",University of Calgary; University of Adelaide; Macquarie University,"Elliott, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Calgary, AB, Canada.",relliott@ucalgary.ca,"Siu, Tak Kuen/AAJ-6372-2020","Elliott, Robert/0000-0002-5486-6999; Siu, Tak Kuen/0000-0003-2823-5138",ARC; NSERC,ARC(Australian Research Council); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),The authors wish to thank the two anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions.

It argues that resources to improve patient adherence have a clearly distinguishable impact on costs and utility and thus are relatively easy to exclude when transferring trial-based pharmacoeconomic analyses to clinical practice. It proposes a model that adjusts trial-based incremental costs and effectiveness for lower medication adherence in clinical practice. It shows that, contrary to conventional wisdom, drug cost effectiveness in clinical practice can be better than in clinical trials. This may have implications for policy recommendations, depending on how close trial-based cost effectiveness is to the maximum willingness to pay.

Data were obtained using a keyword search of the MEDLINE database and a hand search of articles written by leading researchers in the subject area (with follow up of the references in these articles). Key arguments were discussed and developed at an oncology workshop in September 2009 at the Office of Health Economics. Three key issues emerged. First, the EQ-5D, NICE's preferred measure of health-related quality of life (QOL) in adults, has been found to be relatively insensitive to changes in health status of cancer patients. Second, the time trade-off, NICE's preferred technique for estimating the values of health states, involves making assumptions that are likely to be violated in end-of-life scenarios. Third, the practice of using valuations of members of the general population, as recommended by NICE, is problematic because such individuals typically display a misunderstanding of what it is really like for patients to live with cancer. Because of the way in which it is constructed, the QALY shows important limitations in terms of its ability to accurately capture the value of the health gains deemed important by cancer patients. A research agenda for addressing these limitations is proposed.","[Garau, Martina; Shah, Koonal K.; Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London SW1A 2DY, England; [Mason, Anne R.; Drummond, Michael F.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Wang, Qing] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Uxbridge, Middx, England",University of York - UK; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Shah, KK (通讯作者)，Off Hlth Econ, 12 Whitehall, London SW1A 2DY, England.",kshah@ohe.org,"Garau, Martina/P-5582-2014; Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014; Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014","Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858; Mason, Anne/0000-0002-5823-3064; Garau, Martina/0000-0002-0762-4743",Pharmaceutical Oncology Initiative (POI) group,Pharmaceutical Oncology Initiative (POI) group,This paper is based on part of a consulting project commissioned and funded by the Pharmaceutical Oncology Initiative (POI) group.

Mathematically, the situation can be described as a stochastic differential game, where one of the players (the agent) is trying to find the portfolio that maximizes the utility of her terminal wealth, while the other player (the market'') is controlling some of the unknown parameters of the market (e. g., the underlying probability measure, representing a model uncertainty problem) and is trying to minimize this maximal utility of the agent. This leads to a worst case scenario control problem for the agent. In the Markovian case, such problems can be studied using the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equation, but these methods do not work in the non-Markovian case. We approach the problem by transforming it into a stochastic differential game for backward stochastic differential equations (a BSDE game). Using comparison theorems for BSDEs with jumps we arrive at criteria for the solution of such games in the form of a kind of non-Markovian analogue of the HJBI equation.

The savings subsidy improves welfare because it makes succumbing to temptation less attractive. We then study an economy with a long but finite horizon which nests, as a special case, the Phelps-Pollak-Laibson multiple-selves model (thereby providing guidance on how to evaluate welfare in this model). We prove that when period utility is logarithmic, the optimal savings subsidies increase over time for any finite horizon.

The test statistics we use in this paper are Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin's (1992; KPSS hereafter) tests for the null of stationarity, though using other kinds of tests is also possible. The tests are shown to depend on the limiting distributions of the estimators and parameters of the nonlinear model when they use full-sample residuals from the nonlinear least squares and nonlinear leads-and-lags regressions. This feature makes it difficult to use them in practice. As a remedy, this paper develops tests using subsamples of the regression residuals. For these tests, first, the nonlinear least squares and nonlinear leads-and-lags regressions are run and residuals are calculated. Second, the KPSS tests are applied using subresiduals of size b. As long as b/T --> 0 as T --> infinity, where T is the sample size, the tests using the subresiduals have limiting distributions that are not affected by the limiting distributions of the full-sample estimators and the parameters of the model. Third, the Bonferroni procedure is used for a selected number of the subresidual-based tests. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the tests work reasonably well in finite samples for polynomial and smooth transition regression models when the block size is chosen by the minimum volatility rule. In particular, the subresidual-based tests using the leads-and-lags regression residuals appear to be promising for empirical work. An empirical example studying the U.S. money demand equation illustrates the use of the tests.","[Choi, In] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 121742, South Korea; [Saikkonen, Pentti] Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",Sogang University; University of Helsinki,"Choi, I (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Shinsu Dong, Seoul 121742, South Korea.",inchoi@gmail.com; pentti.saikkonen@helsinki.fi,"Saikkonen, Pentti/ABD-8240-2020",,,,,,38,40,43,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

In the previous literature, negative volatility spillovers were ruled out by the assumption that all the parameters of the model are nonnegative, which is a sufficient condition for ensuring the positive definiteness of the conditional covariance matrix. In order to allow for negative feedback, we show that the positive definiteness of the conditional covariance matrix can be guaranteed even if some of the parameters are negative. Thus, we extend the results of Nelson and Cao (1992) and Tsai and Chan (2008) to a multivariate setting. For the bivariate case of order one, we look into the consequences of adopting these less severe restrictions and find that the flexibility of the process is substantially increased.

Building on theoretical insights from Carlsson and van Damme (1993), it explores the effect of small amounts of private information on a class of dynamic cooperation games with exit. Lack of common knowledge leads players to second guess each other's behavior and makes coordination difficult. This restricts the range of equilibria and highlights the role of miscoordination payoffs in determining whether cooperation is sustainable or not. The paper characterizes the range of perfect Bayesian equilibria as the players' information becomes arbitrarily precise. Unlike in one-shot two-by-two games, the global games information structure does not yield equilibrium uniqueness.","Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Chassang, S (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",chassang@princeton.edu,,,,,,,32,25,35,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2010,78.0,3,,,,,973,1006,,10.3982/ECTA7324,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,600IW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000277980400004,0

In the second stage, a simple hypothesis about a component of the structural parameter vector is tested, using a t-statistic that is based on either the ordinary least squares (OLS) or the two-stage least squares estimator (2SLS), depending on the outcome of the Hausman pretest. The asymptotic sire of the two-stage test is derived in a model where weak instruments are ruled out by imposing a positive lower bound on the strength of the instruments. The asymptotic size equals I for empirically relevant choices of the parameter space. The size distortion is caused by it discontinuity of the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic in the correlation parameter between the structural and reduced form error terms. The Hausman pretest does not have sufficient power against correlations that are local to zero while the OLS-based t-statistic takes on large values for such nonzero correlations. Instead of using the two-stage procedure. the recommendation then is to use a I-statistic based on the 2SLS estimator or. it weak instruments are a concern, the conditional likelihood ratio test by Moreira (2003).","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Guggenberger, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Bunche Hall 8385,Box 951477, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",guggenbe@econ.ucla.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1346827] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,28,24,28,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

For this reason, many authors have used estimated factors in the construction of prediction models. In this article, we begin by surveying the extant literature on diffusion indexes. We then outline a number of approaches to the selection of factor proxies (observed variables that proxy unobserved estimated factors) using the statistics developed in Bai and Ng (2006a,b). Our approach to factor proxy selection is examined via a small Monte Carlo experiment, where evidence supporting our proposed methodology is presented, and via a large set of prediction experiments using the panel dataset of Stock and Watson (2005). One of our main empirical findings is that our osmoothedo approaches to factor proxy selection appear to yield predictions that are often superior not only to a benchmark factor model, but also to simple linear time series models which are generally difficult to beat in forecasting competitions. In some sense, by using our approach to predictive factor proxy selection, one is able to open up the oblack boxo often associated with factor analysis, and to identify actual variables that can serve as primitive building blocks for (prediction) models of a host of macroeconomic variables, and that can also serve as policy instruments, for example. Our findings suggest that important observable variables include various SP500 variables, including stock price indices and dividend series; a 1-year Treasury bond rate; various housing activity variables; industrial production; and exchange rates.","[Armah, Nii Ayi; Swanson, Norman R.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Swanson, Norman R.] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,"Armah, NA (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, 75 Hamilton St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",armah@econ.rutgers.edu,,,Rutgers University Research Council,Rutgers University Research Council,"The authors wish to thank the editors, Esfandiar Maasoumi and Marcelo Medeiros, as well as two anonymous referees for providing numerous useful suggestions on earlier versions of this article.

The outcome of PUB strongly depends on the risk of rebleeding. A recent multinational placebo-controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00251979) showed that high-dose intravenous (IV) esomeprazole, when administered after successful endoscopic haemostasis in patients with PUB, is effective in preventing rebleeding. From a policy perspective it is important to assess the cost efficacy of this benefit so as to enable clinicians and payers to make an informed decision regarding the management of PUB. Objective: Using a decision-tree model, we compared the cost efficacy of high-dose IV esomeprazole versus an approach of no-IV proton pump inhibitor for prevention of rebleeding in patients with PUB. Method: The model adopted a 30-day time horizon and the perspective of third-party payers in the USA and Europe. The main efficacy variable was the number of averted rebleedings. Healthcare resource utilization costs (physician fees, hospitalizations, surgeries, pharmacotherapies) relevant for the management of PUB were also determined. Data for unit costs (prices) were primarily taken from official governmental sources, and data for other model assumptions were retrieved from the original clinical trial and the literature. After successful endoscopic haemostasis, patients received either high-dose IV esomeprazole (80 mg infusion over 30 min, then 8 mg/hour for 71.5 hours) or no-IV esomeprazole treatment, with both groups receiving oral esomeprazole 40 mg once daily from days 4 to 30. Results: Rebleed rates at 30 days were 7.7% and 13.6%, respectively, for the high-dose IV esomeprazole and no-IV esomeprazole treatment groups (equating to a number needed to treat of 17 in order to prevent one additional patient from rebleeding). In the US setting, the average cost per patient for the high-dose IV esomeprazole strategy was $US14290 compared with $US14239 for the no-IV esomeprazole strategy (year 2007 values). For the European setting, Sweden and Spain were used as examples. In the Swedish setting the corresponding respective figures were Swedish kronor (SEK)67862 ($US9220 at average 2006 interbank exchange rates) and SEK67 807 ($US9212) [year 2006 values]. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $US866 and SEK938 ($US127), respectively, per averted rebleed when using IV esomeprazole. For the Spanish setting, the high-dose IV esomeprazole strategy was dominant (more effective and less costly than the no-IV esomeprazole strategy) [year 2008 values]. All results appeared robust to univariate/threshold sensitivity analysis, with high-dose IV esomeprazole becoming dominant with small variations in assumptions in the US and Swedish settings, while remaining a dominant approach in the Spanish scenario across a broad range of values. Sensitivity variables with prespecified ranges included lengths of stay and per diem assumptions, rebleeding rates and, in some cases, professional fees. Conclusion: In patients with PUB, high-dose IV esomeprazole after successful endoscopic haemostasis appears to improve outcomes at a modest increase in costs relative to a no-IV esomeprazole strategy from the US and Swedish third-party payer perspective. Whereas, in the Spanish setting, the high-dose IV esomeprazole strategy appeared dominant, being more effective and less costly.","[Barkun, Alan N.; Adam, Viviane] McGill Univ, Div Gastroenterol, Ctr Hlth, Montreal Gen Hosp, Montreal, PQ H3C 1A4, Canada; [Sung, Joseph J.

In this regard, we examine the notion of thinning that was recently advocated for the purpose of hedging a multi-name derivative by single-name derivatives.

However, the use of a standard t copula is often criticized due to its restriction of having a single parameter for the degrees of freedom (dof) that may limit its capability to model the tail dependence structure in a multivariate case. To overcome this problem, the grouped t copula was proposed recently, where risks are grouped a priori in such a way that each group has a standard t copula with its specific dof parameter. In this paper we propose the use of a generalized grouped t copula, where each group consists of one risk factor only, so that a priori grouping is not required.

Using daily data for the period May 2000 to May 2005, this article adopts GARCH model with generalized error distribution to estimate the time-varying Value at Risk in both upside and downside directions at confidence level of 90 % and 95 %, and then uses granger causality in risk to investigate the extreme co-movement in both upside and downside directions between crude oil markets and gasoline markets from three continents in the world. The empirical results show that oil price adjustment exhibits asymmetric relationship, namely, the rise of price will transmit to another market within one day, while the decline of price will transmit to another market with delay. This means that the efficiency of information transmission when price are rising is higher than the instance when price are falling. Our results do not support the popular opinion that the asymmetric gasoline price adjustment is due to the market power.","[Lv Wen-dong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Business, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Pan Hui-feng] Univ Int Business & Econ, Financial Markets Inst, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; University of International Business & Economics,"Lv, WD (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Business, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,24,0,0,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,527,532,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100073,0

The goal of this article is to estimate interest rate curves by using Support Vector Regression (SVR), a method derived from the Statistical Learning Theory developed by Vapnik (1995). The motivation is that SVR features these extra capabilities at a low estimation cost. The SVR is specified by a loss function, a kernel function and a smoothing parameter. SVR models the daily U.S. dollar interest rate swap curves, from 1997 to 2001. As expected from a priori and sensibility analyses, the SVR equipped with the kernel generating a spline with an infinite number of nodes was the best performing SVR. Comparing this SVR with other models, it achieved the best cross-validation interpolation performance in controlling the bias-variance trade-off and generating the lowest error considering the desired accuracy fixed by the bid-ask spreads.","[Monteiro, Andre d'Almeida] Gavea Investimentos, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,"Monteiro, AD (通讯作者)，Ave Ataulfo Paiva 1100,801 Leblon, BR-22440035 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",amonteiro@gaveainvest.com.br,,,,,,,56,1,1,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We propose a method that leverages all available data in this setting by adjusting average patient characteristics in trials with IPD to match those reported for trials without IPD. Treatment outcomes, including continuous, categorical and censored time-to-event outcomes, can then be compared across balanced trial populations The proposed method is illustrated by a comparison of adalimumab and etanercept for the treatment of psoriasis. IPD from trials of adalimumab versus placebo (n = 1025) were re-weighted to match the average baseline characteristics reported for a trial of etanercept versus placebo (n = 330) Re-weighting was based on the estimated propensity of enrolment in the adalimumab versus etanercept trials. Before matching, patients in the adalimumab trials had lower mean age, greater prevalence of psoriatic arthritis, less prior use of systemic treatment or phototherapy, and a smaller mean percentage of body surface area affected than patients in the etanercept trial After matching, these and all other available baseline characteristics were well balanced across trials. Symptom improvements of >= 75% and >= 90% (as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score at week 12) were experienced by an additional 17 2% and 14 8% of adalimumab-treated patients compared with the matched etanercept-treated patients (respectively, both p < 0.001) Mean percentage PASI score improvements from baseline were also greater for adalimumab than for etanercept at weeks 4, 8 and 12 (all p < 0.05) Matching adjustment ensured that this indirect comparison was not biased by differences in mean baseline characteristics across trials, supporting the conclusion that adalimumab was associated with significantly greater symptom reduction than etanercept for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis","[Signorovitch, James E.; Wu, Eric Q.; Yu, Andrew P.; Kantor, Evan] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Gerrits, Charles M.; Bao, Yanjun; Gupta, Shiraz R.; Mulani, Parvez M.] Abbott Labs, Abbott Pk, IL 60064 USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Abbott Laboratories,"Signorovitch, JE (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",,,,"Abbott Laboratories, Inc; Analysis Group, Inc","Abbott Laboratories, Inc(Abbott Laboratories); Analysis Group, Inc","This study was supported by Abbott Laboratories, Inc and Analysis Group, Inc Editorial support was provided by Ellen Stoltzfus, PhD, of JK.

Based on the complex network theory, the evolution mechanism of cluster innovation networks is analyzed, and a model of cascading failure in the cluster innovation networks is developed. This study shows that: (1) there is a close relation between the evolution mechanism of cluster innovation networks and the risk-resistant capability of the networks, and the process of evolving based on the principle of preferential attachment brings about the scale-free character of the cluster innovation networks; (2) the uniform distribution of enterprises strength contributes to improve the invulnerability of the innovation networks; (3) there is a threshold of inter-firm connection density that intensive inter-firm relationship contributes to the risk-resistant ability of innovation networks up to a threshold and beyond which more intensive inter-firm relationship can lead to a decrease in risk-resistant ability of innovation networks. Finally, it is found that the key factors causing the cascading breakdown of cluster innovation networks can be summarized into three areas: the distribution of inter-firm connections, the distribution of firms' risk-resistant capabilities, and the innovation capabilities of the enterprises within the cluster. Some recommendations regarding to improving the robustness of cluster innovation networks are proposed in order to avoid the occurrence of cascading breakdown in industrial cluster.","[Wang Guo-hong; Xing Rui; Tang Li-yan; Kittisarawanno, Supatida] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,,,,,,,,,39,3,4,1,11,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1445,1455,,,,,,11,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100196,0

However, little attention has been paid to link modularity with discontinuous innovation. Therefore, our research aims to examine the relationship between modularity and discontinuous innovation at industry level. In fact, both of their information and evolutional paths can be explored by patent analysis. Thus, the patent data from automobile industry is used to explore their correlations. Corresponding indicators constructed by patent information are employed to analyze the dynamics of modularity and evolution of discontinuous technology in automobile industry. This analysis tries to provide a quantitative and dynamic perspective for understanding development of industrial technologies and demonstrating coevolution of modularity and discontinuous innovation.","[Wang Hai-long; Huang Ming] Dalian Univ Technol, 21st Century Dev Res Ctr, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,,,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,10,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,737,744,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100102,0

To improve forecasting performance, this study presents an integrated model to mitigate forecasting error. The model evaluates consumer preference by brand choice models, makes time-series forecasts by ARIMA, and integrates the outcome from one with the other. The empirical result reveals that the presented model outperforms ARIMA. It benefits related industry by pointing out a possible direction of consumer taste and providing more accurate forecasts.

Objective: To estimate the cost effectiveness of LTRAs compared with long-acting beta 2 agonists as add-on therapy for patients whose asthma symptoms are not controlled on low-dose ICS. Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 2-year, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial set in 53 primary-care practices in the UK. Patients aged 12-80 years with asthma insufficiently controlled with ICS (n = 361) were randomly assigned to add-on LTRAs (n = 176) or long-acting beta 2 agonists (n = 185). The main outcome measures were the incremental cost per point improvement in the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (MiniAQLQ), per point improvement in the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and per QALY gained from perspectives of the UK NHS and society. Results: Over 2 years, the societal cost per patient receiving LTRAs was 1157 pound versus 952 pound for long-acting beta 2 agonists, a (significant. adjusted) increase of 214 pound (95% CI 2, 411) [year 2005 values]. Patients receiving LTRAs experienced a non-significant incremental gain of 0.009 QALYs (95% CI -0.077, 0.103). The incremental cost per QALY gained from the societal (NHS) perspective was 22 pound 589 (11 pound 919). Uncertainty around this point estimate suggested that, given a maximum willingness to pay of 30 pound 000 per QALY gained, the probability that LTRAs are a cost-effective alternative to long-acting beta 2 agonists as add-on therapy was approximately 52% from both societal and NHS perspectives. Conclusions: On balance, these results marginally favour the repositioning of LTRAs as a cost-effective alternative to long-acting beta 2 agonists as add-on therapy to ICS for asthma. However, there is much uncertainty surrounding the incremental cost effectiveness because of similarity of clinical benefit and broad confidence intervals for differences in healthcare costs.

This study investigates the conditional heteroskedasticity of mortality in terms of statistical time series. We start from testing the conditional heteroskedasticity of the period effect in the naive Lee-Carter model for some mortality data. Then we introduce the Generalized Dynamic Factor method and the multivariate BEKK GARCH model to describe mortality dynamics and the conditional heteroskedasticity of mortality. After specifying the number of static factors and dynamic factors by several variants of information criterion, we compare our model with other two models, namely, the Lee-Carter model and the state space model. Based on several error-based measures of performance, our results indicate that if the number of static factors and dynamic factors is properly determined, the method proposed dominates other methods.

We show that the major Source of the problem is actually the nuisance intercept parameter, and we propose basing inference on the restricted likelihood, which is free of such nuisance location parameters and also possesses small curvature, making it Suitable for inference. The bias of the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates is shown to be approximately 50% less than that of the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates near the Unit root, without loss of efficiency. The error in the chi-square approximation to the distribution of the REML-based likelihood ratio test (RLRT) for no predictability is shown to be (3/4-rho(2))n(-1) (G(3)(.) - G(1)(.)) + O(n(-2)), where vertical bar rho vertical bar < 1 is the correlation of the innovation series and G(s)(.) is the Cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of a chi(2)(s) random variable. This very small error, free of the autoregressive (AR) parameter, suggests that the RLRT for predictability has very good size properties even when the regressor has strong persistence. The Bartlett-corrected RLRT achieves an O(n(-2)) error. Power under local alternatives is obtained, and extensions to more general univariate regressors and vector AR(1) regressors, where OLS may no longer be asymptotically efficient, are provided. In simulations the RLRT maintains size well, is robust to non-normal errors, and has uniformly higher power than the Jansson and Moreira (2006, Econometrica 74, 681-714) test with gains that can be substantial. The Campbell and Yogo (2006, Journal of Financial Econometrics 81, 27-60) Bonferroni Q test is found to have size distortions and can be significantly oversized.","[Deo, Rohit S.] NYU, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Chen, Willa W.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",New York University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Deo, RS (通讯作者)，NYU, 8-57 KMC,W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",rdeo@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,45,22,27,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

In macroeconomics, interactive effects represent unobservable common shocks and their heterogeneous impacts on cross sections. We consider identification, consistency, and the limiting distribution of the interactive-effects estimator. Under both large N and large T, the estimator is shown to be root NT consistent, which is valid in the presence of correlations and heteroskedasticities of unknown form in both dimensions. We also derive the constrained estimator and its limiting distribution, imposing additivity coupled with interactive effects. The problem of testing additive versus interactive effects is also studied. In addition, we consider identification and estimation of models in the presence of a grand mean, time-invariant regressors, and common regressors.

When an insurer's surplus is below a certain level, it is kept as liquid reserves. As the surplus attains the level, the excess of the surplus above the level will earn interest at a constant interest rate. If the surplus continues to surpass a higher level, the excess of the surplus above this higher level will be paid out as dividends to the insurer's shareholders at a constant dividend rate or by the threshold strategy. The lower and higher levels are called the liquid reserve level and the threshold level, respectively. This paper is to discuss the interactions of the liquid reserve level, the interest rate, the threshold level, and the dividend rate in the proposed risk model by studying the expected discounted penalty function and the expected present value of dividends paid up to the time of ruin. We derive expressions for the solutions to both quantities via the approach of integro-differential equation systems. We show that the dividend-penalty identity (Gerber et al. 2006, ASTIN Bulletin) still holds for the threshold strategy with liquid reserves and interest. We illustrate these results by deriving explicit solutions to the probability of ultimate ruin under the threshold strategy when claim sizes are exponentially distributed. In the end, we also discuss the impact of the liquid reserve level, the interest rate, the threshold level, and the dividend rate on the ruin probability by numerical examples.","[Cai, Jun; Willmot, Gordon E.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Feng, Runhuan] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53202 USA",University of Waterloo; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Cai, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",jcai@uwaterloo.ca; fengr@uwm.edu; gewillmo@uwaterloo.ca,,"Willmot, Gordon/0000-0001-5717-5934; Feng, Runhuan/0000-0002-9957-1019",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),We thank two anonymous referees for their careful reading of the paper and their helpful suggestions that improved the presentation of the paper.

In contrast with most of the existing literature, we do not specify a priori which parameters are strongly or weakly identified. We rather consider that weakness should be related specifically to instruments, or more generally to the moment conditions. In addition, we focus here on the case dubbed nearly-weak identification where the drifting DGP introduces a limit rank deficiency reached at a rate slower than root-T. This framework ensures the consistency of Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimators of all parameters, but at a rate possibly slower than usual. It also validates the GMM-LM test with standard formulas. We then propose a comparative study of the power of the LM test and its modified version, or K-test proposed by Kleibergen. Finally, after a well-suited rotation in the parameter space, we identify and estimate directions where root-T convergence is maintained. These results are all directly relevant for practical applications without requiring the knowledge or the estimation of the slower rate of convergence.","[Antoine, Bertille] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Renault, Eric] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",Simon Fraser University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Antoine, B (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",bertille_antoine@sfu.ca; renault@email.unc.edu,"Antoine, Bertille/AGV-6595-2022",,,,,,23,31,32,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

We systematically analysed the cost effectiveness of treatments for the different stages of NSCLC, with particular emphasis on more recently approved agents. Numerous economic analyses in NSCLC have been conducted, with a variety of methods and in a number of countries. In patients with localized disease, adjuvant chemotherapy appears to have greater cost effectiveness than observation; however, there are few published data. In locally advanced disease, combined modalities (chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy) are probably cost effective, but high-quality economic analyses are lacking. In advanced NSCLC, third-generation chemotherapies used in the first-line setting can be administered with acceptable incremental cost effectiveness. In the second-line setting, new agents (docetaxel, pemetrexed and erlotinib) have acceptable cost effectiveness. The lack of cost-utility analyses for elderly patients and patients with a poor prognosis rules out firm conclusions. This review suggests that most therapies for NSCLC are cost effective when the patient has a good performance status, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio under $US50 000 per life-year gained in the majority of cases.","[Chouaid, Christos; Atsou, Kukovi; Hejblum, Gilles] INSERM, U707, Paris, France; [Chouaid, Christos] Univ Paris 06, Paris, France; [Chouaid, Christos] Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Chest Dept, F-75571 Paris, France; [Hejblum, Gilles] Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Dept Publ Hlth, Paris, France; [Vergnenegre, Alain] Cluzeau Hosp, Chest Dept, Evaluat Unit, Limoges, France",Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Sorbonne Universite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Saint-Antoine - APHP; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Saint-Antoine - APHP; CHU Limoges,"Chouaid, C (通讯作者)，Hop St Antoine, Serv Pneumol, 184 Rue Faubourg St Antoine, F-75571 Paris, France.",christos.chouaid@sat.ap-hop-paris.fr,"VERGNENEGRE, Alain/AAG-5795-2019; christos, chouaid/R-4477-2018; Hejblum, Gilles/N-6337-2017","christos, chouaid/0000-0002-4290-5524; Hejblum, Gilles/0000-0003-0127-1964",,,,,59,35,36,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,2,,,,,113,125,,10.2165/00019053-200927020-00003,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,432IS,19254045.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000265127300003,0

At present, on global level, the issue of Agricultural policy and its instruments convergence across the EU emerges. The key element of economic development in each country is people, who in growing globalization conditions seek better quality of life, which is mainly provided through the labor market and full satisfaction of consumption needs. The changes of Lithuanian agricultural manufacture and employment in this sector, agricultural products and food export are related with free movement of goods in EU and with export support into third countries. The competitiveness of farmers in Lithuania significantly lags from EU farmers in productivity, incomes and size of farms. In order to clarify the approach to youth entrepreneurship and the entrepreneur's natural features, the students of Lithuanian Veterinary Academy Faculty of Veterinary medicine master degree studies were interviewed.

We prove that if there are two players and payoffs are generic, then an outcome satisfies forward induction if every game with the same reduced normal form after eliminating redundant pure strategies has a sequential equilibrium with an equivalent outcome.

Objective: This study aimed to value chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) health profiles, which describe the health of these patients over the course of I year from a societal perspective. Methods: We developed 16 COPD health profiles. Each profile combined a description of the severity of COPD during the stable phase with a description of the exacerbation profile in terms of severity, frequency and duration. These profiles were valued by a representative sample of 239 Dutch adults using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and time trade-off (TTO) methods. Value functions were estimated using random effects regression analysis. Results: Both VAS and TTO values consistently decreased as severity of the COPD profiles increased. Estimated TTO values ranged from 0.97 for mild COPD without exacerbations to 0.43 for very severe COPD with one non-serious and one serious exacerbation per year. The estimated decrements in TTO values ranged from 0.010 for having one non-serious exacerbation to 0.088 for having one non-serious plus one serious exacerbation per year. Conclusions: The value function may be an alternative way to model the joint impact of COPD severity and exacerbations on utility values in health economic modelling studies.","[Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P.

We consider a class of LM statistics based on non-parametric kernel estimators of the long-run variance and we develop a fixed-b asymptotic theory for the statistics. We provide results for the case of I(0) and I(1) errors. The fixed-b theory suggests that, for a given statistic, kernel and significance level, there exists a bandwidth such that the fixed-b asymptotic critical value is the same for both I(0) and I(1) errors. We compute these robust bandwidths for a selection of well-known kernels. In the case of the supremum statistic, the robust bandwidth LM tests have good power that is monotonic and similar for all kernels. In the case of the mean and exponential mean statistics, power is non-monotonic when the robust bandwidths are used. Under the null hypothesis, the Bartlett supremum statistic has little, if any, over-rejection problems in finite samples even when there is a moving average component with a negative coefficient. In contrast, the other supremum statistics tend to over-reject in this case. In practice, we recommend the Bartlett supremum LM statistic implemented with the robust bandwidth.","[Yang, Jingjing; Vogelsang, Timothy J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Yang, JJ (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",yangjin3@msu.edu; tjv@msu.edu,,,,,,,21,7,7,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Given an arbitrary stochastic future lifetime 7, the probability distribution function of the present value of a cash flow depending on 7 can be approximated by a mixture of exponentials, based on Jacobi polynomial expansions. In case of mortality-linked derivative pricing, the required Laplace inversion can be avoided by introducing this mixture of exponentials as an approximation of the distribution of the survival time T in the recursion scheme.

We show that in this environment, agents typically achieve more insurance than that obtained under self-insurance with a single asset. Consumption allocations exhibit excess smoothness, as found and defined by Campbell and Deaton (1989). We argue that excess smoothness, in this context, is equivalent to a violation of the intertemporal budget constraint considered in a Bewley economy (with a single asset). We also show parameterizations of our model in which we can obtain a closed-form solution for the efficient insurance contract and where the excess smoothness parameter has a structural interpretation in terms of the severity of the moral hazard problem. We present tests of excess smoothness, applied to U.K. microdata and constructed using techniques proposed by Hansen, Roberds, and Sargent (1991) to test the intertemporal budget constraint. Our theoretical model leads us to interpret them as tests of the market structure faced by economic agents. We also construct a test based on the dynamics of the cross-sectional variances of consumption and income that is, in a precise sense, complementary to that based on Hansen, Roberds, and Sargent (1991) and that allows us to estimate the same structural parameter. The results we report are consistent with the implications of the model and are internally coherent.","[Attanasio, Orazio P.] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Pavoni, Nicola] Bocconi Univ, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Pavoni, Nicola] IGIER, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Attanasio, Orazio P.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; University College London; Bocconi University; Bocconi University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Attanasio, OP (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",o.attanasio@ucl.ac.uk; nicola.pavoni@unibocconi.it,,"pavoni, nicola/0000-0003-3086-9447",ESRC [RES-051-27-0135]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [BEC2001-1653]; ESRC [RES-051-27-0135] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful for comments received from Marco Bassetto, Richard Blundell, Harald Uhlig, three anonymous referees, participants at the 2004 SED annual meeting, and several seminar audiences.

In comparison with the previous approximation models based on the assumption of continuous sampling time, the current research of working out a closed-form exact solution for variance swaps with discrete sampling times at least serves for two major purposes: (i) to verify the degree of validity of using a continuous-sampling-time approximation for variance swaps of relatively short sampling period; (ii) to demonstrate that significant errors can result from still adopting such an assumption for a variance swap with small sampling frequencies or long tenor. Other key features of our new solution approach include the following: (1) with the newly found analytic solution, all the hedging ratios of a variance swap can also be analytically derived; (2) numerical values can be very efficiently computed from the newly found analytic formula.","[Zhu, Song-Ping] Univ Wollongong, Sch Math & Appl Stat, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Zhu, SP (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Math & Appl Stat, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",spz@uow.edu.au,"Zhu, Song-Ping/C-6480-2019","Zhu, Song-Ping/0000-0002-2863-0640",,,,,43,96,106,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0960-1627,,,MATH FINANC,Math.

In most applications, the function of interest (e.g., an Engel curve or demand function) is assumed to be known up to finitely many parameters (e.g., a linear model), and instrumental variables are used to identify and estimate these parameters. However, linear and other finite-dimensional parametric models make strong assumptions about the population being modeled that are rarely if ever justified by economic theory or other a priori reasoning and can lead to seriously erroneous conclusions if they are incorrect. This paper explores what can be learned when the function of interest is identified through an instrumental variable but is not assumed to be known up to finitely many parameters. The paper explains the differences between parametric and nonparametric estimators that are important for applied research, describes an easily implemented nonparametric instrumental variables estimator, and presents empirical examples in which nonparametric methods lead to substantive conclusions that are quite different from those obtained using standard, parametric estimators.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Horowitz, JL (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",joel-horowitz@northwestern.edu,,,"NSF [SES-0817552]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0817552] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This article is based on the Fisher-Schultz Lecture that I presented at the 2008 Econometric Society European Meeting.

This paper also establishes the validity of tests suggested in the smooth moment indicators case for overidentifying restrictions and specification. In particular, a number of these tests avoid the necessity of providing an estimator for the Jacobian matrix that may be problematic for the sample sizes typically encountered in practice.","[Parente, Paulo M.

Then we compute the infinitesimal generator associated with the order book in a general setting, and link the price dynamics to the instantaneous state of the order book. In the last section, we prove the stationarity of the order book and give some hints about the behaviour of the price process in long time scales.","[Abergel, Frederic; Jedidi, Aymen] Ecole Cent Paris, Chair Quantitat Finance, Lab Math Appl Syst, Chatenay Malabry, France",Universite Paris Saclay,,frederic.abergel@ecp.fr; aymen.jedidi@ecp.fr,,,,,,,14,8,8,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-88-470-1765-8,NEW ECON WINDOWS,,,2011,,,,,,,93,107,,,,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Physics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Physics,BVM64,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291893200007,0

However, the relationship between the costs and benefits of available vaccines remains a controversial topic. Our objective is to systematically review the literature on the cost effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination against AOM in children. We searched PubMed, Cochrane and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE], NHS Economic Evaluation Database [NHS EED] and Health Technology Assessment database [HTA]) from inception until 18 February 2010. We used the following keywords with their synonyms: 'otitis media', 'children', 'cost-effectiveness', 'costs' and 'vaccine'. Costs per AOM episode averted were calculated based on the information in this literature. A total of 21 studies evaluating the cost effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were included. The quality of the included studies was moderate to good. The cost per AOM episode averted varied from (sic)168 to (sic)4214, and assumed incidence rates varied from 20 952 to 118 000 per 100 000 children aged 0-10 years. Assumptions regarding direct and indirect costs varied between studies. The assumed vaccine efficacy of the 7-valent pneumococcal CRM197-conjugate vaccine was mainly adopted from two trials, which reported 6-8% efficacy. However, some studies assumed additional effects such as herd immunity or only took into account AOM episodes caused by serotypes included in the vaccine, which resulted in efficacy rates varying from 12% to 57%. Costs per AOM episode averted were inversely related to the assumed incidence rates of AOM and to the estimated costs per AOM episode. The median costs per AOM episode averted tended to be lower in industry-sponsored studies. Key assumptions regarding the incidence and costs of AOM episodes have major implications for the estimated cost effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination against AOM. Uniform methods for estimating direct and indirect costs of AOM should be agreed upon to reliably compare the cost effectiveness of available and future pneumococcal vaccines against AOM.","[Boonacker, Chantal W.

In Belgium, the Drug Reimbursement Committee (DRC) evaluates reimbursement requests for orphan drugs based on multiple criteria: the therapeutic value, price and proposed reimbursement tariff; the importance of the drug in clinical practice; and the budget impact of the drug. Objectives: This study aimed to assess reimbursement dossiers of orphan drugs in Belgium and to compare them with the clinical evidence submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Methods: A qualitative analysis examined all reimbursement dossiers of orphan drugs that were submitted in Belgium between January 2002 and June 2008. The following information was extracted from each dossier: description of the orphan drug; indication; reimbursement status; therapeutic value and needs; budget impact; and number of registered indications. For selected orphan drugs, an in-depth analysis extracted and compared information about the clinical trials, their primary endpoints and results from EMA documents (i.e. the marketing authorization application file, European public assessment report and summary of product characteristics) and the Belgian reimbursement dossiers. Results: Reimbursement was awarded to the majority of orphan drugs. In addition to the official criteria, other negotiable factors, such as price adjustments, employment incentives, patient population restrictions and funding of diagnostic tests by the company, seemed to play a role in the reimbursement decision. Despite the low number of patients, randomized controlled trials were conducted for many orphan drugs. Budget-impact analyses were simplistic and did not consider the impact across multiple indications. Some differences were also observed between the clinical evidence submitted to the EMA and that submitted to the Belgian DRC. Conclusions: In addition to the official criteria, other negotiable factors, such as price adjustments and employment incentives, may play a role in Belgian reimbursement decisions of orphan drugs. Some differences have also been noted between the clinical evidence reported in EMA documents and the evidence included in Belgian reimbursement dossiers of orphan drugs. There appears to be a need for further standardization of Belgian reimbursement applications and for European cooperation in sharing clinical evidence of orphan drugs.","[Simoens, Steven] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Ctr Pharmaceut Care & Pharmacoecon, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Cleemput, Irina; Hulstaert, Frank] Belgian Hlth Care Knowledge Ctr, Brussels, Belgium; [Denis, Alain; Mergaert, Lut; Fostier, Christel] Yellow Window Management Consultants, Antwerp, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Simoens, S (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Ctr Pharmaceut Care & Pharmacoecon, Onderwijs Navorsing 2,POB 521,Herestr 49, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",steven.simoens@pharm.kuleuven.be,,"Hulstaert, Frank/0000-0003-2879-9910; Cleemput, Irina/0000-0003-4479-8950",Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre,Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre,"Financial support for this research was received from the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre, a state-funded research institution.

Necessary and sufficient conditions on the stochastic term structure movements for the absence of arbitrage are given. Background market risk as well as feedback contagion effects of the loss process are taken into account. Moreover, we show that any exogenous specification of the volatility and contagion parameters actually yields a unique consistent loss process and thus an arbitrage-free family of (T, x)-bond prices.

However, in order to meet the information needs of regulators such as the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), such disease-specific data need to be converted into a broader generic measure; for NICE, the preferred instrument is the EQ-5D. The process of converting QOL data from one instrument to another is known as 'mapping'. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the extent to which disease-specific measures generated in the clinical trials for a new treatment for chronic constipation (prucalopride) can be 'mapped' onto a preference-based generic measure (EQ-5D and SF-6D) to generate robust and reliable utility estimates. Methods: Disease-specific QOL data generated in the clinical trials of prucalopride (PAC-QOL scores) were converted into utility values estimated using the preference-based generic measure EQ-5D. SF-36 data were also collected in the clinical trials and used to generate SF-6D estimates for comparative purposes. Regression analysis was used to derive a range of mapping functions to identify the extent to which increasing the complexity of the hypothesized underlying mapping function enhanced the robustness and reliability of the obtained mapping relationship. Results: The mean utility observed at baseline for chronic constipation, based on SF-36 data, was 0.813 with the EQ-5D and 0.723 with the SF-6D. An examination of the differences between predicted and observed values generally found that the mapping functions generated were robust and reliable, with little evidence of bias across the range of the dependent variable. However, the nature of the symptoms explored in the PAC-QOL measure was, in general, less severe than those explored in the EQ-5D. For example, the condition-specific measures explored the degree to which patients experienced 'discomfort', rather than 'pain' as evaluated in the EQ-5D. Given this limitation in the severity range covered in the disease-specific measures, it is perhaps not surprising that a 'floor effect' was identified, with certain health dimensions mapping only to the upper range of the EQ-5D measure. Conclusions: In circumstances where direct utility measurement is not available, mapping provides a valuable method by which to estimate utility data for incorporation into cost-effectiveness analyses. Our findings emphasize the importance of the structure and nature of the mapping analysis undertaken as being a fundamental determinant of the utility estimates generated. Unfortunately, the theoretical guidance available to steer such analyses is still comparatively underdeveloped and this remains an area of health economic analysis in which empiricism largely rules. Ensuring that such mapping is undertaken and interpreted in as transparent and robust a manner as possible is therefore crucial in allowing regulators to accurately compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of new drugs across therapeutic areas.","[Parker, Mark; Haycox, Alan; Graves, Jane] Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Liverpool L69 7ZH, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Haycox, A (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Chatham St, Liverpool L69 7ZH, Merseyside, England.",ahay@liv.ac.uk,,,Movetis,Movetis,The case study described in this article was partly funded by an unrestricted educational grant from Movetis.

Models are based on scientific knowledge of disease (which is likely to change over time), simplifying assumptions and input parameters with different levels of uncertainty; therefore, it is sensible to explore the consistency of model predictions with observational data. Calibration is a useful tool for estimating uncertain parameters, as well as more accurately defining model uncertainty (particularly with respect to the representation of correlations between parameters). Calibration involves the comparison of model outputs (e.g. disease prevalence rates) with empirical data, leading to the identification of model parameter values that achieve a good fit. This article provides guidance on the theoretical underpinnings of different calibration methods. The calibration process is divided into seven steps and different potential methods at each step are discussed, focusing on the particular features of disease models in economic evaluation. The seven steps are (i) Which parameters should be varied in the calibration process? (ii) Which calibration targets should be used? (iii) What measure of goodness of fit should be used? (iv) What parameter search strategy should be used? (v) What determines acceptable goodness-of-fit parameter sets (convergence criteria)? (vi) What determines the termination of the calibration process (stopping rule)? (vii) How should the model calibration results and economic parameters be integrated? The lack of standards in calibrating disease models in economic evaluation can undermine the credibility of calibration methods. In order to avoid the scepticism regarding calibration, we ought to unify the way we approach the problems and report the methods used, and continue to investigate different methods.","[Vanni, Tazio; Legood, Rosa] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Policy, Hlth Serv Res Unit, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Vanni, Tazio; White, Richard G.; Edmunds, W.

While some of these stylized facts, such as the inverse cubic law distribution of price returns indeed seem to be universal, there is less consensus about other phenomena. In particular, there has been a long-running debate in the literature about whether the distributions of trading volume V-Delta t and the number of trades N-Delta t occurring in a given time interval Delta t, are universal, and whether the volume distribution is Levy-stable. In this article, we analyse data from the National Stock Exchange of India, both daily and high frequency tick-by-tick, to answer the above questions. We observe that it is difficult to fit the V-Delta t and N-Delta t distributions for all stocks using the same theoretical curve, e.g., one having a power-law form. Instead, we use the concept of the stability of a distribution under temporal aggregation of data to show that both these distributions converge towards a Gaussian when considered at a time-scale of Delta t = 10 days. This appears to rule out the possibility that either of these distributions could be Levy-stable and at least for the Indian market, the claim for universality of the volume distribution does not hold.","[Vijayaraghavan, Vikram S.] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Sinha, Sitabhra] Inst Math Sci, Madras 600113, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc) India,"Vijayaraghavan, VS (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",vikramsv@smail.iitm.ac.in; sitabhra@imsc.res.in,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-88-470-1765-8,NEW ECON WINDOWS,,,2011,,,,,,,17,+,,,,,,3,"Business, Finance; Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Physics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Physics,BVM64,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291893200002,0

We first demonstrate that the limiting null distributions of the rank statistics coincide with those derived by previous authors who assume either independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) or (strict and covariance) stationary martingale difference innovations. We then propose wild bootstrap implementations of the cointegrating rank tests and demonstrate that the associated bootstrap rank statistics replicate the first-order asymptotic null distributions of the rank statistics. We show that the same is also true of the corresponding rank tests based on the i.i.d. bootstrap of Swensen (2006, Econometrica 74, 1699-1714). The wild bootstrap, however, has the important property that, unlike the i.i.d. bootstrap, it preserves in the resampled data the pattern of heteroskedasticity present in the original shocks. Consistent with this, numerical evidence suggests that, relative to tests based on the asymptotic critical values or the i.i.d. bootstrap, the wild bootstrap rank tests perform very well in small samples under a variety of conditionally heteroskedastic innovation processes. An empirical application to the term structure of interest rates is given.","[Taylor, A. M.

It is well-known that this leads to time inconsistency, so that optimal strategies are no longer implementable. We then define equilibrium strategies to be such that unilateral deviations occurring during a small time interval are penalized. Non-equilibrium strategies are not implementable, so only equilibrium strategies should be considered by a rational planner. We show that there exists such strategies which are (a) smooth, and (b) lead to stationary growth, as in the classical Ramsey model. Finally, we prove an existence and multiplicity result: for logarithmic utility and quasi-exponential discount, there is an interval I such that, for every k in I, there is an equilibrium strategy converging to k. We conclude by giving an example where the planner is led to non-constant discount rates by considerations of intergenerational equity.","[Ekeland, Ivar] Univ British Columbia, Canada Res Chair Math Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Lazrak, Ali] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Ekeland, I (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Canada Res Chair Math Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",ekeland@math.ubc.ca; ali.lazrak@sauder.ubc.ca,,,,,,,16,76,82,1,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

More productive firms pay higher wages and exporting increases the wage paid by a firm with a given productivity. The opening of trade enhances wage inequality and can either raise or reduce unemployment. While wage inequality is higher in a trade equilibrium than in autarky, gradual trade liberalization first increases and later decreases inequality.","[Helpman, Elhanan] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",Harvard University; Princeton University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Helpman, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, 217 Littatter Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ehelpman@harvard.edu; itskhoki@princeton.edu; s.j.redding@lse.ac.uk,,"tavasoli, farzan/0000-0001-5211-645X",National Science Foundation; Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics; Yale School of Management; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics; Yale School of Management; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper is a combined version of Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2008a, 2008b).

The drift is filtered from a combination of price observations and the privileged information, fusing a partial information scenario with enlargement of filtration techniques. We apply a variant of the Kalman-Bucy filter to infer a signal, given a combination of an observation process and some additional information. This converts the combined partial and inside information model to a full information model, and the associated investment problem for HARA utility is explicitly solved via duality methods. We consider the cases in which the agent has information on the terminal value of the Brownian motion driving the stock, and on the terminal stock price itself. Comparisons are drawn with the classical partial information case without insider knowledge. The parameter uncertainty results in stock price inside information being more valuable than Brownian information, and perfect knowledge of the future stock price leads to infinite additional utility. This is in contrast to the conventional case in which the stock drift is assumed known, in which perfect information of any kind leads to unbounded additional utility, since stock price information is then indistinguishable from Brownian information.","[Danilova, Albina] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Math, London, England; [Monoyios, Michael; Ng, Andrew] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford,"Monoyios, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford, England.",monoyios@maths.ox.ac.uk,,"Monoyios, Michael/0000-0002-2286-418X",,,,,30,15,16,1,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

Solvency II, the European Commission's planned reform of the regulation of insurance companies is well underway. One of its consequences will be a shift in focus to internally based models in determining the regulatory capital needed to cover unexpected losses. This evolution emphasises the importance of credit risk assessment through internal ratings. In light of this new prudential regulation, this paper suggests a Basel II compliant approach to predicting credit ratings for non-rated corporations and evaluates its performance compared to external ratings. The paper provides an interesting modelling of non-financial European companies rated by S&P. In developing the model, broad applicability is set as an important boundary condition. Even though the model developed is fairly simple and maintains a high level of granularity, it gives high rates of accuracy and is very interpretable. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Skills are determined by parental environments and investments at different stages of childhood. We estimate the elasticity of substitution between investments in one period and stocks of skills in that period to assess the benefits of early investment in children compared to later remediation. We establish nonparametric identification of a general class of production technologies based on nonlinear factor models with endogenous inputs. A by-product of our approach is a framework for evaluating childhood and schooling interventions that does not rely on arbitrarily scaled test scores as outputs and recognizes the differential effects of the same bundle of skills in different tasks. Using the estimated technology, we determine optimal targeting of interventions to children with different parental and personal birth endowments. Substitutability decreases in later stages of the life cycle in the production of cognitive skills. It is roughly constant across stages of the life cycle in the production of noncognitive skills. This finding has important implications for the design of policies that target the disadvantaged. For most configurations of disadvantage it is optimal to invest relatively more in the early stages of childhood than in later stages.","[Cunha, Flavio] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA; [Heckman, James J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Heckman, James J.] Univ Coll Dublin, Geary Inst, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Heckman, James J.] Amer Bar Fdn, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Schennach, Susanne M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Chicago; University College Dublin; University of Chicago,"Cunha, F (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA.",fcunha@sas.upenn.edu; jjh@uchicago.edu; smschenn@uchicago.edu,,"Cunha, Flavio/0000-0003-3265-7894","National Science Foundation [SES-0241858, SES-0099195, SES-0452089, SES-0752699]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R01HD43411]; J.

Those surveys offering low-cost prepaid incentives and promised lottery incentives or offering promised certain (low-cost) and lottery incentives simultaneously engender the highest completion (OR= 1.79). Contingent incentives have the most stable effectiveness and contingency of incentives (certain, contingent, and combined) exert a moderate impact on effectiveness of material incentives.

Objectives: To predict the effects of the ritonavir-boosted, HIV protease inhibitor (PI) darunavir on the direct costs of care, while accounting for CD4 cell counts, during the first year of therapy in highly treatment-experienced, HIV-infected adults in different healthcare settings. Methods: The mean annual per-patient cost of darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) and control PI-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was calculated from the proportional use of antiretroviral agents in the DRV/r and control PI arms of the pooled POWER 1 and 2 trials, applying drug-acquisition costs for five healthcare settings. Non-antiretroviral-related costs by CD4 cell count, derived from non-interventional studies in the same settings, were applied to the POWER data (proportion of patients with CD4 cell counts in different strata at week 48) to estimate mean annual non-antiretroviral-related costs per patient in patients receiving DRV/r or control PI-based HAART during year 1. Results: Across all settings, the mean annual per-patient cost of DRV/r-based treatment was 2-19% higher than that of control PI-based therapy during the first year of therapy. By raising CD4 cell counts, however, DRV/r-based regimens were predicted to lower mean annual non-antiretroviral-related costs by 16-38% compared with control PI-based therapy. When combined, the total annual per-patient cost of HIV care during the first year of therapy was estimated to be 7% lower in the DRV/r compared with the control PI arm using US data, 8% lower using Swedish data, budget neutral using UK and Belgian data and 5% higher using Italian data. Conclusions: Darunavir-based HAART may lower non-antiretroviral-related costs compared with control PI-based therapy in highly treatment-experienced, HIV-infected patients during the first year of therapy by improving patients' CD4 cell counts. These costs could partly/fully offset the increased acquisition cost of DRV/r in this patient population over the same period.","[Smets, Erik] Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Serv LLC, B-2800 Mechelen, Belgium; [Allegri, Gabriele] Janssen Cilag SpA, Cologno Monzese, Italy; [Lothgren, Mickael] Janssen Cilag AB, Stockholm, Sweden; [Hemmett, Lindsay] Tibotec, Buckingham, England; [Gebo, Kelly] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD USA; [Hill, Andrew M.] Tibotec BVBA, Mechelen, Belgium; [Hill, Andrew M.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Pharmacol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson; Johns Hopkins University; Johnson & Johnson; University of Liverpool,"Smets, E (通讯作者)，Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Serv LLC, Gen Wittelaan L11 B3, B-2800 Mechelen, Belgium.",ESMETS1@its.jnj.com,"Gebo, Kelly/AHA-7533-2022","Gebo, Kelly/0000-0003-4010-398X",Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services; Tibotec,Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services; Tibotec,"The authors are grateful to Tony Vangeneugden, Ben Van Baelen, Eric Lefebvre, Sabrina Spinosa-Guzman, Frank Tomaka, Piet De Doncker and the rest of the darunavir study team for their contributions.

And auditors pay more attention to the financial restatement due to fraud and the risk-adjusted of Audit Fee to the restatement due to fraud is much greater than the others. Meanwhile the promulgation of New Audit Standard enhances the auditors' reaction to restatement. The risk-adjusted of audit fee to the restatement increase significantly and the degree of augment is much higher to the restatement due to fraud.

Data for this study were collected from 197 listed companies out of 11 industries in the People's Republic of China, and were used in hierarchical modeling to test the interrelations among innovative strategy, top management human capital, employee human capital, and corporate performance. The results reveal that top management human capital and employee human capital exhibit direct positive effects on corporate performance respectively, and human capital is the source of a firm's value enhancement The findings also show that. employee human capital mediates the relationship between top management human capital and corporate performance, thus top management human capital that enhances corporate performance needs to fit with employee human capital, and top management should inspire employees to behave their human capital to create value for the firm. Furthermore, the findings indicate that there is an interfering interactive effect between innovative strategy and top management human capital on corporate performance. Therefore, the level of top management human capital and its development should maintain fairly good coordination with the determination and implementation of firm innovative strategy so as to achieve high performance and obtain competitive advantage.","[Tian Li-fa; Gao Su-ying] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R China; [Gao Su-ying; Zhao Shu-ming] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China",Hebei University of Technology; Nanjing University,"Tian, LF (通讯作者)，Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R China.",,,,Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [70732002]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [G2009000137]; Social Science Foundation of Hebei Province [HB10XGL203],Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province); Social Science Foundation of Hebei Province,"Supported by the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (70732002) , Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (G2009000137) and the Social Science Foundation of Hebei Province (HB10XGL203).",,36,0,0,0,8,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,375,383,,,,,,9,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100053,0

Since the pioneering work of Gerber and Shiu (1994), the use of the Esscher transform for option valuation has also been investigated extensively. However, the relationships between the asset pricing model based on the Esscher transform and some fundamental equilibrium-based asset pricing models, such as consumption-based models. have so far not been well-explored. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between consumption-based models and asset pricing models based on Esscher-type transformations in a discrete-time setting. Based on certain assumptions for the distributions of asset returns, changes in aggregate consumptions and returns on the market portfolio, we construct pricing measures that are consistent with those arising from Esscher-type transformations. Explicit relationships between the market price of risk, and the risk preference parameters are derived for some particular cases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Instead of using the Variance as a risk measure we consider the Expected Shortfall (Tail-Value-at-Risk) and include capital costs and take constraints on risk capital into account. Starting from a risk-based capital allocation, the paper presents an optimization scheme for sharing risk in a multi-risk class environment. Risk sharing takes place between two portfolios and the pricing of risktransfer reflects both portfolio structures. This allows us to shed more light on the question of how optimal risk sharing is characterized in a situation where risk transfer takes place between parties employing similar risk and performance measures. Recent developments in the regulatory domain ('risk-based supervision') pushing for common, insurance industry-wide risk measures underline the importance of this question. The paper includes a simple non-life insurance example illustrating optimal risk transfer in terms of retentions of common reinsurance structures.","AXA Winterthur, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland",,"Kull, A (通讯作者)，AXA Winterthur, POB 357, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland.",andreas.kull@axa-winterthur.ch,,,,,,,26,4,4,0,9,PEETERS,LEUVEN,"BONDGENOTENLAAN 153, B-3000 LEUVEN, BELGIUM",0515-0361,,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,NOV,2009,39.0,2,,,,,591,613,,10.2143/AST.39.2.2044650,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,531DA,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000272641700011,0

We study rules that associate to each profile of preferences a partition of the society. We focus on strategy-proof rules on restricted domains of preferences, as the domains of additively representable or separable preferences. In such domains, the only strategy-proof and individually rational rules that satisfy either a weak version of efficiency or non-bossiness and flexibility are single-lapping rules. Single-lapping rules are characterized by severe restrictions on the set of feasible coalitions that are consistent with hierarchical organizations. These restrictions are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a unique core-stable partition. In fact, single-lapping rules always select the associated unique core-stable partition. Thus, our results highlight the relation between the non-cooperative concept of strategy-proofness and the cooperative concept of uniqueness of core-stable partitions.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Fudamentos Anal Econ 2, Fac CC Econ & Empresariales, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Rodríguez-Alvarez, C (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Fudamentos Anal Econ 2, Fac CC Econ & Empresariales, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",carmelor@ccee.ucm.es,"Rodriguez-Alvarez, Carmelo/L-4386-2014","Rodriguez-Alvarez, Carmelo/0000-0002-3008-6605",,,,,22,10,11,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Two trend break models are considered: the first holds the level fixed while allowing the trend to break, while the latter allows for a simultaneous break in level and trend. For the known break date case, our proposed tests are formed as a weighted average of the optimal tests appropriate for I(0) and I(1) shocks. The weighted statistics are shown to have standard normal limiting null distributions and to attain the Gaussian asymptotic local power envelope, in each case regardless of whether the shocks are I(0) or I(1). In the unknown break date case, we adopt the method of Andrews (1993) and take a weighted average of the statistics formed as the supremum over all possible break dates, subject to a trimming parameter, in both the I(0) and I(1) environments. Monte Carlo evidence suggests that our tests are in most cases more powerful, often substantially so, than the robust broken trend tests of Sayginsoy and Vogelsang (2004). An empirical application highlights the practical usefulness of our proposed tests.","[Taylor, A. M.

The risk process of the company is governed by either a compound Poisson process or its diffusion approximation. The company can also transfer a certain proportion of the insurance risk to a reinsurance company by purchasing reinsurance. The optimal investment-reinsurance problems with model uncertainty are formulated as two-player, zero-sum, stochastic differential games between the insurance company and the market.

We consider 1993-2001 data consisting of policy and claims files from a major Singaporean insurance company. A hierarchical statistical model, developed in prior work (Frees and Valdez (2008)), is fit using the micro-level data. This model allows us to study the accident frequency, loss type and severity Jointly and to incorporate individual characteristics such as age, gender and driving history that explain heterogeneity among policyholders. Based on this hierarchical model, one can analyze the risk profile of either a single policy (micro-level) or a portfolio of business (macro-level). This paper investigates three types of actuarial applications. First, we demonstrate the calculation of the predictive mean of losses for individual risk rating. This allows the actuary to differentiate prices based on policyholder characteristics. The nonlinear effects of coverage modifications such as deductibles, policy limits and coinsurance are quantified. Moreover, our flexible structure allows us to unbundle contracts and price more primitive elements of the contract, such as coverage type. The second application concerns the predictive distribution of a portfolio of business. We demonstrate the calculation of various risk measures, including value at risk and conditional tail expectation, that are useful in determining economic capital for insurance companies. Third, we examine the effects of several reinsurance treaties. Specifically, we show the predictive loss distributions for both the insurer and reinsurer under quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements. In addition, we present an example of portfolio reinsurance, in which the combined effect of reinsurance agreements on the risk characteristics of ceding and reinsuring company are described.","[Frees, Edward W.; Shi, Peng] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Valdez, Emiliano A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Math, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Connecticut,"Frees, EW (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jfrees@bus.wisc.edu; pshi@bus.wisc.edu; valdez@math.uconn.edu,"FREES, EDWARD/KBC-8981-2024","Shi, Peng/0000-0003-2789-3235",National Science Foundation [SES-0436274]; Assurant Health Insurance Professorship,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Assurant Health Insurance Professorship,"The first author thanks the National Science Foundation (Grant Number SES-0436274) and the Assurant Health Insurance Professorship for funding to support this research.

This makes it difficult, for example, to find statistically significant temporal structures in the data on the single asset level. By contrast, there is often a broader availability of cross-sectional data, i.e. a large number of assets in the portfolio. This paper proposes a stochastic dynamic model which takes this situation into account. The modelling framework is based on multivariate elliptical processes which model portfolio risk via sub-portfolio specific volatility indices called portfolio risk drivers. The dynamics of the risk drivers are modelled by multiplicative error models (MEMs) - as introduced by Engle [Engle, R.F, 2002. New frontiers for ARCH models. J. Appl. Econom. 17, 425-446] - or by traditional ARMA models. The model is calibrated to Moody's KMV Credit Monitor asset returns (also known as firm-value returns) given on a monthly basis for 756 listed European companies at 115 time points from 1996 to 2005. This database is used by financial institutions to assess the credit quality of firms. The proposed risk drivers capture the volatility structure of asset returns in different industry sectors. A characteristic cyclical as well as a seasonal temporal structure of the risk drivers is found across all industry sectors. In addition, each risk driver exhibits idiosyncratic developments. We also identify correlations between the risk drivers and selected macroeconomic variables. These findings may improve the estimation of risk measures such as the (portfolio) Value at Risk. The proposed methods are general and can be applied to any series of multivariate asset or equity returns in finance and insurance.

The main purpose of this paper is to show that, contrary to what is generally believed, omnibus specification tests only have substantial local power against alternatives in a finite-dimensional space (usually unknown to the researcher). We call such a space the principal space. We characterize and estimate the principal space for Cramer-von Mises tests. These results are some of the by-products of a detailed theoretical power analysis carried out in the paper. This investigation focuses on the class of the so-called integrated consistent tests under possibly heteroskedastic time series. A Monte Carlo experiment examines the finite-sample properties of tests and estimators of preferred alternatives. Finally, an application of our theory to test the martingale difference hypothesis of some exchange rates provides new information on the rejection of omnibus tests and illustrates our findings.","Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Escanciano, JC (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, 100 S Woodlawn,Wylie Hall, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jescanci@indiana.edu,"Escanciano, Juan Carlos/R-1878-2018","Escanciano, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-6559-416X",,,,,46,31,33,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

However, even with the recursive algorithms of Ruben (1962, Annals of Mathematical Statistics 33, 542-570) and Chikuse (1987, Econometric Theory 3, 195-207), numerical evaluation of these invariant polynomials is extremely time consuming. As a result, the value of invariant polynomials has been largely confined to analytic work on distribution theory. In this paper we present new, very much more efficient, algorithms for computing both the top-order zonal and invariant polynomials. These results should make the theoretical results involving these functions much more valuable for direct practical study. We demonstrate the value of our results by providing fast and accurate algorithms for computing the moments of a ratio of quadratic forms in normal random variables.","[Kan, Raymond; Wang, Xiaolu] Univ Toronto, Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada; [Hillier, Grant] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England",University of Toronto; University of Southampton,"Kan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Sch Management, 105 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",kan@chass.utoronto.ca,"WANG, Xiaolu/C-9563-2015","Hillier, Grant/0000-0003-3261-5766",,,,,39,10,11,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Moreover, the regression results indicate that asset volatility dominates bank size in determining the insurance premium. When the volatility risk is decomposed into two parts, credit risk significantly dominates interest-rate risk.

We uncover a number of factors and issues that are likely to influence the expected returns and, hence, the incentive to invest in new pharmaceutical R&D in tandem with the development of pharmacogenomics. Specifically, we identify how pharmacogenomics may lower the cost of drug development by shortening drug development times. Thus, pharmacogenomics may lead to an increase in a drug's effective patent life, and may also increase the demand and adoption rate for new products' For these and other reasons, pharmacogenomics may one day enhance expected future returns to R&D, leading to higher levels of R&D investment and an increased pace of pharmaceutical innovation. Our conclusions must be read with much caution, however, as there is considerable uncertainty as to how the area will evolve, both clinically and economically. The time horizon necessary for the science to develop and be adopted into clinical practice is not clear. Nevertheless, we think the issues and factors outlined in this article shed light on possible future economic outcomes and changes in the industry's structure, conduct and performance.

The Lithuanian employment policy is linked with membership in the European Union. The relevance of the work is to define Lithuanian situation in labour market and foresee employment policy in close correlation with EU strategy and financial instruments. The aim of this paper is to define the main theoretical aspects of the Lithuanian employment policy and its relation to the EU Employment Strategy. The goals of the performed research: 1. To show the connection between unemployment and economic, social development in the country. 2. To analyze the creation and implementation of the employment strategy in Lithuania. In the work, the theoretical method was used - the analysis and generalization of scientific literature, the analysis of legal documents, the analysis and generalization of statistics, the descriptive method.

Evidences show that the important assumption that the returns dynamics of the underlying stock have a continuous sample path which can be described by the stochastic process deviates from the real world situation. In this paper, I took the pattern of stock price movement as a process driven by the combination of the geometric Brownian motion and Poisson Process, and study the important factors affecting the default probability of corporate debt using MATLAB to do numerical simulation. It is found that: (a) in the occurrence of the rare event, the adoption of the model only based on pure geometric Brownian motion will lead to underestimation of bankruptcy risk. (b) the degree of asset value shrinkage following each negative jump is positively correlated with the default risk of corporate debt, and this default probability is a convex function of the corresponding jumping probability per unit time. (c) the marginal default probability is a non-negative random variable that varies as the times of asset jumps before the maturity of the corporate debt are different. Moreover, it will reach the maximum value when jumping probability and the degree of asset value shrinkage both approach to 100%. (d) when the degree of asset value shrinkage maintains unchanged, the greater the initial leverage ratio d, the higher default risk the company will face. Consequently, the agency problem between shareholders and creditors is likely to take place.","Nankai Univ, Res Ctr Corp Governance, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Nankai University,,xiaofei90@163.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,755,762,,,,,,8,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600128,0

While many theories explain why this change took place, we investigate the process of transition itself. We argue that local information transmission generates changes in participation that are geographically heterogeneous, locally correlated, and smooth in the aggregate, just like those observed in our data. In our model, women learn about the effects of maternal employment on children by observing nearby employed women. When few women participate in the labor force, data are scarce and participation rises slowly. As information accumulates in some regions, the effects of maternal employment become less uncertain and more women in that region participate. Learning accelerates, labor force participation rises faster, and regional participation rates diverge. Eventually, information diffuses throughout the economy, beliefs converge to the truth, participation flattens out, and regions become more similar again.

The uncertainty and volatility of future longevity has posed significant risk issues for both individuals and product providers of annuities and pensions. This paper investigates the effectiveness of static hedging strategies for longevity risk management using longevity bonds and derivatives (q-forwards) for the retail products: life annuity, deferred life annuity, indexed life annuity, and variable annuity with guaranteed lifetime benefits. Improved market and mortality models are developed for the underlying risks in annuities. The market model is a regime-switching vector error correction model for GDP, inflation, interest rates, and share prices. The mortality model is a discrete-time logit model for mortality rates with age dependence. Models were estimated using Australian data. The basis risk between annuitant portfolios and population mortality was based on UK experience. Results show that static hedging using q-forwards or longevity bonds reduces the longevity risk substantially for life annuities, but significantly less for deferred annuities. For inflation-indexed annuities, static hedging of longevity is less effective because of the inflation risk. Variable annuities provide limited longevity protection compared to life annuities and indexed annuities, and as a result longevity risk hedging adds little value for these products.

EDSs are deep out of the money digital put options that pay out a fixed amount (recovery rate) upon the stock price hitting a pre-set low barrier. The premium is paid out as contingent quarterly payments similar to Credit Default Swaps (CDSs). EDSs initially soared in volume as investors used them in capital structure arbitrage strategies involving the simultaneous buying and selling of EDS contracts, as spreads on EDSs were several multiples of CDS spreads. However, the contracts diminished in volume as CDS contracts took over. With the recent financial turmoil in the credit derivatives market, some attention has turned from CDSs and their associated structured correlation products such as Nth-to-default basket and synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) as CDS markets tend to be opaque and difficult to price. In addition, default correlations are not directly observable and recoveries are stochastic, making pricing and modelling difficult. As against this, the underlying stock prices in EDS are directly observable and the correlation is also directly observable. The EDS may therefore return to the credit fold and may be a complement to the CDS market. In this paper, we examine the pricing of CDSs using the CEV process and calibrate the CEV process to actual observed market prices for EDS; we then draw conclusions on the CEV process, the relationship between stock prices and volatility, and the relationship between CDS and EDS prices.","[Baaquie, Belal E.; Pan, Tang] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore 117542, Singapore; [Baaquie, Belal E.] Natl Univ Singapore, Risk Management Inst, Singapore 117542, Singapore; [Bhanap, Jitendra D.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Math, Singapore 038985, Singapore; [Bhanap, Jitendra D.] Natl Australia Bank, Singapore 038985, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Pan, T (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore 117542, Singapore.",g0600523@nus.edu.sg,"Baaquie, Belal/H-9295-2013",,,,,,9,2,2,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Various decision-analytic modelling approaches exist to estimate the cost effectiveness of health technologies for CHF. We sought to systematically identify these models and describe their structures. We performed a systematic literature review in MEDLINE/PreMEDLINE, EMBASE, EconLit and the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry using a combination of search terms for CHF and decision-analytic models. The inclusion criterion required 'use of a mathematical model evaluating both costs and health consequences for CHF management strategies'. Studies that were only economic evaluations alongside a clinical trial or that were purely descriptive studies were excluded. We identified 34 modelling studies investigating different interventions including screening (n = 1), diagnostics (n = 1), pharmaceuticals (n = 15), devices (n = 13), disease management programmes (n = 3) and cardiac transplantation (n = 1) in CHF. The identified models primarily focused on middle-aged to elderly patients with stable but progressed heart failure with systolic left ventricular dysfunction. Modelling approaches varied substantially and included 27 Markov models, three discrete-event simulation models and four mathematical equation sets models; 19 studies reported QALYs. Three models were externally validated. In addition to a detailed description of study characteristics, the model structure and output, the manuscript also contains a synthesis and critical appraisal for each of the modelling approaches. Well designed decision models are available for the evaluation of different CHF health technologies. Most models depend on New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes or number of hospitalizations as proxy for disease severity and progression. As the diagnostics and biomarkers evolve, there is the hope for better intermediate endpoints for modelling disease progression as those that are currently in use all have limitations.","[Goehler, Alexander; Geisler, Benjamin P.; Gazelle, G.

J,"Hoyle, M",,,,"Hoyle, Martin",,,Accounting for the Drug Life Cycle and Future Drug Prices in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Economic evaluations of health technologies typically assume constant real drug prices and model only the cohort of patients currently eligible for treatment. It has recently been suggested that, in the UK, we should assume that real drug prices decrease at 4% per annum and, in New Zealand, that real drug prices decrease at 2% per annum and at patent expiry the drug price falls. It has also recently been suggested that we should model multiple future incident cohorts. In this article, the cost effectiveness of drugs is modelled based on these ideas. Algebraic expressions are developed to capture all costs and benefits over the entire life cycle of a new drug. The lifetime of a new drug in the UK, a key model parameter, is estimated as 33 years, based on the historical lifetime of drugs in England over the last 27 years. Under the proposed methodology, cost effectiveness is calculated for seven new drugs recently appraised in the UK. Cost effectiveness as assessed in the future is also estimated. Whilst the article is framed in mathematics, the findings and recommendations are also explained in non-mathematical language. The life-cycle correction factor' is introduced, which is used to convert estimates of cost effectiveness as traditionally calculated into estimates under the proposed methodology. Under the proposed methodology, all seven drugs appear far more cost effective in the UK than published. For example, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreases by 46%, from 61 pound 900 to 33 pound 500 per QALY, for cinacalcet versus best supportive care for end-stage renal disease, and by 45%, from 31 pound 100 to 17000 pound per QALY, for imatinib versus interferon-a for chronic myeloid leukaemia. Assuming real drug prices decrease over time, the chance that a drug is publicly funded increases over time, and is greater when modelling multiple cohorts than with a single cohort. Using the methodology (compared with traditional methodology) all drugs in the UK and New Zealand are predicted to be more cost effective. It is suggested that the willingness-to-pay threshold should be reduced in the UK and New Zealand. The ranking of cost effectiveness will change with drugs assessed as relatively more cost effective and medical devices and surgical procedures relatively less cost effective than previously thought. The methodology is very simple to implement. It is suggested that the model should be parameterized for other countries.","Univ Exeter, Peninsula Med Sch, PenTAG, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Hoyle, M (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Peninsula Med Sch, PenTAG, Veysey Bldg,Salmon Pool Lane, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England.",martin.hoyle@pms.ac.uk,,"Hoyle, Martin/0000-0001-5593-9777",,,,,0,36,37,1,15,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,1,,,,,1,15,,10.2165/11584230-000000000-00000,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,708FN,21142275.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286347800001,0

Each of these theorems specifies a set of moment, dependence, and heterogeneity conditions on the underlying sequence that ensures the validity of CLT and IP. Special emphasis is paid to the case in which the underlying sequence has just barely infinite variance, since this case is relevant to econometrics applications that involve high-frequency financial data. Moreover, two new results on IPs that apply to heteroscedastic sequences are obtained. The first IP applies to sequences whose variances evolve over time in a polynomial-like fashion, whereas the second IP concerns sequences that experience a single variance break at some point within the sample.","[Kourogenis, Nikolaos; Pittis, Nikitas] Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, Piraeus 18534, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Kourogenis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou Str, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",nkourogenis@yahoo.com,"Kourogenis, Nikolaos/AAP-7447-2021",,,,,,53,1,1,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Methods: We used administrative claims data and generalized linear models to develop cost prediction equations for selected cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), angina, strokes and revascularization procedures. Separate equations were estimated for patients with events and for their propensity score-matched controls. Attributable costs were estimated on a monthly basis for the first 36 months after each event and annually thereafter, with differences in survival between cases and controls factored into the longitudinal cost calculations. The regression models were used to estimate event costs ($US, year 2007 values) for the 'average' patient in each event group, over various time periods ranging from I month to lifetime. Results: When the equations are run for the average patient in each event group, attributable costs of each event in the acute phase (i.e. first 3 years) are substantial (e.g. MI $US73 300; hospitalization for angina $US36 000; non-fatal haemorrhagic stroke $US71 600). Furthermore, for most events, cumulative costs remain substantially higher among cases than among controls over the remaining lifetime of the patients. Conclusions: This study provides updated estimates of medical care costs of cardiovascular events among a managed care population over various time horizons. Results suggest that the economic burden of cardiovascular disease is substantial, both in the acute phase as well as over the longer term.","[O'Sullivan, Amy K.; Rubin, Jaime; Nyambose, Joshua; Thompson, David] i3 Innovus, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Kuznik, Andreas] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA; [Cohen, David J.] St Lukes Midamer Heart Inst, Kansas City, MO USA",i3 Innovus; Pfizer,"O'Sullivan, AK (通讯作者)，i3 Innovus, 10 Cabot Rd,Suite 304, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",amy.osullivan@i3innovus.com,,"Kuznik, Andreas/0000-0002-8634-8360",Pfizer Inc; Boston Scientific; Abbott Vascular; Medtronic; Edwards Lifesciences; Astra Zeneca; Medrad,Pfizer Inc(Pfizer); Boston Scientific(Boston Scientific); Abbott Vascular(Abbott Laboratories); Medtronic(Medtronic); Edwards Lifesciences; Astra Zeneca(AstraZeneca); Medrad,"This study was sponsored by Pfizer Inc.

In large part the reason for this is a severe stability constraint known as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition which limits the latter class's efficiency. Implicit methods, however, are difficult to implement for all but the most simple of pricing models, whereas explicit techniques are easily adapted to complex problems. For the first time in a financial context, we present an acceleration technique, applicable to explicit finite difference schemes describing diffusive processes with symmetric evolution operators, called Super-Time-Stepping. We show that this method can be implemented as part of a more general approach for non-symmetric operators. Formal stability is thereby deduced for the exemplar cases of European and American put options priced under the Black-Scholes equation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach to describing the efficiencies of finite difference schemes as semi-empirical power laws relating the minimal real time required to carry out the numerical integration to a solution with a specified accuracy. Tests are described in which the method is shown to significantly ameliorate the severity of the CFL constraint whilst retaining the simplicity of the underlying explicit method. Degrees of acceleration are achieved yielding comparable, or superior, efficiencies to a set of benchmark implicit schemes. We infer that the described method is a powerful tool, the explicit nature of which makes it ideally suited to the treatment of symmetric and non-symmetric diffusion operators describing complex financial instruments including multi-dimensional systems requiring representation on decomposed and/or adaptive meshes.","[O'Sullivan, Stephen] Dublin City Univ, Sch Math Sci, Dublin 9, Ireland; [O'Sullivan, Stephen] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Sch Math Sci, Dublin 9, Ireland; [O'Sullivan, Conall] Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Banking & Finance, Michael Smurfit Sch Business, Blackrock, Co Dublin, Ireland",Dublin City University; University College Dublin; University College Dublin,"O'Sullivan, S (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, Sch Math Sci, Dublin 9, Ireland.",steve.osullivan@dcu.ie,"O'Sullivan, Stephen/P-4361-2019","O'Sullivan, Stephen/0000-0003-4108-3407",,,,,31,19,19,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Objective: This study aims to identify the optimum mix of interventions that are cost effective, from societal and healthcare provider perspectives, for the prevention and control of cervical cancer. Methods: A computer-based Markov model of the natural history of cervical cancer was used to simulate an age-stratified cohort of women in Thailand. The strategy comparators, including both control and prevention programmes, were (i) conventional cytology screening (Pap smears); (ii) screening by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA); and (iii) HPV-16, -18 vaccination. Input parameters (e.g. age-specific incidence of HPV infection, progression and regression of the infection, test performance of screening methods and efficacy of vaccine) were synthesized from a systematic review and meta-analysis. Costs (year 2007 values) and outcomes were evaluated separately, and compared for each combination. The screening strategies were started from the age of 30-40 years and repeated at 5- and 10-year intervals. In addition, HPV vaccines were introduced at age 15-60 years. Results: All of the screening strategies showed certain benefits due to a decreased number of women developing cervical cancer versus 'no intervention'. Moreover, the most cost-effective strategy from the societal perspective was the combination of VIA and sequential Pap smear (i.e. VIA every 5 years for women aged 30-45 years, followed by Pap smear every 5 years for women aged 50-60 years). This strategy was dominant, with a QALY gain of 0.01 and a total cost saving of Baht (Bt)800, compared with doing nothing. from the societal perspective, universal HPV vaccination for girls aged 15 years without screening resulted in a QALY gain of 0.06 at an additional cost of Bt8800, based on the cost of Bt15 000 for a full immunization schedule. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, comparing HPV vaccinations for girls aged 15 years with the current national policy of Pap smears for women aged 35-60 years every 5 years, was approximately Bt181 000 per QALY gained. This figure was relatively high for the Thai setting. Conclusions: The results suggest that controlling cervical cancer by increasing the numbers of women accepting the VIA and Pap smear screening as routine and by improving the performance of the existing screening programmes is the most cost-effective policy option in Thailand.","[Praditsitthikorn, Naiyana; Teerawattananon, Lot; Tantivess, Sripen] Minist Publ Hlth, Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program, Muang, Nonthaburi, Thailand; [Praditsitthikorn, Naiyana; Riewpaiboon, Arthorn] Mahidol Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharm, Bangkok 10700, Thailand; [Teerawattananon, Lot; Tantivess, Sripen; Limwattananon, Supon; Tangcharoensathien, Viroj] Minist Publ Hlth, Int Hlth Policy Program, Muang, Nonthaburi, Thailand; [Chichareon, Saibua] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Hat Yai, Thailand; [Ieumwananonthachai, Nantakan] Mahidol Univ, Fac Med Siriraj Hosp, Dept Radiol, Bangkok 10700, Thailand",Ministry of Public Health - Thailand; Mahidol University; Ministry of Public Health - Thailand; Prince of Songkla University; Mahidol University,"Praditsitthikorn, N (通讯作者)，Minist Publ Hlth, Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program, Tiwanon Rd, Muang, Nonthaburi, Thailand.",naiyana.p@hitap.net,"Praditsitthikorn, Naiyana/HSH-5274-2023; Riewpaiboon, Arthorn/AAV-1115-2021","Praditsitthikorn, Naiyana/0000-0003-1739-3552; Riewpaiboon, Arthorn/0000-0003-2959-3244; Teerawattananon, Yot/0000-0003-2217-2930",World Bank; Thai Health Promotion Foundation; Health Systems Research Institute; Bureau of Policy and Strategy; Thai Health-Global Link Initiative Project,World Bank(The World Bank India); Thai Health Promotion Foundation; Health Systems Research Institute; Bureau of Policy and Strategy; Thai Health-Global Link Initiative Project,"This study was conducted with funding from the World Bank's Population and Reproductive Health Capacity Building Program.

Both fluconazole and the echinocandins are recommended as first-line therapy for C/IC. Resource use and cost considerations are important in selecting appropriate treatment but little information is available on the economic implications of using echinocandins in this setting. Objective: To compare resource utilization and treatment costs (in $US) associated with the echinocandin anidulafungin (200 mg intravenously on day 1, then 100 mg intravenously daily) versus those of fluconazole (800 mg intravenously on day 1, then 400 mg intravenously daily) as first-line treatment for C/IC. Methods: Available charts from patients enrolled in a recent clinical trial comparing anidulafungin and fluconazole for C/IC were reviewed. Patients who were in the ICU at study entry were identified, and the following data, collected during the 13-week study period, were compared between treatment groups: global response at end of study treatment, number of days patients survived after hospital discharge ('hospital-free' days), hospital resource use, and C/IC-related costs (year 2008 values) to a US hospital payer. These comparisons were also conducted for all non-ICU hospitalized patients, and for survivors in both study populations. Sensitivity analyses explored the cost impact of variability in the hospitalization costs between ICUs and non-ICU wards and of reduced duration intravenous therapy. Statistical comparisons between the two treatment groups were conducted for clinical outcomes, resource use and cost measures, using regression models. All statistical comparisons were adjusted for baseline co-variates (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score, absolute neutrophil count and catheter removal status). Results: For ICU patients with C/IC (n = 63), global response was significantly higher for anidulafungin than fluconazole (68.6% vs 42.9%; p = 0.03). ICU patients treated with anidulafungin had an average of 13.9 more hospital-free days (18.2 vs 4.3 days; p = 0.04) than those treated with fluconazole. After adjustment for co-variates, although lower costs were observed for anidulafungin vs fluconazole in ICU patients and in ICU patients who survived, no statistical differences were found. For all hospitalized patients (n= 159), global response was also higher for anidulafungin (78.3% vs 60.5%; p <0.01). There was no difference in average length of hospitalization (29.6 days) or hospital-free days. After adjustment for co-variates, anidulafungin treatment resulted in an incremental C/IC-related cost of $US2680 (p = 0.73). For hospitalized patients who survived (anidulafungin 81.9%, fluconazole 69.7%), anidulafungin treatment was associated with an incremental cost of $US231 (p = 0.98). Conclusion: Anidulafungin as first-line treatment of C/IC appears to be of particular benefit to ICU patients, improving clinical outcomes and possibly decreasing costs, driven by reduced ICU and hospital stay, when compared with fluconazole. Anidulafungin also yielded significantly improved treatment outcomes in the general inpatient population, with total costs similar to fluconazole.","[Reboli, Annette C.] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Camden, NJ 08103 USA; [Rotstein, Coleman] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kett, Daniel H.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Maschio, Michael; Cartier, Shannon] i3 Innovus, Burlington, ON, Canada; [Chambers, Richard; Tarallo, Miriam] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Biomedical & Health Sciences; University of Toronto; University of Miami; i3 Innovus; Pfizer,"Reboli, AC (通讯作者)，Rowan Univ, Cooper Med Sch, Ferry Terminal Bldg,2 Aquarium Dr 305, Camden, NJ 08103 USA.",Reboli@rowan.edu,,"Maschio, Michael/0000-0002-6595-3019",Pfizer Inc; Merck; Pfizer; Astellas,Pfizer Inc(Pfizer); Merck(Merck & Company); Pfizer(Pfizer); Astellas(Astellas Pharmaceuticals),"This study was sponsored by Pfizer Inc.

Trying it on, it does not fill the measurements of a well-made theoretical concept: there is an element of arbitrariness in its very definition, it disobeys certain self-evident parity requirements, and it fails to generalize to more complex models.

The solution we obtain reduces in the case of quadratic loss to the solution of three partial differential equations of Black-Scholes type, one of them nonlinear.","[Rogers, L. C.

We mainly focus on the problem of residual spatial autocorrelation, in which case it is appropriate to restrict attention to the class of invariant tests, but we also consider the case when the autocorrelation is due to the presence of a spatially lagged dependent variable among the regressors.

We aim for sufficient richness to permit applications to a broad variety of commodity markets, including those that are characterized by seasonality and by spikes in the spot process. In the first, largely theoretical, part of the paper we derive a series of useful results concerning the low-dimensional Markov representation of the dynamics of an entire term structure of futures prices. Extending previous results in the literature, we cover jump-diffusive models with stochastic volatility as well as several classes of regime-switching models. To demonstrate the process of building models for a specific commodity market, the second part of the paper applies a selection of our theoretical results to the exercise of constructing and calibrating derivatives trading models for USD natural gas. Special attention is paid to the incorporation of empirical seasonality effects in futures prices, in implied volatilities and their 'smile', and in correlations between futures contracts of different maturities. European option pricing in our proposed gas model is closed form and of the same complexity as the Black-Scholes formula.","[Andersen, Leif] Bank Amer Merrill Lynch, New York, NY 10036 USA",Bank of America Corporation,"Andersen, L (通讯作者)，Bank Amer Merrill Lynch, 1 Bryant Pk, New York, NY 10036 USA.",leif.andersen@baml.com,,,,,,,39,22,22,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We therefore conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to November 2009 to summarize currently available information about how frequently, on average, treatment-effect modification occurs across trials that might be used on different sides of an indirect comparison. Although similarity is a key assumption, there is currently no published evidence specifically for indirect comparisons about how frequently treatment-effect modification occurs. Six analyses were identified that assessed treatment-effect modification across studies included in direct head-to-head meta-analyses. Such analyses are relevant to indirect comparisons because the phenomenon being investigated would occur with similar frequency. They provide important information because lack of treatment-effect modification across sides of an indirect comparison cannot be directly assessed statistically; this is in contrast to direct head-to-head meta-analyses where Cochrane's Q statistic or 12 can be used. For ratio measures such as the odds ratio and relative risk, treatment-effect modification occurred for 10-33% of meta-analyses. For the risk difference (an arithmetic measure), the range was 15-46%. It is not prudent to assume similarity in an indirect comparison, based only on the result that ratio measures such as the odds ratio are reasonably robust to treatment-effect modification. All indirect comparisons should include a thorough narrative comparison of differences in patient characteristics and study methods. This will provide end users with the best evidence with which to make an assessment of the likelihood of treatment-effect modification and the plausibility of the similarity assumption.","[Coory, Michael] Canc Council, Canc Epidemiol Ctr, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Jordan, Susan] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Herston, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Coory, M (通讯作者)，Canc Council, Canc Epidemiol Ctr, 100 Drummond St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.",Michael.Coory@cancervic.org.au,"Jordan, Susan J/AAE-6356-2020","Jordan, Susan J/0000-0002-4566-1414",National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia,National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),Susan Jordan is supported by a Postdoctoral Public Health Training Fellowship from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia.

Existing research on this topic is exclusively based on western countries. With the rise of family firms in China in the late 1970s, many founders found themselves approaching retirement age and need to consider succession issue. The strong desire of keeping business within a family in Chinese society implies children are preferred successors. Daughters have been increasingly considered and trained as the successors for family business in China. This paper explores father-daughter succession in family firms based on interviews of four female successors in China. The four cases present distinctive stages of succession and reveal deep influence of Confucianism in various aspects of father-daughter succession as well as challenges faced female successors in male dominant industries.","[Deng, Xin] Univ S Australia, Sch Commerce, Ctr Regulat & Market Anal, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",University of South Australia,,,"Deng, Xin/A-6036-2008","Deng, Xin/0000-0003-2149-0240",,,,,32,1,1,2,14,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1710,1718,,10.1109/ICMSE.2010.5720012,0.0,,,9,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100230,0

It's necessary for government to apply fit regulation mechanism to prevent against hidden irregularity of dairy processing enterprises. The purpose of this paper is designing effective hidden irregularity regulation mechanism of dairy processing enterprise based on the basic of Principal-agent Theory to prevent hidden irregularity. In this paper, it assumes that government is first principal, regulation department is secondary principal and enterprise is the agent, then we create and analyze hidden irregularity regulation model. Finally, the optimal regulation mechanism and relative properties are obtained. The results indicate that the impact factors of hidden irregularity of processing enterprises are award incentive, excess income, penalty amount and finding probability. Only government increases the supervision intensity and strength against inferior dairy products and provides award incentive for regulation department, regulation department will find irregularity actively and enterprise will choose regularity strategy.

There are growing pressures for a more systematic and quantitative approach to regulatory BRA. However, there is also a need for CER beyond the evidence that can reasonably be generated during prelaunch product development. Important regulatory and policy questions include the following. What would be a level playing field across disease areas and companies? Who should bear the costs of these studies? What role can benefit-risk modelling play? What is the value of research and how is it related to the prevalence of disease? What is the relationship between uncertainty and the value of evidence? We need to recognize the lifecycle nature of evidence generation, moving from the regulatory setting to the real world and affecting potentially hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of patients worldwide We need to emphasize not only the public goods nature of information embedded in innovations, but also that it is global.

These methods are based respectively on the analysis of log-periodicity and on the local fractal properties of financial time series in the vicinity of phase transitions (crashes). The log-periodicity analysis is made in a daily time horizon, for the whole history (1991-2008) of Warsaw Stock Exchange Index (WIG) connected with the largest developing financial market in Europe. We find that crash-like events on the Polish financial market are described better by the log-divergent price model decorated with log-periodic behavior than by the power-law-divergent price model usually discussed in log-periodic scenarios for developed markets. Predictions coming from log-periodicity scenario are verified for all main crashes that took place in WIG history. It is argued that crash predictions within log-periodicity model strongly depend on the amount of data taken to make a fit and therefore are likely to contain huge inaccuracies. Next, this global analysis is confronted with the local fractal description. To do so, we provide calculation of the so-called local (time dependent) Hurst exponent H-loc for the WIG time series and for main US stock market indices like DJIA and S&P 500. We point out dependence between the behavior of the local fractal properties of financial time series and the crashes appearance on the financial markets. We conclude that local fractal method seems to work better than the global approach both for developing and developed markets. The very recent situation on the market, particularly related to the Fed intervention in September 2007 and the situation immediately afterwards is also analyzed within fractal approach. It is shown in this context how the financial market evolves through different phases of fractional Brownian motion. Finally, the current situation on American market is analyzed in fractal language. This is to show how far we still are from the end of recession and from the beginning of a new boom on US financial market or on other world leading stocks.","[Grech, Dariusz] Univ Wroclaw, Inst Theoret Phys, PL-50204 Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,,dgrech@ift.uni.wroc.pl,,"Grech, Dariusz/0000-0002-3638-1250",,,,,45,3,3,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",,,978-4-431-53852-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,149,172,,10.1007/978-4-431-53853-0_7,0.0,,,24,"Business; Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Physics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Physics,BTS33,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000287957900007,0

Rational antibacterial policy, combined with enforcement of infection control practices are key strategies to combat AMR in the hospital setting. Loss of antibacterial activity as a direct result of antibacterial consumption can be modelled via the economic approach of a negative externality. Objective: To determine the externalities of antibacterial consumption and alcohol-based hand rub use for hand disinfection. Methods: A simple model was built, combining the results of a recently conducted cost-of-illness study with the results of a multivariate time-series analysis, which determined the impact of antibacterial consumption and alcohol-based hand rub use on the incidence of hospital-acquired infections caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (M RSA). Results: Consumption of a single defined daily dose of second-generation cephalosporins, third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and lincosamides is associated with a negative externality of about (sic)5, (sic)15, (sic)11 and (sic)12, respectively. In contrast, use of 1 litre of alcohol-based hand rub solution for hand disinfection is associated with a positive externality of about (sic)61. In other words, a single disinfection of the hands (use of 3 mL alcohol-based hand rub solution) saves an average (sic)0.18 of the potential cost incurred by M RSA-related infections. Conclusions: Quantifying the externalities of antibacterial use and alcohol-based hand rub use may lead to changes in prescribing behaviour and increase compliance with hand disinfection. Furthermore, the presented methodology of relating the cost of resistance to specific factors such as antibacterial use and hand disinfection provides information that may be useful for prioritizing prevention methods.","[Kaier, Klaus; Frank, Uwe] Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Kaier, Klaus] Univ Freiburg, Res Ctr Generat Contracts, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg,"Kaier, K (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Breisacher Str 115B, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",klaus.kaier@uniklinik-freiburg.de,"Kaier, Klaus/B-4227-2009","Kaier, Klaus/0000-0003-0837-6945",European Commission [2005203],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"Research on health and economic impacts of antimicrobial resistance by K.K. and U.F. is currently supported by the European Commission (Project BURDEN, Project commissioned by DG SANCO, Grant Agreement no. 2005203; http://www.eu-burden.info).",,26,13,14,0,21,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,12,,,,,1123,1128,,10.2165/11535640-000000000-00000,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,708JY,21108531.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286359300006,0

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based upon the manufacturer's submission to NICE. The ERG also independently searched for relevant evidence and modified the manufacturer's decision analytic model to examine the impact of altering some of the key assumptions. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from a single-placebo randomized controlled trial (RCT) of daily treatment with alitretinoin for 12-24 weeks, with follow-up for a further 24 weeks, in patients with severe CHE unresponsive to topical corticosteroids. A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved 'clear' or 'almost clear' hands by week 24 with alitretinoin than those using placebo: 48% with alitretinoin 30 mg (p < 0.001); 28% with alitretinoin 10 mg (p < 0.005); 17% with placebo. Most patients who responded remained in remission during the 24-week follow-up period. The most commonly reported adverse event was dose-dependent headache, with rates of 20% in the alitretinoin 30 mg group and 11% in the alitretinoin 10 mg group, respectively. Serious adverse events were rare, although alitretinoin was associated with increases in both total cholesterol and triglycerides. No direct or indirect comparisons of alitretinoin with any of the relevant treatment comparators (psoralen + UVA [PUVA], ciclosporin or azathioprine) were available. In the manufacturer's original submission to NICE, the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) reported for alitretinoin were 8614 pound per QALY versus ciclosporin, -469 pound per QALY versus PUVA (with alitretinoin dominant) and 10612 pound per QALY versus azathioprine (year 2007-8 values). In response to a request from the ERG, the manufacturers provided a revised model that compared alitretinoin only with placebo, for which the ICER was reported to be 12931 pound. However, the omission of adverse events entirely from this revised model, in combination with a number of other factors, led the ERG to conclude that the model underestimated the costs of treatment associated with alitretinoin. Estimates of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) were the primary source of uncertainty, with the use of values from an alternative source producing ICERs of around 30 pound 000 per QALY gained. The ERG concluded that, although the evidence presented indicates that alitretinoin is efficacious in the treatment of severe CHE, it gives little indication of alitretinoin's efficacy relative to likely alternative treatment options or its efficacy and safety in the longer term. Although the ICERs estimated by the manufacturer suggested that alitretinoin may be cost effective for use in the UK NHS, utilizing the alternative HR-QOL estimates resulted in a 2-fold increase in the ICER. Thus, there was considerable uncertainty as to the true ICER of alitretinoin versus the relevant treatment comparators. The Appraisal Committee recommended that alitretinoin be provided to those patients with severe CHE and a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of at least 15. They recommended that treatment be stopped as soon as an adequate response was observed, or if CH E remained severe at 12 weeks, or if response was inadequate at 24 weeks.","[Rodgers, Mark; Slack, Russell; Duffy, Steven; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Griffin, Susan; Paulden, Mike; Sculpher, Mark] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Ingram, John R.] Univ Wales Hosp, Cardiff CF4 4XW, S Glam, Wales",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Cardiff University,"Rodgers, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",mr14@york.ac.uk,"Griffin, Susan/AAE-8970-2020; Paulden, Michael/E-2061-2016","Griffin, Susan/0000-0003-2188-8400; Paulden, Mike/0000-0002-0381-5980; Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913; Ingram, John R/0000-0002-5257-1142",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [08/87/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 08/87/01) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment.

Objective: To examine the cost effectiveness of high-close versus low-dose statin therapy in CHIF patients. Methods: Two scenarios (literature-based [base-case scenario] vs trial-based post-event mortality [alternative scenario]) assessed the cost effectiveness of atorvastatin 80 mg/day (A80) versus atorvastatin 10 mg/day (A 10) in patients with both CHF and coronary heart disease (CHID) [CHF/CHD], using a lifetime Markov model The model predicts treatment-specific probabilities of major and minor cardiovascular events and death, based oil clinical trial data. The quality of life and costs were literature based Measures Included costs per life-year saved (LYS) and QALY gained Health consequences and costs were discounted at 3 0% annually Analyses were conducted from the payer perspective and valued in $US, year 2006-7 values. Results: Literature-based mortality estimates (base case) increased fife-years and QALYs For A80 compared with A10 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] SUS9600 per LYS. SUS13600 per QALY) At a willingness to pay of SUS100 000 per QALY, A80 was cost effective in 80% of simulations. A10 dominated A80 when using trial-based mortality estimates (alternative scenario) At a willingness to pay of $US100 000 per QALY, A80 was cost effective in 48% of simulations. Conclusions: Intensive A80 treatment may be cost effective versus A10 in cardiovascular prevention in CHF/CHD patients in the US. due to projected gains in life expectancy and health-related quality of life However, the results are highly sensitive to assumptions about the mortality rate in the model. When using the mortality rate observed in the trial, A 10 dominates A80.","[Rosen, Virginia M.; Taylor, Douglas C.

In this paper, the relationship between the consumption demand and the population urbanization was analyzed by the method of econometrics using the statistics data from 1978 to 2008 in China as sample. The demonstration analysis shows that the increasing of the urbanization level has being driven the growth of consumption demand. Therefore, accelerating the process of urbanization and increasing the urbanization rate of population is the fundamental way to increase our consumption demand.","[Yu Shu-bo] Shandong Univ Finance, Sch Econ, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Finance & Economics,,,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1924,1930,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100260,0

However, the issue of performance evaluation in the practice of electric power enterprise performance management based of indicators system is not only an evaluation of current value, but also a dynamics evaluation problem based on the dynamic time database. In view of this, the author proposed a timing dynamic evaluation model of performance indicators system in electric power enterprises, and simultaneously put forward a new way of weight-determine by considering time-value coefficient based on 'Vertical and horizontal method'. By the way, an empirical study is carried out, which shows the reliability and reasonability of this method and provides an effective reference and attempt for human resource management in enterprise innovation.","[Yu Shun-kun; Wu Yi-qun] N China Elect Power Univ, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,,,"wu, yi/JEP-1581-2023",,,,,,20,1,1,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,218,223,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100030,0
