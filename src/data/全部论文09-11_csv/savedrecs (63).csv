This paper explores how the changing climate is likely to affect oil and gas operations in low-lying coastal areas and the outer continental shelf. Oil and gas production in these regions comprises a large sector of the economies of many energy producing nations. Six key climate change drivers in coastal and marine regions are characterized with respect to oil and gas development: changes in carbon dioxide levels and ocean acidity, air and water temperature, precipitation patterns, the rate of sea level rise, storm intensity, and wave regime. These key drivers have the potential to independently and cumulatively affect coastal and offshore oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation, and several impacts of climate change have already been observed in North America.

In this way, the economic and environmental benefits of energy conservation activities can be enjoyed by both the investor and the end-user, which can reduce the investment risk and realize a rational profit allocation. This study presents a numerical analysis of the introduction of distributed energy resources (DER) into a Chinese urban area. An optimization model is developed to determine the energy system combination under the constraints on the electrical and thermal balances and equipment availability. According to the simulation results, the introduction of DER systems possesses considerable potential to reduce CO2 emissions, especially when considering that the economic profit of the CO2 credit will increase the incentive to adopt DER systems to an even greater extent. Furthermore, by sharing the energy cost savings with the investors under an ESCO framework, the investment risk can be further reduced, and the conditions required for the project to qualify for CDM can be relaxed.

Decomposition analysis has been employed to separate the structural effect (share of different products in the sector) from pure intensity effect (efficiency increase through technical improvement) for each industry. The results show that the combined effect (considering both structural and intensity effects together) on both iron and steel and paper and pulp industries is negative while it is positive for aluminum and textiles. The intensity effect for all the industries, barring textiles, is negative showing improvement in energy efficiency: iron and steel in particular, has seen a decrease of 134 PJ in energy consumption owing to improvements in efficiency. However, energy intensity in textiles has risen by 47 PJ due to increased mechanization. Structural effect is positive in aluminum and iron and steel industries indicating a movement towards higher energy-intensive products. In the case of aluminum, positive structural effect dominates over negative intensive effect whereas negative intensive effect dominates iron and steel industry. The paper helps in designing policies for improving productivity and reduce energy consumption in India's manufacturing sector. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Reddy, B.

It involves the delicate problem of complex coordination between countries on a truly global scale. As long as fossil fuels are too cheap, climate change policy will engage all major economies. The costs are high enough to make efficiency a priority, which means striving toward a single market for carbon plus tackling the thorny issues of fairness. Hopes for a grand deal were mercilessly shattered at Copenhagen in December 2009 and in other recent UNFCCC meetings, with the result that green growth is promoted as an alternative path. Indeed, green growth is clearly the goal, but it is no magic bullet. The world economy will require clear and rather tough policy instruments for growth to be green-and it is naive to think otherwise. Growth, green or not, will boost demand for energy and coal is normally the cheapest source. The magnitude of the challenge is greater if we also consider the problems related to nuclear (fission) energy and, in some instances, to bioenergy (such as its competition for land that may be essential for the poor). This paper discusses some necessary ingredients for a long-term global climate strategy. As we wait for the final (and maybe elusive) worldwide treaty, we must find a policy that makes sense and is not only compatible with, but facilitates the development of such a treaty.

One demand sector that promises strong returns for load management efforts is cooling and refrigeration. In these processes, thermal inertia provides a temporal buffer for shifting and adjusting the power consumption of cooling systems. We have conducted an empirical investigation to obtain a detailed and time-resolved bottom-up analysis of load management for refrigeration systems in the city of Mannheim, Germany. We have extrapolated our results to general conditions in Germany. Several barriers inhibit the rapid adoption of load management strategies for cooling systems, including informational barriers, strict compliance with legal cooling requirements, liability issues, lack of technical experience, an inadequate rate of return and organizational barriers. Small commercial applications of refrigeration in the food-retailing and cold storage in hotels and restaurants are particularly promising starting points for intelligent load management. When our results are applied to Germany, suitable sectors for load management have theoretical and achievable potential values of 4.2 and 2.8 GW, respectively, amounting to about 4-6% of the maximum power demand in Germany.

Empirically, we use the Bank of Italy's survey of household income and wealth (SHIW) dataset, and find evidence of a substantial urban rent premium, while we do not find support for an urban wage premium. We conclude that urban agglomeration is predominantly a source of positive amenities for residents and, in particular, highly-educated individuals seem to care about the welfare effects of agglomeration more than their less-educated counterparts.

This so-called 'water-energy nexus', is important to understand due to increasing energy demands and decreasing freshwater supplies in many areas. This paper performs a country-level quantitative assessment of this nexus in the MENA region. The results show a highly skewed coupling with a relatively weak dependence of energy systems on fresh water, but a strong dependence of water abstraction and production systems on energy. In case of Saudi Arabia it is estimated that up to 9% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be attributed to ground water pumping and desalination. Other countries in the Arabian Gulf may be consuming 5-12% or more of total electricity consumption for desalination. The results suggest that policy makers should explicitly consider energy implications in water intensive food imports and future restructuring of water demand. This will help in making more integrated decisions on water and energy infrastructure systems. An integrated assessment may in some cases favor water reuse and changes in the agricultural sector as opposed to the expansion of energy intensive and financially expensive desalination systems.

The specific objective was to estimate environmental Kuznets curves for two indicators of environmental quality and to establish whether the estimated relationships conform to the inverted U-shape hypothesis. The results of the empirical investigation generally suggest the existence of an environmental Kuznets curve for suspended particulate matter. In the case of organic water pollutants, the evidence weighs more in favor of rising pollution as per capita income increases. The turning point levels of income established for the two indicators of environmental quality were however generally low, when compared to evidence from existing studies. On the face value, this suggests that African countries may be turning the corner of the environmental Kuznets curve, much faster, and at lower levels of income, much in line with the emerging idea of a revised environmental Kuznets curve. The results also suggest that economic growth and rising incomes may matter in African countries in order to curb pollution from these pollutants, but more stringent policy measures, particularly at the industrial level would be required to curb environmental degradation from organic water pollutants.

Empirical estimates of the model are obtained using survey forecasts of annual GDP growth and inflation in the United States with forecast horizons ranging from 1 to 24 months, and the model is found to closely match the joint realization of forecast errors at different horizons. Our empirical results suggest that professional forecasters face severe measurement error problems for GDP growth in real time, while this is much less of a problem for inflation. Moreover, inflation exhibits greater persistence, and thus is predictable at longer horizons, than GDP growth and the persistent component of both variables is well approximated by a low-order autoregressive specification.","[Patton, Andrew J.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Timmermann, Allan] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Duke University; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Patton, AJ (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",andrew.patton@duke.edu; atimmerm@ucsd.edu,"Patton, Andrew/JXN-4362-2024",,Danish National Research Foundation,Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"We thank the editor, Serena Ng, an associate editor, and two anonymous referees for constructive comments.

The Indian government has enthusiastically adopted a second-generation feedstock - the oilseed-bearing shrub, Jatropha curcas - for an ambitious national biodiesel program. Studies estimating the production capacity and potential land use implications of this program have typically assumed that the 'waste land' slated for Jatropha production has no economic value and that no activities of note will be displaced by plantation development. Here we examine the specific local impacts of rapid Jatropha plantation development on rural livelihoods and land use in Rajasthan, India. We find that in Jhadol Tehsil, Jatropha is planted on both government and private land, and has typically displaced grazing and forage collection. For those at the socioeconomic margins, these unconsidered impacts counteract the very benefits that the biofuel programs aim to create. The Rajasthan case demonstrates that local land-use impacts need to be integrated into decision-making for national targets and global biofuel promotion efforts. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

For this reason, we used diverse sources to identify the key programmatic features that have contributed, but clearly are not totally responsible for, decoupling achievements of two countries ( China and Thailand) and then, on the basis of these findings, reviewed emerging industrial energy decoupling programs in four other countries (India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam). We found that the design of the two successful on-going decoupling programs have common features, which are setting an explicit target for decoupling of energy use and industrial output, a government program that offers financial incentives and imposes specific auditing and reporting requirements and involvement of the manufacturing sector in designing and implementing targets as they apply to individual enterprises. We also found that the emerging programs in the other four countries lack some or all of these essential programmatic features. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine the results of this strategy when entry limitation amounts to a limit on capital, but fishing firms can vary an unrestricted input, and thereby use the restricted input more intensively. Under these regulatory constraints, fishing firms will earn rents that depend on the elasticity of substitution between restricted and unrestricted inputs.

Pyrolysis biochar systems appear to offer greater carbon abatement than other bioenergy systems. Carbon abatement of 0.7-1.3 t CO2 equivalent per oven dry tonne of feedstock processed was found. In terms of delivered energy, medium to large scale PBS abates 1.4-1.9 t CO(2)e/MWh, which compares to average carbon emissions of 0.05-0.30 t CO(2)e/MWh for other bioenergy systems. The largest contribution to PBS carbon abatement is from the feedstock carbon stabilised in biochar (40-50%), followed by the less certain indirect effects of biochar in the soil (25-40%)-mainly due to increase in soil organic carbon levels. Change in soil organic carbon levels was found to be a key sensitivity. Electricity production off-setting emissions from fossil fuels accounted for 10-25% of carbon abatement. The LCA suggests that provided 43% of the carbon in the biochar remains stable, PBS will out-perform direct combustion of biomass at 33% efficiency in terms of carbon abatement, even if there is no beneficial effect upon soil organic carbon levels from biochar application.

Considering the existing situation, cost-effective operation of the TIC infrastructure installed in these regions (i.e. remote T/C stations) becomes critical. However, since in most cases grid-connection is not feasible, the up-to-now electrification solution for remote T/C stations is based on the operation of costly, oil consuming and heavy polluting diesel engines. Instead, the use of photovoltaic (PV)-based hybrid power stations is currently examined, using as a case study a representative remote T/C station of the Greek territory. In this context, the present study is concentrated on the detailed cost-benefit analysis of the proposed solution. More precisely, the main part of the analysis is devoted to develop a complete electricity production cost model, accordingly applied for numerous oil consumption and service period scenarios. Note that in all cases examined, zero load rejections is a prerequisite while minimum long-term cost solutions designated are favorably compared with the diesel-only solution. Finally, a sensitivity analysis, demonstrating the impact of the main economic parameters on the energy production cost of optimum sized PV-diesel hybrid power stations, is also provided.

There is a substantial literature on public attitudes towards environmental taxes. There has, however, been few comprehensive attempts to understand attitudes towards environmental taxes. The main research question in this paper is which factors influence support for fuel taxation. We propose a model of attitudes towards fuel taxation, and test this model as well as more specific hypotheses, using data from a representative survey of the adult Norwegian population. Our results suggest that support for fuel taxation is best predicted by beliefs about environmental consequences, followed by beliefs about consequences to others. Beliefs about consequences to self (self-interest) is the factor that explains the least variation in support for fuel taxation. The academically interesting result that support cannot be well explained without capturing a broad range of motivational factors is also highly policy relevant. It implies that there is no magic formula for increasing public support for environmental taxes. There are, however, some issues which can be addressed: trust in how well the government spends the revenue, and the perception that taxation does very little to change behaviour and thus to reduce environmental problems.

This new technique has radically changed the energy future of the United States. The U.S. has shifted from a waning producer of natural gas to a growing producer. The Energy Information Administration forecasts that by 2035 nearly half of U.S. natural gas will come from shale gas. Texas is a major player in these developments. Of the eight states and coastal areas that account for the bulk of U.S. gas, Texas has the largest proved reserves. Texas' Barnett Shale already produces six percent of the continental U.S.' gas and exploration of Texas' other shale gas regions is just beginning. Shale gas production is highly controversial, in part because of environmental concerns. Some U.S. states have put hydraulic fracturing moratoriums in place because of fear of drinking water contamination. The federal government has gotten involved and some states, like Texas, have accused it of overreaching. The contention over shale gas drilling in the U.S. may be a bellwether for other parts of the world that are now moving forward with their own shale gas production. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

An analysis of internal and external failures in UK renewable energy policy,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,RO reform; Internal and external failures; UK renewable energy policy,GERMANY,"Despite operating a delivery programme for RES-E since 1990, UK targets and policy goals have not been achieved. In response, the Government reformed the RO. This article re-examines UK renewable energy policy by analysing the internal and external failures of the various mechanisms to determine if Government has learnt from previous experience in reforming the RO. Government did not learn from their own actions during the NFFO/RO transition, evidenced by high-levels of similarity in internal/external failures. The reformed-RD is expected to significantly increase deployment, has provided a 'renewables package' by comprehensively addressing both internal/external failures but major internal failures (price/financial risk) still remain, resulting in contiguous failures over two decades and two mechanism changes (NFFO, RO, RO/reformed-RO). Success will again be heavily dependent on a select few technologies and new/untested measures to combat external failures. Mechanism-extension to 2037 is probably the single most important factor underlying potential deployment increases. However, introducing a FIT-like system via the sheer number of 'bolt-on' reforms to counter policy failures indicates loss of direction and clarity. Overall, although Government appears to have learnt some of its lessons from the past two-decades, significant doubt remains whether renewable energy policy objectives will be met via the latest mechanism change.

This paper compares current subsidization of the nuclear industry with providing equivalent support to manufacturing photovoltaic modules. Current U.S. indirect nuclear insurance subsidies are reviewed and the power, energy and financial outcomes of this indirect subsidy are compared to equivalent amounts for indirect subsidies (loan guarantees) for photovoltaic manufacturing using a model that holds economic values constant for clarity. The preliminary analysis indicates that if only this one relatively ignored indirect subsidy for nuclear power was diverted to photovoltaic manufacturing, it would result in more installed power and more energy produced by mid-century. By 2110 cumulative electricity output of solar would provide an additional 48,600 TWh over nuclear worth $5.3 trillion. The results clearly show that not only does the indirect insurance liability subsidy play a significant factor for nuclear industry, but also how the transfer of such an indirect subsidy from the nuclear to photovoltaic industry would result in more energy over the life cycle of the technologies.

This paper argues that in fact the net political effect of oil varies dramatically depending on the nature of the petrostate. It shows that oil income, when combined with revolutionary governments in petrostates, generates strong incentives for foreign policy aggression and international conflict. The aggressiveness of petro-revolutionary states is shown to have consequences in both military and economic spheres of international relations. Militarily, the aggressiveness of this type of state leads to a high rate of armed conflicts. Economically, the aggressiveness of petro-revolutionary states shapes global oil markets and international economic relations. The argument is tested using statistical analysis of international conflicts and economic sanctions. The policy implications are then considered, focusing on the negative global impacts of dependence on oil consumption. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Electricity share final consumption almost doubled, increasing from 8.8% to 17.2% in the period studied. However the energy intensity of LOSSES remained practically constant, which reflects the fact that the efficiency of electricity generation from coal (the main source of electricity) remained practically constant in that period. Despite the attractiveness of end-use devices running on electricity such as computers, which is typical of modern societies, the CO2 emissions are bound to increase unless coal is replaced by less carbon emitting sources such as natural gas, renewables and nuclear energy.

Under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations the financial incentives for the supply of biofuels have been volatile, e.g. 2008/2009 saw Renewable Transport Fuel Certificate values fall to zero. Any shortfall from the maximum value has significant implications for all biofuels. It is demonstrated that biomethane can be produced at a cost which is competitive with liquid biofuels and fossil fuels within the UK. Technologies such as water scrubbing, pressure swing adsorption and physical and chemical absorption are available to upgrade biogas generated by anaerobic digestion of organic wastes to transport fuel quality, and technologies such as membrane separation and cryogenic distillation are being modified for such an application. The manufacture and sale of biomethane as a transport fuel is also financially competitive with Combined Heat and Power. One limiting factor may be the additional cost of purchasing and maintaining biomethane fuelled vehicles. Support in this area could lead to the rapid expansion of biomethane transport fuel infrastructure and bring significant long term environmental and economic advantages. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

These efforts are designed to increase logistic and conversion efficiencies, enhancing the economic competitiveness of cellulosic biofuels. However, not enough attention has been paid to the future market conditions for cellulosic biofuels, which will determine whether the necessary private investment will be available to allow a cellulosic biofuels industry to emerge. We examine the future market for cellulosic biofuels, differentiating between cellulosic ethanol and 'drop-in' cellulosic biofuels that can be transported with petroleum fuels and have equivalent energy values. We show that emergence of a cellulosic ethanol industry is unlikely without costly government subsidies, in part because of strong competition from conventional ethanol and limits on ethanol blending. If production costs of drop-in cellulosic biofuels fall enough to become competitive, then their expansion will not necessarily cause feedstock prices to rise. As long as local supplies of feedstocks that have no or low-valued alternative uses exist, then expansion will not cause prices to rise significantly. If cellulosic feedstocks come from dedicated biomass crops, then the supply curves will have a steeper slope because of competition for land. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on this debate, this paper proposes criteria under which the depletion of non-renewable resources would create excess costs for future generations. Therefore, this paper aims to answer the question What will be the impact of the depletion of non-renewable resources on sustainable economic development? Accordingly, a sustainable development policy appears feasible by minimizing non-sustainable externalities which derive from future externalities that weigh the benefits from a previous employment of natural resources. The research based on qualitative analysis clarifies the reasons for and the extents of taking sustainability into account as well as points to difficulties of implementing policies to time the transition towards a sustainable economic development. Finally, the research shows the implications of this approach for environmental degradation, the depletion of non-renewable resources and energy production. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The economy consists of multiple regions and each region consists of the CBD and the residential area (like in the standard Alonso model). All the markets are perfectly competitive. The paper demonstrates a way to integrate some important models in the literature in transportation research, economic growth theory, urban economics, and regional economics. The simulation results for a 3-region economy provide some interesting insights into national economic development, regional agglomeration, and urban configuration. We demonstrate, for instance, that when the technologically most advanced region improves its transportation conditions, the national output is increased, the advanced region attracts more people from the other two regions, the advanced region's industrial and housing output levels are increased, the other two regions' output levels are reduced, the land and housing rents and residential distribution in the advanced region are reduced near the CBD and increased far away from the CBD, and the land and housing rents and residential distribution in the other two regions are reduced over the entire residential areas.","Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, Grad Sch Management, Sch Int Management, Oita 8748577, Japan",Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University,"Zhang, WB (通讯作者)，Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, Grad Sch Management, Sch Int Management, 1-1 Jumonjibaru, Oita 8748577, Japan.",wbzl@apu.ac.jp,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Data relating to embodied energy and emissions in buildings is limited. However, stochastic techniques can be used to estimate the distribution of such emissions from buildings. This helps policymakers identify which instruments are appropriate for achieving emissions reductions. A primary aim of this paper is to demonstrate this approach using a sample of apartment buildings in Ireland. A Monte-Carlo simulation suggests that the average probability distribution of embodied greenhouse gases in a sample of Irish apartment buildings is characteristic of a Wakeby distribution with a long tail which can be targeted for improvement through the implementation of appropriate policies. Two policies are investigated: one regulatory whereby the embodied emissions of building materials are limited to the 80th percentile of their current distributions; and one informational where buildings are given an embodied emissions rating. It is estimated that such policies could result in an average reduction of 450 gCO(2)-eq/E for the sample of apartment buildings analysed and could result in savings of (sic)2bn to EU-27 countries in avoided carbon credits.

Whilst there has been much discussion of the audit expectations gap, the financial statements' expectations gap has received much less attention. The paper contends that there is no point in trying to just tackle the audit expectations gap if there is a greater expectations gap relating to the financial statements themselves. It is suggested that possible components of the financial statements' expectations gap include the emphasis on decision-usefulness, the prediction of future cash flows, the imprecision of the word stewardship, and connotations that the balance sheet represents wealth. The inability to communicate the limitations of financial reporting and the preoccupation of the accounting standard-setters with satisfying user needs may be central to the financial statements' expectations gap.","[Higson, Andrew] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,,A.W.Higson@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,409,415,,,,,,7,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100055,0

The aim of the standard is to create financial statements which will provide information about the financial position, performance and cash flow as these are important for users' economic decisions. Another objective of the standard is the enhancement of the quality of the provided information, its comprehensibility in the international context and the reduction of load for accounting entities which have to report with the use of global standards. Currently, there is no obligation to use the standard; its acceptance depends on the European Commission and then the national legislation of each particular country. Because of the differences between the national GAAP in particular countries and the standard, it is certain that in case of transition to the standard there will be qualitative and quantitative differences arising from the differing approach to the recognition and reporting of assets and liabilities. The qualitative differences are brought about by the standard objectives in which it is assumed that the reporting in compliance with the standard will result in a truer and fairer view; moreover, the information from different countries will be comparable, which is not possible if national regulations are used. The quantitative differences arise as a consequence of the differing valuation of statement of financial position, assets, liabilities, expenditures and revenues, which will then be reflected in the differing values of profit ratio, indebtedness, or liquidity.

The New Economic Geography, now middle-aged, Regional Studies. This paper claims that the New Economic Geography has now become 'middle-aged'. On the one hand, the New Economic Geography is said to be of less relevance when describing current developments in advanced economies because it focuses more on tangible causes of the spatial concentration of economic activities, and not so much on intangible sources, such as information spillovers. On the other hand, the paper states that recent developments in developing economies like China are quite in line with the core-periphery model that predicts increasing regional specialization as a result of economic integration. Although both economists and geographers study these spatial processes, no fruitful exchange between the two is expected because of the use of different methodologies. [image omitted] Krugman P.

De l'autre cote, l'article affirme que des developpements recents dans les economies avancees, voire la Chine, sont tout a fait en accord avec le modele du centre-peripherie, qui prevoit une augmentation de la specialisation regionale suite a l'integration economique. Bien que les economistes et les geographes etudient ces processus geographiques, on n'attend aucun debat constructif a cause des methodologies differentes. Nouvelle geographie economique Agglomeration Regions Commerce international Krugman P. Die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie - inzwischen im mittleren Alter, Regional Studies. In diesem Beitrag wird die These aufgestellt, dass sich die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie inzwischen im mittleren Alter befindet. Einerseits gilt die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie als weniger relevant zur Beschreibung von aktuellen Entwicklungen in den Industriestaaten, weil sie sich starker auf die greifbaren Ursachen der raumlichen Konzentration von Wirtschaftsaktivitaten und weniger auf nicht greifbare Quellen wie z.B. Informationsubertragungen konzentriert. Andererseits wird in diesem Beitrag festgestellt, dass die jungsten Entwicklungen in Schwellenlandern wie China durchaus dem Kern-Peripherie-Modell entsprechen, in dem eine hohere regionale Spezialisierung als Ergebnis einer wirtschaftlichen Integration prognostiziert wird. Obwohl diese raumlichen Prozesse sowohl von Okonomen als auch von Geografen untersucht werden, ist aufgrund der Verwendung unterschiedlicher Methodologien kein fruchtbarer Austausch zwischen diesen beiden Gruppen zu erwarten.

En este articulo se defiende la tesis de que la Nueva Geografia Economica ahora ya ha madurado. Por una parte, la Nueva Geografia Economica tiene menos relevancia cuando se describen los desarrollos actuales en las economias avanzadas porque se centra mas en las causas tangibles de la concentracion espacial de las actividades economicas y no tanto en las fuentes intangibles, tales como los desbordamientos de informacion. Por otra parte, en este articulo destaco que los recientes avances en las economias en desarrollo como China se ajustan mucho conel modelo centro-periferia que preve una mayor especializacion regional como resultado de la integracion economica.

Exploring the effect of geographical proximity and university quality on university-industry collaboration in the United Kingdom, Regional Studies. This paper concerns the geographical distance between a firm and the universities in its local area. It is argued that firms' decisions to collaborate with universities for innovation are influenced by both geographical proximity to universities and the quality of these universities. The findings show that being located close to a lower-tier university reduces the propensity for firms to collaborate locally, while co-location with top-tier universities promotes collaboration. However, it is also found that if faced with the choice, firms appear to give preference to the research quality of the university partner over geographical closeness. This is particularly true for high-research and development intensive firms.","[Laursen, Keld] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, DRUID, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Reichstein, Toke] BEM Bordeaux Management Sch, CEREBEM, F-33405 Talence, France; [Salter, Ammon] Imperial Coll Business Sch, Adv Inst Management Res, London SW7 2AZ, England",Copenhagen Business School; Imperial College London,"Laursen, K (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, DRUID, Kilevej 14A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",kl.ino@cbs.dk; tr.ino@cbs.dk; a.salter@imperial.ac.uk,"Laursen, Keld/A-3441-2009; Salter, Ammon/A-9217-2010","Reichstein, Toke/0000-0002-1836-8802; Laursen, Keld/0000-0002-2763-3989",ESRC [ES/G042993/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G042993/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,55,275,298,12,217,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Design/methodology - comparative analysis of allocation of financing in absolute and relative terms is complemented with correlation analysis between financial and territory development indicators. The analysis is performed in regional (5 planning regions) and local (118 municipalities) level, as well as in such types of territories as municipalities with growth poles of international, national and regional importance, other municipalities and specially assisted areas. Findings - more financing in absolute terms has been allocated to more developed regions with an exception of least developed region Latgale which has attracted second largest amount of financing after most developed Riga region. In relative terms more financing has been received by the least developed regions due to large investments in public infrastructure. Although growth poles have attracted greatest part of financing in activities of local importance, in relative terms major growth poles have received less financing than other territories. Practical implications - in perspective when planning EU funds programmes more attention should be paid to promotion of education, science, entrepreneurship and innovations in regions. Otherwise least developed regions will not grow fast enough to reduce regional disparities. Creation of additional territorial principals to promote investments in major growth poles should be invented in order to facilitate concentration of resources thus increasing the ability of growth poles to encourage development in their surrounding areas. Originality/value - this article gives insight in the allocation of EU funds in Latvian territories both in regional and local level. It analyses the concentration of investments in growth poles, specially assisted areas and other territories. The evaluation is made in context with regional development strategy that is stipulated in Sustainable development strategy of Latvia till 2030.","[Vitola, Alise; Senfelde, Maija] Riga Tech Univ, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,,vitola.alise@gmail.com; maija.senfelde@rtu.lv,"Vitola, Alise/IZQ-5516-2023","Vitola, Alise/0000-0002-5253-5133",,,,,9,0,0,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,312,320,,,,,,9,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100042,0

To quantitatively assess the energy and environmental impacts of civil construction at a macro-level, this study developed a 24 sector environmental input-output life-cycle assessment model (I-O LCA) based on 2002 Chinese national economic and environmental data. The model generates an economy-wide inventory of energy use and environmental emissions. Estimates based on the level of economic activity related to planned future civil works in 2015 are made. Results indicate that the embodied energy of construction projects accounts for nearly one-sixth of the total economy's energy consumption in 2007, and may account for approximately one-fifth of the total energy use by 2015. This energy consumption is dominated by coal and oil consumptions. Energy-related emissions are the main polluters of the country's atmosphere and environment. If the industry's energy use and manufacturing techniques remain the same as in 2002, challenges to the goals for total energy consumption in China will appear in the next decade. Thus, effective implementation of efficient energy technologies and regulations are indispensable for achieving China's energy and environmental quality goals.

As one of the most important incentive-based policy instruments, carbon tax has sparked a lively controversy in China. This paper explores the impact of carbon tax on Chinese economy, as well as the cushion effects of the complementary policies, by constructing a dynamic recursive general equilibrium model. The model can describe the new equilibrium for each sequential independent period (e.g. one year) after carbon tax and the complementary policies are imposed, and thus describe the long-term impacts of the policies. The simulation results show that carbon tax is an effective policy tool because it can reduce carbon emissions with a little negative impact on economic growth; reducing indirect tax in the meantime of imposing carbon tax will help to reduce the negative impact of the tax on production and competitiveness: in addition, giving households subsidy in the meantime will help to stimulate household consumptions. Therefore, complementary policies used together with carbon tax will help to cushion the negative impacts of carbon tax on the economy. The dynamic CGE analysis shows the impact of carbon tax policy on the GDP is relatively small, but the reduction of carbon emission is relatively large. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, despite recent studies showing that B5 has similar performance qualities to that of the currently used ultra-low-sulfur petroleum diesel (ULSD) fleet managers and corporations still remain hesitant regarding a switch to B5. This research examined the major areas of concern that arise with transitioning fleets from ULSD to B5 with the goal of alleviating those concerns with quantitative results from an actual fleet implementation and transition. In conjunction with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) a comparison of cost, cold weather fuel properties, engine performance, fuel economy, and maintenance and repairs was conducted using data obtained over 3 years from a pilot study.

It shows that while the principle of minimum differentiation in location may be supported, the Pprinciple of maximum differentiation in location can never apply if firms engage in spatially discriminatory pricing. This paper proves that spatial agglomeration gives rise to the unique location equilibrium in both cases where firms charge uniform delivered and mill prices.

Energy use per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) declined by approximately 5% per year during this period. However, the period 2002-2005 saw energy use per unit of GDP increase an average of 3.8% per year. To stem this out-of-control growth in energy demand, in November 2005 the Chinese government enunciated a mandatory goal of 20% reduction of energy intensity between 2006 and 2010. The National People's Congress passed legislation identifying the National Reform and Development Commission as the lead agency to design and carry out programs in support of this goal. These policies and programs, created after almost a decade of decline of the energy-efficiency policy apparatus, have had considerable impact. Although initial efforts have not been sufficient to meet the annual declines required to reach the ambitious 20% energy intensity target, the latest reports indicate that China may now be on track to meet this goal. The paper provides an assessment of these policies and programs to begin to understand issues that will play a critical role in China's energy and economic future. Activities undertaken in China will have a significant influence on the global effort to reduce the growth, and later the absolute quantity, of greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A test is conducted to see if Venezuela has its production Granger cause its OPEC quota or whether the OPEC quota for Venezuela Granger causes Venezuelan production. The results show both occur at different times. In the short run, OPEC's oil production quota for Venezuela Granger causes Venezuelan production. However, shortly after cuts, Venezuela cheats on agreements, suggesting a tit-for-tat oligopoly game, which is not anti-competitive. In the long run, we show that Venezuelan oil production Granger causes OPEC's quota for Venezuela, but not vice versa. Having Venezuelan oil production Granger cause OPEC quotas for Venezuela in the long run suggests OPEC does not coordinate outputs as much as it reacts to them. The evidence suggests Venezuela is not a part of an OPEC anti-competitive syndicate even though we show that Venezuelan oil production is low. An alternative explanation for why Venezuela and possibly other OPEC members have low oil production outputs is that institutions and risk aversion, not cartel participation, is the cause. A vector error correction model shows that there is no tendency for Venezuelan oil production to converge to OPEC's quota for Venezuela. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we present an overview of the Finnish energy policy and economy and their effect on farms (the top-down perspective). Then we analyze the drivers behind the bioenergy decisions of farms in general and in the Oulu region, located in Northern Finland (the bottom-up perspective). There is weak policy coherence between national and regional energy efforts. Strong pressure is placed on farmers to improve their business and marketing knowledge, innovation and financial abilities, education level, and networking skills. In the Oulu region, bioenergy forerunners can be divided in three different groups - investors, entrepreneurs and hobbyists - that have different levels of commitment to their energy businesses.

We illustrate this effect on CO2 price and global energy transition within a MERGE-type general-equilibrium model framework, by considering simple stochastic CO2 policy scenarios. In these scenarios, economic agents know that credible long-run CO2 emissions targets will be set in 2020, with two possible outcomes: either a hard cap or a soft cap. Each scenario is characterized by the relative probabilities of both possible caps. We derive consistent stochastic trajectories-with two branches after 2020-for prices and quantities of energy commodities and CO2 emissions permits. The impact of uncertain long-run CO2 emissions targets on prices and technological trajectories is discussed.

This analysis explores the life cycle water consumption of alternative low-carbon energy sources for transportation. Energy sources analyzed include both biofuels used in internal combustion engines and low-carbon electricity generation methods used in conjunction with electric vehicles. Biofuels considered are corn-based ethanol, soybean biodiesel, cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass, and microbial biodiesel. Electricity sources analyzed are coal with carbon sequestration, photovoltaic cells, and solar concentrators. The assessment method used is hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA), which combines materials-based process method and the economic input-output (EIO) method. To compare these technologies on an even footing the life cycle water use to propel a passenger vehicle one mile is estimated. All technologies evaluated showed an increase in water consumption compared to unleaded gasoline when water use from vehicle manufacturing was included. Scale-up calculations showed that mass adoption of electric vehicles and some configurations of algae and switchgrass systems could potentially contribute to the decarbonization of transportation with tolerable increases in overall water consumption. Irrigated crop based biofuels however were found to have significant potential impact on water resources when scaled up to macroscopic production levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Update and analysis of policy, potential and reality",ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Biofuels; Development; Mozambique,LOCATION,"Climate change, rising oil prices and concerns about future energy supplies have contributed to a growing interest in using biomass for energy purposes. Several studies have highlighted the biophysical potential of biofuel production on the African continent, and analysts see Mozambique as one of the most promising African countries. Favorable growing conditions and the availability of land, water and labor are mentioned as major drivers behind this potential. Moreover, the potential of biofuel production to generate socio-economic benefits is reflected in the government's policy objectives for the development of the sector, such as reducing fuel import dependency and creating rural employment. This article provides an overview of biofuel developments in Mozambique and explores to what extent reality matches the suggested potential in the country. We conclude that biofuel developments mainly take place in areas near good infrastructure, processing and storage facilities, where there is (skilled) labor available, and access to services and goods. Moreover, our analysis shows the need to timely harmonize current trends in biofuel developments with the government's policy objectives as the majority of existing and planned projects are not focusing on remote rural areas, and - in absence of domestic markets - principally target external markets.

Most developing countries' households rely heavily on wood fuel which impacts on their health and socio-economic status. To ease such a dependency, other modern forms of energy, namely electricity, need to be provided. However, the quality of the electricity service, namely reliability, is an important factor in reducing this dependency. This paper discusses a choice experiment valuation study conducted among electrified rural households located in Kisumu, Kenya, in which the willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid power outages or blackouts was estimated. A mixed logit estimation was applied to identify the various socio-economic and demographic characteristics which determine preferences in reducing power outages among a household's users.

Although Integrated Resource Planning (IRP), which considers both supply-side and demand-side options, had been a useful tool in the planning process for the power industry, its effectiveness has been challenged recently with the restructuring of the power sector that has occurred in China and elsewhere around the world. The paper proposes Integrated Resource Strategic Planning (IRSP) as an alternative to IRP in a deregulated power sector. IRSP takes the resource planning process one step further to the national level. In this paper, the authors demonstrate the tremendous potential for efficiency improvements on both the supply and demand sides of the power sector in China with IRSP. The results show that between 2009 and 2020, the potential for electricity savings will reach about 1228.5 Twh, and the potential reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will be about 1020.5 million tons. Another important finding of this study is that the current market-based pricing system in China should be improved to provide sufficient incentives for pursuing energy savings on the demand side.

Besides the pressure posed on energy supply, they also have adverse impact on the environment through greenhouse gas emissions, wastewater discharge and so on. This study was intended to shed some light on the energy and environment related issues in hotel industry. Energy consumption data and relevant information collected from hotels were subjected to rigorous statistical analysis. A regression-based benchmarking model was established, which takes into account, the difference in functional and operational features when hotels are compared with regard to their energy performance. In addition, CO2 emissions from the surveyed hotels were estimated based on a standard procedure for corporate GHG emission accounting. It was found that a hotel's carbon intensity ranking is rather sensitive to the normalizing denominator chosen. Therefore, carbon intensity estimated for the hotels must not be interpreted arbitrarily, and industry specific normalizing denominator should be sought in future studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, both left-tail and right-tail extreme events conform with Frechet limit laws. Pure-jump models which describe well the tail properties of market returns are identified via their Levy measures. The distribution of extreme events implied by our model's Levy measure is closer to the actual realization of extremes than those of competing models.

OPEC's strategic behavior is modelled as a dominant firm, and the model includes price interdependence between different energy commodities to better estimate the cost of an oil disruption. It is found that substituting pellets for oil in households and using imported sugar cane ethanol are cost-efficient policies if greenhouse gas benefits are included. Domestically produced wheat ethanol is not found to be cost-efficient even if both the expected cost of oil disruption and greenhouse gas benefits are included, the same also holds for hybrid vehicles.

Based on the investment decisions of these firms, the role of sales, cash-flow, external financing, and working capital is investigated through regression analysis. The regional influence is captured by explanatory variables representing regional and firm characteristics, and by interaction dummies between the region and the main investment determinants. The results indicate significant differences across regions in the importance of investment determinants.

The economic and energy policy implications of each scenario are discussed and a number of policy options are presented to ensure that the growth in CO2 emissions is contained.

J,"Nygaard, I",,,,"Nygaard, Ivan",,,Institutional options for rural energy access: Exploring the concept of the multifunctional platform in West Africa,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy access; Rural electrification; Women's groups,,"The concept of the multifunctional platform for rural energy access has increasingly been supported by donors in five West African countries since 1994. While it is often referred to as a highly successful concept, recent reviews and interviews with local stakeholders in Mali and Burkina Faso indicate that the high aspirations to be found in project descriptions and early evaluations are only partly reflected in activities on the ground. This paper illustrates how the multipurpose aspects of the platform have made the concept a nexus of potential achievements that are highly valued in the dominant discourse of development, and how including concerns, such as poverty alleviation, gender equity, local democracy, decentralisation and the environment, have attracted donors outside the energy sector. The paper thus argues that, while the integration of multiple technical functions, preconceived organisational set-ups and local fuel production have in fact had limited or even adverse effects on the outcome of the multifunctional platform programme, these virtues have proved essential in presenting the concept at the policy level.

S. de, Haddad E. A. and Hewings G. J. D. Transport-regional equity issue revisited, Regional Studies. The objective of this paper is to analyse the relationship between transport and regional equity in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Furthermore, the existence of a trade-off between economic performance and regional equity is investigated as well. To do so, the paper develops a spatial computable general equilibrium model based on Brocker and Schneider's approach of 2002 to implement comparative static analysis, explicitly incorporating iceberg transportation costs. Four activities are modelled, namely production, final demand, transportation and exports. Two production factors are assumed: labour and other factors. The model has 12 domestic regions and three external regions. Four counterfactual experiments are developed based on decreases in transportation costs due to a 'distance shortening'. The main findings indicate that if the transport infrastructure improvement is focused only among poor regions, the promotion of regional equity is insignificant. If the transport infrastructure improvement links are concentrated among rich regions, there is an increase in regional income inequalities. However, if the improvements are targeted to the roads linking poor regions and rich ones, there is greater promotion of regional equity. The same result will occur when improvements are made to all road links of the state.","[de Almeida, Eduardo Simoes] Univ Juiz Fora, Dept Econ, BR-36036300 Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil; [Haddad, Eduardo Amaral] Univ Sao Paulo, FIPE, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Hewings, Geoffrey J.

The effects of the liberalization of international trade are analysed in a New Economic Geography model of a country with an asymmetrical distribution of housing between regions. Labour is mobile between regions, but not between countries. Trade liberalization tends to reduce inequalities in the distribution of the population between the two regions, although the population is more unequally distributed than housing. Results are similar when there is a bias in preferences towards home-produced varieties of manufactures. If consumers care relatively little about housing and transport costs are high enough, an agglomerated equilibrium becomes stable. [image omitted] Moncarz P. E. et Bleaney M.

The amount by which a country saves and invests less than the marginal resource rents equals the expected capital gains on reserves of natural resources plus the expected increase in interest income on net foreign assets plus the expected fall in the cost of resource extraction due to expected improvements in extraction technology. Effectively, depletion is then postponed until better times. This suggests that it is not necessarily sub-optimal for resource-rich countries to have negative genuine saving. However, in countries with different groups with imperfectly defined property rights on natural resources, political distortions induce faster resource depletion than suggested by the Hotelling rule. Fractionalised societies with imperfect property rights build up more foreign assets than their marginal resource rents, but in the long run accumulate less foreign assets than homogenous Hence, such societies end up with lower sustainable societies. consumption and are worse off, especially if seepage is strong, the number of rival groups is large and the country does not enjoy much monopoly power on the resource market Genuine saving is zero in such societies. However, World Bank genuine saving figures based on market rather than accounting prices will be negative, albeit less so in more fractionalised societies with less secure property rights.

Applying the bounds test approach to cointegration developed by Pesaran et al. (2001) we find that there was a short- and a long-run relationship between nuclear energy consumption and economic growth. Using four long-run estimators we also found that nuclear energy consumption has a positive and a statistically significant impact on India's economic growth. Further, applying the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) approach to Granger causality and the variance decomposition approach developed by Pesaran and Shin (1998), we found a positive and a significant uni-directional causality running from nuclear energy consumption to economic growth without feedback. This implies that economic growth in India is dependent on nuclear energy consumption where a decrease in nuclear energy consumption may lead to a decrease in real income. For a fast growing energy-dependent economy this may have far-reaching implications for economic growth. India's economic growth can be frustrated if energy conservation measures are undertaken without due regard to the negative impact they have on economic growth. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Trade creates a mechanism for consumers to shift environmental pollution associated with their consumption to other countries. Carbon leakage exerts great influences on international trade and economy. Applying an input-output approach, the paper estimates the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) embodied in China's foreign trade during 1997-2007. It is found that 10.03-26.54% of China's annual CO2 emissions are produced during the manufacture of export goods destined for foreign consumers, while the CO2 emissions embodied in China's imports accounted for only 4.40% (1997) and 9.05% (2007) of that. We also estimate that the rest of world avoided emitting 150.18 Mt CO2 in 1997, increasing to 593 Mt in 2007, as a result of importing goods from China, rather than manufacturing the same type and quantity of goods domestically. During 1997-2007, the net additional global CO2 emissions resulting from China's exports were 4894 Mt. Then, the paper divides the trade-embodied emissions into scale, composition and technical effect. It was found that scale and composition effect increased the CO2 emissions embodied in trade while the technical effect offset a small part of them. Finally, its mechanism and policy implications are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The papers yield somewhat similar results regarding atmospheric CO2 levels, but they reach substantially different conclusions regarding future climate change. Here, we compare their methods and results. Our work shows that Net and Cooper's paper significantly underestimates future warming. Net and Cooper conclude that even if all the available fossil fuels would be burned at the maximum possible rate during this century, the consequent warming would cap at less than 1 degrees C above the 2000 level.

Life cycle analyses (LCAs) of biofuels production routes show that the GHG savings may vary significantly for different biofuels. An increasing number of governments are therefore looking for options to differentiate between biofuels according to their actual GHG savings. Accurate calculations of GHG savings thus become increasingly important. This paper deals with an omission of current LCAs for ethanol and ETBE blends, which leads to an underestimation of their calculated GHG savings. Current studies do not take into account that refiners will adjust their refinery operation when bioethanol or ETBE is added, because of the different characteristics of these products. The analysis indicates that the net effect of these refinery modifications on the GHG savings is positive, i.e. GHG-emissions reduce in both cases. The emission reduction is highest in the case of ETBE. We recommend to include this effect in future LCA calculations for ethanol and ETBE. As the calculation model used for this study is only a simplified representation of the EU refinery sector, we also advise to perform a more detailed analysis of these effects using more elaborate refinery models.

Two refineries' schemes were simulated through a linear programming optimization model in order to compare the optimum configuration obtained before and after the input of different CO2 prices. The cases analyzed represent refining projects to be located in Brazil, a growing market for fuels and petrochemical feedstocks, as well as an oil producing country with rising crude exports. After 2012, emerging countries, such as Brazil, may adopt carbon emission reduction targets. Therefore, it is worth analyzing the impact of pricing CO2 emissions in these countries, where the majority of new refining projects will be located. Our findings indicate that the initial refinery configurations proposed are quite rigid technologically for CO2 prices up to US$ 100/t CO2. For CO2 prices higher than US$ 100/t CO2, refineries reduced their emissions by increasing the consumption of natural gas used to produce hydrogen, and through changes in the original configurations towards less-energy consuming process units. Promising technological advances, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), can also diminish the rigidity of the model and facilitate actions to curb carbon emissions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It focuses on the relationship between energy market developments and the pricing of European energy stocks. According to our results, oil price hikes negatively impact on stock returns of European utilities. However, they lead to an appreciation of oil and gas stocks. Interestingly, forecastable oil market volatility negatively affects European oil and gas stocks, implying profit opportunities for strategic investors. In contrast, the gas market does not play a role for the pricing of Eurozone energy stocks. Coal price developments affect the stock returns of European utilities. However, this effect is small compared to oil price impacts, although oil is barely used for electricity generation in Europe. This suggests that for the European stock market, the oil price is the main indicator for energy price developments as a whole. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This research aims to estimate state-to-state commodity trade flow tables by major industrial sectors for the US useful for creating an MRIO-type model, the National Interstate Economic Model (NIEMO). The model is based on IMPLAN and related data for 2001. Constructing NIEMO was challenging because of the limited availability of commodity freight shipment data between the states. This helps to explain why a Chenery-Moses-type model such as NIEMO has not been developed in recent years. Two basic sets are necessary to construct NIEMO. Interregional trade tables to estimate trade coefficients by states and industry had been available from the US Commodity Transportation Survey Data since 1977, but reporting was discontinued for some years. For the years since 1993, this data deficit can be met to some extent with the recent Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). Available since 1993, the CFS data are widely used, but they have several inherent problems. Recent attempts to estimate interregional trade flows using data from the 1997 CFS, based on IMPLAN data made this clear to us. This study suggests a new approach to estimate the trade tables between all 50 states plus D. C. and the rest of the world. These tables are assembled via a two-step method, to adjust for incomplete reported trade flows, and to update the adjusted trade flows by estimating values via a Fratar Model based on the 1997 CFS data. Reconciliation of the IMPLAN and CFS databases presents various problems that are addressed in this paper.","[Park, JiYoung] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Buffalo, NY 14217 USA; [Gordon, Peter; Richardson, Harry W.] Univ So Calif, Sch Policy Planning & Dev, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Moore, James E., II] Univ So Calif, Ethel Percy Andrus Ctr 240, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Park, J (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, 3435 Main St,116 Hayes Hall, Buffalo, NY 14217 USA.",jiyoungp@gmail.com; pgordon@usc.edu; jmoore@usc.edu; hrichard@usc.edu,"Park, Jiyoung/AAG-2436-2020; Moore, James E/Q-3674-2018","Park, Jiyoung/0000-0002-7579-5034;",,,,,22,16,19,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

To do so, it compares the modeled and observed responses of the Indian economy to the rise of oil price during the 2003-2006 period. The objective is twofold: first, to disentangle the various mechanisms and policies at play in India's economy response to rising oil prices and, second, to validate our model as a tool capable of reproducing short-run statistical data. With default parameterization, the model predicts a significant decrease in the Indian growth rate that is not observed. However, this discrepancy is corrected if three additional mechanisms identified by the International Monetary Fund are introduced, namely the rise in exports of refined oil products, the imbalance of the trade balance allowed by large capital inflows, and the incomplete pass-through of the oil price increase to Indian customers. This work is a first step toward model validation, and provides interesting insights on the modeling methodology relevant to represent an economy's response to a shock, as well as on how short-term mechanisms - and policy action - can smooth the negative impacts of energy price shocks or climate policies.

Most of the previous studies could hardly address multiple uncertainties that exist in such systems: this may lead to incomplete, simplified or even false solutions, and could jeopardize the robustness of management decisions. This study is to develop a dynamic inexact stochastic energy systems planning model (DITS-MEM) for managing municipal energy systems and greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions under uncertainty. Through integrating mixed-integer, interval-parameter and two-stage stochastic programming techniques, DITS-MEM can handle not only the uncertainties expressed as interval values and probabilistic distributions associated with GHG-emission reduction targets, but also the dynamics of capacity-expansion issues. The developed model is then applied to the Beijing Municipality. The results suggest that the DITS-MEM model is applicable in reflecting complexities of multi-uncertainty. dynamic and interactive municipal energy management systems, and capable of addressing two-stage stochastic problem of GHG-emission reduction. The obtained solutions can provide decision bases for formulating GHG-reduction policies and assessing the associated economic implications in purchasing emission credits or bearing economic penalties.

A MARKAL-based integrated energy system model of the five GMS countries was developed to examine benefits of regional energy resource development for meeting the energy demand of these countries. The study found that an unrestricted energy resource development and trade within the region would reduce the total-regional energy systems cost by 18% and would abate the total CO2 emission by 5% as compared to the base case. All the five countries except Myanmar would benefit from the expansion of regional energy resource integration in terms of lower energy systems costs and better environmental qualities. An imposition Of CO2 emission reduction constraint by 5% on each of the study countries from that of the corresponding emissions under the unrestricted energy resource development in the GMS is found to improve energy security, reduce energy import and fossil fuels dependences and increase volume of power trade within the region. The total energy system cost under the joint CO2 emission reduction strategy would be less costly than that under the individual emission targets set for each country.

In order to quantify resource appropriation and trends in production and consumption, the concept of emergy synthesis is employed. Our results show a significant increase in the total amount of emergy consumed by 66.9% between 1979 and 2003 which comes hand in hand with an increase in the level of environmental stress by 93.7% (quantified as the environmental loading ratio). On the other hand the emergy required to produce 1 USD of economic output has been gradually decreasing which denotes an increase in the efficiency of the conversion of natural capital into economic output. What is most interesting though is the growing dependence of the Japanese economy on imported emergy, increasingly from developing nations, that severely affects the potential for unhindered economic growth. This can prove to be a big barrier that could affect the resource security of the Japanese economy and render it susceptible to risks associated with access to natural resources which in turn can jeopardise its long-term economic sustainability.

There is no optimum method of establishing the stringency of a standard, but policymakers can be informed by analyses of technology cost-effectiveness from the viewpoint of different actors (e.g., society, vehicle purchasers) and of top runners-vehicles in the current fleet, or projections of future leading vehicles, that can serve as models for average vehicles some years later. The focus of the paper is on the US light vehicle fleet, with some discussion of applications to the European Union. A leading edge midsize car for the 2020 timeframe is identified, and various types of attribute-based standards are discussed. For the US, a 12-15 year target for new vehicle fleet improvement of 30-50% seems a reasonable starting point for negotiations. For 2030 or so, doubling current fuel economy is possible. In both cases, adjustments must be made in response to changing economic circumstances and government and societal priorities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is therefore important to evaluate the potential of different demand-side measures that may contribute to reduce peak load. This paper analyses data from an experiment where residential water heaters were automatically disconnected during peak periods of the day. A model of hourly electricity consumption is used to evaluate the effects on the load of the disconnections. The results indicate an average consumption reduction per household of approximately 0.5 kWh/h during disconnection, and an additional average increase in consumption the following hour, due to the payback effect, that may reach up to 0.28 kWh/h per household.

The study compared energy plants supplying the thermal and electrical energy in sawmills, laminated veneer lumber (LVL) plants and medium density fibreboard (MDF) mills. The breakeven electricity price for the MDF and LVL scenarios ranged from 4-8.9 c/kWh while the sawmill scenario was 11.6 c/kWh. The conclusion of the study is that while the economics are comparable with other renewable energy generation methods such as hydro and wind the location of the plant is critical to overall feasibility due mainly to biomass availability and power price both now and in light of expected future trends. The technology is complementary to the government's forward strategy which encourages both distributed generation and renewable energy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Penniall, C.

Thus, there is pressure from both public and policy makers to reduce the State dependency on foreign fossil fuel sources. To this extend, there are incentives created at State and Federal level for both residential and commercial buildings to install photovoltaic (PV) systems. Although such incentives are necessary for long-term objectives, it is shown in this study that retrofitting inefficient old building-equipment is another viable source to reduce the State of Hawaii's electricity demand. Four case studies are presented to illustrate that building-equipment retrofitting is a viable and necessary tool for increasing the energy efficiency of buildings. Each case study presents an equipment retrofit project electricity savings with its payback periods, and compares with equivalent electricity capacity and economics PV systems in Honolulu. Hawaii. The case studies show that energy savings from retrofit projects ranged from 28% to 61% for individual equipment retrofits. These results indicate that equipment retrofitting with energy-efficient alternatives is about 50% or more cost-effective than installing PV systems. This is so even when large renewable energy tax incentives provided by the Federal and State Governments are taken into account. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As such, policymakers and stakeholder groups have proposed a number of policy instruments aimed at reducing these emissions. In order to fully evaluate the effectiveness of these policies, policymakers must consider both the direct responses associated with policy actions, and the indirect responses that occur through complex relationships within socioeconomic systems. In cases where multiple policy instruments are employed, these indirect effects create policy interactions that are either complementary or competing; policymakers need to understand these interactions in order to leverage policy synergies and manage policy conflicts. Analysis of these indirect effects is particularly difficult in the transportation sector, where system boundaries are uncertain and feedback among systems components can be complicated. This paper begins to address this problem by applying systems dynamics tools (in particular causal loop diagrams) to help identify and understand the role of feedback effects on transportation-related GHG reduction policies. Policymakers can use this framework to qualitatively explore the impacts of various policy instruments, as well as identify important relationships that can be later included in quantitative modeling approaches.

Biogas energy could augment these conventional energy sources but despite its advantages and favourable conditions for its production, biogas energy use in Uganda remains low due to technical, economic and socio-cultural impediments. Based on primary data on households in Central and Eastern Uganda and the use of logistic regression, this study analyses factors affecting the adoption of biogas energy in Uganda. The empirical results suggest that the probability of a household adopting biogas technology increases with decreasing age of head of household, increasing household income, increasing number of cattle owned, increasing household size, male head of household and increasing cost of traditional fuels. In contrast, the likelihood of adoption decreases with increasing remoteness of household location and increasing household land area. Policy options and recommendations including educational and awareness campaigns on biogas benefits and successes, the provision of financial and non-financial incentives to households and establishment of an institutional framework could bolster wider biogas energy acceptance in Uganda.

This paper focuses on the geographical differences in electricity prices and the consequences of those differences for business production and location. It accounts for the dynamic nature of business responses to these geographical differences by classifying manufacturing businesses into three groups based on intensity of electricity use and business mobility: (1) heavy users of electricity that are relatively highly mobile; (2) heavy users that are relatively tied to their location; and (3) businesses for which electricity is not a significant cost of production. For empirical analysis, plant- or firm-level data is most desirable, but was not available. As an alternative, the most disaggregate (6-digit NAICS) industry data has been utilized. Findings suggest that heavy users of electricity, regardless of the degree of business mobility, tend to stay in their current location rather than relocate, as they often have a greater technical ability to substitute away from electricity when electricity prices are high.","San Francisco State Univ, Dept Publ Adm, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Bae, S (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Downtown Campus,835 Market St,5th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",bae@sfsu.edu,,,,,,,42,4,6,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

It is found that great mitigation achievements had been made in coal-fired power generation, cement and aluminium sectors through various policies. About 420 million tons (Mt), 234 and 48 Mt of CO2-e have been reduced, respectively, from 2001 to 2007. However, factors such as fast-growing development needs, low-quality resources and carbon-intensive energy mix, huge disparities within sector, poor technology, equipment and financial status of plants, low level of employers' abilities as well as huge social costs are causing big difficulties and barriers to further mitigate sectoral greenhouse gas in China. Therefore it is strongly advocated that the existing and possible new sectoral approaches try to consider these factual barriers as comprehensively as possible.

The carbon constraint is set at 20.7% below the reference emissions level for sectors eligible according to the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS). Free permit distribution enhances growth despite a severe emissions cap, because environmental regulation stimulates structural changes [Porter, M., 1991. American's green strategy. Scientific American 264, 168]. That is, grandfathering allows sectors additional resources to invest in developing technologies, but it also raises the CO2 abatement costs because of energy rebound effects from enhanced growth. Results under endogenous growth [Romer, P.M., 1990. Endogenous technological change. journal of Political Economy 98 (5), 71-102] are very similar to those obtained under an exogenous growth scenario [Ramsey, Y.F., 1928. A mathematical theory of saving. Economic journal 38, 543-559], as the substitution effects are responsible for the majority of variations; in addition, Romanian research activities are too modest to significantly impact this system. The abatement cost per unit of GDP is higher under endogenous growth, as spillover effects reduce incentives to invest. Technological diffusion continues to have a positive impact on economic growth, which counterbalances the free-riding attitude adopted by some energy-intensive sectors, such as glass and cement.

It compares the educational profiles of in-migrants and non-migrants across a sample of 303 U.S. counties and tests a stock-flow model that poses that a well-educated population stock attracts a well-educated migrant flow. The results suggest that newcomers are better educated than the resident population, and the education gap is most pronounced for newcomers from other states. The results further suggest that the educational status of newcomers (in-migrants) is positively related to the educational status of the resident population (stayers), thus implying a further agglomeration of human capital across space. However, for interstate migrants the effect is context-dependent, playing a greater role in urban settings and diminishing in more rural settings.","Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Waldorf, BS (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",bwaldorf@purdue.edu,,,,,,,42,37,49,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Daily electricity demand and average temperature during the period from 1970 until 2007 are investigated for possible trends in the temperature dependence of electricity demand. We hypothesize that the increased use of cooling applications has shifted the temperature dependence of electricity demand upwards in summer months. Our results show significant increases in temperature dependence of electricity demand in May, June, September, October and during the summer holidays. During the period studied, temperature dependence in these months has shifted from negative to positive, meaning that a higher temperature now leads to an increased electricity demand in these months, rather than a decreased demand as observed historically. Although electricity demand in countries with moderate summer temperatures such as the Netherlands generally peaks in winter months and shows a minimum in summer months, this trend may signal the development of an additional peak in summer, especially given the expected climatic change. As power generating capacity may be negatively influenced by higher temperatures due to decreasing process cooling possibilities, an increasing electricity demand at higher temperatures may have important consequences for power generation capacity planning and maintenance scheduling.

First, the relationship between the CO(2) emissions and per capita income is examined by the help of a time series model using cointegration techniques. In the second stage, the relationship between income and air pollution is investigated by using PM(10) and SO(2) measurements in Turkish provinces. In this part of the study panel data estimation techniques are utilized. The time series model covers 1968-2003, and the panel data model covers 1992-2001 including observations from 58 provinces. A monotonically increasing relationship between CO(2) and income is found in the long-run according to time series analysis. On the other hand, panel data analysis indicates an N-shape relationship for SO(2) and PM(10) emissions. Therefore, the results of our time series and panel data analyses do not support the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, which assumes an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental degradation and income.

We apply this model to the electricity sector, where we analyze three typical technologies based on fossil fuel, fossil fuel with carbon capture and renewable energy, respectively. In this way, we can analyze the transition from CO2-intensive to CO2-neutral electricity production in the face of rising and uncertain CO2 prices. In addition, such a modelling approach enables us to estimate precisely the expected value of (perfect) information, Le, the willingness of investors and producers to pay for information about the correct CO2 price path. As can be expected, the expected value of information rises with increasing CO2 price uncertainty. In addition, the larger the price uncertainty, the larger are the cumulative CO2 emissions over the coming century. The reason for this is that the transition to less CO2-intensive technologies is increasingly postponed with rising CO2 price uncertainty. By testing different price processes (geometric Brownian motion versus jump processes with different jump frequencies), we can also make useful recommendations concerning the importance of policy predictability. We find that it is better to have climate change policies that are stable over a certain length of time and change abruptly than less abrupt but more frequently changing policies. Less frequent fluctuations reduce the expected value of information and result in smaller cumulative CO2 emissions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Since policy-makers usually pursue several conflicting objectives, policy-making can be understood as a multicriteria decision problem. Following the methodological proposal by Andre and Cardenete (2005), multi-objective programming is used in connection with a computable general equilibrium model to represent optimal policy-making and to obtain so-called efficient policies in an application to a regional economy (Andalusia, Spain). This approach is applied to the design of subsidy policies under two different scenarios. In the first scenario, it is assumed that the government is concerned just about two objectives: ensuring the profitability of a key strategic sector and increasing overall output. Finally, the scope of the exercise is enlarged by solving a problem with seven policy objectives, including both general and sectorial objectives. It is concluded that the observed policy could have been Pareto-improved in several directions.","[Andre, Francisco J.; Cardenete Flores, Manuel Alejandro] Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, E-41013 Seville, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"André, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, Ctra Utrera,Km 1, E-41013 Seville, Spain.",andre@upo.es; macardenete@upo.es,"Andre, Francisco J./H-4613-2015; Cardenete, Manuel Alejandro/A-5300-2015","Andre, Francisco J./0000-0002-6406-3305; Cardenete, Manuel Alejandro/0000-0001-7495-7479",,,,,30,4,4,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This work uses a jump diffusion process to estimate the price of mutual guarantee bonds made under the terms of the China Small Business Financing Program. First, a logistic structural model of mutual guarantee bond is built up. The model was then employed to design the logical pricing model of credit spread when an exogenous default process jumps for the first time. A geometrical attenuation function is introduced to reflect the unexpected default of intensities. Furthermore, the pricing model of collective small-medium corporate bonds as the spot interest rate is assumed to follow Vasicek model. Finally, the work tests the pricing model with one thousand times Monte Carlo methods and offer theoretical background and empirical evidence for further financial innovation as well.","[Chen, Xiao-hong; Zhang, Qi] Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Central South University,,cxh@mail.csu.edu.cn; lily-zhangqi@163.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,5,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,341,344,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.228,0.0,,,4,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BLA43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269752000083,0

Three fast-growing species, three gasifiers of different capacities, three capital costs, and two scenarios of carbon payments were considered for analysis. Sensitivity and risk analyses were undertaken for determining the effects of variations in inputs on selected outputs. Results suggest that 5 million megawatt hour electricity can be generated annually which will prevent 4 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. The production cost of a unit of electricity was found inversely related to the scale of production. The average cost of electricity at the consumer level produced using 100 kW gasifier was $0.15/kWh, which was greater than the price of electricity supplied from grid i.e. $0.08/kWh. The unit cost of producing electricity using Acacia nilotica was lowest among all the selected species. Technological advancements suitable government incentives are needed to promote electricity generation from forest biomass through gasification technology. This will help in spurring economic development and reducing overall ecological footprint of the state. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

As an alternative to the clean development mechanism regime, developing countries may accept a (generous) cap on their own emissions, allow domestic producers to invest in new efficient technologies, and sell the excess emission permits on the international permit market. The purpose of this article is to show how the gains from investment, and hence the incentive to invest in new technology in developing countries, differ between the two alternative regimes. We show that the difference in the gains from investment depends on whether the producers in developing countries face competitive or noncompetitive output markets, whether the investment affects fixed or variable production costs, and whether producers can reduce emissions through means other than investing in new technology.

Aiming at these faults, some improved methods are proposed to solve these problems, one of methods is BP neural network based on Kalman Filter which can solve before-mentioned faults partly. But present methods of BP neural network based on Kalman Filter can not do batch processing and study multi-sample conditions. Improved BP neural network based on Kalman Filter is proposed depending on present BP neural network based on Kalman Filter. The idea of new method includes two steps, firstly we obtain the update of estimation weight, secondly we use the obtained results to mend the Kalman Gain for new update of time and measurement, at the some time the new algorithm can adopt batch processing to learning neural network.

Two mechanisms can lead to fiscal strategic interactions between local jurisdictions. The first is due to the tax base mobility. Authorities use fiscal variables to attract new resources. The second is related to information asymmetries between the politicians and the constituency. To reduce these asymmetries, voters can compare their fiscal situation with the one in neighbouring jurisdictions. These two channels lead to what can be referred to as 'mobility-led' and 'information-led' tax competition. This paper aims to discriminate between these two tax competition models in the case of the French regions. The econometric tests suggest that when taxes are paid by voters, the politicians in office seem to be involved in an 'information-led' tax competition, while in the case of taxes paid by firms, the mobility of the tax base seems to be the best way to explain strategic fiscal interactions.","[Reulier, Emmanuelle] Univ Rennes 1, F-35065 Rennes, France; CREM CNRS, F-35065 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Reulier, E (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35065 Rennes, France.",emmanuelle.reulier@univ-rennes1.fr; yvon.rocaboy@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,14,9,10,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper analyses the transformation of Suzhou, known previously for its Sunan model of development into a globalizing foreign direct investment (FDI) and high-technology centre. It is argued that the key to the transformation has been the efforts of states in utilizing global capital, mainly through the development of the Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP). However, the nature of Suzhou Industrial Park is largely that of a satellite district, and its future is likely a satellite neo-Marshallian district. A third pathway of development is promoted by integrating globalizing regional development with domesticating globalization, and by moving beyond the divide of globalization and localization.

We examine the use of cogeneration to satisfy the energy demands of oil sands operations in Alberta in the context of carbon management. This paper evaluates the role of cogeneration in meeting Provincial carbon management goals and discusses the arbitrary characteristics of facility- and product-based carbon emissions control regulations. We model an oil sands operation that operates with and without incorporated cogeneration. We compare CO2 emissions and associated costs under different carbon emissions control regulations, including the present carbon emissions control regulation of Alberta. The results suggest that incorporating cogeneration into the growing oil sands industry could contribute in the near-term to reducing CO2 emissions in Alberta. This analysis also shows that the different accounting methods and calculations of electricity offsets could lead to very different levels of incentives for cogeneration. Regulations that attempt to manage emissions on a product and facility basis may become arbitrary and complex as regulators attempt to approximate the effect of an economy-wide carbon price.

This paper aims to fill this gap, investigating the attractiveness of SMPP portfolios respect to large power plant portfolios. The analysis includes nuclear, coal and combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT) of different plant sizes. The Mean Variance Portfolio theory (MVP) is used to define the best portfolio according to Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Levelised Unit Electricity Cost (LUEC) considering the life cycle costs of each power plant, Carbon Tax, Electricity Price and grid dimension. The results show how large plants are the best option for large grids, while SMPP are as competitive as large plants in small grids. In fact, in order to achieve the highest profitability with the lowest risk it is necessary to build several types of different plants and, in case of small grids, this is possible only with SMPP. A further result is the application of the framework to European OECD countries and the United States assessing their portfolios. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Project-specific impacts are estimated at the local level (i.e., within a 100-mile radius around the wind farms) and at the state level. The primary economic policy question addressed is how investment in wind energy affects the state and local communities where the wind farms are built. During the four-year construction phase approximately 4100 FTE (full time equivalents) jobs were supported with turbine and supply chain impacts accounting for 58% of all jobs generated. Total lifetime economic activity to the state from the projects equated to more than $1.8 billion, or $1.3 million per MW of installed capacity. The total economic activity to the local communities was also substantial, equating to nearly $730 million over the assumed 20-year life cycle of the farms, or $0.52 million per MW of installed capacity. Given the current level of impacts observed, and the potential for increased impacts via greater utilization of instate manufacturing capacity and the development of trained wind industry specific laborers, Texas appears to be well positioned to see increasing impacts from continued wind development.

In 2010, China started to report the fuel consumption rates of light-duty vehicles tested in laboratory and to require new vehicles to show the rates on window labels. In this study, we examined the differences between the test and real-world fuel consumption of Chinese passenger cars by using the data reported by real-world drivers on the internet voluntarily. The sales-weighted average fuel consumption of new cars in China in 2009 was 7.80 L/100 km in laboratory and 9.02 L/100 km in real-world, representing a difference of 15.5%. For the 153 individual car models examined, the real-world fuel consumption rates were -8 to 60% different from the test values. The simulation results of the International Vehicle Emission model show that the real-world driving cycles in 22 selected Chinese cities could result in -8 to 34% of changes in fuel consumption compared to the laboratory driving cycle. Further government effort on fuel consumption estimates adjustment, local driving cycle development, and real-world data accumulation through communication with the public is needed to improve the accuracy of the labeling policy.

We show that the dominant advocacy coalition, which favors a hard path energy development in general, enforces a large-scale development of wind energy. Two other coalitions - a soft path coalition and a nationalist coalition - oppose this development, but not wind energy per se. We argue that difference in belief systems explains their opposition rather than planning issues or NIMBY concerns. We also contend that, despite its predominance over (wind) energy policy, the hard path coalition is willing to learn and make concessions towards the soft path coalition, but not towards the nationalist coalition.

The results show that there are remarkable regional disparities among eastern, central and western areas, regional elasticities of per capita GDP and energy intensity on CO2 emissions, which reflect the regional differences in economic development, economy structure and restraining function of energy intensity decrease on the emission. Energy intensity reducing is more effective to emission abatement for provinces with higher elasticity of energy intensity, but may not be significant for provinces with lower elasticity. The inverse distribution of energy production and consumption, regional unfairness caused by institutional factors like energy price and tax system result in inter-regional CO2 emission transfer embodied in the power transmission. The calculation indicates that the embodied emission transfer was gradually significant after 2003, from eastern area to the central and western areas, especially energy production provinces in central area, which leads to distortion on the emission and emission intensity. The regional emission reduction targets and supporting policies should be customized and consistent with the actual situations rather than setting the same target for all the provinces.

In this progress, the energy sector has played a vital role. This role is likely to deepen in the years to come as Vietnam strives to achieve even higher levels in economic progress. Such deepening in the role of energy, this paper argues, will heighten concerns about the security of energy supply, and economic, environmental, social and political consequences. In order to address these issues, Vietnam has over the last decade, developed a suite of energy policies. A deeper review of these policies suggests that they are typified by economic-growth orientation, exclusive focus on a single-sector or single issue, and largely neglect the significance of cross-sectoral and cross-thematic issues arising from the interdependencies between energy, economy, and the polity at large. The existing energy policy settings are, therefore, unlikely to be able to provide a satisfactory redress to the challenges noted above. This paper provides an overview of the current energy policies with a view to identify areas where further policy effort is needed in order to facilitate a sustainable development of the Vietnamese energy sector.

The most widely used methodology to calculate greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector at the local level uses a harmonic average (HA) methodology based on nationally averaged fuel economies that assume 55% city and 45% highway VMTs. This paper presents a local condition (LC) methodology that accounts for county-level variations in city and highway VMTs, as opposed to assumed uniform driving conditions. Both HA and LC methodologies were used to estimate and compare absolute and per capita CO2 emissions both statewide and counties for 2000 and 2008. From 2000 to 2008, statewide absolute and per capita CO2 emissions increased similarly using HA and LC methodologies; however, the percent change varied considerably among counties. Statewide CO2 emissions calculated from HA and LC methodologies differed by only -0.2% (2000) and 1.7% (2008); however, the differences in the county-level emissions ranged from -8.0% to 14.9% (2000) and from -5.6% to 17.0% (2008). While either the HA or the LC methodology yields a similar result statewide, significant variation exists at the county level, warranting the need to consider local driving conditions when estimating county-level emissions.

The problem is analyzed for a network and for a discrete location space, showing that in both cases it can be solved by a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation. This formulation is used to solve an illustrative example in a variety of scenarios, where profits for both the entering firm and its competitors are analyzed. In some scenarios is seen that the aggregate profit of the pre-existing facilities increases in the number of facilities of the entrant.

This article focuses on two potential threats to energy security in the North African context: first, intenational disruption of energy supplies by governments: second, attacks by non-state actors on energy infrastructure. Based on an analysis of North African security and energy geopolitics, the article provides an assessment of these threats as they have materialized with regard to existing energy industries, particularly oil and gas. The article then seeks to apply the findings to renewable energy schemes that are currently being discussed and developed, gauging the likelihood and impact of such threats materializing in respect to various technologies, and differentiating between different states of the region.

The intermittent nature of some renewable energy resources impact reliability, operations, and market prices, in turn affecting all market participants. Meeting renewable energy goals may require coordination among many market players. These challenges may be successfully overcome by imposing goals, establishing trading mechanisms, and implementing operational changes in competitive markets. This strategy has contributed to Texas' leadership among all US states in non-hydro renewable energy production. While Texas has been largely successful in accommodating over 9000 MW of wind power capacity, this extensive reliance upon wind power has also created numerous problems. Higher levels of operating reserves must now be procured. Market prices often go negative in the proximity of wind farms. Inaccurate wind forecasts have led to reliability problems. Five billion dollars in transmission investment will be necessary to facilitate further wind farm projects. Despite these costs, wind power is generally viewed as a net benefit.

Syria also suffers from inadequate public transport provision, poor infrastructure and the absence of suitable traffic management systems, with the average speed of road transport in Damascus at about 4-5 km/h. Only until very recently, a comprehensive network for the continuous monitoring of air pollutants has been lacking. This paper reviews, collates and synthesises the results of numerous studies of Syrian road transport, with an emphasis on air pollution from Syria's transport and energy production sectors. It is revealed that what studies that have been done show that the air quality in Syrian urban areas falls below established national air quality standards, especially during winter when the demand for heating is high. The paper proposes a number of suggestions to improve air quality in Syria by using greener and more public transport, promoting and incentivising rational and efficient energy consumption in all sectors, taking advantage of available renewable energy resources, establishing an active network for routine measurement of pollution, setting local emissions standards that are in line with international standards and which are supported by the imposition of penalties, fines or taxation on polluting agents.

The model accounts for spatial and social effects (including threshold effects, homophily, and conformity) and media influences. Preliminary simulations demonstrate how such a model could be used to identify nonlinear interactions among potential leverage points, inform policies affecting PHEV market penetration, and help identify future data collection necessary to more accurately model the system. We examine sensitivity of the model to gasoline prices, to accuracy in estimation of fuel costs, to agent willingness to adopt the PHEV technology, to PHEV purchase price and rebates, to PHEV battery range, and to heuristic values related to gasoline usage. Our simulations indicate that PHEV market penetration could be enhanced significantly by providing consumers with ready estimates of expected lifetime fuel costs associated with different vehicles (e.g., on vehicle stickers), and that increases in gasoline prices could nonlinearly magnify the impact on fleet efficiency. We also infer that a potential synergy from a gasoline tax with proceeds is used to fund research into longer-range lower-cost PHEV batteries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The institutional, technological and social bases of the Saskatchewan power regime have been disrupted by both exogenous pressures and endogenous problems, providing an opportunity for alternative energy options to be considered as possible power alternatives. As the province addresses the long-term socio-technical transition (STR) associated with a regime change in the power sector a number of alternative energy options have been identified. Using a transition management approach, this paper argues that the path taken will depend very much on whether these alternatives can be adopted as modifications of the existing STR - leaving the key actors, institutions and relationships essentially untouched - or whether they will necessitate a wholesale reconstruction of the regime itself. In this paper we analyze how, over time, the socio-technical configurations of the energy system became very durable as existing technologies become embedded in regulatory frameworks, infrastructure, users practices and expert communities. We then consider the potential of several alternative technological trajectories and the likelihood of one of these socio technical regimes emerging in Saskatchewan. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A methodology for allocating the cost of RES subsidies that ensures an optimal balance between compliance with the main regulatory principles of tariff design and each state's specific policy is of cardinal importance in the current context. This paper presents and discusses a novel methodology to allocate the RES subsidy costs, which consists of distributing them among final energy consumers, in proportion to their consumption, regardless of the type of final energy consumed (liquid fuels, gas, electricity or coal). First, the different designs of RES subsidies are categorized and a review of a good number of the RES burden sharing mechanisms implemented in the EU is presented. Then, the proposed methodology is developed on the basis of the basic regulatory principles underlying the tariff design and the current regulatory context in force in the EU. Finally, to illustrate its actual impact in a real case example, the proposed methodology is applied to the Spanish system, in which the burden of extra costs incurred for RES amounts to a very large proportion of the overall energy system costs.

For the sake of accurate computation an additional variable - employment - was also taken into account. Computations conducted for the period Q1 2000 to Q4 2009 by means of recent causality techniques confirmed the neutrality of hard coal usage with respect to economic growth. On the other hand, calculations for the pairs lignite-GDP and total coal consumption-GDP showed the existence of a significant nonlinear causality from coal usage to economic growth. This is clear evidence for claiming that lignite plays an important role in the economic growth of the Polish economy. Furthermore, each coal-related variable was found to have a nonlinear causal impact on employment. Because of the relatively short length of available time series we additionally applied bootstrap critical values. The empirical results computed by both methods did not exhibit significant differences. These results have important policy implications. In general, our findings support the hypothesis that closing hard coal mines in Poland should have no significant repercussions on economic growth. However, this does not seem to be true for lignite mines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Clustering refers to coordinated introduction of hydrogen vehicles and refueling infrastructure in a few focused geographic areas such as smaller cities (e.g. Santa Monica, Irvine) within a larger region (e.g. Los Angeles Basin). We analyze several transition scenarios for introducing hundreds to tens of thousands of vehicles and 8-42 stations, considering: Station placement Convenience of the refueling network Type of hydrogen supply Economics (capital and operating costs of stations, hydrogen cost). A cluster strategy provides good convenience and reliability with a small number of strategically placed stations, reducing infrastructure costs. A cash flow analysis estimates infrastructure investments of $120-170 million might be needed to build a network of 42 stations serving the first 25,000 vehicles. As more vehicles are introduced, the network expands, larger stations are built and the cost of hydrogen becomes competitive on a cents per mile basis with gasoline. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, more insights are needed whether such a trading system leads to a sufficient high CO2 price and stable investment environment for CCS deployment. To gain more insights, we combined WorldScan, an applied general equilibrium model for global policy analysis, and MARKAL-NL-UU, a techno-economic energy bottom-up model of the Dutch power generation sector and CO2 intensive industry. WorldScan results show that in 2020, CO2 prices may vary between 20 E/tCO(2) in a GRAND COALITION scenario, in which all countries accept greenhouse gas targets from 2020, to 47 epsilon/tCO(2) in an IMPASSE scenario, in which EU-27 continues its one-sided emission trading system without the possibility to use the Clean Development Mechanism. MARKAL-NL-UU model results show that an emission trading system in combination with uncertainty does not advance the application of CCS in an early stage, the rates at which different CO2 abatement technologies (including CCS) develop are less crucial for introduction of CCS than the CO2 price development, and the combination of biomass (co-)firing and CCS seems an important option to realise deep CO2 emission reductions.

This has environmental consequences as exports and imports either increase or decrease local production and consequently greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper's objective is to illustrate the importance of electricity trade's impact on GHG emissions by providing an estimate of the net GHG emissions resulting from these trades. To achieve this objective, Quebec hourly electricity exchanges with adjacent jurisdictions were examined over the 2006-2008 period. In order to associate a specific GHG emission quantity to electricity trades, hourly marginal electricity production technologies were identified and validated using the Ontario hourly output per power plant and information released in the Quebec adjacent system operator reports. It is estimated that over three years, imports into Quebec were responsible for 7.7 Mt of GHG, while Quebec hydropower exports avoided 28.3 Mt of GHG emissions. Hence, the net result is 20.6 Mt of avoided emissions over 2006-2008, or about 7 Mt per year, which corresponds to more than 8% of the Quebec yearly GHG emissions. When GHG emissions from all life cycle stages (resource extraction to end-of-life) are accounted for, the net avoided GHG emissions increase by 35%, to 27.9 Mt. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

After the introduction, it formulates the obscure concept of energy security and attempts to contextualize it with Chinese characteristics. Then it explicitly points out that the largest driver of oil demand by China as the World's Factory is transport instead of industry. Next, it explores the effectiveness of transnational pipelines as a measure of energy security and explains why they are less effective than many observers have previously assumed. Furthermore, it investigates the global expansion of Chinese national oil companies and questions their actual contribution to energy security. A few concluding remarks then follow.

A large number of national and international initiatives lately experienced rapid development in the view of the biofuels and bioenergy targets announced in the European Union, United States and other countries worldwide. The main certification initiatives are analysed in detail, including certification schemes for crops used as feedstock for biofuels, the various initiatives in the European Union, United States and globally, to cover biofuels and/or biofuels production and use. Finally, the possible way forward for biofuel certification is discussed. Certification has the potential to influence positively direct environmental and social impact of bioenergy production. Key recommendations to ensure sustainability of biofuels/bioenergy through certification include the need of an international approach and further harmonisation, combined with additional measures for global monitoring and control. The effects of biofuels/bioenergy production on indirect land use change (ILUC) is still very uncertain: addressing the unwanted ILUC requires sustainable land use planning and adequate monitoring tools such as remote sensing, regardless of the end-use of the product.

The present study will attempt to differentiate itself from this prior research by looking at the effect of income taxes on the interstate migration of both whites and African-Americans at various ages. Another distinguishing feature of the present study is that it will use data from the NLSY-Geocode, a data set not used previously for this type of study. Results of the present study are similar to the results of prior works; income taxes have an effect on migration for most races and age groups. Individuals move from states with high income taxes to states with low income taxes; these results corroborate the results obtained from the use of aggregate, state-level data.

Integrated rural tourism in the English-Welsh cross-border region: an analysis of strategic, administrative and personal challenges, Regional Studies. Cross-border tourism development is fraught with tensions, as is evident in the English-Welsh cross-border region. This paper examines strategic, administrative, and personal challenges in developing and promoting integrated approaches to rural tourism in the region. It is argued that the concept of integrated rural tourism could be useful to agencies already engaged in promoting coordination through enterprise and innovation. However, findings suggest that, whilst integrated rural tourism was welcomed by respondents as an opportunity to foster partnership modes of working across the border, limitations posed by existing administrative boundaries and weak inter-sectoral collaboration greatly impede the growth of a strategic vision.","[Ilbery, Brian] Univ Gloucestershire, Countryside & Community Res Inst, Cheltenham GL50 2RH, Glos, England; [Saxena, Gunjan] Univ Hull, Scarborough Management Ctr, Scarborough YO11 3AZ, N Yorkshire, England",University of Gloucestershire; University of Hull,"Ilbery, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gloucestershire, Countryside & Community Res Inst, Cheltenham GL50 2RH, Glos, England.",bilbery@glos.ac.uk; g.saxena@hull.ac.uk,,,,,,,104,27,31,0,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

One of the obstacles cellulosic ethanol must overcome in order to contribute to transportation energy demand is the infrastructure required to produce and distribute the fuel. Given a nascent cellulosic ethanol industry, locating cellulosic ethanol refineries and creating the accompanying infrastructure is essentially a greenfield problem that may benefit greatly from quantitative analysis. This study models cellulosic ethanol infrastructure investment using a mixed integer program (MIP) that locates ethanol refineries and connects these refineries to the biomass supplies and ethanol demands in a way that minimizes the total cost. For the single- and multi-state regions examined in this study, larger facilities can decrease ethanol costs by $0.20-0.30 per gallon, and placing these facilities in locations that minimize feedstock and product transportation costs can decrease ethanol costs by up to $0.25 per gallon compared to uninformed placement that could result from influences such as local subsidies to encourage economic development. To best benefit society, policies should allow for incentives that encourage these low-cost production scenarios and avoid politically motivated siting of plants. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A field-by-field study of 83 giant gas fields shows that the major producing Russian gas fields are in decline, and by 2013 much larger supplies from the Yamal Peninsula and the Shtokman field will be needed in order to avoid a decline in production Gas from fields in Eastern Siberia and the Far East will mainly be directed to the Asian and Pacific Rim markets, thereby limiting its relevance to the European and CIS markets As a result, the maximum export increase to the European and CIS markets amounts only to about 45% for the period 2015-2030.

The paper addresses three issues in relation to these CDM Warrants (CDM(w)). First, how should the Member State treat the CDM(w) in making decisions concerning emission reduction? The price of the property right is an important signal for a Member State in deciding the level of domestic abatement compared to trading in CDM(w)s. In other words, a shadow price for CDM(w)s should be used in formulating the emission strategy in order to determine whether or not a Member State is a buyer or seller of CDM(w)s. Second, what mechanism should be used to facilitate the exchange of CDM(w)s? The preferred mechanism depends on the market size, over which there appears to be some ambiguity: market intermediaries such as Over-the-Counter trades and exchanges are preferred if market size is small; auctions if the market size is large. Third, who should realise the value of CDM(w)s-the State, existing polluters, etc.? The value of CDM(w)s should accrue to the State. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

How many technologies developed in these programs have been successfully commercialized? What are the key factors for successful commercialization and diffusion in the market? This paper tries to answer these questions by examining the Japanese experience of public R&D in demand-side energy efficiency, focusing on two major projects conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. It is found that of the 34 technologies developed in the two projects, only seven have been commercialized so far, four of those seven have only a very limited number of installations, and only one has a growing market. The results show that, while public R&D investments have a high risk of failure, they can bring new technologies to the market after a certain lead time. In addition, several factors resulting in the success or failure of commercialization/diffusion are identified, such as long-term R&D support by the government, a marketing strategy to respond to and influence market demand, and combination of R&D and deployment policy.

A much larger number of nuclear reactors would be needed for a major impact on carbon emission. The crucial question is whether it can be done without increasing the risk of nuclear proliferation. Specifically, can a larger nuclear share in world energy production, well above the present 6%, be achieved in the next few decades without adding the proliferation-sensitive technologies of reprocessing spent fuel and recycling plutonium to the problems of the unavoidable use of enrichment technology? The answer depends on the available uranium resources. We first looked for the maximum possible nuclear buildup in the 2025-2065 period under the constraints of the estimated uranium resources and the use of once-through nuclear fuel technology. Our results show that nuclear energy without reprocessing could reduce carbon emission by 39.6% of the total reduction needed to bring the WEO 2009 Reference Scenario prediction of total GHG emissions in 2065 to the level of the WEO 450 Scenario limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees C. The less demanding strategy of the nuclear replacement of all non-CCS coal power plants retiring during the 2025-2065 period would reduce emission by 26.1%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Sensitivities to market and regulatory drivers of value are assessed, e.g. electricity price spreads, ancillary services revenues, wind curtailment and the level of carbon prices. The paper concludes by suggesting possible ways to improve the competitiveness of electricity storage, such as research and development and deployment programmes, and changes to the design of power markets and regulatory arrangements to enable storage owners to better capture the benefits of storage. Such changes would allow electricity storage, where economically viable, to play a critical role in establishing a future sustainable European power system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We have analyzed those drivers for European Countries. Over an extended period of time (1990-2006) we used panel data techniques, namely the fixed effects vector decomposition. The results suggest that both the lobby of the traditional energy sources (oil, coal, and natural gas) and CO(2) emissions restrain renewable deployment. The objective of reducing energy dependency appears to stimulate renewable energy use. Our results robustly support the EU decision to create a directive promoting the use of renewable sources (Directive 2001/77/EC).

Because individuals are sensitive to how information is presented, the choice of the message frame can significantly influence attitudes and behavioural intention. Because of the strengthening effect on both concern and PCE, our findings suggest that for the prevention of energy and environmental problems and the promotion of a more sustainable and environmental friendly energy consumption not the gravity of these problems and the possible disadvantages but the possibilities to overcome these problems (e.g. reduction of energy use, environmental friendly energy sources) have to be stressed.

Water also is becoming critically important for low-carbon power generation. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions from pulverized coal (PC) power plants, post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems are receiving considerable attention. However, current CO2 capture systems require a significant amount of cooling. This paper evaluates and quantifies the plant-level performance and cost of different cooling technologies for PC power plants with and without CO2 capture. Included are recirculating systems with wet cooling towers and air-cooled condensers (ACCs) for dry cooling. We examine a range of key factors affecting cooling system performance, cost and plant water use, including the plant steam cycle design, coal type, carbon capture system design, and local ambient conditions. Options for reducing power plant water consumption also are presented.

The result showed that the awareness of CCS was low among the surveyed public in China, compared to other clean energy technologies. Respondents indicated a slightly supportive attitude towards the use of CCS as an alternative technology to CO2 emission reductions. The regression model revealed that in addition to CCS knowledge, respondents' understanding of the characteristics of CCS, such as the maturity of the technology, risks, capability of CO2 emission reductions, and CCS policy were all significant factors in predicting the acceptance of CCS. The findings suggest that integrating public education and communication into CCS development policy would be an effective strategy to overcome the barrier of low public acceptance.

This energy flow out will pose risks to China's rational utilization of natural resources as well as environmental protection. In this paper, we evaluate the energy embodied in goods produced in China during 1992-2005 and use input-output structural decomposition analysis to identify five key factors causing the changes of energy embodied in exports. (Direct primary energy efficiency, primary energy consumption structure, structure of intermediate inputs, structure of exports, and scale of exports.) For the three sub-periods of 1992-1997,1997-2002, and 2002-2005, results show that China is a net exporter of energy, and the energy embodied in exports tends to increase over time. The expanding total volume of exports and increasing exports of energy-intensive goods tend to enlarge the energy embodied in exports within all three sub-periods, but these driving forces were offset by a considerable improvement of energy efficiency and changes in primary energy consumption structure from 1992 to 2002 and the effects of structure of intermediate input only in the sub-period from 1992 to 1997. From 2002 to 2005, the sharp augmentation of energy embodied in exports was driven by all the five factors. Our research has practical implications for the Chinese economy. Results of this study suggest that the energy embodied in trade should receive special attentions in energy policies design to limit the energy resource out-flow and pollution generation.

Since the Sustainable Energy Policy Principles were announced in 2008, Taiwanese government has declared that the development of renewable energy should take into account goals that pertain to energy, the environment, and the economy (3E goals). This study aims to assess the 3E goals and renewable energy sources regulated by the Renewable Energy Development Bill that passed in 2009. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is used to resolve the multi-goal problem for achieving our research purposes. That is, this research attempts to reveal the suitable renewable energy sources for the purposes of meeting the 3E policy goals. The results first show that environmental goal is the most important to the development of various renewable energy technologies in Taiwan, followed by the economic and energy goals. Additionally, hydropower, solar energy, and wind energy would be the renewable energy sources utilized in meeting the 3E policy goals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates terrorist attack practices against energy infrastructures and discusses how we may understand them. Our results indicate that attacks against energy infrastructures are comparatively few. Also, we find no strong connection between the ideologies of various terrorist groups and their proclivity to attack. In addition, the highly disproportionate number of attacks in a handful of countries highlights the strong geographic concentration of attacks. To explain these findings, we analyze terrorist targeting incentives including intimidation levels, symbolism, attack feasibility, and concerns for stakeholders. We argue that terrorists in general have comparatively few incentives to attack energy supply infrastructures based on our assessment of these factors. Moreover, higher levels of terrorist incidents in states more prone to internal violent conflict may suggest stronger incentives to attack energy infrastructures. When outlining energy security policies, the low frequency of worldwide attacks coupled with the high concentration of attacks in certain unstable countries should be taken into consideration. Energy importing countries could benefit from developing strategies to increase stability in key energy supply and/or transit countries facing risks of internal instability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The evolution of the carbon intensity (I(c)=CO(2)/GDP) in the period 1990-2007 was encouraging but not sufficient to reduce the growth of carbon emission. As a result of COP-15 in Copenhagen these countries (and regions) made pledges that could lead to more reduction: for the United States a 17% reduction in CO(2) emissions by 2020 below the level of 2005: for the European Union a 20% reduction in CO(2) emissions by 2020 below the 1990 level: for China a 40-45% reduction in the carbon intensity and for India a 20-25% reduction in carbon intensity by 2020. We analyzed the consequences of such pledges and concluded that the expected yearly rate of decrease of the carbon intensity follows basically the business as usual trend in the period 1990-2007 and will, in all likelihood, be insufficient to reduce carbon emissions up to 2020.

However, to achieve the large cuts required it is necessary to understand the whole-life contribution of all sectors of the electricity industry. Here, a preliminary assessment of the life cycle carbon emissions of the transmission network in Great Britain is presented. Using a 40-year period and assuming a static generation mix it shows that the carbon equivalent emissions (or global warming potential) of the transmission network are around 11 gCO(2-eq)/kWh of electricity transmitted and that almost 19 times more energy is transmitted by the network than is used in its construction and operation. Operational emissions account for 96% of this with transmission losses alone totalling 85% and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) emissions featuring significantly. However, the CO2 embodied within the raw materials of the network infrastructure itself represents a modest 3%. Transmission investment decisions informed by whole-life cycle carbon assessments of network design could balance higher financial and carbon 'capital' costs of larger conductors with lower transmission losses and CO2 emissions over the network lifetime. This will, however, necessitate new regulatory approaches to properly incentivise transmission companies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Econometric methods were used to identify the effects of different policy devices of power sector reforms on performance indicators (installed capacity per capita, transmission and distribution loss) in the countries analyzed. The research findings suggest that reform variables such as the entry of independent power producers (IPPs), unbundling of generation and transmission, establishment of regulatory agencies, and the introduction of a wholesale spot market are the driving forces of increasing generation capacity, as well as reducing transmission and distribution loss in the respective regions. In this study, we can assume that, firstly, different electric industry's reform policies/measures have different impacts on geographically and economically diverse countries. Secondly, a country's state of economic development has a different impact on policy effects of reforms. Thirdly, coexistent with independent regulatory agencies, reform policy becomes more powerful in realizing sector performances. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Factors such as a warming climate and varying internal heat gains are estimated to examine whether UK domestic buildings are likely to be prone to overheating in the future, and therefore require mechanical air conditioning. The study suggests that the ability, or inability, of the occupant to adapt to bedroom temperature is paramount in the understanding of the conditions for overheating. While this is difficult to quantify (and a range of comfort temperatures are proposed), the effect of changing the building construction and geographical location can result in significantly different thermal conditions. As might be expected, the problem appears most noticeable for buildings in the south of the UK and with lightweight constructions. Even with a window-opening schedule applied to such a scenario, the average internal temperature is simulated as being over 28 C for almost 12% of the year. A different metric, defined as cooling nights, suggests that there might be a cooling problem in bedroom areas for approximately a third of the year. In the North of the UK, and also for solid wall dwellings, this problem diminishes significantly. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Peacock, A. D.; Jenkins, D.

Within the debate about mitigating global climate change, there is mounting pressure for emerging economies like China to take more responsibility for reducing their carbon emissions within a post-2012 international climate change policy framework. For China, this leads to fundamental questions about how feasible it is for the country to shift away from its recent carbon intensive pattern of growth. This paper presents some general results of scenarios that have been developed to investigate how China might continue to develop within a cumulative carbon emissions budget. The results show how changes in the key sectors of the Chinese economy could enable China to follow four different low carbon development pathways, each of which complies with a cumulative emissions constraint. Each scenario reflects different priorities for governmental decision making, infrastructure investments and social preferences. Having compared the key features of each scenario, the paper concludes with some implications for Chinese government policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These challenges favor two main strategies for the sector: the first strategy is increasing refinery complexity and versatility: the second is integrating the refining and petrochemical industries, adding value to the crude oil while guaranteeing market share to premium oil products. Both strategies aim at increasing production of highly specified oil products, simultaneously reducing the environmental impacts of the refining industry. This paper analyses the case of a Brazilian refinery, Gabriel Passos Refinery (REGAP), by proposing additional investments to alter and/or expand its current production scheme. All the proposed options present relatively low investment rates of return. However, investments in a hydrocracking based configuration with a gasification unit providing hydrogen and power can further improve the operational profitability, due to reduced natural gas consumption.

The scenarios indicate a large low-cost mitigation potential in electricity and industry, while reaching low emission levels in international transportation and agricultural emissions might prove difficult. The two effort sharing approaches, Triptych and Multistage, were compared in terms of equitability and coherence. Both approaches produced an equitable cost distribution between countries, with least developed countries having negative or low costs and more developed countries having higher costs. There is, however, no definitive solution on how the costs should be balanced equitably between countries. Triptych seems to be yet more coherent than other approaches, as it can better accommodate national circumstances. Last, challenges and possible hindrances to effective mitigation and equitable effort sharing are presented. The findings underline the significance of assumptions behind effort sharing on mitigation potentials and current emissions, the challenge of sharing the effort with uncertain future allowance prices and how inefficient markets might undermine the efficiency of a cap-and-trade system.

By applying this methodology to the French economy for the period 1978-2006 the obtained results suggest that: first, technical change has a non-neutral impact on factor demands; second, capital-saving technical progress is present in the majority of the sectors studied; third, energy demand has increased in all sectors but electricity and gas.

Several commentators have observed that to understand what happened, one must look at history. Our paper answers this call and demonstrates how historical choices, path dependencies, and ways of dealing with these afterwards, have shaped Europe's electric power infrastructure and its vulnerability geography. We show that the decentralized organization of transnational electricity infrastructure and governance, often blamed for present-day power grid fragility, was informed by reliability considerations that still count today. We also address the (meso)regional logic of the failure, foregrounding how stakeholders from different parts of Europe historically chose to collaborate in different ways, with due consequences for the 2006 disturbance and other recent blackouts. Finally, the paper observes that today's notion of transnational electricity infrastructure vulnerability, supposedly demonstrated by the 2006 blackout, is highly contested as many stakeholders find the system extremely reliable.

J,"Ladenburg, J",,,,"Ladenburg, Jacob",,,Attitudes towards offshore wind farms-The role of beach visits on attitude and demographic and attitude relations,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Attitude towards offshore wind farms; Coastal user-specific attitude; Attitude formation,RENEWABLE ENERGY; PUBLIC-ATTITUDES; ON-LAND; POWER; IMPACT; PREFERENCES; PARK,"Presently. less than a handful of papers have analysed the attitude towards offshore wind farms in a population living in an area with offshore wind farms. This leaves the experience-based attitude and demographic relations analysis relatively unexplored. The present studies aims at covering some of that seemingly uncharted territory by analysing attitudes from a sample of more than 1000 respondents. Applying an Ordered Probit Model, the results show general positive attitudes towards offshore wind farms and that the attitude formation seems to be a function of the gender, income, level of education, visit frequency and type of visit to the beach and the view to on-land turbines from the residence. Interestingly and perhaps the most interesting results, the observed relations between demographics and attitude are found to be dependent on the type and frequency of usage of the beach among the respondents. Attitudes towards offshore wind farms and demographic associations are thus found to be more evident in the case that respondents do use not the beach for walking on a relatively frequent basis but much weaker if the respondent use the beach on a frequent basis. However, these results are sensitive to the type of beach usage. This Suggests that attitude formation towards offshore wind farms appear to be dependent on a combination of the type and frequency of use of the beach. To the author's knowledge these findings are novel, as such relation has not yet been identified in the literature. As such, the results sited light on a new angle in both the literature focusing on the opposition formation towards wind power projects in general and offshore wind farms in particular.

Evidence to date indicates that eco-driving can reduce fuel consumption by 10%, on average and over time, thereby reducing CO2 emissions from driving by an equivalent percentage.

It then investigates the extent that electricity consumers have taken advantage of energy efficiency opportunities relating to more efficient lights, water heaters, appliances, air-conditioners and heaters, and better energy-efficiency labels. The article also assesses the degree that electricity users have become more aware about electricity prices and their levels of consumption, and touches on the connection between rising levels of income and electricity use.

The investigation is made on the basis of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis, using time series data and cointegration analysis. Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) are used as the environmental indicators, and GDP as the economic indicator. Our results show that there is a long-run cointegrating relationship between the per capita emissions of two pollutants and the per capita GDP. An inverted U relationship between SO(2) emissions and GDP has been found, with income turning point approximately equals to $1200 (constant 2000 prices) or to $3700 (in PPP, constant 2000 prices). However, a monotonically increasing relationship with GDP is found more appropriate for CO(2) emissions. Furthermore, the causality results show that the relationship between income and pollution in Tunisia is one of unidirectional causality with income causing environmental changes and not vice versa, both in the short-run and long-run. This implies that an emission reduction policies and more investment in pollution abatement expense will not hurt economic growth. It could be a feasible policy tool for Tunisia to achieve its sustainable growth in the long-run. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimate cross-sectional regressions of the mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease against the intensity of fuel consumption using local data for the entire US, before the US Clean Air Act (CAA) in 1974 and after the most recent policy revisions in 2004. The cardiovascular disease rate improvement estimate suggests that up to 60 cardiovascular disease deaths per 100,000 residents are avoided in the largest urban areas with highest fuel consumption per square mile. In New York City, for instance, the mortality reduction may be worth about $30.3 billion annually. Across the US, the estimated Value of Statistical Life (VSL) benefit is $202.7 billion annually. There are likely three inseparable reasons that contributed importantly to this welfare improvement. First, the CAA regulations banned leaded gasoline, and mandated reduction in specific chemicals and smog components. Second, technologies such as the Catalytic Converter (CC) for the automobile and the low particulate diesel engine were adopted. Third, biofuels have had important roles, making the adoption of clean air technology possible and substituting for high emission fuels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Yang, G; Huang, WJ",,,,Yang Guang; Huang Wenjie,,,The status quo of China's nuclear power and the uranium gap solution,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,China's nuclear power; Natural uranium demand model; Natural uranium gap,NW CHINA; DEPOSIT,"Mainland China has eleven nuclear power reactors in commercial operation; six are under construction, and several more are slated for development in the near future. Additional reactors are planned, including some of the world's most advanced, to give a fivefold increase in nuclear capacity up to 40 GWe by 2020, and then a further three to fourfold increase to 120-160 GWe by 2030. The natural uranium supply, however, does not correspond to the speed of nuclear power development because of low production and poor deposits. After examining the existing nuclear power status quo in China, this paper provides an experimental model and a calculation method for the natural uranium needed that is based on the nuclear capacity to be installed in 2014. The natural uranium gap is further discussed through an analysis of the uranium resource distribution, reserves, and production in China, together with approaches to fill the gap. To meet the imminent uranium peak that will be required for fuel demands, China should diversify natural uranium sources and develop advanced nuclear power systems to save fuel.

Regarding the sustainability of ethanol production from sugarcane, it is essential to consider the use of the land, reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG), bioelectricity production from bagasse, energy balance of ethanol produced from sugarcane and reduction of vinasse. No other technology available to date has been able to transform the sun's energy and to reduce carbon emissions as efficiently and economically as the production of ethanol from sugarcane and its use as biofuel.

The demand for it has significantly increased. Japan, Korea and Taiwan heavily rely on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports for their gas supplies from Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Australia and the Middle East. On the other hand, countries like Thailand and Singapore import gas via trans-border pipelines. Gas supply interruptions, volatile gas prices, transportation and distribution bottlenecks, and a growing reliance on imports over longer distances have renewed interest on gas security in Asia. This paper examines the relative vulnerability to natural gas supply disruptions of seven gas-importing countries in Asia for year 2008. Based on four indicators of security of gas supply, a composite gas supply security index is estimated as an overall indication of gas vulnerability for our sample countries. The results demonstrate that there are differences in the values of the overall indicator of gas vulnerability among countries and the assessment is useful in developing an effective strategy of natural gas supply security in countries in the Asian region.

Wahrend die Firmen auf die wissensbasierte globale Wirtschaft reagieren, muss sich jede Region ein 'Wissensmonopol' aufbauen, um in der globalen Landschaft der Fahigkeiten hervorzustehen.

Cuando las empresas ubican los centros de investigacion y desarrollo (I + D) en nuevos lugares, tratan de sacar el mejor provecho del conocimiento con un nuevo enfoque abierto para responder a las distintas demandas de los clientes y a los ciclos de vida mas cortos de los productos. Con la globalizacion de I + D han aumentado los costes porque las empresas se comunican a traves de fronteras nacionaes, culturales y linguisticas usando tanto redes de TIC (Tecnologias de la Informacion y la Comunicacion) como interacciones personales. Los intermediarios en la transferencia de conocimientos, tales como agentes y guardianes del conocimiento, han cobrado mas importancia ya que se unen nuevos nodos al sistema global del conocimiento. Dado que las empresas responden a la economia global basada en el conocimiento, cada region debe construir un 'monopolio del conocimiento' para destacar en el panorama global de capacidades.

As to the determinants of the strength of transmission to individual countries, we test the relevance of their macroeconomic policies and the role of real and financial integration.

The main target is to reduce global CO2 emissions to 10 Gt per year in 2050, thus limiting global average temperature increase to 2 degrees C and preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. A review of sector and region specific energy efficiency measures resulted in the specification of a global energy demand scenario incorporating strong energy efficiency measures. The corresponding energy supply scenario has been developed in an iterative process in close cooperation with stakeholders and regional counterparts from academia, NGOs and the renewable energy industry. The Energy [R]evolution scenario shows that renewable energy can provide more than half of the world's energy needs by 2050.

The technology is under development: a number of technological, economic, environmental and safety issues remain to be solved. CCS may prolong the prevailing coal-to-electricity regime and countervail efforts in other mitigation categories. Given the need to continue using fossil-fuels for some time, however, it may also serve as a bridging technology towards a renewable energy future. in this paper, we analyze the structural characteristics of the CCS innovation system and perform an energy-environment-economic analysis of the potential contribution of CCS, using a general equilibrium model for Germany. We show that a given climate target can be achieved at lower marginal costs when the option of CCS is included into the mix of mitigation options. We conclude that, given an appropriate legal and policy framework, CCS, energy efficiency and some other mitigation efforts are complementary measures and should form part of a broad mix of measures required for a successful CO2 mitigation strategy.

However. the renewable energy policies in China are controversial and one can easily draw the wrong conclusions that Chinese renewable energy development has taken off from a surface assessment of the policies. By investigating and summarizing the first-hand experiences of participation in the Chinese renewable market (mainly wind farm development) in the past five years, this paper provides another dimension of policy analysis and independent review of the current issues facing the market. An investigation of policy changes and consequences clearly demonstrates the transformation of the Chinese renewable market. The domestic manufacturing quality and unprofessional design of wind farms made most developers' financial returns unrealistic in the wind market. Despite the difficulties and inconsistency in the system, China is tackling environmental issues seriously and heading in the right direction. With centrally controlled management, the Chinese strategies do not have to be justified financially. It is envisioned by the authors that re-organizing over 70 existing Chinese wind turbine manufacturers is unavoidable. Establishment of an internal renewable market, such as Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) system in the UK whose effectiveness is another subject of debate, would be an effective means by which the Chinese government in their post-2012 strategy could make the wind market more financially viable.

At the European Community level, energy concerns are dominated by environmental commitments that seem to demand coal's disappearance. The countries that for years have supplied the European energy market with this resource have confronted their future challenges in differing ways. The history of the energy sector in Spain has been marked by important changes, and coal has been a key factor in this process. Membership in the European Union has constituted a clear transition for a historically subsidized and protected sector that now faces an uncertain role in the national energy market. The aim of this paper is to offer an overview and analysis of the mechanisms that have been implemented in the energy sector. The first part analyzes the rationalization policies that preceded Spanish entry into the EU, giving a detailed description of the complex programs designed by the government to help mining companies. The second part analyzes later systems aimed at helping the coal industry that were implemented after the EU imposed new criteria and objectives. These systems led to the so-called mixed model of rationalization. This model, which is completely different from that implemented in other member states, is based on maintaining a system of subsidies that discriminate between public and private companies. The third part examines the objectives of the current system and the plans projected for the future in the context of the EU's adoption of an energy strategy that seeks to reconcile a self-sufficient energy supply with adherence to environmental commitments.

We find that changes in per capita GDP, population growth and transportation energy intensity are the main factors driving transport sector CO2 emission growth in the countries considered. While growth in per capita income and population are responsible for the increasing trend of transport sector CO2 emissions in China, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand; the decline of transportation energy intensity is driving CO2 emissions down in Mongolia.

As most direct household emissions come from only two fuel sources, this paper critically examines how existing emissions reduction policies for the sector shape - and are shaped by - relations between the three main groups of actor in this policy domain: central government, gas and electricity suppliers, and energy users. Focusing on relations between three dyads (government-suppliers, suppliers-consumers and consumers-government) enables us to examine aspects of demand reduction that have often been overlooked to date. By 'relations' we refer to services, power relationships and flows of capital and information, as well as less easily defined elements such as loyalty, trust and accountability. The paper argues that the chosen government policy path to deliver demand reduction, which heavily emphasises the suppliers' role. suffers from principal-agent problems, fails to align consumers and supplier interests toward emissions reduction, and does not yet portray a lower-carbon future in positive terms. It suggests that more attention should be paid to government-consumer relations, recognising that energy consumers are also citizens. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In fact, the risk of crude oil and petroleum product imports is different because of the different import origins and prices. Which import risk is lower for China? From the perspective of oil supply security, how should China portfolio crude oil and petroleum product imports to minimize its oil import risk? Using portfolio theory and a diversification index approach, this paper compares and analyzes the supply, price and transport risks of crude oil and petroleum product imports. Our results show that the following: (1) Specific risk (diversification risk) and marine transport risk of China's petroleum product imports are lower than that of crude oil imports. (2) The average rate of return of China's petroleum product imports is higher than that of crude oil imports. Moreover, the average import price variance of petroleum product imports is lower than that of crude oil imports. Thus, the systematic risk (price risk) of petroleum products is lower too. Therefore, from the perspective of oil supply security, China should increase petroleum product imports to decrease its oil import risk. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As the largest user of energy within the US government, the Department of Defense (DOD) is rightly concerned that any disruption to the nation's energy supply may have an extremely adverse impact on its military capabilities. The total solution to providing energy security will be multi-faceted with progress required on many fronts. Increasing the use of renewable energy sources and improving energy storage capabilities are gradually creating a positive impact, but investing in improving the overall efficiency of the military effort provides both immediate and long-lasting payback. One might Suppose that a decrease in the energy used by the DOD should lead to a decrease in military capability, but historical data proves otherwise. It is shown that the military has additional impetus, compared to civilian consumers, to pursue energy-efficiency improvements. Many tools are available to help the DOD along this path, yet there remain obstacles which must first be identified and analyzed as discussed herein.

Over time, this development may pose a threat to the reliability and efficiency of the Dutch electricity balancing market. We investigated possible changes to the design of the Dutch balancing market that can maintain or even improve upon its current operational performance level. The first step of the research was an analysis of the existing Dutch balancing market. It consists of three main instruments: programme responsibility, the single buyer market for regulating and reserve power (RRP), and imbalance settlement. The balancing market currently functions satisfactorily. Subsequently, the effects of large-scale development of microgeneration in the Netherlands were evaluated with a qualitative scenario analysis. Four microgeneration scenarios and two methods for allocating the household electricity consumption and generation were considered. The four scenarios concerned large-scale penetration of PV, heat-led micro CHP, electricity-led micro CHP operated by the household consumer, and electricity-led micro CHP operated by the supply company. The last scenario was found to have the strongest positive net effect. Finally, six design options were identified for improving the Dutch balancing market design in case the share of microgeneration would increase substantially. Of these six options, adjusting the profile methodology and the regulation of smart meters are no-regret options that can be implemented immediately. The attractiveness of the other options depends upon the microgeneration portfolio that emerges, the manageability of large metering data flows, and the nature of the technical effects of large-scale microgeneration penetration.

The cause for this shortage is thought to be the current Chinese energy pricing system, which is mainly government rather than market controlled. Government-regulated price-caps for coal have seriously affected coal supply. At the same time price-caps for electricity supply have caused suspension of power plant operation. As a result, the average operating time of coal-fired power plants declined 50h annually across the nation in the first half of 2008 compared to the previous year, despite clear power shortages. Here, it will be suggested that energy pricing, set by supply and demand may effectively discourage excessive growth in heavy industry, substantially encourage energy conservation and efficiency, and curb the rapid electricity demand in China. It will be argued that a market-oriented electricity pricing mechanism is required for China to secure its future power supply. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding the domestic demand of oil producing countries is important due to the existence of subsidised supply, loss of foreign exchange income and the environmental effects of oil use. The paper analyses the evolution of petroleum product demand in MENA and presents an econometric analysis of demand using a simple log-linear specification for four petroleum products, namely gasoline, diesel, kerosene and fuel oil. The study covers seven MENA countries, namely Algeria, Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar. The results show that demand has grown quite fast in these countries probably because the fuel price has been kept very low while income has risen fast and thus demand has grown fast. The gasoline demand model has performed better than other models in terms of producing expected signs for the parameters. The results for the kerosene model was the least satisfactory as most of the coefficients were found to be statistically insignificant. However, in terms of numerical results, this study compares well with other similar studies of the past. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to meet their Kyoto protocol commitments and in line with European Union policy, the Irish government has introduced a carbon-based tax system for new vehicles purchased from the 1st of July 2008. This new legislation aims to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector, a sector which is responsible for a significant proportion of both. This paper presents the results of the development, calibration, and application of a car choice model which predicts the changes in CO2 emissions intensity from new vehicle purchases as a result of the changes in vehicle tax policy and fuel price in Ireland. The model also predicts the impact of such changes on tax revenue for the Irish government and the changes in the split between the number of diesel and petrol vehicles purchased. The investigation found that the introduction of these new carbon-based taxes in Ireland will result in a reduction of 3.6-3.8% in CO2 emissions intensity and a reduction in annual tax revenue of (sic)191 M.

To test for Granger causality a bivariate vector autoregression framework is used. Empirical results from each model are derived for the island of Sardinia (Italy) over the time span 1955 to 2004. The first model suggests supply is demand-driven; the second model implies a bi-directional Granger-causal relationship between demand and capacity. The third and fourth models indicate demand is quality-driven. This empirical finding implies that an environmental conservation policy may be feasible without compromising the number of tourists visiting Sardinia and hence its economic growth.,"[Biagi, Bianca] Univ Sassari & Cagliari, CRENoS, Ctr N S Econ Res, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Biagi, Bianca] Univ Sassari, Dept Econ DEIR, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari; University of Sassari,"Biagi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari & Cagliari, CRENoS, Ctr N S Econ Res, Via Torre Tonda 34, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",bbiagi@uniss.it; mpulina@uniss.it,,"Biagi, Bianca/0000-0002-8913-1239",,,,,45,8,8,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Besides using a more complete data set that offers a more detailed look at the evolution of regional incomes in Western Europe than previous studies, it is the first to shed empirical light on regional income differences and their evolution in Eastern Europe during the transition phase from communism towards EU membership by means of a (spatial) Markov chain analysis. Regional income disparities in Western Europe are found to be decreasing over time and less persistent than reported in earlier studies. In the case of Eastern Europe some regions are likely to fall behind in terms of GDP per capita whereas a substantial number of other regions will be able to (slowly) catch up with their Western neighbours. Moreover in Western Europe localized regional conditions appear to be a main determinant of the observed income differences, whereas in Eastern Europe country-specific factors are of bigger importance.","Utrecht Sch Econ, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Bosker, M (通讯作者)，Utrecht Sch Econ, Janskerkhof 12, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands.",m.bosker@econ.uu.nl,,,,,,,45,33,38,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

One of the particularly sensitive industries in Poland is coal mining, which is the result of coal-based structure of electricity generation. As it is more difficult, in the liberalised market, to burden consumers with all the costs, electricity producers are eager to transfer the risk of operation to the suppliers. That increases uncertainty about the future of the hard coal industry. The aim of this paper was to quantitatively estimate the impact that liberalisation of the electricity markets may have on the coal mining sector in Poland. First of all, the possible areas of that impact were identified. Then the model, which involved detailed relations in the impact areas identified, was developed and employed to evaluate the performance of the mining sector. The comparison of scenarios of a monopolistic electricity sector with a liberalised one enabled an estimation of the scale of the impact on the mining sector to be made. The results showed that liberalisation causes decreased coal consumption and decreased operating profits in coal companies. However, some savings in electricity costs are possible for coal producers.

However, the uncertainties that are inherent in the planning process and the complex interactions among various uncertain parameters are challenging the capabilities of these developed tools. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a hybrid interval-fuzzy two-stage stochastic energy systems planning model (IFTEM) to deal with various uncertainties that can be expressed as fuzzy numbers, probability distributions and discrete intervals. The developed IFTEM is then applied to a hypothetical regional energy system. The results indicate that the IFTEM has advantages in reflecting complexities of various system uncertainties as well as dealing with two-stage stochastic decision problems within energy systems.

The various initiatives by governments and researchers were surveyed and the nation is found to sit in the midst of enormous potential for wind harvest for power generation. The far northern states, the mountainous regions and different places of the central and south-eastern states were identified as good areas for wind harvest together with the offshore areas spanning from Lagos through Ondo, Ogun, Cross-Rivers to Rivers states along the Atlantic Ocean in the south-south. Despite this great potential and huge prospect, the country is found to still suffer from serious energy crises due to her over dependence on hydropower which also is susceptible to seasonal variation in the amount of water levels at dams. There is yet to be committed wind energy project for power generation on-going in the country.

This paper looks back at how the design of ancillary services markets has recently evolved to put this development in context. Thereafter it examines the methods by which ancillary services are procured by highlighting the procurement practices at a number of different Independent System Operators, principally those in California, New York, New England, Texas and the PJM Interconnection, in an attempt to tease out the remaining reasons why the ancillary service markets are still so different. This is important as there are many innovations that are not rooted in regional differences but reflect genuine technical advances and economic efficiency gains and can be replicated across other ISOs to produce more efficient designs, greater reliability and lower costs.

Impacts of agglomeration on call centre operations: evidence from North West England, Regional Studies. Call centres have until fairly recently provided a significant source of employment growth in the peripheral regions of the UK. Despite the potential for locational dispersal throughout the urban hierarchy, however, call centres tend to be highly concentrated in larger urban centres and variations in wage costs between local labour markets appear to have little influence over location patterns. This paper explores the consequences of high levels of agglomeration for recruitment and retention of labour within call centres in the North West Region of England. Using survey data, various measures of labour market stress are shown to be positively correlated with urban size. The results tend to confirm that businesses are prepared to absorb the costs of concentration in order to avoid the perceived risks of labour shortages in smaller dispersed urban centres.","[Peck, Frank; Cabras, Ignazio] Univ Cumbria, Paternoster Row CA3 8TB, Carlisle, England",University of Cumbria,"Peck, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cumbria, Paternoster Row CA3 8TB, Carlisle, England.",frank.peck@cumbria.ac.uk; ignazio.cabras@cumbria.ac.uk,,"Cabras, Ignazio/0000-0002-3418-8553",,,,,23,1,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

Limits to the mega-city region: conflicting local and regional needs, Regional Studies. There has been a revival of interest in the city region in recent spatial planning and development policy. The economic arguments have been most prominent, while the environmental and social dimensions have been neglected. This paper analyses the tension within large or 'mega'-city regions between local needs and regional interests, using the United Kingdom's Thames Gateway initiative as an example. It has gained support as a plan to concentrate the supply of new housing in an area east of London in response to wider growth pressures and housing constraints. Yet, the priority locally is economic and social development for existing residents rather than more housing for incomers. The paper explores the contrast between the regional housing agenda and the needs of established local communities for jobs, skills, and improved services. It shows how the pursuit of narrow regional objectives may complicate the task of local regeneration. There are important lessons for city region theory and practice in not constraining the role envisaged for secondary cities and towns in relation to the core city.","Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8RS, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Turok, I (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, 25 Bute Gardens, Glasgow G12 8RS, Lanark, Scotland.",I.Turok@socsci.gla.ac.uk,"Turok, Ivan/X-6120-2019","Turok, Ivan/0000-0001-5520-2492",,,,,88,17,19,3,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

It analyzes the past activities related to solar energy in Malaysia, in terms of research and developments (R&Ds), the implementations used as well as the national policies for the past 20 years which have pushed the installation of PV in the country. The Feed-In Tariff (FiT) scheme is discussed, showing comparative cost-benefit analysis between the PV installation in houses in the United Kingdom (UK) and Malaysia, and with other investment schemes available in Malaysia. To investigate the awareness of renewable energy policies and incentives, a preliminary survey of the public opinion in Malaysia has been carried out, and an evaluation of public willingness to invest in the FiT scheme by installing the PV on their houses is presented. The cost-benefit analysis shows that the proposed FiT programme is capable of generating good return on investment as compared to the one in the UK, but the return is lower than other investment tools. The survey suggests that most Malaysians are unaware of the government's incentives and policies towards renewable energies, and are not willing to invest in the FiT scheme. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

They do not make allowance for the fact that concentration may be differently pronounced at various geographical levels. Methods of spatial point pattern analysis allow one to measure industry concentration at a continuum of spatial scales. While common distance-based methods are well applicable for sub-national study areas, they become inefficient in measuring concentration at various levels within industrial countries. This particularly applies in testing for conditional concentration where overall manufacturing is used as a reference population. Using Ripley's K function approach to second-order analysis, we propose a subsample similarity test as a feasible testing approach for establishing conditional clustering or dispersion at different spatial scales. For measuring the extent of clustering and dispersion, we introduce a concentration index of the style of Besag's (J R Stat Soc B, 25:294, 1977) L function. The new index can be employed to measure the extent of substantial clustering and dispersion.

It is conceptualized as a situation in which the energy services used for sustaining local consumption, local production and the export of goods and services are derived from locally renewable energy resources. Technically, the implementation of higher degrees of energy autarky rests on increasing energy efficiency, realizing the potential of renewable energy resources and relying on a decentralized energy system. Practically, a transition towards regional energy autarky requires administrations and civil society actors to initialize and develop projects at the local level, ensure their acceptance and support by the regional population and implement the project in collaboration with relevant actors.

The analysis is based on the evolution of the spatial distributions over time. Robust measures of dispersion, asymmetry, peakedness and two nonparametric distributional tests - shape equality and multimodality - are used to assess spatial time differences. A robust normal reference bandwidth is also applied to estimate Markov's transition laws and its subsequent ergodic (long-run) distributions. Our results point toward non-stationary, flattening and right-skewed spatial distributions before the oil price shocks of the 1970s and more stable and symmetric shapes between 1980 and 2000 at the world level and for many country groupings (similar income, geographic neighbors, institutional partners). In the latter period, group-specific convergence patterns emerge with the clearest single-peaked and compact density shapes being reached in the wealthy, well-integrated and European countries during the last years of the panel. No significant multimodality is formally detected in the world distribution over the whole period. The Markov analysis suggests more divergence and larger per capita emissions for the world in the long run, with a doubling in median emissions and stable pollution gaps during the first 50 years of the transition. A variety of steady state distributions are identified in the country subsets. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Criado, C.

Situated on the island of Borneo, Bakun Dam is a 204 m high concrete face, rock filled dam on the Balui River in the Upper Rajang Basin in the rainforests of Sarawak. Bakun Dam and its affiliated infrastructure could be the single largest and most expensive energy project ever undertaken in Southeast Asia. Based on data collected through site visits, original field research in Sarawak, and more than 80 research interviews, the article begins by teasing out the complex history and drivers behind the Bakun project before identifying a set of potential social, political, and economic benefits the project could deliver. It then delves into six sets of barriers in the technical, economic, political, legal and regulatory, social, and environmental realms. We find that Bakun illustrates how centralized energy megaprojects, while ostensibly championed for reasons of economies of scale and the ability to bring about transformational change in the shortest period of time, often fail to address broader development goals such as fighting energy poverty and improving the livelihoods of the local communities they are supposed to serve.

We choose China and India as a representative of emerging markets to examine if the quantity of crude oil imported by China and India is significant in the existing oil pricing system (Kaufmann et al., 2004). Our data starts from January 2002 and ends in March 2010, which includes the oil shock of 2007-2008. We utilize cointegration and error correction model framework developed by Engle-Granger (1987) and Gregory-Hansen (1996) in the analysis. Our results indicate that demand from emerging markets has become a significant factor in the world oil pricing system since 2003. This result is significant as it lends empirical support to the widely held conjecture that the oil shock of 2007-2008 is a demand-led shock (Hamilton, 2009). Our result also has significant policy implications that go beyond the oil shock. The emerging market factor is there to stay and reflects the changing power between emerging and developed economies in the world economic system as a result of decades of fast economic development in the former. It will certainly influence policy issues related to oil and beyond.

The analysis reveals some commonalities and differences between the procedures across regions. Furthermore, some aspects regarding these procedures have raised the concern of different stakeholders, including the central government and wind energy investors. A conflict between the interests of the central and regional governments can be observed. Lack of coordination between the different administrative levels and the more is better mentality of regional authorities have led to a significant growth of wind energy requests for the (national) feed-in tariff. In turn, investors have complained about the discretionarity and non-transparency of those procedures and the lack of homogeneity across regions. This is likely to result in delays, uncertainty for investors and higher transaction costs. Although there has been a trend to a model which involves the use of multicriteria bidding procedures with more explicit, objective and precise criteria regarding project selection, the aforementioned problems suggest the need to improve coordination between the different administrative levels.

This is in contrast to its relatively poor attainment of wind energy on land, and raises questions about the reasons for this difference in performance. This article traces the phases of development of marine wind energy in the UK with reference to factors that are instrumental in the uptake of this form of renewable energy. A number of features emerge from this analysis that stand in some contrast to the situation on land and help to explain the UK's current status. These include: recognition of an exceptional resource and relative ease of exploitation; government commitment and policy geared to controlled growth and strategic oversight, adequate economic support and start-up investment; the unusual rights and interests of the Crown Estate; and growing scale, confidence and organisation on the part of the industry. Set against these factors are the complexities of consenting, supply bottlenecks, and some stakeholder and public resistance, though these are outmatched by the drivers in favour of development and are being partly addressed.

Using extensive data from the four ERCOT zones of Texas, this paper develops a two-stage model to attack the issue. The first stage is an ordered-logit regression to identify and quantify, for example, the impact of wind generation in the West zone on the estimated probability of a positive or negative price difference between the North and West zones. The second stage is a log-linear regression model that identifies and quantifies the estimated impact of wind generation on the sizes of those positive and negative price differences. It is shown that high wind generation and low load in the wind-rich ERCOT West zone tend to lead to congestion and zonal price differences, that those differences are time-dependent, and that other factors such as movements in nuclear generation and natural-gas prices, as well as fluctuating non-West zone loads, also play a role. The results have broad implications for energy policy makers that extend well beyond the borders of Texas and, indeed, those of the United States. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Differences between regulatory policies and market designs in terms of generation adequacy policies may distort the normal functioning of the neighboring markets, as well as the reliability of supply. We test the effect of heterogeneous regulatory design between two interdependent markets: energy-only market, price-capped market without capacity mechanisms and price-capped markets with forward capacity contracts obligation. We rely on a long-term market simulation model in system dynamics that characterizes expansion decision in a competitive regime. The results show that differences in market designs affect both price and reliability of supply in the two markets. We examine both the short and long terms effect, and how free-riding may occur where capacity adequacy policies are adopted in one market but not the other. The main finding is that the lack of harmonization between local markets in policies to ensure capacity adequacy may lead to undesirable side effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis was conducted for the time period of 1985-2025 for Ann Arbor, MI and San Antonio, TX. Using annual sales-weighted efficiencies of residential CAC equipment, the tradeoff between potential operational savings and the burdens of producing new, more efficient equipment was evaluated. The optimal replacement schedule for each objective was identified for each location and service scenario. In general, minimizing energy consumption required frequent replacement (4-12 replacements), minimizing GHG required fewer replacements (2-5 replacements), and minimizing cost required the fewest replacements (1-3 replacements) over the time horizon. Scenario analysis of different federal efficiency standards, regional standards, and Energy Star purchases were conducted to quantify each policy's impact. For example, a 16 SEER regional standard in Texas was shown to either reduce primary energy consumption 13%, GHGs emissions by 11%, or cost by 6-7% when performing optimal replacement of CACs from 2005 or before. The results also indicate that proper servicing should be a higher priority than optimal replacement to minimize environmental burdens. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to predict the future energy efficiency gap, a multivariate regression model combined with risk analysis is developed to estimate future energy intensity of China's steel industry. It is found that R&D intensity, energy saving investment, labor productivity and industry concentration are all important variables that affect energy intensity. We assess the possible measures as to how China's steel industry can narrow the energy efficiency gap with Japan by means of scenario analysis. Using Japan's current energy efficiency level as baseline, the energy saving potential of China's steel industry is more than 200 million ton coal equivalent in 2008, and it would fall to zero in 2020. However, if greater efforts were made to conserve energy, it would be possible to narrow down the energy efficiency gap between China and Japan by around 2015. Finally, using the results of the scenario analysis, future policy priorities for energy conservation in China's steel industry are assessed in this paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Based or driving behavior statistics on vehicle distance traveled and daily trips (US DOT, 2003) in the US, we develop a simulation algorithm to estimate the PHEV charging profiles of electricity demand with plausible plug-in times and depth of discharge of the PHEVs. The model enables simulations of the impacts of various grid management strategies on the availability of vehicle charging in public places, the charge power levels and standards, scheduling charging in off-peak periods and policy measures to promote PHEV adoption. PHEV charging imposes a modest pressure on system load on the order of 560-910 W-p per vehicle. We find that enabling charging in places other than home increases the daily electric energy use of PHEV from 24% to 29% (1.5-2 kWh/day). Major findings of the different scenarios are that PHEVs with a 20 mile range (PHEV-20) shift 45-65% of vehicle miles traveled in the United States to electricity, compared with 65-80% for PHEVs with a 40 mile range (PHEV-40).

One approach has been to develop energy-related projects in their local, host communities. Because host communities can play a major role in the successful planning and implementation of these projects, understanding the factors relating to their support is important. Building on research that suggests that procedural fairness is one such key factor, this study examines community members' support of six approaches a local university could implement to work towards a goal of carbon neutrality. The results of a mail survey (N=677) found that perceived fairness of campus decision makers was significantly related to community support for the proposed approaches; however, beliefs about the efficacy of the different approaches to address challenges associated with climate change had the strongest relationship with support. The results also suggest that residents prefer changes in the energy infrastructure, such as the development of wind power, over the purchase of carbon offsets. We discuss the results in terms of actions that universities may take to foster community engagement in decision-making for university-sponsored sustainable energy projects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

While the emerging global debate on potential cost-effective responses has produced potential solutions such as cap and trade systems and/or carbon taxes as part of evolving sustainable energy/environmental policies, this kind of intellectual inquiry does not seem to be an issue among Turkish policy-making elites. This is mainly due to their miscalculation that pursuing sustainable energy policies is much more expensive in comparison to the utilization of fossil fuels such as natural gas. Nevertheless, the pegged prices of an energy sector dominated by natural gas are illusive, as both the political risks and environmental damage have not been incorporated into the current cost calculations. This paper evaluates energy policies through a lens of risk management and takes an alternative approach to calculating energy costs by factoring in political risks. This formulation reveals that the cost of traditional fossil-based energy is in fact more expensive than renewable energy. In addition to being environmentally friendly, the paradigm shift towards renewable energy policies would provide Turkey with a significant opportunity to stimulate its economy by being one of the first countries to develop green technologies and as a result this burgeoning sector would prompt job creation as well; mainly due to the externalities.

These issues, along with other bioenergy sustainability issues, are reviewed through eighteen international case studies with the objective of identifying opportunities and threats to decentralised bioenergy systems. The case studies were selected based on feedstock type, bioenergy type, production capacity, synergistic alliances, ownership structure and physical locations. This variation was used to provide a basis for evaluating opportunities and threats from different contexts. Commercial viability remains the primary concern for the sustainability of decentralised bioenergy systems. There are, however, opportunities for compounding benefits through integrating small scale decentralised bioenergy systems with other production systems. Integrated production, including closed loop models, allow waste materials from one process to be used as inputs in other production processes, and thereby increasing economic, social and environmental outcomes. Synergistic opportunities along the bioenergy production chain, which include feedstock production, bioenergy marketing and distribution could also be exploited by communities and other investors to minimise decentralised production risk.

Furthermore, we try to find out whether these incentives differ between British and Dutch couriers. We find that several incentives play a significant role. Subcontractors in the Netherlands predominantly are extrinsically motivated to engage in CO2 reporting and reduction techniques. This is because they are mainly driven by regulatory compliance, energy costs and implementation costs. In contrast, British subcontractors are much more intrinsically motivated to comply.

Our analysis combines a review of international patent data at a detailed technology level with field interviews of ten Chinese PV companies. We show that Chinese producers have acquired the technologies and skills necessary to produce PV products through two main channels: the purchasing of manufacturing equipment in a competitive international market and the recruitment of skilled executives from the Chinese diaspora who built pioneer PV firms. The success of these firms in their market is, however, not reflected in their performance in terms of innovation.

It was found that the method chosen can have a large impact on the CO2 intensity for countries with relatively large amounts of combined heat and power plants. Of the analysed countries, the difference in CO2 intensities is found to be especially large for Russia, Germany and Italy (82%, 31% and 20% differences in 2007, respectively, for CO2 intensity of total power generation). This study furthermore shows that by taking into account transmission and distribution losses and auxiliary power use, CO2 intensity for electricity consumption is 8-44% higher for the analysed countries than the CO2 intensity for electricity generation, with 15% as global average, in 2007. CO2 emissions from power generation can be reduced by implementing best practice technology for fossil power generation. This paper estimates a potential of 18-44% savings, with 29% as global average. An additional potential is expected to exist for reducing transmission and distribution losses, which range from 4% to 25% of power generation in 2006, for the analysed countries, with 9% as global average.

The UK mainstream house construction industry is being driven, through policy and regulation, towards achieving this end without evidence of how these new systems of provision are used by passively adopting households. In this paper energy use, consequential emissions of CO2, and annual running costs for a case study comprising 14 newly constructed low energy affordable homes are evaluated. Four different energy typologies are compared: ground sourced heat pumps: active solar (thermal and photovoltaic): passive solar and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery: conventional high efficiency gas boiler. The carbon embodied in construction and emitted over a 20 year occupation period for each typology is calculated. Ground source heat pumps have the highest annual primary energy demand, CO2 emission and annual running costs over the 20 year period. The homes with active solar technologies provided most benefit across all three evaluation criteria. Energy and CO2 emissions associated with end uses other than heating were similar to the UK average. This poses significant questions on the probability of policy application in the real world to deliver projected reductions in emissions of CO2. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In these scenarios Europe is expected to reinforce its present competitive advantages. The intention is not to identify desirable, positive, ideological or most probable scenarios; the aim is instead to combine in a strictly logical way the different trajectories that can be envisaged in the main economic, institutional and social driving forces of change and consequently to build a small number of alternative, consistent and 'conditional' scenarios.

Their mitigation will clearly be hostage to improvement in economic development, since the unevenness of that development created them in the first place. Integral to development is structural change, and the key to effecting that change is improved energy efficiency. Indeed, this paper explores energy usage and regional development from 1952 to the present, establishing that they both conform to an inverted-U pattern. Eastern China, the leader in industrialization, has moved beyond the apogee of the curve, but Central and Western China have failed to follow suit, being held back by poor industrial structures and adverse patterns of energy consumption. Remedying this laggardly performance preoccupies China's Government, for rendering the country energy-efficient and containing regional disparities, both rest on pushing the Central and Western regions down the curve in the wake of the prosperous coast.

To promote biofuel, Indian government has announced biodiesel purchase price as well as compulsory blending ratio. But, these measures have not worked to create large scale biodiesel production in India. With this backdrop, this paper highlights about the importance of a sound pricing policy focusing on the entire value chain of biodiesel production. The analysis is based on field level data from Chhattisgarh, the leading state in the production of jatropha. Such a sound pricing policy has to deal with the prices of feedstock, by-products and final product like biodiesel. It would also have to reflect on the business model of production of biodiesel. The simulation exercises in our model shows that the business returns from the production of biodiesel and the minimum support price (MSP) of the feedstock for biodiesel (i.e. jatropha seeds in this case) are sensitive to various parameters like seed yields, technological efficiency, by product and petro-diesel prices. An effective price policy framework has to consider all these factors to create a platform for sustainable biodiesel production in India. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Renewables such as large hydro and solar proposed by the Government have a potential to reduce the overall life cycle environmental impacts from the electricity mix, considering their lower environmental impacts compared to fossil-fuels. However, this requires a five-fold increase in grid investments from the current US$1.7 billion per year to US$9.40 billion by 2030. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The EU policy framework mainly emphasizes economical and technical aspects of RE sources, and promotes large scale projects. However the local implementation of RE EU policies can lead to spatial misfits if the policy implementation neglects the peculiarities of the place. It is important to understand the misfits and relationship between the EU RE policies and the local implementation process, as misfits can affect the policy implementation process and subsequently policy outcomes can be different from those intended, leading to inapt or inapplicable measures. This article presents findings of a qualitative in-depth study of Malta's RE policy implementation. The paper shows that planning of central large-scale RE projects in Malta provokes land and marine use conflicts and can cause difficulties in implementation. The concerned key actors implement the policies according to their motivation, perception, and capacity, and the context in which they are embedded. Hence, both the EU RE policy framework and the national interaction process influence the implementation process, which can lead to spatial mismatches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study is to examine the effects of current and future energy price policies on optimal configuration of combined heat and power (CHP) and combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems in Iran, under the conditions of selling and not-selling electricity to utility. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used for minimizing the cost function for owning and operating various CHP and CCHP systems in an industrial dairy unit. The results show that with the estimated future unsubsidized utility prices, CHP and CCHP systems operating with reciprocating engine prime mover have total costs of 5.6 and $2.9 x 10(6) over useful life of 20 years, respectively, while both systems have the same capital recovery periods of 1.3 years. However, for the same prime mover and with current subsidized prices, CHP and CCHP systems require 4.9 and 5.2 years for capital recovery, respectively. It is concluded that the current energy price policies hinder the promotion of installing CHP and CCHP systems and, the policy of selling electricity to utility as well as eliminating subsidies are prerequisites to successful widespread utilization of such systems.

To qualify under the Renewable Fuel Standard, cellulosic ethanol and new corn ethanol must demonstrate 60% and 20% lower emissions than petroleum fuels, respectively. A combined corn-grain and corn-stover ethanol system could potentially satisfy a major portion of renewable fuel production goals. This work examines multiple LCA allocation procedures for a hypothetical system producing ethanol from both corn grain and corn stover. Allocation choice is known to strongly influence GHG emission results for corn-ethanol. Stover-derived ethanol production further complicates allocation practices because additional products result from the same corn production system. This study measures the carbon intensity of ethanol fuels against EISA limits using multiple allocation approaches. Allocation decisions are shown to be paramount. Under varying approaches, carbon intensity for corn ethanol was 36-79% that of gasoline, while carbon intensity for stover-derived ethanol was -10% to 44% that of gasoline. Producing corn-stover ethanol dramatically reduced carbon intensity for corn-grain ethanol, because substantially more ethanol is produced with only minor increases in emissions. Regulatory considerations for applying LCA are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We discuss the main choices that will have to be made if the European Union implements such a system alongside the EU ETS. Although more analysis is required on some issues, on others some design options seem clearly preferable to others. First, the import adjustment should be a requirement to surrender allowances rather than a tax. Second, the general rule to determine the amount of allowances per ton imported should be the product-specific benchmarks that the European Commission is currently elaborating for a different purpose (i.e. to determine the amount of free allowances). Third, this obligation should apply when the imported product is registered at the EU border, and not after the end of the year as is the case for domestic emitters. Fourth, the export adjustment should take the form of a rebate on the amount of allowances a domestic emitter has to surrender. Five, this rebate should equal the above-mentioned product-specific benchmarks, not the emissions of the particular exporting plant or firm. Finally, the adjustment does not have to apply to consumer products but mostly to basic products. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the wide range of modelling approaches used and multiplicity of assumptions made, it is shown that forecasts can be usefully compared along two dimensions, namely: shape of future production profile and assumed or implied ultimately recoverable resource of conventional oil. Other differences between forecasts are either secondary or are components of these two parameters. The paper shows how large differences in the assumed size of the resource make relatively little difference to the timing of a global peak in conventional oil production. It also examines the impact of rates of discovery, reserves growth and depletion on the forecast date of peak and shows how forecasts that delay this peak until beyond 2030 rest on assumptions that are at best optimistic and at worst implausible.

The carbon emissions from these sources-discussed here as the metro area's partial carbon footprint-provide a foundation for identifying the pricing, land use, help metropolitan areas throughout the world respond to climate change. The article begins by exploring a sample of the existing literature on urban morphology and climate change and explaining the methodology used to calculate each area's carbon footprint. The article then depicts the specific carbon footprints for Beijing, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, Manila, Mexico City, New Delhi, New York, Sao Paulo, Seoul, Singapore, and Tokyo and compares these to respective national averages. It concludes by offering suggestions for how city planners and policymakers can reduce the carbon footprint of these and possibly other large urban areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This standard aims to introduce advanced energy-saving technologies into passenger vehicles and to reduce the average fuel consumption rate of Chinese new passenger vehicle fleet in 2015 to 7 L/100 km. The Phase 3 standard follows the evaluating system by specifying fuel consumption targets for sixteen individual mass-based classes. Different from compliance with the Phases 1 and 2 fuel consumption standards, compliance of the Phase 3 standard is based on corporate average fuel consumption (CAFC) rates for individual automobile companies. A transition period from 2012 to 2014 is designed for manufacturers to gradually adjust their production plans and introduce fuel-efficient technologies. In this paper, we, the designers of the Phase 3 standard, present the design of the overall fuel consumption reduction target, technical feasibility, and policy implications of the Phase 3 standard. We also explore several enforcement approaches for the Phase 3 standard with financial penalties of non-compliance as a priority.

With the rapid economic growth, Chinese energy consumption sharply increased. The relation between Chinese energy consumption and economic growth is focused on, and many researchers have studied this issue by applying the methods such as granger causality test. However, the results just reveal the relation in a very long period. In this paper, the history of Chinese economy is divided into four periods. And the relation between Chinese energy consumption and economic growth is examined by applying grey incidence analysis, which is one of the most important methods of grey system theory which can be applied to solve the problems with small samples. The results show that the relations in different periods are not the same. The degree of grey incidences between total energy consumption and values added of secondary industry is larger, and the degree of grey incidences between GDP and consumption of coal is larger too.

National elasticities with respect to price, income, vehicle stock and metro fares are estimated using both a time series cointegration model and a panel GMM model for Mexican states. Estimates for Mexico City are derived by modifying national estimates according to mode shares as suggested by Graham and Glaister (2006), and by estimating a panel Within Groups model with data aggregated by borough. Although all models agree on the sign of the elasticities the magnitudes differ greatly. Elasticities change over time and differ between the national and local levels, with smaller price responses in Mexico City. In general, price elasticities are smaller than those reported in the gasoline demand surveys, a pattern previously found in developing countries. The fact that income and vehicle stock elasticities increase over time may suggest that vehicles are being used more intensively in recent years and that Mexico City residents are purchasing larger vehicles. Elasticities with respect to metro fares are negligible, which suggests little substitution between modes. Finally, the fact that fuel efficiency elasticities are smaller than vehicle stock elasticities suggests that vehicle stock size, rather than its composition, has a larger impact on gasoline consumption in Mexico City.

This paper provides a state-level context for examining wind power deployment and presents research on how policy stakeholders perceive wind energy in four states: Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, and Texas. Through semi-structured interviews, state-level energy policy stakeholders were asked to explain their perceptions of wind energy technology within their state. Interview texts were coded to assess how various drivers promote or hinder the deployment of wind power in sub-national contexts. Responses were dominated by technical, political, and economic frames in all four states, but were often driven by a very different rationale. Environmental, aesthetic, and health/safety frames appeared less often in the discourse. This analysis demonstrates that each state arrived at its current level of deployment via very different political, economic, and technical paths. In addition to helping explain why and how wind technology was - or was not - deployed in each of these states, these findings provide insight into the diversity of sub-national dialogues on deployment of low-carbon energy technologies.

First, factor models based on large sets of macroeconomic variables for forecasting, which have generally proven useful for forecasting. However, there is some disagreement in the literature as to the appropriate method. Second, forecast methods based on mixed-frequency data sampling (MIDAS). This regression technique can take into account unbalanced datasets that emerge from publication lags of high- and low-frequency indicators, a problem practitioner have to cope with in real time. In this article, we introduce Factor MIDAS, an approach for nowcasting and forecasting low-frequency variables like gross domestic product (GDP) exploiting information in a large set of higher-frequency indicators. We consider three alternative MIDAS approaches (basic, smoothed and unrestricted) that provide harmonized projection methods that allow for a comparison of the alternative factor estimation methods with respect to nowcasting and forecasting. Common to all the factor estimation methods employed here is that they can handle unbalanced datasets, as typically faced in real-time forecast applications owing to publication lags. In particular, we focus on variants of static and dynamic principal components as well as Kalman filter estimates in state-space factor models. As an empirical illustration of the technique, we use a large monthly dataset of the German economy to nowcast and forecast quarterly GDP growth. We find that the factor estimation methods do not differ substantially, whereas the most parsimonious MIDAS projection performs best overall. Finally, quarterly models are in general outperformed by the Factor MIDAS models, which confirms the usefulness of the mixed-frequency techniques that can exploit timely information from business cycle indicators.","[Marcellino, Massimiliano] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Marcellino, Massimiliano] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Schumacher, Christian] Deutsch Bundesbank, Econ Res Ctr, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",European University Institute; Bocconi University; Deutsche Bank,"Marcellino, M (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy.",massimiliano.marcellino@eui.eu; christian.schumacher@bundesbank.de,,"Marcellino, Massimiliano/0000-0002-8737-2768",,,,,49,131,142,3,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

We compared the initial purchase and installation cost of heaters with changes in the number of visits to health professionals, time off work/school, caregiving, and pharmaceutical use for household members and changes in total household energy use and carbon emissions following the intervention. We used two scenarios to analyse the results over the predicted 12-year life-span of the heaters. The targeted approach (Scenario A - assuming high rates of household asthma throughout the period of analysis) produced enough health-related benefits to offset the cost of the heaters, and when total energy use and carbon emission savings were included in the analysis the ratio of benefits to costs was 1.09:1.

In 2008, about 560 million mobile phones were produced and 634 million users subscribed to a mobile phone plan in China. These large numbers mean that the charging and disposal of mobile phones has the potential to have significant impacts on the environment. Thus the evaluation of material and energy consumption of mobile phones is an important task in the end-of-life management of electronic products. This paper uses material flow analysis (MFA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to estimate the life cycle impacts of mobile phones in China from manufacturing energy, use phase and generation of waste mobile phones. Results indicate over the mobile phone life cycle, manufacturing accounts for 50% of the total energy consumption, whereas the use phase accounts for only 20%. Mobile phones and supporting infrastructures account for a rapidly increasing 0.17% of Chinese energy use. In 2008, around 77 million units of waste mobile phones were generated in China. To manage this energy use and recover valuable materials recommendations are made to increase lifespan, improve energy efficiency during use and ensure recycling. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

While the long-run component of real oil prices seems to have a stochastic trend, global real economic activity has been thought to generate important changes in real oil prices. Based on this argument, in this paper, we analyze the real oil prices within a trend-cycle decomposition framework, where we impose a stochastic trend and assume the cyclical term to be affected by global economic conditions. We also let the parameters vary over time to see whether shocks to trend and the cycle have changing effects on the real oil prices. As a result, we find that shocks to trend are more persistent recently. In that sense, this paper contributes to the literature by offering an explanation for the increased volatility in oil prices. In addition, we show that global economic activity contributed also to the previous oil price shocks, which were regarded mainly as supply-side driven. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our central argument is that energy governance in this country has been shifting from a hierarchical to a co-governance mode. Accordingly, interactions among the State, the society and economic actors are now regulated in a horizontal and decentralized way, rather than a vertical and centralized one. This shift contributed to the success of the Camisea gas project and had a positive effect on foreign direct investments inflow in the energy sector (1). In addition, it has helped Peru reach energetic self-sufficiency, while improving its energy balance (2). Meanwhile, energy policy has welcomed a major participation of social actors, contributing to institutionalized arrangements between the State, the companies and indigenous communities and their NGO partners (3). Two theoretical conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, the State's role remains central in energy governance, thus invalidating the hollowing of the State thesis. Second, the co-governance mode helps to overcome the resource curse thesis.

The empirical analysis of U.S. stock return data shows statistically and economically significant forecasting gains of the decomposition model over the conventional predictive regression.","[Anatolyev, Stanislav] New Econ Sch, Moscow 117418, Russia; [Gospodinov, Nikolay] Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada",New Economic School; Concordia University - Canada,"Anatolyev, S (通讯作者)，New Econ Sch, Nakhimovsky Pr 47, Moscow 117418, Russia.",sanatoly@nes.ru; gospodin@alcor.concordia.ca,"Anatolyev, Stanislav/V-9122-2017","Anatolyev, Stanislav/0000-0002-2560-0200",FQRSC; IFM2; SSHRC,FQRSC; IFM2; SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We would like to thank the Editor, two anonymous referees, seminar and conference participants at the University of Helsinki, the 2008 North American winter meeting of the Econometric Society, the 13th International Conference of the Society for Computational Economics and the 27th International Symposium on Forecasting for very useful comments and suggestions and Moto Yogo for making the data available on his website.

A Masdar City case study,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy currency; Demand management; Renewable energy economics,TRANSMISSION,"We propose the introduction of an energy-based parallel currency as a means to ease the transition to energy-conscious living. Abundant fossil energy resources mask the internal and external energy costs for casual energy consumers. This situation is challenging communities that draw a significant fraction of their primary energy consumption from renewable energy sources. The Masdar Energy Credit (MEC) system is a way of translating the fundamental aspects behind energy generation and usage into a tangible reality for all users with built-in fungibility to incentivize collectively sustainable behavior. The energy credit currency (ergo) corresponds with a chosen unit of energy so that the total amount of ergos issued equals the energy supply of the community. Ergos are distributed to users (residents, commercial entities, employees, and visitors) on a subscription basis and can be surrendered in exchange for the energy content of a service. A spot market pricing mechanism is introduced to relate ergos to fiat currency using a continuously variable exchange rate to prevent depletion of the sustainable energy resource. The MEC system is intended to: (i) meet the sustainable energy balance targets of a community (ii) support peak shaving or load shifting goals, and (iii) raise energy awareness.

Biofuels are the most popular renewable resource option for the transport sector, and the European Union has established objectives that the Member States must adopt and implement. However, biofuel production at such a scale requires a considerable amount of water resources, and this water-energy nexus is rarely taken into account. This paper shows the strong nexus between water and energy in biofuel production and estimates the virtual water (VW) content and the water footprint (WF) from the raw material production that will be needed to reach the Spanish targets for biofuel consumption by 2010. The results show how the impact of such targets on the global and local water situation could be reduced through virtual water imports and, at the same time, how these imports could increase Spain's water and energy dependence. Hence, in order to manage water from an integral perspective of the territory, the inclusion of biofuel Consumption objectives should go hand in hand with measures to reduce the demand of energy in the transport sector.

Thus, this paper aims at measuring environmental efficiency within a joint production framework of both desirable and undesirable output using Data Envelopment Analysis and Directional Distance Function. Carbon dioxide is considered as an input in one context and as an undesirable output in the other with the environmental efficiency being defined accordingly. Using 3 digit sate level data from the Annual Survey of Industries for the years 2000-2001 through 2004-2005, the proposed models are applied to estimate environmental efficiency of Indian cement industry. Empirical results show that there is enough potential for the industry to improve its environmental efficiency with efficiency being varied across states. Results also show that Indian cement industry, if faced with environmental regulation, has the potential to expand desirable output and contract undesirable output with the given inputs. However, regulation has a potential cost in terms of lower feasible expansion of desirable output as compared to unregulated scenario. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although their energy efficiency has been increasing substantially in past decades, still additional energy efficiency potentials exist. Energy policy that aims at realizing these potentials faces, however, growing concerns about possible adverse effects on commodity prices. Here, we address these concerns by applying the experience curve approach to analyze long-term price and energy efficiency trends of three wet appliances (washing machines, laundry dryers, and dishwashers) and two cold appliances (refrigerators and freezers). We identify a robust long-term decline in both specific price and specific energy consumption of large appliances. Specific prices of wet appliances decline at learning rates (LR) of 29 +/- 8% and thereby much faster than those of cold appliances (LR of 9 +/- 4%). Our results demonstrate that technological learning leads to substantial price decline, thus indicating that the introduction of novel and initially expensive energy efficiency technologies does not necessarily imply adverse price effects in the long term. By extending the conventional experience curve approach, we find a steady decline in the specific energy consumption of wet appliances (LR of 20-35%) and cold appliances (LR of 13-17%). Our analysis suggests that energy policy might be able to bend down energy experience curves. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Regional dimension of taxes and public expenditure in Ireland, Regional Studies. In Ireland, as in many other countries, there has been an ongoing debate on the nature, degree and trends of regional imbalance. However, relatively little is known about the effects of policies at the regional level in Ireland. This paper considers two aspects of public policy, namely the fiscal system and public expenditure. In particular, regional government accounts are constructed that identify the level of taxation, subsidization and public expenditure at the regional level. The analysis of these data confirms that the fiscal system does reduce relative income differences in Ireland. Furthermore, there are substantial resource transfers across regions.","Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Morgenroth, E (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq,Sir John Rogersons Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland.",edgar.morgenroth@esri.ie,,"Morgenroth, Edgar/0000-0002-9442-0561",,,,,29,6,6,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

During the first half of the eighteenth century, this chain would begin with the obligados (traders that contracted with the town council the supply of charcoal at fixed amounts and prices), and would end with the pieceworkers. The link of both ends were the charcoal-makers, a combination of independent businessmen and skilled workers, without whom the nearly twenty-three thousand tons of charcoal demanded by the capital yearly at the time would never have been brought in. This paper underlines the importance of charcoal-makers' management, and defends that the latter, unlike the obligados, would relay on the said management in order to endure the transformation that took place in Madrid's charcoal-supply system from 1753.","Univ Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Nieto-Sánchez, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain.",,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,4,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

The survey highlights that most empirical studies focus on either testing the role of energy (electricity) in stimulating economic growth or examining the direction of causality between these two variables. Although the positive role of energy on growth has become a stylized fact, there are some methodological reservations about the results from these empirical studies. A general observation from these studies is that the literature produced conflicting results and there is no consensus neither on the existence nor on the direction of causality between energy consumption (electricity consumption) and economic growth. As a policy implication, to avoid from conflicting and unreliable results, the authors may use the autoregressive distributed lags bounds test, two-regime threshold co-integration models, panel data approach and multivariate models including new variables (such as: real gross fixed capital formation, labor force, carbon dioxide emissions, population, exchange rates, interest rates, etc.). Thus, the authors should focus more on the new approaches and perspectives rather than by employing usual methods based on a set of common variables for different countries and different intervals of time.

Investigating job changes, we combine the advantages of recent panel studies, allowing us to control for unobserved heterogeneity of workers, and conventional cross-sectional estimations, which are less affected by measurement error. We find a VSL of 6.1 million euros from pooled cross-sectional estimation, 1.5 million euros from the first-differences panel model and 2.0 million euros from the job-changer specification. Thus, ignoring individual heterogeneity causes overestimates of the VSL, whereas the attenuation bias in panel data models leads to underestimates of the VSL Our results are less biased than former results and can be used to perform cost-benefit analyses of public projects aimed at reducing fatality risks, e.g., in the domains of environmental health,, or traffic policy.

We consider the diversification effect of wind power to reduce the risk of water inflow shortages, an important energy security concern for hydropower-based economic zones (e.g. Quebec and Norway). Our risk measure is based on the probability of a production deficit, in a manner akin to the value-atrisk, simulation analysis of financial portfolios. We examine whether the risk level of a mixed hydro-and-wind portfolio of generating assets improves on the risk of an all-hydro, portfolio, by relaxing the dependence on water inflows and attenuating the impact of droughts. Copulas are used to model the dependence between the two sources of energy. The data considered, over the period 1958-2003, are for the province of Quebec, which possesses large hydro and wind resources. Our results indicate that for all scenarios considered, any proportion of wind up to 30% improves the production deficit risk profile of an all-hydro, system. We can also estimate the value, in TW h, of any additional one percent of wind in the portfolio. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that the frequency of large blackouts in the United States has not decreased over time, that there is a statistically significant increase in blackout frequency during peak hours of the day and during late summer and mid-winter months (although non-storm-related risk is nearly constant through the year) and that there is strong statistical support for the previously observed power-law statistical relationship between blackout size and frequency. We do not find that blackout sizes and blackout durations are significantly correlated. These trends hold even after controlling for increasing demand and population and after eliminating small events, for which the data may be skewed by spotty reporting. Trends in blackout occurrences, such as those observed in the North American data, have important implications for those who make investment and policy decisions in the electricity industry. We provide a number of examples that illustrate how these trends can inform benefit-cost analysis calculations. Also, following procedures used in natural disaster planning we use the observed statistical trends to calculate the size of the 100-year blackout, which for North America is 186,000 MW.

Prior research contributes limited empirical evidence to this debate, and characterizing self-selection remains problematic. This empirical research explores the impacts of self-selection and proximity to transit at both residence and workplace. The research hypothesis is self-selection and proximity to transit increase the probability of workers commuting by rapid rail transit. To conduct this research, a station-exit passenger survey was conducted along the Taipei Rapid Transit System. Analysis methods include binomial logit modeling and sensitivity analysis. Research results support the idea that transit proximity to both work and residence increase the probability of transit commuting, but the hypothesis about the impact of self-selection is only partly supported. Policy implications suggest that, on one hand, increasing density around transit stations could realize unfulfilled self-selection; on the other hand, improved quality-of-life characteristics in neighborhoods around station areas may induce residents and companies to relocate to the neighborhood, thereby increasing residents' and workers' probabilities of commuting by transit.","Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Land Econ, Taipei 11605, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Tsai, YH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Land Econ, 64 Sec 2,ZhiNan Rd, Taipei 11605, Taiwan.",yhsin@nccu.edu.tw,,"TSAI, YU-HSIN/0000-0002-3675-685X",,,,,36,11,14,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Quantitatively, from the first half to the second half of the period 1985-2007 the average number of pipeline toll hearing days in Canada fell by three-quarters. On average, settlements last more than twice as long as litigated outcomes and have cut regulatory processing times by about one third for gas pipelines and by about two thirds for oil pipelines, with the result that regulatory processing times per effective toll-year have fallen to 13% and 27% respectively of previous levels. Qualitatively, settlements have been used to determine prices, operating and capital cost projections, return on equity, service quality improvements, risk-sharing investments and information requirements. They were the vehicle by which multi-year incentive agreements developed rapidly for all pipelines. They have also been used to introduce light-handed regulation. They have provided a mechanism for fruitful collaboration between pipelines and their customers and have changed attitudes in the industry. Two key actions of the National Energy Board have facilitated settlements by clarifying expectations and property rights: its generic cost of capital decision that removes the market power of the pipeline and enables effective negotiation with users, and its willingness to judge a settlement by the reasonableness of the process leading up to it instead of imposing the Board's own values on the outcome.

A public-private partnership-driven business model, with entrepreneurship at the core, is developed with institutional, financing and pricing mechanisms for diffusion of energy services. This approach, termed as EMPOWERS (entrepreneurship model for provision of wholesome energy-related basic services), if adopted, can facilitate large-scale dissemination of energy-efficient and renewable technologies like small-scale biogas/biofuel plants, and distributed power generation technologies to provide clean, safe, reliable and sustainable energy to rural households and urban poor.

Using this model, empirical results are presented for the optimal size of China's SPR and the best acquisition and drawdown strategies for a few specific cases. The results show that with comprehensive consideration, the optimal SPR size for China is around 320 million barrels. This size is equivalent to about 90 days of net oil import amount in 2006 and should be reached in the year 2017, three years earlier than the national goal, which implies that the need for China to fill the SPR is probably more pressing; the best stockpile release action in a disruption is related to the disruption levels and expected continuation probabilities. The information provided by the results will be useful for decision makers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The data are divided into two sets. The sub-data set I (1996-2004) are employed to develop empirical correlations between the monthly average of daily global solar radiation fraction (H/H-0) and various meteorological parameters. The nonlinear Angstrom type model developed by Sen and the trigonometric function model proposed by Bulut and Buyukalaca are also evaluated. New empirical constants for these two models have been obtained for Jeddah. The sub-data set 2 (2005, 2006) are then used to evaluate the derived correlations. Comparisons between measured and calculated values of H have been performed. It is indicated that, the Sen and Bulut and Buyukalaca models satisfactorily describe the horizontal global solar radiation for Jeddah. All the proposed correlations are found to be able to predict the annual average of daily global solar radiation with excellent accuracy.

This paper combines analysis of load and generation characteristics, generation adequacy and base and peak load variations to assess the future role of wind generation. A simulation of Tamil Nadu in India, with a high penetration of wind power (27% by installed capacity), shows a capacity credit of 22% of the installed wind capacity. For seasonal wind regimes like India, neither the capacity factor, nor the capacity credit reflects the monthly variation in the wind generation. A new approach based on the annual load duration curve has been proposed for generation expansion planning with higher penetration of wind. The potential savings in base and peak capacity required with increasing wind power have been quantified. A future scenario for Tamil Nadu for 2021 has been illustrated. It was found that 5500 MW of wind power can save 3200 MU of peak energy required or an average peak capacity of 2400 and 1100 MW of base capacity.

Further, we also include an additional simulation in which a hypothetical regional tax rate, to finance environmental policies, is considered. This second simulation assumes constant fiscal revenues. The results of the first simulation show that the effects of this tax are modest. The simulation shows household welfare losses, decreasing activity levels and generalised price reductions, except in production sectors more directly linked to the oil products sector.

The groundwork stage involves characterizing the social context, assessing available energy resources, identifying environmental issues, setting eco-resource limits, and quantifying socio-economic constraints for a given region. A spectrum of development options is then constructed according to the range of energy service levels identified for the sector under study. A spectrum of conceptual energy systems is generated and infrastructure investments and resource use are modeled. The outcome is a matrix of energy system investment possibilities for the range of energy demand levels reflecting the values, ideas, and expectations expressed by the community. These models are then used to assess technical feasibility and economic, environmental and social risk. The result is an easily understood graphical depiction of local aspirations, investment options, and risks which clearly differentiates development opportunities from non-viable concepts. The approach was applied to a case study on Rotuma, an isolated Pacific Island. The case study results show a clear development opportunity space for Rotuma where desired energy services are in balance with investment sources, resource availability, and environmental constraints.

Industrial motors account for a major segment of total industrial energy use. Since motors are the principle energy users, different energy savings strategies have been applied to reduce their energy consumption and associated emissions released into the atmosphere. These strategies include using highly efficient motors, variable speed drive (VSD), and capacitor banks to improve the power factor. It has been estimated that there can be a total energy savings of 1765, 2703 and 3605 MWh by utilizing energy-efficient motors for 50%, 75% and 100% loads, respectively. It was also found that for different motor loads, an estimated US$115,936 USS173,019 and US$230,693 can be saved in anticipated energy costs. Similarly, it is hypothesized that a significant amount of energy can be saved using VSD and capacitor banks to reduce speed and improve the power factor, thus cutting energy costs. Moreover, a substantial reduction in the amount of emissions can be effected together with the associated energy savings for different energy savings strategies. In addition, the payback period for different energy savings strategies has been found to be reasonable in some cases. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Saidur, R.; Jahirul, M.

Separating subclasses was necessary, since there are large differences between land and offshore fields, as well as between non-OPEC and OPEC fields. The evolution of decline rates over past decades includes the impact of new technologies and production techniques and clearly shows that the average decline rate for individual giant fields is increasing with time. These factors have significant implications for the future, since the most important world oil production base - giant fields - will decline more rapidly in the future, according to our findings.

Combinations of these are also considered. The model has a demand side perspective, considers both residential and service sectors, and calculates energy flows from net to delivered energy. Energy demand is given by the product of activity and intensity matrices. The activity levels are defined for the stock and the new construction, renovation and demolition flows. The intensity properties are defined in archetypes, and are the result of different energy class and heating carriers share options. The scenarios are shaped by combining the activity flows with different archetypes. The results show that adopting conservation measures on a large scale does allow reducing both electricity and total energy demand from present day levels while the building stock keeps growing. The results also highlight the importance of making a clear distinction between the assumptions on intensity and activity levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines the issue of the existence of the threshold effects in the relationship between oil revenues and output growth in oil-exporting countries, applying panel regressions. The empirical results strongly suggest the existence of a threshold beyond which oil revenues growth exerts a negative effect on output. The results indicate that the threshold of growth rate of oil revenues above which oil revenues significantly slows growth is around 18-19% for oil-exporting countries. In contrast, linear estimation without any allowance for threshold effects would misleadingly imply that an increase in the oil revenues increase the economic growth rate. Failure to account for nonlinearities conceal the resource curse in these countries particularly during extreme oil booms as suggested in previous studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A transition to a hydrogen-based economy could therefore potentially respond to climate, air quality. and energy security concerns. In a hydrogen economy, both mobile and stationary energy needs could be met through the reaction of hydrogen (H-2) with oxygen (O-2). This study applies a full fuel cycle approach to quantify the energy, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), and cost implications associated with a large transition to hydrogen in the United States. It explores a national and four metropolitan area transitions in two contrasting policy contexts: a business-as-usual (BAU) context with continued reliance on fossil fuels, and a GHG-constrained context with policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A transition in either policy context faces serious challenges, foremost among them from the highly inertial investments over the past century or so in technology and infrastructure based on petroleum, natural gas, and coal. A hydrogen transition in the USA could contribute to an effective response to climate change by helping to achieve deep reductions in GHG emissions by mid-century across all sectors of the economy; however, these reductions depend on the use of hydrogen to exploit clean, zero-carbon energy supply options.

Theoretical analysis of equalization and spatial location efficiency, Regional Studies. This paper shows that regional economies, such as federations or unitary countries with sub-national governments, may need a system of optimal inter-regional transfers to correct for various types of externalities related to factor mobility and location decisions. It is then argued that equalization schemes that take account of the differing expenditure and revenue needs of regions create a pattern of inter-regional transfers of income, but that they are inconsistent with what is required for spatial efficiency. Therefore, equalization is incompatible with the efficient spatial allocation of mobile factors of production. It is also shown that regions have an incentive to act strategically over equalization and distort their provision of local public goods.","Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6072, Australia",Curtin University,"Petchey, J (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6072, Australia.",Jeff.Petchey@cbs.curtin.edu.au,,,,,,,26,2,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

The emergence of low-cost carriers, following air travel re-regulation in Europe, has major implications for individual firms and regional economies. Understanding regions as 'economies of flows', the paper explores, largely conceptually, how uneven, fluctuating, and fragmentary changes in air travel and connectivity, resulting from the activities of low-cost carriers, have had substantial impacts on flows of labour migrants, knowledge, business connectivity/investment, and mobile markets, especially tourism. The resulting modifications to institutions and regional externalities contribute to net changes in the transaction costs of individual firms, regional competitiveness, and the unfolding and increasingly interconnected map of uneven regional development in Europe.","[Williams, Allan M.; Balaz, Vladimir] London Metropolitan Univ, Inst Study European Transformat, London N7 8DB, England; [Williams, Allan M.; Balaz, Vladimir] London Metropolitan Univ, Working Lives Res Inst, London N7 8DB, England; [Balaz, Vladimir] Inst Forecasting, Bratislava, Slovakia",London Metropolitan University; London Metropolitan University; Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Williams, AM (通讯作者)，London Metropolitan Univ, Inst Study European Transformat, 160-220 Holloway Rd, London N7 8DB, England.",Allan.Williams@londonmet.ac.uk; vbalaz@yahoo.com,"Baláž, Vladimír/R-9416-2016","Baláž, Vladimír/0000-0002-8132-3789",,,,,72,45,47,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

On the basis of the incentive theories and the information sharing model, we discuss the revenue equilibrium in supply chain inventory management and hold that designing an incentive mechanism to motivate the partners to share their true information is extremely important. By analyzing the three kinds of equilibrium from the perspective of different information sharing level, we present pricing discount, orders incentive, buy-back, cross shareholding and fair revenue distribution as practical ways to motivate the members to share their information with other partners.","[Yuan, Qi] Lixin Univ Commerce, Sch Business Adm, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Qiong, Zhang] Shanghai Univ, Sch Sociol, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance; Shanghai University,"Yuan, Q (通讯作者)，Lixin Univ Commerce, Sch Business Adm, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",nikkeshu@126.com; Happyzhang269@126.com,"Qiong, Zhang/JDV-9691-2023",,,,,,18,0,0,0,12,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,373,+,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.150,0.0,,,2,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BLA43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269752000091,0

Then, a benefits-centric Multi-Participant Trust Architecture (abbr.

From both the environmental and the equity component of sustainability, a comparison of accessibility by car versus public transport is of utmost importance. However, most studies in this direction have used rather rough estimates of travel time, especially by public transport. In this paper, we present Urban.Access, an ArcGIS extension for estimating car-based and transit-based accessibility to employment and other land uses. Urban.Access enables a detailed representation of travel times by transit and car and thus makes it possible to adequately compare accessibility levels by transport mode. The application of Urban.Access to the Tel Aviv metropolitan area shows that the gaps between car-based and transit-based accessibility are larger than those found in other studies. We argue that this is not the result of a poorer transit system, but rather of a more detailed description of travel by transit in the Urban.Access application. The larger gaps point to a greater need for adequate policy responses, both for reducing car dependence as well as for creating a more equitable transport system. Hence, we uphold that an adequate representation of transit travel times is more than a scientific matter-it is a matter of great social importance.","[Benenson, Itzhak; Kwartler, Ariela] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Geog & Human Environm, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Martens, Karel] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Rofe, Yodan] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Beer Sheva, Israel",Tel Aviv University; Radboud University Nijmegen; Ben Gurion University,"Benenson, I (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Geog & Human Environm, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",bennya@post.tau.ac.il; k.martens@fm.ru.nl; yrofe@bgu.ac.il,"Martens, Karel/G-5988-2011; ROFE, YODAN/F-1895-2012; Benenson, Itzhak/R-3666-2016","ROFE, YODAN/0000-0003-2655-0839; Benenson, Itzhak/0000-0003-0704-0673; Martens, Karel/0000-0002-5690-0556",,,,,23,108,120,2,66,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Starting from the data collected in a paper survey, we analyse the extent of the constraint experienced by households in terms of equipment purchasing behaviour and daily energy consumption. This analysis shows that the least well-off households are particularly constrained since the share of their budget represented by these energy services is very large (15-25%), and this corresponds to a level of energy service well below that of the better-off households. The case of space-heating shows a factor of 2 in terms of level of comfort achieved between the extreme 10-percentiles. These households also face a strong capital constraint for equipment purchases. This leads either to a large increase in the required rate of return or to a reduction in the proportion of households that are prepared to replace their equipment earlier. The least well-off households are thus doubly constrained, since it is more difficult for them to invest.

Based on it, we analyse combinations of the proposed emission reduction ranges for Annex I countries as a group (25-40% below 1990 levels) and non-Annex I as a group (15-30% below baseline) by 2020 to limit global warming to 2 degrees C. We use results of the FAIR model with costs estimates based on two energy system models. We conclude that the range of targets that comply with a set of criteria for economic, political and environmental considerations is smaller than that by environmental considerations alone. More specifically, we find that according to our criteria, a 30% Annex I reduction target below 1990 levels, combined with a 20% non-Annex I reduction target below baseline emission levels (i.e. 20 to 30% above 2005 levels), is the only combination of targets fulfilling all our criteria for both energy system models. Otherwise, reaching the 2 degrees C target becomes less likely, technically infeasible, or non-Annex I abatement costs are likely to exceed those of Annex I, a result, which we consider less plausible from a political viewpoint in our conceptual framework.

The power authority structure is an American 20th century institution for managing energy resources-a form of a public authority or public corporation dedicated to creating, operating and maintaining electric generation and transmission infrastructure. Offshore wind power is characterized by high capital costs but no fuel costs and thus low operating costs. Therefore a power authority, by virtue of its access to low-cost capital and managerial flexibility, could facilitate offshore wind power development by reducing financial risk of developing and lowering debt payments, thus improving the risk profile and lowering the cost of electricity production. Additionally, power authorities can be made up of multiple states, thus opening the possibility for joint action by neighboring coastal states. Using primary and secondary data, we undertake an in-depth analysis of the potential benefits and shortcomings of a power authority approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

While historical transitions between major energy sources have occurred, most of these shifts lasted over a century or longer and were stimulated by resource scarcity, high labor costs, and technological innovations. The energy transition of the 21st century will need to be more rapid. Unfortunately, little is known about how to accelerate energy transitions. This article reviews past transitions and factors behind them, along with their time frames. Three modern case studies are discussed: Brazil, which shifted from an oil-based transportation system to one based on sugarcane-ethanol (success): France, which shifted from oil-fired electric power to nuclear power (success): and the United States, which attempted to shift from foreign oil to a mix of domestic energy resources (failure). Lessons from these attempts to govern energy transitions are discussed. Several policy instruments to accelerate a transition are identified, though even under ideal circumstances a global energy supply transition will be very slow. Given the need to simultaneously implement programs in countries with different political economies, a greater focus on energy efficiency, promotion of Smart Grids, and possibly a new treaty should yield more timely results.

In the DEA method more than one unit are identified as efficient. Therefore, this study suggests a method for ranking the efficient units by their importance as benchmarks for the inefficient units through benchmark share measure. The bigger the benchmark share, the more important an efficient division is in benchmarking for inefficient ones. Result reveals that plain area divisions are relatively efficient and have higher potential to influence the performance of inefficient EDDs.

As a result, excess wind electricity has to be rejected in the nighttime low demand hours, when the wind power is ramping up. To compensate for the fluctuation of wind power, new coal-fired power plants are being constructed along with the big wind projects in the North China grids. This study analyzed why adding coal-fired generation cannot remove the bottleneck of wind integration by modeling the operating problem of the wind integration. The peak-load adjusting factor of the regional grid is defined. Building more coal-fired power plants will not increase the adjusting factor of the current grid. Although it does help to increase the total integrated wind power in the short term, it will add difficulties to the long-term wind integration. Alternatively, the coordinated resource utilization is then suggested with the discussion of both the effective pumped hydro storage and the potential electric vehicle storage. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyze what these changes could entail for electricity generation in the United States under four climate policy scenarios that involve different costs for emitting CO2 and different technology options for reducing emissions out to the year 2030. The potential impacts of the scenarios on the U.S. electric system are modeled using a modified version of the U.S. National Energy Modeling System and water-use factors for thermoelectric power plants derived from electric utility data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Under all the climate-policy scenarios, freshwater withdrawals decline 2-14% relative to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario of no U.S. climate policy. Furthermore, water use decreases as the price on CO2 under the climate policies increases. At relatively high carbon prices ( > $50/tonne CO2), however, retrofitting coal plants to capture CO2 increases freshwater consumption compared to BAU in 2030. Our analysis suggests that climate policies and a carbon price will reduce both electricity generation and freshwater withdrawals compared to BAU unless a substantial number of coal plants are retrofitted to capture CO2.

The development of the industry has the potential to improve the rural environment and produce significant amounts of sustainable energy for China. Barriers to the development are the relatively weak environmental policies, imperfect financial policies and lack of long-term follow-up services. The rapid economic development of China has also seen a development in the scales of biogas plants constructed. Although the technology has been improved, this review has identified problems in the construction and operation of Chinese biogas plants, particularly in the efficiency of household systems. All levels of China's government acknowledge this and recent biogas projects have more focus on quality and less on the quantity. The intention is to gradually introduce stricter environmental policies, to provide better service systems, improve the financial policies that support the construction and follow-up service of biogas projects, promote the use of standardized engineering equipment and materials and standards for plant construction and production. This will promote the development of biogas projects at various scales further, and reduce the dependency on fossil fuels and emissions of greenhouse gases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The first part of the paper gives an overview of several mandatory GHG trading schemes around the world. The second part focuses on the future trends in carbon trading. It argues that the emergence of new schemes, a gradual enlargement of the current ones, and willingness to link existing and planned schemes seem to point towards geographical, temporal and sectoral expansion of emissions trading. However, such expansion would need to overcome some considerable technical and non-technical obstacles. Linking of the current and emerging trading schemes requires not only considerable technical fixes and harmonisation of different trading systems, but also necessitates clear regulatory and policy signals, continuing political support and a more stable economic environment. Currently, the latter factors are missing. The global economic turmoil and its repercussions for the carbon market, a lack of the international deal on climate change defining the Post-Kyoto commitments, and unfavourable policy shifts in some countries, cast serious doubts on the expansion of emissions trading and indicate that carbon trading enters an uncertain period.

Mustafa",,,Political institutions of electricity regulation: The case of Turkey,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity regulation; Regulatory governance; Institutions,FOUNDATIONS,"Turkey has been going through a liberalization process in its electricity market over the last decade. So far, the regulatory content of the market reforms has been in the center of attention in the literature, to the negligence of regulatory governance. However, recent studies, which applied the theoretical insights of new institutional economics to utilities regulation, have demonstrated that political endowments of the country draw the boundaries to which extent such regulatory content can be effectively implemented. In line with these studies, this paper adopts an institutional approach and attempts to identify the political endowments of Turkey in order to further analyze whether the market reforms succeeded in bringing about sufficient checks to cure the institutional problems. In other words, the paper takes a picture of the overall regulatory arena. The results show that the current regulatory structure, especially government-regulator relations, yet fails to meet good regulatory governance criteria. The paper also provides some policy suggestions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Incorporating the role of storage into current scenario tools is challenging, because it requires high temporal resolution to reflect the effects of intermittent sources on system balancing. This study draws on results from a model with such resolution. It concludes that large scale storage could become economically viable for scenarios with high penetration of renewables. As the proportion of intermittent sources increases, the optimal type of storage shifts towards solutions with low energy related costs, even at the expense of efficiency. However, a range of uncertainties have been identified, concerning storage technology development, the regulatory environment, alternatives to storage and the stochastic uncertainty of year-on-year revenues. All of these negatively affect the cost of finance and the chances of successful market uptake. We argue, therefore, that, if the possible wider system and social benefits from the presence of storage are to be achieved, stronger and more strategic policy support may be necessary. More work on the social and system benefits of storage is needed to gauge the appropriate extent of support measures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To analyse these effects a simulation model is used. We model the car fleet from a bottom-up perspective, with a detailed coverage of vehicle specifications and propulsion technologies. The model focuses on the technological trend toward electrified propulsion systems and their potential effects on the fleet's energy consumption and GHG emissions. To represent the impact of prices and income on the development of the fleet, we combine the fleet model with top-down demand models. We developed two scenarios for the time frame 2010-2050, using two different sets of assumptions for regulatory development and conditions of increasing fossil fuel prices and continuous technological progress in vehicle propulsion technologies. The results indicate that material cuts in energy consumption and GHG emissions can be achieved with changes to the political framework for passenger cars. Appropriate taxation of fuels and cars can stabilise demand for individual motorised transport and lead to an improvement in vehicle efficiency by fostering the adoption of efficient vehicle propulsion technologies and low carbon fuels.

We estimate the determinants of product innovations differing in their degree of newness to the adopting firm. Knowledge spillovers from rivals have a positive impact on incremental innovations. This impact is largely independent of participation in R&D cooperation. Spillovers exert no such independent influence on drastic innovation activities. The results support the hypothesis that establishments face difficulties in using knowledge that comes from areas they are not familiar with. Establishments exploit spillovers for incremental innovations rather than for drastic innovations. To some degree R&D cooperation can help to overcome the difficulties in using spillovers for drastic innovations. Furthermore, our estimates provide evidence that the firm's own R&D effort and the use of outside information are substitutes.","[Jirjahn, Uwe] Univ Trier, Fachbereich 4, Lehrstuhl Arbeitsmarktokon, D-54286 Trier, Germany; [Kraft, Kornelius] Tech Univ Dortmund, Lehrstuhl Wirtschaftspolit, Dortmund, Germany",Universitat Trier; Dortmund University of Technology,"Jirjahn, U (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Fachbereich 4, Lehrstuhl Arbeitsmarktokon, Univ Ring 15, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",jirjahn@uni-trier.de; kornelius.kraft@tu-dortmund.de,"Jirjahn, Uwe/W-9001-2019",,,,,,55,27,30,4,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

Main drivers in this development are the technical and economic advantages of natural gas. It is a clean, versatile, and easily controllable fuel. On this basis, natural gas is often considered the form of energy that will be the bridging fuel to a sustainable energy system, sometime after 2050. Unlike other main sources of energy, such as oil and coal, gas is not traded on an actual world market.

The study finds balanced collaboration with domestic partner regions and developing countries is preferred in the case of collaboration, given that the unit cost of collaboration is assumed lower than that of no collaboration. Appreciation of benefits such as technology transfer and local environmental improvement in developing countries increases the preference of collaboration with developing countries. Two factors hinder Japanese local governments' collaboration with developing countries from the perspective of citizens: a sense of environmental responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the city and a preference for domestic orientation even if the collaboration with developing countries is less costly and has benefits of technology transfer and local environmental improvement. The preference for a lower total cost of GHG emissions reductions is confirmed except for those with a sense of environmental responsibility. The study also finds that provision of information on mitigation projects and co-benefits would increase the preference for interregional collaboration with developing countries depending on the types of collaborative project, except for those with a sense of environmental responsibility.

No one knows precisely where or in what volume ethanol is being blended with gasoline and this has important implications for motor fuels markets: Because refiners cannot perfectly predict where ethanol will be blended with finished gasoline by wholesalers, they cannot know when to produce and where to ship a blendstock that when mixed with ethanol at 10% would create the most economically efficient finished motor gasoline that meets engine standards and has comparable evaporative emissions as conventional gasoline without ethanol blending. In contrast to previous empirical analyses of biofuels that have relied on highly aggregated data, our analysis is disaggregated to the level of individual wholesale fuel terminals or racks (of which there are about 350 in the US). We incorporate the price of ethanol as well as the blendstock price to model the wholesaler's decision of whether or not to blend additional ethanol into gasoline at any particular wholesale city-terminal. The empirical analysis illustrates how ethanol and gasoline prices affect ethanol usage, controlling for fuel specifications, blend attributes, and city-terminal-specific effects that, among other things, control for differential costs of delivering ethanol from bio-refinery to wholesale rack.

Despite this growing interest, the global ethanol market is still incipient because of the small number of producing countries, the lack of technical standardization and the existence of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. New laws have taken effect in 2010 in the United States and the European Union imposing domestic requirements for sustainable production of ethanol. Although these are generally positive developments, they can create greater difficulties for the development of an international ethanol market. This work examines the technical barriers posed by these new laws and how they can be resolved under the auspices of the World Trade Organization.

Using data from the 2003 Survey of Household Energy Use, we look at the extent to which split incentives that result from bill-paying arrangements affect a variety of activities including the setting of temperatures at various times of the day and the use of eco-friendly options in basic household tasks. Findings suggest that these split incentives do indeed impact some aspects of occupant behaviour, with households who do not pay directly for their heat opting for increased thermal comfort and being less sensitive to whether or not somebody is at home and the severity of the climate when deciding on temperature settings. Regardless of who pays for utilities. Canadian households who live in multi-family dwellings are generally unresponsive to fuel prices. Our empirical results suggest the possibility of environmental benefits from policies aimed at improving energy-efficiency in this sector, especially if targeted at reducing the impacts of the behaviour of those who do not pay directly for energy use.

By adapting the ADVISOR (Advanced Vehicle Simulator) software to evaluate vehicle efficiency, and by estimating the Brazilian light-duty vehicle market share based on historical data, this paper estimates the possible levels of GHG emissions and area planted with sugarcane in 2030 in the country. The findings indicate that reductions from 8% to 20% in greenhouse gas emissions and 0.9-1.8 million ha in sugarcane planted area are possible with no significant technological breakthroughs over the horizon to 2030 in comparison with a baseline scenario.

Their introduction has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector, which has led to government policies aimed at easing their introduction. If their widespread adoption is set as a target it is imperative to consider the effects of existing policies that may increase or decrease their adoption rate. In this study, we present a micro level electricity demand model that can gauge the effects of PHEVs on household electricity consumption and the subsequent economic attractiveness of the vehicles. We show that the electricity pricing policy available to the consumer is a very significant factor in the economic competitiveness of PHEVs. Further analysis shows that the increasing tier electricity pricing system used in California will substantially blunt adoption of PHEVs in the state: and time of use electricity pricing will render PHEVs more economically attractive in any state.

While massive investments are anticipated and planners and developers are scouting for viable locations and consider risk and impact, few studies simultaneously address potentials and costs together with the consequences of proposed planning in an analytical and continuous manner and for larger areas at once. Consequences may be investments short of efficiency and equity, and failed planning routines. A spatial resource economic model for the Danish offshore waters is presented, used to analyse area constraints, technological risks, priorities for development and opportunity costs of maintaining competing area uses. The SCREAM-offshore wind model (Spatially Continuous Resource Economic Analysis Model) uses raster-based geographical information systems (GIS) and considers numerous geographical factors, technology and cost data as well as planning information. Novel elements are weighted visibility analysis and geographically recorded shipping movements as variable constraints. A number of scenarios have been described, which include restrictions of using offshore areas, as well as alternative uses such as conservation and tourism. The results comprise maps, tables and cost-supply curves for further resource economic assessment and policy analysis. A discussion of parameter variations exposes uncertainties of technology development, environmental protection as well as competing area uses and illustrates how such models might assist in ameliorating public planning, while procuring decision bases for the political process. The method can be adapted to different research questions, and is largely applicable in other parts of the world. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article the method of Constant Market Share Analysis is used to analyze the impact of changes in the structure of FDI by 15 sectors of economy to the value-added growth in Latvia, during the period from 2000 to 2007. It was concluded that until FDI changes occurs within the three broader sectors of economy (primary, manufacturing and services sectors), negative effect on the overall value-added growth is not observed.

First, we estimate and forecast the Chinese demand for coal using panel data disaggregated by provinces and accounting for spatial heterogeneity. Second, given the spatial nature of the data, we explicitly capture the spatial autocorrelation among provinces using spatial econometrics. In particular, we specify the Chinese industrial coal demand at provincial level with fixed-effect spatial models. The empirical results show that the fixed-effect spatial ADL model is able to capture the existing interdependence between provinces.

To accomplish this, we use a forest sector model that includes the suppliers and major users of roundwood. The econometric results, based on a data set that spans 40 years, show that all the own price elasticities have the expected signs. Among the three forestry products, the supply and (long-term) demand of forest fuel seems to be most sensitive to a price change. In a second step, the estimated model is used to simulate the effect of increased forest conservation - the Sustainable Forest objective - on the supply of wood fuel. If oil is used as a substitute, Swedish emissions of greenhouse gases will increase by almost 0.92 percent, which indicates a clear conflict with the Reduced Climate Impact objective.

The analysis is based on data of the EU ETS for the period 2005-2007 (Phase l). The scope of this study comprises the European glass industry as a whole and its seven subsectors. The analysis is based on an assignment of the glass installations (ca. 450) within the EU ETS to the corresponding subsectors and an adequate matching of the respective production volumes. A result is the assessment of the overall final energy consumption (fuel, electricity) as well as the overall CO2 emissions (process, combustion and indirect emissions) of the glass industry and its subsectors in the EU25/27. Moreover, figures on fuel mix as well as fuel intensity and CO2 emissions intensity (i.e. carbon intensity) are presented for each of the subsectors on aggregated levels and for selected EU Member States separately. The average intensity of fuel consumption and direct CO2 emissions of the EU25 glass industry decreased from 2005 to 2007 by about 4% and amounted in 2007 to 7.8 GJ and 0.57 t(CO2) per tonne of saleable product, respectively.

Typically for the federal political system in Switzerland, the elements of the energy policy field are shaped by the principle of subsidiarity. The aim is that cantons promote innovative problem solutions and regionally adapted implementation. For this reason, policy differences between cantons are large and create a need for coordination. More concretely, I will analyze the impact of inter-cantonal institutions on different innovations in the field of energy policy. The research question is approached with an event history analysis on three different innovative measures in the Swiss cantons from 1990 to 2007. A more comprehensive picture of diffusion in one policy field is drawn with this approach. The main contribution of this paper is the finding that intergovernmental institutions promote diffusion in one policy field only for measures with certain characteristics. The internal determinants are therefore not a sufficient explanation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The most important issues determining the mid- and long-term future for domestic coal production are. (1) the development of the economy, hence the demand for electricity, (2) regulations (mostly environmental) affecting the power sector, (3) the competitiveness of coal-based technologies, and (4) the costs of domestic coal production. Since the range of issues and relations being considered is very broad, a specific method needs to be employed for the quantitative analysis. The tool applied in this study is the partial equilibrium model POWER-POL. in which both the coal and the power sectors are incorporated. The model focuses on energy-economy-environmental issues without capturing detailed macroeconomic links The model was run under six scenario assumptions The results show that the domestic coal sector should maintain its position as a key supplier of primary energy for the Polish power sector However, the environmental regulations to which the domestic power sector has to conform will decrease the share of coal in the fuel-mix. Since the investment processes in this sector are usually long-term, the effects of changes will be noticeable from 2015 onwards. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

PCT is a radical policy proposal which would entail all adults receiving an equal, tradable carbon allowance to cover emissions from household energy and/or personal travel. The allowance would reduce over time, in line with national emissions reduction goals. The government's key concerns about PCT were its social unacceptability and high cost. This paper reviews the literature and identifies knowledge gaps, and then discusses whether these concerns are justified. Contrary to the government's conclusions, most research shows PCT to be at least as socially acceptable as an alternative taxation policy. People think it could be both fair and effective. Set-up and running costs for PCT will undoubtedly be higher than for alternative taxation policies. However, PCT-could deliver benefits from individual and social change motivated by non-economic aspects of the policy. These potential benefits are outlined here. The conclusion is that PCT is a promising and timely policy idea. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on procedures of power systems planning and operation, actors are identified whose operational activities will be affected by PHEV integration. Potential changes and challenges in the actors' long- and short term planning activities are discussed. Further, a PHEV operation state description is developed which defines vehicle operation states from the power system point of view integrating uncontrolled, controlled recharging and vehicle to grid (V2G) utilization in one single framework. Future PHEV managing entities, such as aggregators, can use this framework for planning and operation activities including load management and V2G.

The focus is to find out areas and stations which are contributing more to the total emissions from all thermal power generating stations in the country and identify the overall trends that are emerging.

Discovering the location and extent of infestation before the invasive species causes widespread damage typically requires intensive monitoring efforts. In this paper, we analyze the problem of controlling an invasive species when there is imperfect information about the degree of infestation. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process in which the decision-maker receives an imperfect signal about the level of infestation. The decision-maker then chooses a management action to minimize expected costs based on beliefs about the level of infestation. We apply this model to a simple application with three possible levels of infestation where the decision-maker can choose to take no action, only monitor, only treat, or do both monitoring and treatment jointly. We solve for optimal management as a function of beliefs about the level of infestation. For a case with positive monitoring and treatment costs, we find that the optimal policy involves choosing no action when there is a sufficiently large probability of no infestation, monitoring alone with intermediate probability values and treatment alone when the probability of moderate or high infestation is large. We also show how optimal management and expected costs change as the cost or quality of information from monitoring changes. With costless and perfect monitoring, expected costs are 20-30% lower across the range of belief states relative to the expected costs without monitoring.

As part of its contribution to the G8 Gleneagles Plan of Action, the IEA has been developing in-depth indicators tools that provide data and analysis of energy use and efficiency trends. This paper gives an overview of the IEA indicator methodology and presents examples of how disaggregated indicators can be used to identify the factors that drive and restrain energy demand at the end-use level. A decomposition approach is also used to separate efficiency effects from the impacts of structure and activity. The results clearly show the important role that energy efficiency has played in shaping trends in final energy use in TEA countries for more than 30 years. However, the analysis also reveals that recent gains in energy efficiency have been much lower than in earlier decades. Accelerating energy efficiency improvements is therefore a crucial challenge for IEA governments and indicators have an important role to play in helping to develop and evaluate the policies that will be required.

The varying nature of gas and electric power flows, network support facilities such as gas storage and compressors, and the power ramping characteristics of various power plants were considered. Three case studies were modelled, one case uses the existing network and the other two Make use of a hypothesised network in 2020 with two distinct levels of wind generation representing low and high wind periods. The simulation results show that a large penetration of wind generation will influence the electricity generation mix as the wind power varies. Gas-fired generation is used to compensate for wind variability. This will cause increased flows and compressor power consumption on the gas network.

However, the bottleneck lies in the lack of long-term, stable, sufficient and gradually increasing funds to flow into DSM projects. The author redesigns the practical 'system benefit charge (SBC)' policy, which will provide long-term and stable funding for DSM, the policy to facilitate the financial support from banking sector and capital market, and investigates the possibility of DSM funding from CDM projects. SBC is the best way to boost long-term stable and sufficient funding for DSM at present in China. The current low inflation rate and natural resource price are favored to expedite the implementation of SBC and DSM developments. With regard to the uneven development, China needs to design relative policies to offset the impact in different areas, such as tax reduction and fiscal subsides. It is time for China to develop a definite and clear target and timetable to implement DSM, which will give the public and enterprises a definite and clear expectation for the future. The government should publicize a clear and integrated DSM development plan and relative policy outline in the near, medium, and long term. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Fulfilling both objectives was not possible. The nuclear plants were withdrawn from the sale and plans to build new plants were abandoned, but privatisation proceeded. In 2007, the Labour government began a new attempt to build nuclear plants to operate in the competitive electricity market, promising that no subsidies would be offered to them. By 2010, the utilities that were planning to build nuclear plants were beginning to suggest that 'support' in some form would be needed if they were to build new plants. More surprisingly, the energy regulator, Ofgem, cast doubt on whether a competitive wholesale electricity market would provide security of supply. In 1990, the UK government opted for a competitive electricity market over expanding nuclear power. Now, the option of opting for a competitive electricity market may not exist. However, this might not leave the way open for new nuclear plants. The expected cost of power from new nuclear plants is now so high that no more than one or two heavily subsidised plants will be built. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The fuel policies pursued by governmental or civil authorities are of key importance in the success of alternative fuel use, especially for widespread and efficient use. Following the 1973 petroleum crisis, many users in Turkey, especially in transportation sector, searched for alternative fuels and forms of transportation. Gasoline engines were replaced with diesel engines between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s. In addition, natural gas was introduced to the Turkish market for heating in the early 1990s. Liquid petroleum gas was put into use in the mid-1990s, and bio-diesel was introduced into the market for transportation in 2003. However, after long periods of indifference governmental action, guidance and fuel policies were so weak that they did not make sense.

However, rural electrification offered little by way of market incentives for profit-seeking private companies and was often neglected. As a consequence, delivery models for rural electrification need to change. This paper will review the experiences of various rural electrification delivery models that have been established in developing countries, including concessionary models, dealership approaches and the strengthening of small and medium-sized energy businesses. It will use examples from the USA, Bangladesh and Nepal, together with a detailed case study of a Nepali rural electric cooperative, to explore the role that local cooperatives can play in extending electricity access. It is shown that although there is no magic bullet solution to deliver rural electrification, if offered appropriate financial and institutional support, socially orientated cooperative businesses can be a willing, efficient and effective means of extending and managing rural electricity services. It is expected that this paper will be of particular value to policy-makers, donors, project planners and implementers currently working in the field of rural electrification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The article analyzed the factors that contributed to the emergence of the above phenomena and discussed its consequences. The factors that led to the drop in energy intensiveness with respect to FER includes the rising electrification of the fuel mix, improvements in energy end-use efficiency (partly induced by government policy), and changes in the structure of the Hong Kong economy. With respect to the decline in PER energy intensiveness, the following aspects are pertinent: the share of electricity consumption accounted for by nuclear imports, the efficiency of electricity generation in Hong Kong (partly determined by the type of fuels used) and losses due to transmission and distribution as well as station consumption (system losses). The decline in energy intensiveness is good to Hong Kong, both in terms of the economy and the environment. Its ramifications will be briefly discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve rational, efficient and clean use of energy, together with improved environmental quality within the city, the Shanghai municipal government has decided to expand the supply and utilization of natural gas. Shanghai plans to increase the share of natural gas in its primary energy mix to 7 per cent by 2010, up from 3 per cent in 2005. This increase in natural gas demand has to be matched with a corresponding increase in supply. To date, the Shanghai region has relied on offshore extracted natural gas but this supply is limited due to the size of the reserves. Since 2005, the West-East pipeline has provided an alternative for Shanghai but demands from other regions could reduce the potential for expanding supplies from that source. Since domestic production will not be sufficient to meet demand in the near future, Shanghai is building a liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification terminal at the Yangshan deep-water port that would allow an additional supply of more than 3 billion cubic meters per year of natural gas. Malaysia has already committed to supply LNG to the Shanghai terminal at a price that is significantly higher than the wholesale city-gate price for natural gas transported via pipeline, but still lower than the gas price to end-use consumers. The presence of both an LNG terminal and a transmission pipeline that connects Shanghai to domestic gas-producing regions will create gas-on-gas competition. This study assesses the benefits of introducing such competition to one of China's most advanced cities under various scenarios for demand growth. In this paper, the impact of imported LNG on market concentration in Shanghai's gas market will be analysed using the Herfindahl-Hirschmann index (HHI) and the residual supply index (RSI). Our results show that Shanghai remains a supply-constrained gas market that will continue to rely upon gas supplies from the western provinces and imported LNG. After 2017, the gas market in Shanghai can be regarded as unconcentrated since its HHI fall below 1800 under a very high growth scenario. In terms of RSI, the gas market can be considered competitive at low, moderate and high growth consumption between 2012 and 2015. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Second, we provide the first formal analysis of the creative capital accumulation decision faced by individuals in this regional economy and we compute the optimal length of time during which creative capital is accumulated. Next, we determine the relative return to creative capital and we use this return to conduct comparative statics exercises with our model's four parameters.

J,"Cole, S",,,,"Cole, Sam",,,"The regional portfolio of disruptions, protection, and disasters",ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper explains and implements a portfolio-based framework for analyzing the progression and consequences of disruptions to small-region economies. The first section discusses the underlying relationship between hazards, events, protection, disruptions, and disasters in regional economic systems. Such systems typically are adaptive in that they constantly adjust their levels and patterns of protection and compensation to changes in the frequency and magnitude of disruptions. The section explains how portfolio theory may be re-conceptualized to address policy choices related to the above issues. The second section explains conceptual issues in defining variables and specifying the production function balancing performance and protection. This function in turn defines the optimal expenditure for each actor against which their risk-tolerance is measured. Potential tipping points from singularly large or cascaded shocks, including disruptions from lumpy investment, suggest disaster-mitigating strategies that maximize societal utility or reduce tendencies to major disaster. In the third section, this theory is implemented empirically as a computer simulation model for a stylized open economy driven by tourism and oil refining. The simulations show how the potential for major disruptions varies with policy, increasing rapidly with the risk-propensity of policy makers. They also suggest how appropriate regional economic policy, notably rebalancing and export portfolio and rescheduling major investments, might reduce the likelihood of such events.","SUNY Buffalo, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Cole, S (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA.",samcole@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,47,5,5,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The total installed electric capacity will be optimally expanded from 6885 to 19500 MW in 2030. Furthermore, to ensure supply security the future national energy system will rely mainly upon oil and natural gas (NG) with limited contribution of renewables and nuclear to the end of study period. The share of NG will increase gradually up to 2020 and then retreat. Owing to the continuous decrease of oil production, oil export is expected to vanish in 2012 and the country will import about 63% of its primary energy demand in 2030.

It starts out to discuss the contextual connotations of notions of 'energy security' in medium to long-term time frames and reviews some indicators that have been proposed to quantify it. Special attention is paid to two of these approaches, which the authors helped to develop, i.e. diversity-based indices and the Supply/Demand Index. The paper takes issue with conventional welfare economic approaches that neglect: (i) the scope on the demand side for raising security and (ii) negative feedback mechanisms of socio-political impacts of international rent transfers in fossil fuels exporting countries. The concept of energy services security is proposed with a demand-side focus. This enables application of an integrated approach to gauge the resilience of a society to meet the needs of its population for energy services over longer timescales ahead from various interrelated perspectives. Propositions are made on the attribution of security externalities to the use of fossil fuels, policies, and suggestions for further improvements of measures for energy services security.

First, we conceptually discuss the issue of energy supply security and explain why it is not to handle by one science alone and what economics may contribute in order to structure the topic. After providing a brief survey of existing attempts to define or measure energy security we suggest an additional dimension along which indicators of energy security may be classified: ex-post and ex-ante indicators. Finally, we illustrate our concept on the basis of several simplified indicators. While ex-post indicators are mostly based on price developments, exante indicators are to a greater extent aimed at illustrating potential problems. Our illustration suggests that it is worthwhile to take into account the market structure along with the political stability of exporting countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To EU policy makers such blackouts revealed the fragility of Europe's power grids and the need of a more centralized form of governance, thus legitimizing recent EU interventions. Yet to power sector spokespersons, these events confirmed the reliability of transnational power grids and the traditional decentralized governance model: the disturbances were quickly contained and repaired. This paper inquires the historic legacies at work in these conflicting interpretations and associated transnational governance preferences. It traces the power sector's interpretation to its building of a secure transnational power grid from the 1950s through the era of neoliberalization. Next it places the EU interpretation and associated policy measures against the historical record of EU attempts at transnational infrastructure governance. Uncovering the historical roots and embedding of both interpretations, we conclude that their divergence is of a surprisingly recent date and relates to the current era of security thinking. Finally we recommend transnational, interpretative, and historical analysis to the field of critical infrastructure studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, however, the magnitude of energy savings associated with CFLs has been called into question. Specifically, recent findings suggest an interactive effect associated with the replacement of incandescent light bulbs with CFLs in the residential sector. In this scenario, the reduced wattage of CFLs, relative to incandescent bulbs, generates less heat, which in turn, requires additional natural gas usage during the heating season. Engineering studies suggest the magnitude of the effect is significant in energy terms, which implies that the energy savings associated with CFLs may be significantly overstated. In this paper, we use billing analysis to test for the presence of interactive effects. Our analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset that includes monthly household electricity and natural gas usage, the number of CFL bulbs installed, the installation date, and a set of household characteristics. Our results suggest that CFLs do indeed save electricity. However, we do not find any support for the hypothesis that CFLs cause increased usage of natural gas. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents lessons learned from the introduction of solar LED lanterns in rural Malawi. We discuss a market-based program using new and existing local commercial structures such as vendors and cooperatives to sell lanterns to village households without subsidy. The paper addresses issues of enterprise development, community interactions, and survey data on lighting use and expenditure patterns before and after LED lantern introduction. Households that purchased a lantern reported high levels of satisfaction with the LED lanterns as well as savings in annual kerosene expenditure comparable to the price of the lantern. These households also reported monthly incomes comparable to the price of the LED lanterns whereas non-adopters surveyed reported monthly incomes about half this level, suggesting a need for financing options to maximize adoption among poorer populations in rural areas. These results suggest that similar market based models of LED lighting technology dissemination have the potential to be replicated and scaled up in other off-grid regions in developing countries. However, viability of local cooperatives and supply chains for lantern products over the medium-to-long term remain to be assessed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to encouraging renewable energy, smart grid, clean fuels and other technologies, the United States will need to make substantial infrastructure investments in a variety of industries. Among the significant contributors to the current carbon footprint in the United States is the use of coal as a major fuel for the generation of electricity. One of the most important technologies that the United States can employ to reduce its carbon footprint is to sequester the carbon dioxide (CO2) from coal-fired power plants. This article focuses on the legal and policy issues surrounding a critical piece of the necessary sequestration infrastructure: CO2 pipelines that will carry CO2 from where it is removed from fuel or waste gas streams to where it will be sequestered.

However, after the crisis of 1929 there were a lot of problems caused in part by poor fiscal management, a bad coordination between Renault and SAEAR and, in part, by a number of wrongheaded policies pursued by the Spanish government of the era. Despite these difficulties, Renault ultimately decided to maintain its presence in the Spanish market with the continued sale of imported vehicles from France until 1951, when the subsidiary FASA was established in Valladolid as a consequence of the difficulty in maintaining importing practices.","Univ Salamanca, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain",University of Salamanca,"Cebrián-Villar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.",,"Villar, Mar Cebrián/L-7859-2017","Villar, Mar Cebrián/0000-0002-7511-5801",,,,,42,0,0,0,4,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

The major (but not sole) contributor to deterioration in the U.S. and many other countries, particularly where warm and humid conditions prevail, is infection by hetero-fermentative Leuconostoc mesenteroides lactic acid bacteria. In recent years it has emerged that mannitol is a major product of L. mesenteroides deterioration of both sugarcane and sugar beet and a sensitive marker that can predict processing problems. An enzymatic factory method that is rapid, simple, accurate, and inexpensive is now available to measure mannitol in consignment juices and molasses. Cost of juice preparation was improved considerably by using Celite (TM) filter-aid and glass filters rather than PVDF microfilters. Precision and accuracy of the enzymatic method to measure low mannitol concentrations in sugar products were improved by spiking the buffer with mannitol and then calculating the final mannitol concentration by difference, although this was much better for diluted molasses than juice. Fructose up to 18% on a dissolved solids (Brix) basis was unequivocally shown not to interfere in the enzymatic determination of mannitol in both juices and molasses by comparing with gas and ion chromatography results. The increasing awareness of how mannitol detrimentally affects processing, e.g., crystallization, is discussed.","[Eggleston, Gillian; Gober, Jessica; Alexander, Clay] ARS, Commod Utilizat Res Unit, So Reg Res Ctr, USDA, New Orleans, LA 70124 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Eggleston, G (通讯作者)，ARS, Commod Utilizat Res Unit, So Reg Res Ctr, USDA, New Orleans, LA 70124 USA.",gillian.eggleston@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0097-6156,1947-5918,978-0-8412-2598-5,ACS SYM SER,ACS Symp.

However, analysis reveals that a series of recruitment and retention barriers may impinge upon the 'effectiveness' of such a strategy - particularly the intersection of CEE migrant 'agency' with labour market opportunities and UK immigration/welfare policies.

It is necessary to understand how much energy is used at individual enterprise, where the most energy is consumed and what the best opportunities are to invest in energy efficiency. Auditing energy efficiency was recently undertaken in one of the top 1000 largest Chinese enterprises. The objectives of this paper are to fill a gap in the literature of auditing energy efficiency for a Chinese manufacturing enterprise and to share the audited energy efficiency results. This paper concludes that if the enterprise invests USD 1.9 million to improve energy efficiency, the investment will be recovered in about 18 months. The net present value of the investment would be about USD 9.8 million at a discount rate of 12%. The investment will reduce a large amount of energy consumption at the enterprise based on its figures in 2008, including 15% of electricity, 40% of fuel oil, and 54% of diesel. Carbon reduction is also very cost-effective. Investment of one dollar in the enterprise will help cut carbon emission by 7.95 kg per year and generate $5.3 net revenue in the economic lifetime of the invested technology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The world faces a surge in demand for electricity that is driven by such powerful forces as population growth, extensive urbanization, industrialization, and the rise in the standard of living. This paper attempts to ascertain whether there is a systematic relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth. To this end, we use a large set of data that spans 88 countries during the period, 1975-2004. A statistically significant inverted-U-shaped relationship between per-capita consumption of electricity and per-capita income is detected. Nevertheless, by using a purchasing power parity that is much higher than the per-capita income of all the countries in the world, the level of per-capita income is estimated at the peak point of per-capita electricity consumption to be $61,379 in 2000 constant international dollars. Moreover, we segment the sample into Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and non-OECD countries, and separately analyze the developed and developing countries. The separate estimation shows that even though the peak income is higher than the average per-capita income, a statistically significant inverted-U-shaped relationship is found in OECD and developed countries but not in non-OECD and developing countries.

The analysis is first introduced by a brief examination of regional energy situations and of the international context in which the reforms took place; this includes the policy guidelines introduced by the IFIs and the investment decisions of energy corporations. We analyze management processes and ownership changes for each country. Finally, the article identifies the problems encountered as a result of reform design and the interaction of behaviors between the governments, the International Corporations and the IFIs: lastly, we draw conclusions.

However, it is shown that the model, although sound in principle, has been misapplied due to a confusion of resource categories. A correction of this methodological error reveals that EIA's scenario requires rather extreme and implausible assumptions regarding future global decline rates.

The results suggest that both total products and gasoline share estimates are more responsive to changes in income than changes in the real price of petroleum products. These results have important policy implications as they suggest that policy makers may need to use market-based pricing policies and other policies such as public enlightenment in addition to regulations like minimum energy efficiency standards to promote efficiency and conservation and curb the rising consumption of petroleum products in Indonesia.

The accuracy of the dispatching system, derived from the accuracy of demand forecasting and the forecasting algorithm used, will determines the economic of the power system operation as well as the stability of the whole society. This paper presents a combined epsilon-SVR model considering seasonal proportions based on development tendencies from history data. We use one-order moving averages to produce a comparatively smooth data series, taking the averaging period as the interval that can effectively eliminate the seasonal variation. We used the smoothed data series as the training set input for the epsilon-SVR model and obtained the corresponding forecasting value. Afterward, we accounted for the previously removed seasonal variation. As a case, we forecast northeast electricity demand of China using the new method. We demonstrated that this simple procedure has very satisfactory overall performance by an analysis of variance with relative verification and validation. Significant reductions in forecast errors were achieved. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis includes the costs and margins for all the stakeholders along the economic chain. This analysis reveals that under current market situations in Ireland, the production of ethanol under the same tax regime as petrol makes it difficult to compete against that fuel, with tax breaks, however, it can compete against petrol. On the other hand, even under favourable tax breaks it will be difficult for indigenously produced ethanol to compete against cheaper sources of imported ethanol. Therefore, the current transport fuel market has no economic reason to consume indigenously produced ethanol made from the indigenously grown feedstock analysed at a price that reflects all the stakeholders' costs. To deliver a significant penetration of indigenous ethanol into the market would require some form of compulsory inclusion or else considerable financial supports to feedstock and ethanol producers.

The buildings (1, 2 and 3 bedrooms) are located in La Pampa, central Argentina, in a moderate cold climate. The dimensional and energy-consumption variables are studied (area, envelope's area, FAEP = envelope's area/floor area; envelope's thermal resistance R, volumetric heat loss G and auxiliary heating Q(aux)). The natural gas consumption is analyzed at annual and seasonal levels. Consumption variability among buildings, storeys and flats is calculated. The quantitative analysis is coupled to a qualitative description through direct observation of the buildings. The results show: (a) a high incidence of natural gas consumption in the total annual energy consumption (natural gas+electricity), (b) seasonality of natural gas consumption, with a maximum value in the cold period July-August (variability = 80%). (c) little variability among buildings of the annual natural gas consumption (4.17%), (d) the lowest average energy consumption at the first floor, (e) high variability among flats on each storey, (0 winter consumption of a multi-family dwelling lower than a single-family dwelling of similar area and (g) little seasonal variability of the electricity consumption.

Modular type binary cycle plants have been imported and installed in various geothermal fields in New Zealand, with plans for further expansion. Power output of these plants deteriorates in the summer because plant efficiency depends directly on the geothermal resource and the ambient temperature. As these plants normally use air-cooled condensers, incorporating a water-augmented air-cooled system could improve the power output in summer thereby matching the peak air-conditioning demand. In this work, power generation for the Rotokawa plant was characterized using a similar plant performance and local weather. The improved performance was modelled for retrofit with a wet-cooling system. Maximum generation increase on the hottest day could be 6.8%. The average gain in power over the Summer, November-February, was 1.5%, and the average gain for the whole year was 1%. With current binary unit generation capacity at the Rotokawa plant of 35 MW, investment in a water-augmented air-cooled system could provide 2 MW of peak generation on the hottest days. This investment in efficiency is found to compare favourably to other supply options such as solar PV, wind or gas. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Sohel, M.

Since the EU ETS covers only some industries, it implies a hybrid emission control scheme where EU member states must apply complementary domestic emissions regulation for the non-trading sectors of their economies in order to comply with their national emission reduction targets. The EU ETS thus opens up for strategic partitioning of national emissions budgets by the member states between trading and non-trading sectors. in this paper we examine the potential effects of such strategic behavior on compliance cost and emissions prices. We show that concerns on efficiency losses from strategic partitioning are misplaced. In turn, our analysis implicitly indicates significant political economy forces behind EU climate policy, as both cost-effective and strategically motivated partitioning of national emission budgets are far off from the actual break-down between trading and non-trading sectors.

Motor vehicle idling among individual private citizens is one behavior that may be amenable to large-scale policy interventions. Currently, little data are available to quantify the potential reductions in emissions that could be realized by successful policy interventions. In addition, little is known about the motivations and beliefs that underlie idling. In the fall of 2007,1300 drivers in the US were surveyed to assess typical idling practices, beliefs and motivations. Results indicate that the average individual idled for over 16 min a day and believed that a vehicle can be idled for at least 3.6 min before it is better to turn it off. Those who held inaccurate beliefs idled, on average, over I min longer than the remainder of the sample. These data suggest that idling accounts for over 93 MMt of CO(2) and 10.6 billion gallons (40.1 billion liters) of gasoline a year, equaling 1.6% of all US emissions. Much of this idling is unnecessary and economically disadvantageous to drivers. The policy implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence from the EEX, Nord Pool and Powernext",ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity; Risk premium; Emission allowances,MARKET PRICE; FUTURES; IMPACTS,"The links between emission and energy markets are of great interest to practitioners, academics and policy makers. In this paper, it is conjectured that a positive relationship exists between emission allowance spot returns and electricity risk premia within the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). We discuss how this can be justified on the basis of the substantial uncertainties in the carbon markets. We also argue that this link could be due to trading strategies followed by electricity producers who attempt to exploit their initial allocation of free allowances. Analysis of data from three major markets, the EEX, Nord Pool and Powernext, offers empirical support to our conjecture. These findings have significant policy implications since they imply that efforts should be made in order to reduce the uncertainty in the carbon markets by clearly defining the EU ETS regulative framework and design over the next years. Moreover, our results suggest that the allocation of free allowances and their unrestricted trading enable electricity producers to accomplish windfall profits in the derivatives market at the expense of other market participants.

This study advocates that setting the GHG reduction targets should be settled in this Bill. In addition, based on the analysis of international experiences, it is recommenced that emissions trading scheme in the Bill should be focused on large emission sources and the share of allowance auction should be increased to reduce gratis allocation. Furthermore, from the calculation results based on the long-range energy alternative planning (LEAP) model, a conflict is observed for the existing energy policy and GHG reduction efforts in Taiwan. That is, coal-burning power plants will be the most important source of energy for Taiwan in the future.

The Central Government decided to prompt the retrofit of 1.5 x 10(8) m(2) existing residential buildings in China's northern heating region during the 11th Five-Years Plan. But, at present, the relative incentive policies and measurements are very insufficient. Especially, on the aspect of the retrofit pattern about the organization, retrofit content, investing and financing mode, the policy and management and other factors, no existing successful one can be spreaded into the whole northern heating region. This research not only analyzed the foreign advanced methods, drew lessons from their retrofit in Germany and Poland, but contrasted and analyzed energy efficiency retrofit demonstrations from Harbin, Tianjin, Tangshan and Baotou in China to get our domestic successful patterns and experience.

This in turn has led to a large growth in clean renewable generation for electricity production. Much emphasis has been on wind generation as it is among the most advanced forms of renewable generation, however, its variable and relatively unpredictable nature result in increased challenges for electricity system operators. Tidal generation on the other hand is almost perfectly forecastable and as such may be a viable alternative to wind generation. This paper calculates the break-even capital cost for tidal generation on a real electricity system. An electricity market model is used to determine the impact of tidal generation on the operating schedules of the conventional units on the system and on the resulting cycling costs, emissions and fuel savings. It is found that for tidal generation to produce positive net benefits for the case study, the capital costs would have to be less than epsilon 510,000 per MW installed which is currently an unrealistically low capital cost. Thus, it is concluded that tidal generation is not a viable option for the case system at the present time. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the 1990s, a large number of voluntary agreements emerged in industrialised countries in order to improve industrial energy efficiency. These experiences are now taken into account in China. This article analyses the drivers for voluntary agreements on industrial energy efficiency in China, based on a case study of three enterprises in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. Furthermore, the article reviews the institutional set-up of energy policy and investigates the pertaining policy culture. From the findings, conclusions are drawn on the role of voluntary agreements within China's larger policy context. We conclude that opposed to avoiding stricter regulation, voluntary agreements in Nanjing are reinterpreted in view of more stringent national provisions on energy efficiency in the 11th Five Year Plan. Hence, agreements have evolved into an implementation tool of national policy at the local level. For industry, another major driver for participation was identified as improving its relations with local authorities. Voluntary agreements showed to have the potential to overcome traditional constraints of implementing top-down policies at the local level in China. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We then refer to a theoretical economic grid highlighting the strength of local factors (i.e. social and institutional forces) in co-ordination mechanisms. We conclude that for the case of Crete, both internal factors (such as local acceptance) and external elements (such as macrostructure) play a core role in successful implementation of renewable energy, and from this we propose a number of facilitating conditions which could help promote renewable energy production on other islands.

A carbon mechanism that forces generators to internalise their emissions costs may alter the merit order in which generators are dispatched in the market. Heavy carbon dioxide polluters may switch from operating continuously to having to operate on the margin more often. This results in these units being required to switch on and off and vary their output more frequently, which has a significant impact on their costs. In this paper, the impact of carbon prices on the operating profiles of generators in a real electricity system is investigated. A large number of potential scenarios are considered and it is found that carbon prices significantly increase the cycling costs.

In 2005, the Taipei City government announced that Taipei's total GHG emission in 2015 will reach the same level as that in 2005 and then down to 75% of that level at year 2030. However, based on the estimated energy consumption and GHG emission and the proposed emission reduction plans from the local government, it is clear that these goals are not going to be accomplished. In Taipei, the residential and commercial sector contributes more than 78% of the total GHG emission. Thus, in a business as usual scenario, the total GHG emission in 2030 would be 79% more than that in 2005, far more than the target value proclaimed. As many key factors are uncontrollable by the local government, a target-aimed strategy designing process by looking into changes in Taipei and identifying major targets is proposed in this study.

The contention of this paper is that the policy discourses of 'community' and of 'participation' underpinning area-based regeneration programmes are overly simplistic, and their use in regeneration policy is, as a consequence, highly problematic. Based on an analysis of a regeneration partnership in the north of England, this paper will demonstrate that, while partnership members share the same levels of access in decision-making structures, the members of partnership boards have such different understandings of the purpose of participation and the role of residents in the regeneration process that it has created conflict serious enough to affect delivery of regeneration.

The optimal pricing rate can be found out when it has been put into the game models as a variable and the equilibrium strategy has been reckoned. It puts forward a congestion pricing method based on the Principal-Agent game model. The road traffic governor is a principal, and travelers are agents. The principal want the agents to act in accordance with the objectives of an optimal system-maximized social benefits, but agents make choices according to their own optimal utilities. The principal controls the actions of agents through charging for vehicles at congested sections. Agents choose right actions to meet the conditions.

B. and Frank B. The German information and communication technology (ICT) industry: spatial growth and innovation patterns, Regional Studies. This paper is motivated by previous studies that have found that information and communication technology (ICT) industries seem to cluster geographically and having spatially clustered growth rates. In Germany, the production of ICT devices is concentrated in clusters of innovating regions (in terms of patents). ICT service production, on the other hand, is concentrated in larger urban areas. The data show that negative spatial effects are present for several sectors, which might give support for the so-called backwash effect described by Gunnar Myrdal in 1957. Weak positive growth effects from ICT are found, but these growth effects stem more from innovation in rather than from production or use of ICT.

The gross export to Europe and Americas has exceeded half of total exports in 2008. At the beginning, the export to Europe, Americas and Africa kept alignment with that of Asia, and currently, it has increased far beyond Asia and other Middle East Areas. According to the export growth of YTO Group Corporation, the largest tractor manufacturing company in China, it shows that the export of YTO Group Corporation to Asia, the Middle East and Australia keeps the upward trend, but the growth speed has already slowed down comparing with that of Europe and Americas. Especially after 2008, the export growth of China's large-scale agricultural machinery products to Europe and the Americas is larger than that of Africa and Asia during the same period. The target market of agricultural enterprises has changed gradually from Africa and Asia to Europe and the Americas. And the focuses of international marketing have been shifted from the regions (Africa and Asia) with many less developed and developing countries, to the regions such as Europe and the Americas with many developed and medium-developed countries. At the same time, the export risk for Chinese agricultural machinery enterprises is constantly increased because of the fluctuation of export destinations. At present, especially in the period of international financial crisis, the issue that Chinese agricultural machinery enterprises most concern is how to reduce the entry risk of Chinese agricultural machinery enterprises to the new market. This paper analyzed the reasons and the primary risk of changes in export destination for Chinese agricultural machinery enterprises, and put forward the main approach to prevent risks.","[Zhu Beizhong] Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Econ & Management, Luoyang 471003, Peoples R China",Henan University of Science & Technology,,zbzdy@163.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-078-0,,,,2009,,,,,,,67,70,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BQC59,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280696200016,0

Although meaningful, such visions may not inclusively represent the objectives of all relevant actors. Moreover, the visions are mostly intuitively judged by these actors and reflect their experiences and concerns. Yet, analytical expertise provides essential information about the required decisions and their consequences. We argue that coming up with a number of alternative visions about a future energy system and addressing these visions from both intuitive and analytical perspectives leads to better-quality decisions. This paper presents a case study in the small Swiss community of Urnasch, where actors from practice and academia collaborated in a transdisciplinary process to address the future energy system. Visions of these actors about the ideal-type energy system were linked both with energy scenarios that analytically specified options to implement these visions and with stakeholder-based multi-criteria assessment of the consequences. As a result, most of the involved actors adjusted their initial vision preferences. Thus, we believe this approach could lead to capacity building and formation of stable, informed preferences, which are necessary to support a transition in the coming decades. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the model I consider, the policymaker must set policy in each period before the realization of a price shock. Resource owners then learn the value of the shock, and the owners choose extraction quantities. The optimal policy is a stationary tax rule that responds to a positive shock to the current price by reducing next period's tax rate. Intuitively, a reduction in next period's tax rate makes extraction next period less expensive and thus dampens the resource owner's current response to a price increase. This policy is robust to some, but not necessarily all, boundary solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Before the project described in this paper was initiated, there was no ongoing forum for energy experts from all of the countries of the region to meet, informally and in an unofficial capacity, to discuss openly and in a targeted fashion the energy situations in their countries, and to work together to evaluate the energy efficiency costs and benefits of different ways of meeting regional demand.

Zecca and Chiari used their own model to produce a higher projection of atmospheric CO2 concentration, drawing on the conclusions of Archer (2005) to do so. In this short comment, we show that the model of Zecca and Chiari is an erroneous interpretation of Archer (2005). We present a model based on an improved interpretation of Archer's paper and demonstrate that the model still significantly overpredicts atmospheric CO2 with respect to historical observations of CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, whichever carbon cycle model one chooses to use (i.e. to convert a carbon emissions scenario into an atmospheric CO2 concentration), the primary concerns raised by Nel and Cooper (2009) - regarding an inability to achieve the IPCC's high emissions scenarios due to fossil fuel constraints - remain valid. These concerns are supported by a growing body of literature pointing to a peak in world oil and coal production within the coming few decades. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is a great potential for energy savings in this field, often at little cost. A new European directive and several European standards, including the comfort standard EN15251, were created to develop comfortable and efficient buildings. This paper presents the interaction of this specific standard with the application of energy efficiency regulations. In order to evaluate the impact of the EN15251 application in commercial buildings, a case study was analyzed using the dynamic simulation software TRNSYS-The Transient Energy System Simulation Tool. The building was set according to the standard conditions specified by the national regulation, and the assessment of comfort requirements of EN15251 was verified. It was found that the current comfort requirements of the Portuguese regulation are not sufficient to achieve by themselves the comfort categories specified in the EN15251. About 55% of the comfort hours could not be assured. Furthermore, reaching the main comfort requirements (temperature/fresh air rates) of the EN15251 does not lead directly to the assessment of the corresponding categories. Results showed that the building stayed one comfort category behind from the desired when the correspondent operative temperatures were secured. On the other hand, it was found possible to achieve the comfort categories by increasing the operative temperature ranges, imposed by the standard, about 1 degrees C. This has a negative consequence, which is the increment of energy consumption. However, there is a large room for maneuver to reduce this consumption into acceptable levels according to the EPBD.

In this paper, we investigate the existence and the nature of spatial spillovers for the provision of urban parks in 93 municipalities in the urban area of Angers, France. We use geographic information systems to obtain land use data. We estimate a reaction function, with interactions between cities and their provision of urban parks. For this end, we shall apply spatial econometric techniques. We find positive autocorrelation among municipalities. A 10% rise in the level of parks in neighboring municipalities leads to a 3.6% increase ceteris paribus.

We find that the mean level and variability of the random thresholds are key for explaining differences across products in the frequency of price changes.

However, it is unclear which solar technology is and will prove most viable. Therefore, a comprehensive comparative assessment of solar technologies along the key quantitative and qualitative competitiveness criteria is needed. Based on a literature review and detailed techno-economic modeling for 2010 and 2020 in five locations, we provide such an assessment for the three currently leading large-scale solar technologies. We show that today these technologies cannot yet compete with conventional forms of power generation but approach competitiveness around 2020 in favorable locations. Furthermore, from a global perspective we find that none of the solar technologies emerges as a clear winner and that cost of storing energy differs by technology and can change the order of competitiveness in some instances. Importantly, the competitiveness of the different technologies varies considerably across locations due to differences in. e.g., solar resource and discount rates. Based on this analysis, we discuss policy implications with regard to fostering the diffusion of solar technologies while increasing the efficiency of policy support through an adequate geographical allocation of solar technologies.

This paper presents a novel framework on the basis of a combination of stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm and game theory to study the impacts of different regulatory interventions to promote wind power investment in generation expansion planning. In this study, regulatory policies include Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) incentive, quota and tradable green certificate. The intermittent nature and uncertainties of wind power generation will cause the investors encounter risk in their investment decisions. To overcome this problem, a novel model has been derived to study the regulatory impacts on wind generation expansion planning. In our approach, the probabilistic nature of wind generation is modeled. The model can calculate optimal investment strategies, in which the wind power uncertainty is included. This framework is implemented on a test system to illustrate the working of the proposed approach. The result shows that FITs are the most effective policy to encourage the rapid and sustained deployment of wind power. FITs can significantly reduce the risks of investing in renewable energy technologies and thus create conditions conducive to rapid market growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the weakness associated with the bivariate causality framework, the current study performs a multivariate causality framework by incorporating capital and labor variables into the model between energy consumption and economic growth based on neo-classical aggregate production theory. Using the recently developed autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach, a long-run equilibrium cointegration relationship has been found to exist between economic growth and the explanatory variables: energy consumption, capital and employment. Empirical results reveal that the long-run parameter of energy consumption on economic growth in China is approximately 0.15, through a long-run static solution of the estimated ARDL model, and that for the short-run is approximately 0.12 by the error correction model. The study also indicates the existence of short-run and long-run causality running from energy consumption, capital and employment to economic growth.

We develop a Bayesian analysis of the hierarchical Gaussian common value model with stochastic entry introduced by Bajari and Hortacsu. A key component of our approach is an accurate and easily interpretable analytical approximation of the equilibrium bid function, resulting in a fast and numerically stable evaluation of the likelihood function. We extend the analysis to situations with positive valuations using a hierarchical gamma model. We use a Bayesian variable selection algorithm that simultaneously samples the posterior distribution of the model parameters and does inference on the choice of covariates. The methodology is applied to simulated data and to a newly collected dataset from eBay with bids and covariates from 1000 coin auctions. We demonstrate that the Bayesian algorithm is very efficient and that the approximation error in the bid function has virtually no effect on the model inference. Both models fit the data well, but the Gaussian model outperforms the gamma model in an out-of-sample forecasting evaluation of auction prices.

This article concentrates on how to develop low-carbon tourism using a quantitative approach. Firstly, the tourism system including some mutual influence factors is investigated and some historical data are given in support for the research of their quantitative relationship. Secondly, a differential dynamic system model with fuzzy coefficients is proposed to predict tourism revenue, energy consumption, waste emissions and the carbon intensity.

The Artificial Neural Network uses scenarios with only grid supply, grid combined with hydro-turbine, or with wind turbine and a mutual solution, with hydro and wind turbine. The results obtained show how the model is useful for decision support solutions in the planning of sustainable hybrid energy solutions that can be applied to water distribution systems or others existent hydro-systems, allowing the improvement of the global energy efficiency.

Additional to past problems, the 2008 electricity crisis made the solution crucial after its damaging consequences to the economy. The disagreement on the need and consequences of the continuous electricity price hikes worsens the situation. To contribute to the recent electricity debate, this paper proposes a time-varying price elasticity of demand for electricity; the sensitivity of electricity consumption to price fluctuations changes throughout the years. The main purpose of this study is the estimation of the price elasticity of electricity in South Africa during the period 1980-2005 by employing an advanced econometric technique, the Kalman filter. Apart from the decreasing effect of electricity prices to consumption (-71.8% in the 1990s and -94.5% in the 2000s in average), our results conclude to an important finding: the higher the prices (for example in the 1980s) the higher the sensitivity of consumers to price fluctuations. Thus, further increases of the electricity prices may lead to changes in the behaviour of electricity consumers, focusing their efforts on improving their efficiency levels by introducing demand-side management techniques or even turning to other sources of - cheaper - energy.

According to the International Maritime Organization (Second IMO GHG study, 2009), maritime transport emitted 1046 million tons (all tons are metric) of CO2 in 2007, representing 3.3% of the world's total CO2 emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is currently debating both technical and market-based measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping. This paper presents investigations on the effects of speed reductions on the direct emissions and costs of maritime transport, for which the selection of ship classes was made to facilitate an aggregated representation of the world fleet. The results show that there is a substantial potential for reducing CO2 emissions in shipping. Emissions can be reduced by 19% with a negative abatement cost (cost minimization) and by 28% at a zero abatement cost. Since these emission reductions are based purely on lower speeds, they can in part be performed now. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This article examines the recent public discussion in Finland, France, and the UK - three countries currently in the process of constructing or planning new nuclear power stations. To place the public discussion on nuclear power within the relationship between policy discourses and contexts, the article addresses three interrelated themes: the justifications and discursive strategies employed by nuclear advocates and critics, the similarities and differences in debates between the three countries, and the interaction between the country-specific state orientations and the argumentation concerning nuclear power. Drawing from documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews, the article identifies and analyses key discursive strategies and their use in the context of the respective state orientations: 'technology-and-industry-know-best' in Finland, 'government-knows-best' in France, and 'markets-know-best' in the UK. The nuclear debates illustrate subtle ongoing transformations in these orientations, notably in the ways in which the relations between markets, the state, and civil society are portrayed in the nuclear debates.

Different technical systems are considered such as motorway hydrogen filling stations, Hythane (R)-fueled buses or second-generation biofuels production, which present contrasted hydrogen use characteristics.

Municipalities will play an important role as local energy planning authorities in terms of adopting and refining this vision in different local contexts. Based on a review of 11 municipal energy plans, this paper examines to what extent municipal energy planning matches national 100% renewable energy strategies. The results indicate a willingness among Danish municipalities to actively carry out energy planning, and the plans reveal a large diversity of (new) activities. At the same time, however, there is a strong need for better coordination of municipal energy planning activities at the central level. It is suggested that the role of municipalities as energy planning authorities needs to be outlined more clearly in, e.g., strategic energy planning which integrates savings, efficiency and renewable energy in all (energy) sectors. This requires the state to provide municipalities with the necessary planning instruments and establish a corresponding planning framework. Consequently, there is a need for a simultaneous centralisation and decentralisation during the implementation of the 100% renewable energy vision. The paper outlines a basic division of tasks between the central and the local level within such a strategic energy planning system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Large amounts of variable wind power on the system will increase market risks, with prices more volatile and load factors for conventional thermal plant lower and more uncertain. This extra market risk may discourage investment in generation capacity. Financial viability for thermal plant will be increasingly dependent on price spikes during periods of low wind. Increased price risk will also make investment in other forms of low-carbon generation (e.g. nuclear power) more challenging. A number of policies can reduce the extent to which generators are exposed to market risks and encourage investment. However, market risks play a fundamental role in shaping efficient investment and dispatch patterns in a liberalised market. Therefore, measures to improve price signals and market functioning (such as a stronger carbon price and developing more responsive demand) are desirable. However, the scale of the investment challenge and increased risk mean targeted measures to reduce (although not eliminate) risk exposure, such as capacity mechanisms and fixed price schemes, may have increasing merit. The challenge for policy is to strike the right balance between market and planned approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

From the integrated estimation of three scenarios characterizing different stages of technology innovation in 2007-2030, technology innovation is proven to be the determinant in decreasing resource use and environmental effects from electricity production, but analysis based on current policies reveals some doubt in achieving the coal consumption intensity control target. Constrained with national control targets, the best route of technology innovation is calculated by integrated benefit targeting optimization. Supercritical (SC) and ultra-supercritical (USC) pressure boilers, flue gas desulfurization (FGD) and closed-cycle wet cooling with a high circulation ratio will be the mainstream technologies before 2030 based on current policy. It is inevitable to close or reconstruct small power plants from the late 2010s, and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and pressurized fluidized bed combustion combined cycle (PFBC-CC) plants will show a competitive advantage in the late 2020s. However, air cooling and FGD systems will expand slower than the authorities' expectation, while higher water prices and 502 charges promote the expansion. Stricter restrictions are also found to be positive for technological progress. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Line-pack flexibility is becoming increasingly important as a tool to balance gas supply and demand over different periods. In the European liberalized market context, a monopolist unbundled network operator offers regulated transport services and flexibility (balancing) services according to the network code and balancing rules. Therefore, gas policy makers should understand the role and consequences of line-pack regulation. The analysis shows that the line-pack flexibility service has an important economic value for the shippers and the TSO. Furthermore, the analysis identifies distorting effects in the gas market due to inadequate regulation of line-pack flexibility: by disregarding the sunk costs of flexibility in the balancing rules, the overall efficiency of the gas system is decreased. Finally, the analysis demonstrates that the actual costs of line-pack flexibility are related to the peak cumulative imbalance throughout the balancing period. Any price for pipeline flexibility should, therefore, be based on the related trade-off between the right to use the line-pack flexibility and the provision of transport services.

The aim of the presented study is to assess the different biomass options against the background of energy and environmental political targets based on a system analytical approach for the future German energy sector. The results show that heat generation and to a lower extent combined heat and power (CHP) production from solid biomass like wood and straw are the most cost effective ways to contribute to the emission reduction targets. The use of energy crops in fermentation biogas plants (maize) and for production of 1st generation transportation fuels, like biodiesel from rapeseed and ethanol from grain or sugar beet, are less favourable. Optimisation potentials lie in a switch to the production of 2nd generation biofuels and the enhanced use of either biomass residues or low production intensive energy crops. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Early studies of rural development suggested that newcomer rural entrepreneurs are important agents of change and responsible for new spatial development, but more recent research has concluded that there is no difference between newcomer and local rural entrepreneurs in this respect. Much of this literature is based on qualitative ethnographic case studies. Systematic pooling and scrutinizing of the main attributes and findings of such studies enhances their comparability and permits some generalization. Newcomer and local rural entrepreneurship is therefore investigated by means of a meta-analysis of twenty-two applied studies. The statistical results show that newcomer entrepreneurs are relatively older, better educated, and develop more non-agricultural business. They appear to be predominantly attracted by a rural lifestyle. In many cases, newcomer entrepreneurs are not directly the instigators of economic development, but their contribution to physical capital formation is greater than that of the locals.","[Akgun, Aliye A.; Baycan-Levent, Tuzin] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, TR-34437 Istanbul, Turkey; [Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Poot, Jacques] Univ Waikato, Ctr Populat Studies, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",Istanbul Technical University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Waikato,"Akgün, AA (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, TR-34437 Istanbul, Turkey.",gulumser@itu.edu.tr; tuzin.baycanlevent@itu.edu.tr; pnijkamp@feweb.vu.nl; jpoot@waikato.ac.nz,"(Gülümser) Akgün, Aliye Ahu/O-1021-2013","(Gülümser) Akgün, Aliye Ahu/0000-0001-9722-5131; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132; Poot, Jacques/0000-0003-4735-9283",,,,,73,46,51,8,73,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Under plausible assumptions for costs and performance, point estimates of the levelised costs of Wave and Tidal Stream generation are 90 pound and 81 pound/MWh, respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows how these relative private levelised costs calculations are affected by variation in key parameters, specifically the assumed capital costs, fuel costs and the discount rate. We also consider the impact of the introduction of technology-differentiated financial support for renewable energy on the cost competitiveness of Wave and Tidal Stream power.

The combination of cash payments (and low penetration of cheques) in the Spanish retail sector together with increasing administrative costs, acted as incentives for Spanish savings banks embracing applications of computer technology to articulate viable solutions for cost reductions, offer alternative payment systems to cash and facilitate greater diversification. A running comparison is made with similar developments in Britain. Computerization committees had little impact amongst the trustee savings banks (TSB). This responded to a combination of a poor corporate strategy and a number of external events. By the mid-1970s it was evident that the trustee savings banks had lost a significant share of the total domestic deposits in sterling. Meanwhile, collective investments in computer technology applications were instrumental for Spanish savings banks to successfully contest the domestic retail bank market.","[Batiz-Lazo, Bernardo] Bangor Univ, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Carles Maixe-Altes, J.] Univ A Coruna, La Coruna, Spain",Bangor University; Universidade da Coruna,"Bátiz-Lazo, B (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales.",,"Batiz-Lazo, B/ISV-6142-2023; Maixe-Altes, J.

The mutual competition among the higher education establishments and the study programmes is increasing more and more, the higher education establishments have to evaluate their work thoroughly, but firstly it is important to answer the question: what exactly is the quality of education? And how to evaluate quality of study programme? What exactly affects the quality of study programmes and education? What assessment criteria can be used to evaluate if a study course or a study programme on the whole is qualitative? However, how to indicate, a study course or a study programme on the whole is qualitative? The aim of the author is to find out what characterises the quality of higher education study programmes.

As for his organization, the article analyzes the market structure on telecommunications equipment, setting quantitative and qualitative demand through the investment of CTNE and finally, the redesign of the market with the start of the liberalization of the telephone equipment industry in Spain. The period analyzed is limited by the renewal of the supply contract CTNE-SESA and the shift in Spanish economic policy with the start of development plans.

These vertical and horizontal networks replace ownership-based integration in the market. Recent financial-economic crisis that caused restructuring of many big and small firms in the world and in a single economy was favorable for further and faster network formation. The previous research proves that network formation has an effect on market structure. They change the way firms interact with each other, the way they compete and act in a market. But the problem is that despite a broad definition of market structure, most often the researchers narrow it to market concentration. The methods and indicators used to measure market concentration were invented and are appropriate for evaluation of changes in a market because of ownership-based concentration among firms. As network formation should benefit all firms joining the network. The article suggests broadening the view on market structure by including measurement of market density. It is argued that the combination of market concentration and market density can better reveal changes in market structure under network formation. As there is no common approach to estimate market density, the article suggests and adopts a network clustering coefficient.","[Kalendiene, Jone] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Econ, S Daukanto 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Sinkuniene, Kristina] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Finance, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Kalendiene, J (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Econ, S Daukanto 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",j.sakalyte@evf.vdu.lt; k.sinkuniene@evf.vdu.lt,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,15,22,,,,,,8,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100002,0

Measuring the grey economy is a complex issue which has not received a required attention in academic research thus resulting in a lack of consistent assessment methodologies. This has might result in serious implications for national economies limiting the implementation of the effective mitigation measures in economic policies. Moreover, the research of causes behind the dynamics of the grey economy has been scarce. The objective of this paper is to explore and analyse the nature of dominating social values in Latvia, the impact of the above on related consumer behaviour and influence of the grey economy. Authors seek to explain the factors facilitating existence of the grey economy from a consumer values angle and provide suggestions for national economic policy to decrease the impact of the unregistered economic activities and support sustainable growth and recovery from economic downturn. The study utilizes empirical sociological data from annual value surveys to consider the relationship between values and the drivers for the population to support the growth of grey economy. The study suggests higher support of tax evasion in Self-centred value segment which might have stimulating impact on the grey economy. Contrary, Traditionalist, Domestic and Peaceful values are associated with prevailing acceptance towards properly paying taxes which represents an opportunity to raise taxation income assuming right communication strategy developed. Domestic value domain represents another opportunity for acceptance behaviour however proper tax settlement is lower among their individual priorities thus to be considered as an alert for attempts to increase tax burden.","[Kaze, Valters] Univ Latvia, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia; [Bolinskis, Gatis] Data Serviss, LV-1011 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Kaze, V (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia.",valters.kaze@gmx.net; gatis@data.lv,"Kaze, Valters/P-5932-2017","Kaze, Valters/0000-0003-1502-6994",,,,,45,0,0,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,70,79,,,,,,10,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100009,0

The regions perform even better if they have good transport connections with these countries.

Commonly used empirical proxies for risk (such as the moving standard deviation of the returns on an asset) are not firmly grounded in economic theory. Risk measures have been developed by other studies, but these are often based on subjective weights attaching to a range of objective component indicators, are difficult to replicate and are not strictly consistent with underlying theory. The contribution of this article is to develop a methodology to construct rational expectations consistent empirical risk measures. It has the advantages of being explicitly consistent with economic theory and easily replicable. We illustrate this methodology by specific application to the South African context. The time-varying risk measure developed in this article is consistent with a rational expectations application of the expectations hypothesis. The constructed measure is a broad one (it includes political risk and peso problems for instance) and reflects investors' perceptions of systematic risk.","[Fedderke, Johannes] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Fedderke, Johannes] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Fedderke, Johannes] Econ Res So Africa, Cape Town, South Africa; [Pillay, Neryvia] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Witwatersrand; University of Cape Town,"Fedderke, J (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jwf15@sia.psu.edu; neryvia.pillay@uct.ac.za,"Fedderke, Johannes/N-1411-2019","Fedderke, Johannes/0000-0003-4482-5939",Economic Research Southern Africa,Economic Research Southern Africa,The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Economic Research Southern Africa.,,48,2,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

To this end, the Dutch government has set specific goals in order to foster technological innovation related to energy efficiency in buildings The objective of this paper is to explore the links between technological innovation and public policies in this sector over the last 30 years. The paper aims (1) to measure the evolution of innovations related to energy efficiency in buildings in the Netherlands using patent counts and (2) to provide a historical overview of the policy framework. Descriptive data on patenting activities show that the Netherlands have a clear comparative advantage in the field of energy-saving lighting technologies, mainly due to intensive patenting activities by Philips. High-efficiency boilers also represent a substantial share of Dutch innovation activities in this domain over the last decades. In many other fields (such as insulation, heat-pumps and cogeneration, solar boilers, etc), however, Germany. Austria and Scandinavian countries rank much higher than the Netherlands The descriptive analysis of Dutch energy policy shows an intensification of energy policy in the mid-1990s, followed by a slight decline after 2001 Overall, the simultaneous introduction of policy instruments makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of policies.

This matter is undoubtedly gaining importance and it has taken a key role in the energy regulators' agendas. In this paper, we critically review and categorize the different approaches regulators can opt for to deal with the problem of guaranteeing (or at least enhancing) security of supply in a market-oriented environment. We analyze the most relevant regulatory design elements throughout an updated assessment of the broad range of international experiences, highlighting the lessons we have learned so far in a variety of contexts. Based on the analysis, we conclude by providing a set of principles and criteria that should be considered by the regulator when designing a security of supply mechanism. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Steel, aluminium and cement are the key manufacturing industries in India which provide inputs to various other sectors such as construction, transportation, power transmission, etc. As a result, their demand is consistently rising. These industries are heavily energy-intensive and use raw materials such as iron ore, coal, electricity, steam, and fuel oil, whose supply can act as severe production constraints over a period of time and can hinder sustainable development. Hence it becomes imperative for these industries to continuously innovate more energy efficient techniques. This paper makes a foray into the energy demand for these industries and explores the potential of any future reduction in their energy consumption. The paper offers a projection scenario for 2001-2031 (based on the MARKAL Modeling exercise for India) for possible catching up in reduction in energy consumptions in these sectors under alternative situations. The analysis suggests the existence of some plausible energy efficiency enhancing techniques in these industries. Exploring these options will definitely ensure cost effectiveness and competitiveness of these three key sectors in the global market. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It focuses on an analysis of energy efficiency in the production of aluminum, copper and nickel. A few large-scale enterprises produce most of the aluminum, copper and nickel in China, and use manufacturing facilities that were built within the last 20 years or have recently upgraded their main production equipment and processes. The energy efficiency of these operations is not particularly low compared to international practice. A large number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) operate nonferrous metals production facilities which rank low in energy efficiency and therefore are highly energy intensive per unit of physical output.

Experience shows that converting cost-effective energy savings potential, particularly the demand-side improvement opportunities across sectors, into investments face many barriers and unforeseen transaction costs. This paper draws upon selected experiences with financing energy efficiency in developing countries to explore the key factors of various programmatic approaches and financing instruments that have been applied successfully for delivering energy efficiency solutions. Through case studies, a diverse range of institutional issues are examined related to the identification, packaging, designing, and monitoring approaches that have been used to catalyze traditional and innovative financing of energy efficiency projects. With adequate liquidity in major developing country markets and availability of modern energy savings technologies, it is often the institutional issues that become a key challenge to address in order to finance and implement robust programs. As further operational experience is gained, increased knowledge sharing can lead to scaling-up of such energy efficiency investments. The paper concludes with some ideas for accelerating implementation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To contribute to these discussions, we developed a local (city-scale) low-carbon scenario creation method. An estimation model was developed to show a quantitative and consistent future snapshot. The model can explicitly treat the uncertainty of future socio-economic situations, which originate from the openness of local economy. The method was applied to Kyoto city, and countermeasures to achieve the low-carbon target were identified. Without countermeasures, emissions would increase 12% from 2000. Among the measures, the reduction potential of energy efficiency improvements to residential and commercial sectors was found to be relatively large (15% and 18% of total reductions, respectively). The reduction potential of the passenger transport sector, in which the city government's policy is especially important, was 17% of the total amount. A sensitivity analysis showed that a 10% increase in exports leads to an 8.5% increase in CO2 emissions, and a 20% increase in the share of the commuters from outside the city leads to a 3.5% decrease of CO2 emissions because of the smaller number of residents in the city.

In particular we perform analysis demonstrating potential energy savings which could be obtained were Great Britain to maintain daylight savings time (DST) over winter, instead of reverting to Greenwich mean time (GMT). We review the literature on the effect of DST on energy consumption and show that this indicates a justification for considering the issue. Our headline result is in agreement with many related studies in that advancing the clock by an hour in winter would lead to energy savings of at least 0.3% of daily demand in Great Britain. In deriving this result we have adopted methodologies currently used in load prediction, in particular Support Vector Regression, to estimate energy demand on a half-hourly basis. Corresponding cost savings are found to be higher (due to the nonlinear increase of costs) and we find them to be on the order of 0.6% over the months considered. In terms of environmental impact we find the saving to be approximately equivalent to 450,000 ton of CO2. In deriving these results we adopt a conservative approach such that we consider them lower bounds on any true savings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Hill, S.

To this end, media coverage on biofuels in the Netherlands between 2000 and 2008 is analyzed by means of combining novel quantitative approaches with practitioner interviews.

But although liquid fuels form the foundation of modern industrial economies, the growing debate on 'peak oil' has relatively little influence on energy and climate policy. With this in mind, the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) has conducted an independent, thorough and systematic review of the evidence, with the aim of establishing the current state of knowledge, identifying key uncertainties and improving consensus. The study focuses upon the physical depletion of conventional oil in the period to 2030 and includes an in-depth literature review, analysis of industry databases and a detailed comparison of global supply forecasts. This Communication summarises the main findings of the UKERC study. A key conclusion is that a peak of conventional oil production before 2030 appears likely and there is a significant risk of a peak before 2020. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact of the ban on consumers will depend on the nature of current barriers to the use of CFLs. This paper employs a Double-Hurdle model to identify distinct barriers to household consideration of CFLs and to the subsequent intensity of adoption using a large survey of German households. Barriers to CFL consideration are found to be low for all households, except those with very low incomes. Barriers to CFL consideration are, however, strongly linked to the residential characteristics of low-income households like small size and to the lack of household knowledge of energy consumption. CFLs use will increase after the ban mainly through a rise in the intensity of adoption. But the ban will be costly to consumers because the range of applications where households chose to employ CFLs is limited, particularly for high income households. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

But the post-communist transition was marked by the exacerbation of the sector's numerous technical, economic, regulatory and environmental problems, accompanied by its abandonment in favour of alternative methods of domestic heating. Recent efforts to increase the use of DH in ECE as a result of environmental and energy security concerns have taken place in an absence of critical, context-sensitive research. The purpose of this paper is to explore the legal aspects of post-communist DH reforms in Romania, with the aim of identifying some of the governance challenges faced by state authorities in managing the sector. In broader terms, we seek to explore the extent to which the Romanian legislative framework is in a position to promote energy efficiency in DH. This has been achieved via an analysis of formal policy documents, government decrees, strategic documents and laws pertaining to this sector, as published and subsequently amended in the Official Gazette. The conclusions of the paper identify the key regulatory issues in the sector-especially with respect to the tariff setting process and the division of competences among different organisations in it-while suggesting a set of policy steps and general restructuring approaches that could help overcome the current situation.

Furthermore, plans are to reach 20 GW by 2010 and there are expectations of an installed capacity exceeding 40 GW by 2020. This article will present the innovative solutions for technical and economical integration that allow to reach such high level wind penetration objectives (the system peaks at around 44 GW and is almost isolated). It will be described how the regulation has evolved from a pure Feed-in-Tariff to a market+premium option, where technical and economic integration has been a priority. Today, approximately 97% of installed wind capacity accesses the Spanish wholesale electricity market. Market integration has been crucial, sending the correct signals to participants to look for the optimum technical solutions. Technical improvements have come from both wind power producers (fault-ride-through capabilities, visibility and controllability of wind power, power production forecasting, reactive power control) and the system operator (specific control centre dedicated to Renewable Energy Sources (RES), new security analysis tools, gaining technical confidence of wind capabilities).

The main difference appears, if the whole chain of supply and demand is taken into consideration. Exergy calculations enable us to analyze how much exergy is consumed in which part, from boiler to building envelope. They also reveal how much energy is supplied for the purpose of heating. Results show that insulation has much bigger effect than effect of boiler efficiency. However, the most effective solution is to improve building envelope together with boiler efficiency. Better thermal insulation also makes an important contribution to the improvement of thermal comfort conditions. It causes higher surface temperatures resulting in a larger warm radiant exergy emission rate and consequently better thermal comfort. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

North Korea's nuclear fuel cycle & its relationship to regime perpetuation,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,North Korea; Nuclear fuel cycle; Systemic maintenance,,"North Korea is unlikely to relinquish its nuclear program because of its importance to the perpetuation of the Kim regime. This conclusion arises from the observation that the nuclear program has been a long-term project spanning several decades, culminating in denuclearisation negotiations, which have followed a cyclical pattern in which the North has provoked crises to extract concessions and gain leverage vis-a-vis regional states. It is clear that the nuclear program has great intrinsic value to Pyongyang. First, this paper argues that the sunk costs of previous investment in the nuclear program, as evidenced by the infrastructure for the country's nuclear fuel cycle, create forward momentum favouring continuation of the nuclear program. Second, it argues that the nuclear program solidifies Kim regime rule as an institutional buttress, as a prop for the domestic economy, and as a vehicle for ideological legitimation. The paper is a unique contribution, which explicitly links the Kim regime's proliferation calculus to the economic and bureaucratic imperatives of regime perpetuation, as well as the sunk cost of previous investment in the nuclear program. It provides a coherent explanation for North Korea's consistent unreliability in negotiations, and offers insights into future prospects of the denuclearisation process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper compares the potential of building envelope improvements to those of a change in the occupant's behavioural pattern. Three cases of improvements together with a base case were analysed using exergy analysis, because the exergy concept is useful to understand the underlying processes and the necessary adjustments to the calculation of the heat-pump system. The assumptions for the occupant behaviour were set up based on our field measurements conducted in a dormitory building and the calculation was for steady-state conditions. It was found that the potential of occupant behavioural changes for the reduction in exergy consumption is more affected by the outdoor temperature compared to building envelope improvements. The influence of occupant behaviour was highly significant (more than 90% decrease of exergy consumption) when the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors is small, which is the case for long periods in regions with moderate temperatures during summer and/or winter.

This study, therefore, estimates the changes in price elasticity in the residential electricity market to examine the changes, if any, in household sensitivity (as a result of retail electricity market deregulation policies) to residential electricity rates. Specifically, six types of panel data are prepared, based on three cross-sections all states (except for Alaska and Hawaii) and the District of Columbia, deregulated states, and non-deregulated states and two time series the period before deregulation and the period after deregulation. The panel empirical analysis techniques are used to determine whether or not the variables are stationary, and to estimate price elasticity. We find that there is no substantial difference in the price elasticity between deregulated and non-deregulated states for both periods before deregulation and after deregulation. Thus, it can be said that the deregulation of the retail electricity market has not made consumers more sensitive to electricity rates and that retail deregulation policies are not the cause of price elasticity differences between deregulated and non-deregulated states.

This paper examines pig meat production in North-West Europe as a base case and runs different scenarios to investigate how improvements in terms of energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) savings can be feasibly achieved. As shown in the results of the analysis, pig farming in the EU has a high potential to reduce fossil energy use and GHG emissions by taking improvement measures in three aspects: (i) feed use; (ii) manure management; and (iii) manure utilization. In particular, a combination of improvements in all mentioned aspects offers the highest savings potential of up to 61% fossil energy and 49% GHG emissions. In weighing these three aspects, manure utilization for energy production is found to be the most important factor in reducing fossil energy use and GHG emissions. However, when GHG implications of land use change and land opportunity cost associated with the production of feed crops (e.g. soy meal, cereals) are considered, reducing feed use becomes the main factor in improving GHG performance of EU pork.

In this paper, we develop an economic model of groundwater management that explicitly incorporates spatial dynamic groundwater flow equations. Calibration of our model to published economic studies of specific aquifers demonstrates that existing studies generally incorrectly estimate the magnitude of the groundwater pumping externality relative to spatially explicit models. In particular, for large aquifers with surface areas of thousands of square miles, the marginal pumping externality predicted by single-cell models may be orders of magnitude less than that predicted by a spatially explicit model, even at large distances from a pumping well. Conversely, for small aquifers with areas of a few hundred square miles or less, single-cell models reasonably approximate the pumping externality. Application of single-cell models to inappropriate settings may result in misleading policy implications due to understatement of the magnitude and spatial nature of the groundwater externality.

As a result, governments have had little analytical support to complement expert judgment in the assessment of energy security. This is likely to be inadequate when considering multiple policy goals, and in particular the intersections between energy security and climate change mitigation policies. This paper presents an alternative approach which focuses on gauging the causes of energy insecurity as a way to assist policy making. The paper focuses on the energy security implications of fossil fuel resource concentration and distinguishes between the price and physical availability components of energy insecurity. It defines two separate indexes: the energy security price index (ESPI), based on the measure of market concentration in competitive fossil fuel markets, and the energy security physical availability index (ESPAI), based on the measure of supply flexibility in regulated markets. The paper illustrates the application of ESPI and ESPAI with two case studies France and the United Kingdom looking at the evolution of both indexes to 2030. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper begins to address these simplifications by assuming that transportation costs for manufactured goods are heterogeneous. Basic results are consistent with standard models showing dispersion of economic activity for high transport costs and eventual agglomeration as transport costs decline. However, several novel features arise too. Many unstable, dispersed equilibria exist for high average transport costs, but converge to a stable equilibrium path as transport costs decrease. Equilibrium paths smoothly transition from dispersion to agglomeration and do so at an increasing rate. Additionally, transport costs directly influence firms' location decisions and firms spatially sort by transport cost.","Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Lang, C (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, 404 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",cl395@cornell.edu,,,,,,,22,2,2,2,19,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1056-8190,,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Engineers are divided into two categories representing individuals of working age and those who are either retired or are close to retirement.

Expenditure per capita differs greatly across municipalities, even when accounting for the nature of the service. A spatial autoregressive model is used to test whether the decisions on the expenditure level in a neighboring municipality affect the municipality's own expenditure. The results show that a positive spatial interaction exists among neighbors. However, when controlling for level differences among counties the spatial interaction coefficient becomes negative although not significantly determined. Therefore, the positive interaction first found can be interpreted either as a result of differences in the way county councils diagnose individuals or due to interaction or mimicking among the neighbors belonging to the same county council.","Umea Univ, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Birkelöf, LC (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",lena.birkelof@econ.umu.se,,,,,,,21,6,6,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Survey respondents made choices between pairs of policy options with different characteristics. They favored policies starting in 2010 rather than 2012, and spending 20% of revenue raised on energy-related R&D.

While reflecting broader trends of resource nationalism, these relations have also been affected by a number of factors specific to these countries. In tracing the evolution of the oil investment frameworks of these countries, as well as their concomitant relations with IOCs, this paper probes the roles played by these factors and argues that the type and size of remaining reserves as well as the capability of NOCs are likely to determine the most future developments in the region's oil industry.

The implemented quota scheme allocates the country's annual, predetermined, tax exempt production of bio diesel to industries based on their ability to meet several criteria. A number of bio diesel supply chain stakeholders have criticized this policy for being efficiency-robbing and vague. This paper uses 2007 data from energy crop farms and three bio diesel-producing companies in order to assess these criticisms. We study the economic and environmental aspects of the currently adopted policy and compare them to three alternative scenarios. We conclude that such criticisms have a merit and that policy makers need to reconsider their alternative options regarding the promotion of bio diesel in transport. Permission of sales directly to local consumers and promotion of forward integration by farmers are efficiency enhancing and environment-friendly means of promoting the use of bio diesel in transport.

This evidence suggests the preference for aggregate stabilization policies in the North, Central and South regions. Moreover, this study finds that job creation seems to be an earlier reaction to the deep recession (December 2000-March 2002) than that of job destruction.

Urban-rural income disparity and urbanization: what is the role of spatial distribution of ethnic groups? A case study of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Western China, Regional Studies. Since economic reforms in 1978, China's economic growth and urbanization has occurred alongside dramatic increases in regional inequality, and a corollary threat to sustainable development and social cohesion. Using the case study of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Western China, this research clearly demonstrates that the spatial distribution of ethnic minorities reflects not only their spatial segregation, but also the degree of their socio-economic exclusion from the majority. As the income gap between the minority and majority population increases, the inclusion of minorities in the country's economic reforms is becoming increasingly critical for the future development of China.

The model quantifies the effect on aggregate economic variables, such as gross domestic product (GDP), employment and competitiveness, and also on individual sectors. With the principal demographic projections, the fall in population, and particularly working-age population, has a depressing impact on economic activity. By changing the demographic parameters, the impact of increasing net migration, a policy actively being pursued by the Scottish Government, is tracked. However, the required size of the annual net-migration needed to neutralize the adverse natural demographic changes is far higher than the current trends.","[Lisenkova, K.; McGregor, P.

The challenge for energy modellers is to quantify future energy savings associated with combinations of efficiency measures. This paper draws on the international experience in energy modelling and tracks recent progress that has been made towards a harmonised European framework for verification of savings. It points to the significant development work that remains to be done, particularly to enable an increased reliance on bottom-up evaluation methods. One significant gap in our knowledge relates to the required adjustment of technical savings due to behavioural factors such as rebound effects. The paper uses one country (Ireland) as a case study to demonstrate how a framework is being developed to respond to these new requirements. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose an innovative way of applying dynamic term structure models to predict future changes in interest-rate portfolios. Instead of directly forecasting the movements based on the estimated factor dynamics, we use the dynamic term structure model as a decomposition tool and decompose each interest-rate series into two components: a persistent component captured by the dynamic factors, and a strongly mean-reverting component given by the pricing residuals of the model. With this decomposition, we form interest-rate portfolios that are first-order neutral to the persistent dynamic factors, but are exposed to the strongly mean-reverting residuals. We show that the predictability on the changes of these interest-rate portfolios is significant both statistically and economically. We explore the implications of the predictability in future interest-rate modeling.","[Bali, Turan; Wu, Liuren] Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Heidari, Massoud] Caspian Capital Management LLC, New York, NY 10151 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Bali, T (通讯作者)，Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, 1 Bernard Baruch Way,Box B10-225, New York, NY 10010 USA.",turan.bali@baruch.cuny.edu; massoud.heidari@ccm.natixis.com; liuren.wu@baruch.cuny.edu,"Wu, Liuren/HGD-6691-2022",,,,,,31,16,17,4,15,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

To slow the increase in energy consumption by these cars, China began implementing passenger car fuel economy standards in two phases beginning in 2005. Phase I fuel consumption limits resulted in a sales-weighted new passenger car average fuel consumption decrease of about 11%, from just over 91/100 km to approximately 81/100 km, from 2002 to 2006. However, we project that upon completion of Phase 2 limits in 2009, the average fuel consumption of new passenger cars in China may drop only by an additional 1%, to approximately 7.9 1/100 km. This is due to the fact that a majority of cars sold in 2006 already meets the stricter second phase fuel consumption limits. Simultaneously, other trends in the Chinese vehicle market, including increases in average curb weight and increases in standards-exempt imported vehicles, threaten to offset the efficiency gains achieved from 2002 to 2006. It is clear that additional efforts and policies beyond Phase 2 fuel consumption limits are required to slow and, ultimately, reverse the trend of rapidly rising energy consumption and greenhouse gases from China's transportation sector.

This will require a rapid expansion of renewable energy generation, including wind electricity. Wind energy in New Zealand is commercially viable in many cases, yet opportunities for its exploitation are far from fully utilised. Many communities are showing resistance to wind farm developments, since large wind farms are often seen as intrusive. Building wind farms on a small scale may be a useful way of overcoming this problem. This study examines the pattern of recent wind industry development in New Zealand. It is argued that two key characteristics have emerged that are limiting the potential development of the industry: a trend towards large scale, leading to increased local opposition; and a small number of investors. Research methods include a review of international and local literature, and a rural mail survey questionnaire, with 338 respondents. We provide survey evidence that small wind farms, and community ownership of them, may be attractive to local communities, and that this point of advantage is helpful for the rapid expansion of wind generation in New Zealand.

The approach here is to model the electricity market in a context where the supply companies have market power. The model is then used to analyze the impact of government direct supply of peak capacity on the market. We find that the firms build less peak-generation capacity when the government procures peak generating capacity. The long-run equilibrium with N firms and government capacity of K-G results in an increase of total peak generation capacity of K-G/(N+1) compared to the long-run equilibrium with no government capacity. Supply disruptions of baseline capacity during the peak time period are also considered. It is found that peak prices do not go up any further with (anticipated) supply disruptions. Instead the entire cost of the extra peakers is borne by customers on traditional meters and off-peak customers who face real-time pricing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

According to a survey, electric motors account for more than 70% of the total growth from 1991 to 2004 in electricity consumption in this sector in Malaysia. To reduce electricity consumption, Malaysia should consider resetting the minimum energy efficiency standards for electric motors sometime in the coming year. The first step towards adopting energy efficiency standards is the creation of a procedure for testing and rating equipment. An energy test procedure is the technical foundation for all energy efficiency standards. energy labels and other related programs. The test conditions in the test procedure must represent the conditions of the country. This paper presents the process for the selection of an energy test procedure for electric motors in Malaysia based on the country's conditions and requirements. The adoption of test procedures for electric motors internationally by several countries is also discussed in this paper. Even though the paper only discusses the test procedure for electric motors in Malaysia, the methods can be directly applied in other countries without major modifications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Nordic and Swedish electricity markets are used as the empirical cases. Market concentration issues in the Nordic electricity market in general and in Sweden in particular have been, at least in initial screenings, approached by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). This article uses an alternative measure to HHI, which is based on market shares of the two largest firms in the market. The results shows that only the Swedish wholesale market has a firm that can be regarded as dominant, but only during very short periods. The results from a hypothetical merger between the second and third largest company in the Swedish wholesale market shows that when the dominant position of the largest firm is reduced, by increasing the size of the second largest firm, the threshold value indicates that competition actually will increase (contradicting to the HHI).

This article presents estimates of direct wind energy employment in all EU countries, gathered for the first time. By using a thematic survey, the authors have been able to analyse aspects such as gender distribution, company profiles and the shortage of skilled workers reported by wind energy companies. The outcomes show that wind energy deployment creates a significant number of jobs (over 104,000 in 2008), and does so at a time when other energy sectors are shrinking. There is a clear relationship between MW installed and number of jobs, but the use of a single EU job/MW ratio is not feasible, due to differences in the export/import capacity. Wind turbine manufacturers-including major sub-components-are responsible for the lion's share of the jobs, and there is a marked prevalence of males in the workforce.

This so-called direct rebound effect offsets the energy savings that may otherwise be achieved. This paper provides an overview of the theoretical and methodological issues relevant to estimating the direct rebound effect and summarises the empirical estimates that are currently available. The paper focuses entirely on household energy services, since this is where most of the evidence lies and points to a number of potential sources of bias that may lead the effect to be overestimated. For household energy services in the OECD, the paper concludes that the direct rebound effect should generally be less than 30%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Entrepreneurship and regional culture: the case of Hamamatsu and Kyoto, Japan, Regional Studies. Successful entrepreneurship today must respond to the demands from global market forces. Yet, simultaneously, entrepreneurs must also respond to local social contexts, shaped by historical and regional economic conditions. This paper illustrates how regional culture plays an important role in shaping entrepreneurship, even in a new economic sector. By taking two 'entrepreneurial regions' of Japan, Hamamatsu and Kyoto, it is shown how historical legacy and lead firms strongly influence business practices of information technology entrepreneurs. Results of this qualitative research show how entrepreneurship is an integral aspect of evolving and complex regional systems.

Strategic coupling of regional development in global production networks: redistribution of Taiwanese personal computer investment from the Pearl River Delta to the Yangtze River Delta, China, Regional Studies. From the perspective of strategic coupling of regional development in global production networks (GPN), this paper attempts to explore the dynamics and patterns of the redistribution of Taiwanese personal computer (PC) investment from the Pearl River Delta (PRD) to the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China since the early 2000s. Through firm-level interviews and case studies, it argues that the redistribution is resulted from divergent strategic coupling between respective Taiwanese firms in the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta and their lead firm counterparts fostered by different local institutional initiatives. The study further elucidates that regional development in the global economy has turned increasingly to trans-local dynamics.

Part of this effect may, however, result from a selection bias or environmental activism effect. Based on a pooled cross-section for the Netherlands for 1998-2005 we show that despite the correction for environmental activism the effect of the weight and bag unit-based pricing system on the quantity of waste is sizeable. Moreover, this environmental activism effect is decreasing over time, so that the most environmental friendly municipalities implement unit-based pricing systems at first. In addition, we show that the volume effects of the different unit-based pricing systems are rather stable over time. Although we find some evidence for a learning effect, nearly no evidence is found for an awareness erosion effect. This means at least that the effect of unit-based pricing does not decrease over time, which is reassuring from an environmental point of view. Pricing waste helps. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Every individual of each chromosome will make its own dynamic clone to build its new sub-swarm; then every new chromosome will be mutation in its low bit; at last, the QCEA will update the whole swarm by using random strategy. The algorithm not only has the global searching capacity, but also improves the local searching capacity of algorithm by using quantum probabilistic search. Experiments are implemented and compared with other QEAs. The result indicates that the new algorithm in this paper can search and get the global optimum solution in a shorter time.","[Qu Hongjian] Donghua Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhao Dawei; Zhou Fangzhao] Harbin Univ Commerce, Harbin, Peoples R China",Donghua University; Harbin University of Commerce,"Qu, HJ (通讯作者)，Donghua Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",quhongjian0451@163.com; zdwmr@sina.com; zhoufangzhao@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,23,+,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.134,0.0,,,2,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BLA43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269752000006,0

One of the flexibility provisions currently being considered is to allow countries to reach their individual targets by buying their renewable electricity deployment deficit from other countries with a surplus (i.e., with a renewable electricity deployment above their targets). This trade is likely to take the form of an exchange in guarantees of origin (GOs). GOs are currently implemented in Member States to fulfil the Renewable Electricity Directive requirement that each country has a system that allows the tracing of the source of each kWh of renewable electricity and informs on this source. Although the recent and tiny literature on the analysis of GO trading has focused on trade between firms, the exchange of GOs between governments has not received a comparable attention.

This corporatization policy has been used to restructure state-owned enterprises as well as govern a growing and diverse set of firms in a marketizing economy. The intent of these reforms is that, as has been found in other economies, incorporation should improve firm performance through granting previously state-owned and private firms the various legal forms that provide better protection of property rights and limited liability protection, among others. The findings are that incorporation improves firm performance separately from privatization and listing on stock markets. Even with an under-developed legal system and imperfect capital markets, incorporation generates a productivity improvement which bodes well for the emerging corporate sector in China.","[Li, Xiao Mei; Yueh, Linda] Univ Oxford, China Growth Ctr, Oxford OX1 4AR, England",University of Oxford,"Li, XM (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, China Growth Ctr, St Edmund Hall,Queens Lane, Oxford OX1 4AR, England.",xiao.li@seh.ox.ac.uk; linda.yueh@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,32,5,6,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

However, it managed meet less than 3 percent of its original goal by 2005. This study investigates what happened. More specifically, using a qualitative semi-structured interview approach with data presented in a narrative format, it answers the following five questions: (1) What are the primary energy policy and security challenges facing Malaysia? (2) What were the drivers behind the SREP in Malaysia? (3) What were the major benefits arising from the SREP? (4) What were the significant challenges to implementation? (5) What lessons or insights does the SREP offer for the study of energy policy design and implementation more generally? We find that the SREP failed to achieve its targets due to capacity caps, a lengthy approval process, lack of monitoring, exclusion of stakeholders, and few (if any) pre-feasibility studies. Other factors explaining its poor performance include opposition from the national utility Tenaga Nasional Berhad and electricity tariffs unmatched with true production costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis concludes that Japan's current power generation strategy is not optimized to achieve the government's three strategic energy objectives of simultaneously enhancing economic security, national energy security and environmental security (3Es). To achieve long-run energy sustainability, Japan needs to strive to phase out nuclear power, which is the centerpiece of its current power generation strategy. The analysis concludes by offering four suggestions for a sustainable 3E power generation strategy: (1) internalize all external costs associated with power generation technologies in order to level the economic playing field, (2) increase feed-in mandates for renewable energy to 20%, (3) fully liberalize the power generation industry and (4) intensify R&D in energy storage technologies to support intermittent renewable technologies.

After introducing neighbourhood effects into the theoretical model, we test the methodology using data on 8,429 firms established in the municipalities making up the Spanish region of Murcia. Our results show that human capital, agglomeration economies and industrial land availability are the main factors driving entrepreneurs' decisions. Estimates of the spatial component of the model indicate that spillovers or externalities taking place between municipalities (inter-territorial spatial effects) have a remarkable influence on the location decisions of the firms, thus confirming the need to account for such spatial dependence pattern when studying location decisions of industrial companies at a local level.","[Artal-Tur, Andres; Miguel Navarro-Azorin, Jose] Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Econ, Cartagena 30201, Spain; [Alama-Sabater, Luisa] Univ Jaume 1, Univ Inst Local Dev IIDL, Dept Econ, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universitat Jaume I,"Artal-Tur, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Econ, C Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Spain.",alama@eco.uji.es; Andres.artal@upct.es; Jmiguel.navarro@upct.es,"Sabater, Luisa Alama/L-1769-2014; Artal-Tur, Andres/M-2202-2018","Artal-Tur, Andres/0000-0003-3423-8570; Navarro Azorin, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-9698-1226",,,,,49,34,41,0,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

This research develops a model to understand how geographic dispersion of PV installations impacts the reliability of electricity generated from the total PV network, measured by the variance of the distribution of generated electricity. Using NREL data, beta probability distributions of sunlight (kWh/m(2)/day) in various regions of Virginia are estimated using a fitting method that minimizes the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic. A Monte Carlo simulation model is developed to measure PV electricity generation from multiple centralized and dispersed configurations over 100,000 days of probabilistic sunlight. There is a calculable tradeoff between average generation and generation variability, and increased geographic dispersion of PV installations can decrease this variability. Controlling variable generation through policies that promote efficient PV siting can help provide reliable power, minimizing the need for load-balancing peaking power infrastructure and costly electricity purchases from the grid. Using a tradeoff framework of generation and costs, this paper shows that geographically dispersed generation can mitigate the risk of unreliable solar generation that can significantly impact the end-user costs and make PV infrastructure unattractive.

J,"Fritsch, R",,,,"Fritsch, Remi",,,Comparative financial analysis of electricity utilities in West Africa,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity; West Africa; Tariff,,"Access to electricity is a major issue in West Africa. Governments have a difficult equation to solve. They naturally seek to offer their people a cheap kWh. But they are constrained by a production based largely on oil and therefore highly volatile production costs. How to fix an acceptable tariff, taking into account the investment needs required to expand the network and increase production? This analysis should provide some answers. The study presented in this paper provides a financial analysis of electricity utilities in West Africa. It allows a comparison of performances on a number of key financial ratios related to operations (Earning Before Interest Taxes Debt and Amortization/sales, working capital requirement/sales, days of receivables or payables), investment (net fixed assets/gross fixed assets), bank financing (financial structure, debt/EBITDA, interest expense/EBITDA) and economic and financial returns (Return On Capital Employed, Return On Equity). The conclusion focuses on the growth opportunity that the electricity sector could represent for each country. But this opportunity may only materialize if the EBITDA margins are restored. The available options appear limited and must be assessed taking into account the context of each country: tariff increase, improvement of technical losses or diversification into means of production no longer based primarily on oil or gas.

Solar technologies also had a prompt response to the promoting legislation of 2007. This evolution has generated side effects in the electricity generation system as a whole, and all this phenomenology is analysed in this paper under the consideration of the three objectives theoretically guiding electricity policy nowadays: security of supply (at macro and micro level), environmental quality, and economic competitiveness. The analysis points out some unbalance among the objectives, which can evolve to a scenario where back-up power is going to be a critical point for the stability of the system. Such a back-up service will surely be provided by gas-fired combined cycles (GFCC). The estimated projections of the generation system show that the required back-up power will grow about 8-9 GW by year 2020, for complying with the objective of attaining a share of 40% renewable electricity. However, collateral effects as the decline in the load factor of GFCC, as well as a reduction in spot price of electricity, can cast many doubts about the feasibility to reach that back-up power level.

An integrated technology assessment shows that CSP plants could play a promising role in Africa and Europe, helping to reach ambitious climate protection goals. Based on the analysis of driving forces and barriers, at first three future envisaged technology scenarios are developed. Depending on the underlying assumptions, an installed capacity of 120 GW(el), 405 GW(el) or even 1,000 GW(el) could be reached globally in 2050. In the latter case, CSP would then meet 13-15% of global electricity demand. Depending on these scenarios, cost reduction curves for North Africa and Europe are derived. The cost assessment conducted for two virtual sites in Algeria and in Spain shows a long-term reduction of electricity generating costs to figures between 4 and 6 ct/kWh(el), in 2050. The paper concludes with an ecological analysis based on life cycle assessment. Although the greenhouse gas emissions of current (solar only operated) CSP systems show a good performance (31 g CO2-equivalents/kWh(el)) compared with advanced fossil-fired systems (130-900 CO2-eq./kWh(el)), they could further be reduced to 18 g CO2-eq./kWh(el) in 2050, including transmission from North Africa to Europe.

First, the local energy demand is reviewed and crude oil, with 5.7% annual growth rate, is introduced as a major source to respond to the increasing domestic energy demand. Then, the national plans for controlling the local demand and replacing oil with other types of energy carriers are reviewed to create a view over the future of local demand for crude oil in Iran. In the next step, crude oil production and exploration situation in Iran are investigated and the required increase in production to maintain the present level of export is calculated. By estimating the average capital expenditures for adding each barrel of new capacity to Iran's daily oil production, the necessary annual investment to compensate the production drop and domestic consumption growth for maintaining the export is introduced. Then, the future of oil export in Iran is predicted in three optimistic, reference, and pessimistic scenarios on the basis of the country's ability in managing the financial resources in upstream oil industry. Finally, domestic and foreign investment and the history of buyback contracts and their undeniable role in development of Iranian oil and gas projects are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As DST was implemented in both the countries in 1980, we do not have a clear counterfactual in the form of a control period to identify the impact of DST directly with before and after or with and without analysis. This problem in the study is resolved by using equivalent day normalization technique to identify the impact of DST. The difference-in-difference (DID) average treatment effects model suggests an annual reduction of at least 1.0 percent in electricity consumption for both Norway and Sweden due to DST. The average annual electricity consumption reduction corresponding to DST effects equals 519 and 882 GWh for southern Norway and Sweden, resulting in an annual financial saving of 16.1 million Euros and 30.1 million Euros, respectively. The distribution of treatment effects across different hours of the day indicates a small but significant reduction in electricity consumption during the morning and a steep decline during the evening hours in both countries.

We present a firm-level engineering-economic analysis of a wind/CAES system with a wind farm in central Texas, load in either Dallas or Houston, and a CAES plant whose location is profit-optimized. With 2008 hourly prices and load in Houston, the economically optimal CAES expander capacity is unrealistically large 24 GW - and dispatches for only a few hours per week when prices are highest; a price cap and capacity payment likewise results in a large (17 GW) profit-maximizing CAES expander. Under all other scenarios considered the CAES plant is unprofitable. Using 2008 data, a baseload wind/CAES system is less profitable than a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plant at carbon prices less than $56/tCO(2) ($15/MMBTU gas) to $230/tCO(2) (S5/MMBTU gas). Entering regulation markets raises profit only slightly. Social benefits of CAES paired with wind include avoided construction of new generation capacity, improved air quality during peak times, and increased economic surplus, but may not outweigh the private cost of the CAES system nor justify a subsidy.

A number of changes have gradually been undertaken in terms of electricity tariff settings and their implementation to address specific requirements of the expansion of the power industry at each stage of its development. On-grid electricity tariffs had been used as a key lever to attract investment in power generation at an early stage of reform and then to encourage competition in the power industry. In response to the rising concerns about environmental protection and the promotion of clean energy utilisation, tariffs have progressively been developed for renewable electricity generation, which has contributed to massive expansion of the renewable power industry in China. This paper reviews key milestones of the development of on-grid electricity tariffs in China, examines the tariff-setting mechanisms of coal-fired power plants and renewable power generation, analyses the factors associated with the adjustments of the tariff levels and discusses the options for further reform and more effective electricity pricing.

First, we apply a double-bounded contingent valuation method to elicit Irish home owners' WTP for micro wind turbines, wood pellet boilers, solar panels and solar water heaters. Utilizing findings from the adoption of innovation literature, in a second step we assess the influence of antecedents on WIT for each of the four technologies, including (1) home owners' perception of product characteristics, (2) normative influences and (3) sociodemographic characteristics. Our results show that WTP varies significantly among the four technologies. More importantly, however, home owners hold different beliefs about the respective technologies, which significantly influence their WTP. The results provide valuable information for marketers and policy makers aiming to promote microgeneration technologies more effectively in consumer markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper documents this reorientation, which includes increased on-site electricity production, investments and investment plans for wind power, and new partnerships concerning investments in electricity production assets. We also assess the extent to which these changes can be attributed to key energy and climate policies. Our analysis shows that this strategic reorientation has been driven by changes in the underlying economic conditions for the pulp and paper industry, in particular increases in the price of electricity following the Swedish energy market reform in 1996, and the introduction of the EU ETS. The scheme for tradable renewable electricity certificates, on the other hand, has provided a new source of income. While these market-based signals and responses are the most dominant drivers of strategic change, cognitive changes in the pulp and paper industry have also played a role in the strategic reorientation. The cognitive changes concerning the functioning of the electricity market, i.e. the pricing of electricity and influence of the EU ETS, have been particularly important in this regard.

The value of lost load (VoLL) is the average willingness of electricity consumers to pay to avoid an additional period without power. VoLL is also known as the value of security of electricity supply and is inferred using a production function approach. Detailed electricity use data for the Republic of Ireland allows us to estimate the value of lost load by time of day, time of week and type of user. We find that the value of lost load is highest in the residential sector in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

The optimization model developed uses a genetic algorithm (GA) technique for the calculation of both the additional cost of electricity due to the penetration of RES-E technologies as well as the required RES-E levy in the electricity bills in order to fund this RES-E penetration. Also, the procedure enables the estimation of the optimum feed-in-tariff to be offered to future RES-E systems. Also, the overall cost increase in the electricity sector for the promotion of RES-E technologies, for the period 2010-2020, is analyzed taking into account factors, such as, the fuel avoidance cost, the carbon dioxide emissions avoidance cost, the conventional power system increased operation cost, etc. The overall results indicate that in the case of RES-E investments with internal rate of return (IRR) of 10% the cost of integration is higher, compared to RES-E investments with no profit, (i.e.. IRR at 0%) by 0.3-0.5 (sic)c/kWh (in real prices), depending on the RES-E penetration level. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides, the paper is based on acquired experience and observations obtained in EU TEMPUS project Environmental management in Russia and Ukraine, which lead to the successful implementation of EMS in 5 universities. A survey of EMS implementation cases in universities and observations from project experience let us formulate the principal benefits for EMS implementation. The implemented EMS, including Environmental policy, has a principal significance for various target groups at universities: for the whole university and university leadership, for academic staff, for students and society. Acquired experience from different universities brought to the conclusion, that successful EMS covers identification of direct and indirect environmental aspects in both fields: building and indoor environment, including waste, water and energy management issues, as well as, study and research process and environmental awareness for university staff and students. There is necessary to put attention to principal key points, which require large efforts in universities. They are: preparation for Environmental audits (training, identification of environmental aspects, adaptation of audit tools), identification of direct and indirect environmental aspects, elaboration of Environmental policy and EMS Manual. A principal possibility is use of facilitation tools, including project possibilities, which could facilitate EMS implementation, giving international experience and considerable contribution to initial training, including methodological issues, practical realization of environmental audits at universities and comprehensive consultations.","[Benders, Juris] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Environm Management, LV-1586 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,juris.benders@lu.lv,,,,,,,15,0,0,1,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,144,149,,,,,,6,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100019,0

In addition to reviewing and updating previous studies dealing with the uranium market analysis, in particular Amavilah (1995), the contribution of the paper lies in putting attention to some questions which are still either controversial or unanswered. They are especially related to the controversial hypothesis of the interdependence between uranium market and other commodities markets, both, with respect to the demand side, i.e. oil and coal markets, and the supply side, i.e. gold market. The paper also casts lights on electricity and uranium price effects on uranium demand as well as on the simultaneous interdependencies that may exist between nuclear consumption and nuclear installed capacity. The model is estimated for three different time periods which takes into account the major events that have influenced the nuclear-uranium development, that is, that have constrained the growth rate of nuclear generating capacity, i.e. oil crisis and nuclear accidents. This permits to show if uranium market reaction is independent or it is correlated with specific events associated with each time periods. The model was estimated by using the 3SLS method that correct for the presence of contemporaneously error terms correlation and for the existence of simultaneity bias in the model. Main results give evidence of significant correlation between uranium price and competing fossil fuel prices. They also point-out that uranium price is significantly correlated with the supply forces where supply is significantly dependent on gold prices. Moreover, results show that the electricity prices have a significant effect on the uranium demand only in the post-1990 period, probably following the worldwide electricity prices increasing trend. Further, our estimations show that uranium demand is significantly correlated with uranium price only in the period of nuclear major expansion. As for the nuclear electric consumption and the nuclear installed capacity, results show that they are simultaneously correlated and that the uranium demand depends on both of them, but only for the pre-1990 period. Interestingly, our results give evidence of low elasticities and inelastic reaction of independent model variables to exogenous variables fluctuations, except for the uranium price equation. Based on these results, some policy implications related to, first, the competitiveness of the uranium market and, second, to the supply-demand policy and the associated pricing mechanisms on the uranium market are discussed.

The identification of regional industrial clusters using qualitative input-output analysis (QIOA), Regional Studies. The 'cluster theory' has become one of the main concepts promoting regional competitiveness, innovation, and growth. As most empirical applications focus on measures of concentration of one industrial branch in order to identify regional clusters, the appropriate analysis of specific vertical relations is developing in this discussion. This paper tries to identify interrelated sectors via national input-output tables with the help of minimal flow analysis (MFA). The regionalization of these national industry templates is carried out with the allocation of branch-specific production values on regional employment. As a result, the paper shows concentrations of vertical clusters in only 27 of 439 German Nomenclature des Unites Territoriales Statistiques (NUTS)-3 regions.

One of the key initiatives for realizing this goal is the Top-1000 Energy-Consuming Enterprises program. The energy consumption of these 1000 enterprises accounted for 33% of national and 47% of industrial energy usage in 2004. Under the Top-1000 program, 2010 energy consumption targets were determined for each enterprise. The objective of this article is to evaluate the program design and initial results, given limited information and data, to understand the possible implications of its success in terms of energy and carbon dioxide emission reductions and to recommend future program modifications based on international experience with similar target-setting agreement programs. Even though the Top-1000 program was designed and implemented rapidly, it appears that - depending upon the GDP growth rate - it could contribute to somewhere between approximately 10% and 25% of the savings required to support China's efforts to meet a 20% reduction in energy use per unit of GDP by 2010.

However, as of 2008, less than 1% of global installations were based in China. Recently, the government has stated its grand ambitions of expanding the share of electricity derived from solar power. As part of this initiative, policy makers are currently in the process of drafting a feed-in tariff policy to support the development of the solar energy market. In this paper, we aim to calculate what the level of such a tariff should be. We develop a closed form equation for the cost of PV, and use forecasts on prices of solar systems to derive an optimal feed-in tariff, including a digression rate. The focus is on the potential of residential and small scale commercial solar PV installations. We show that the cost of small scale PV in China has decreased rapidly during the period 2005-2009. Our analysis also shows that optimal feed-in tariffs vary widely between regions within China, and that grid parity could be reached in large parts of the country depending on the expected escalation in electricity prices.

The net emission and cost impacts of PHEV use are intimately connected with the electricity generator mix used for PHEV charging, which will in turn depend on when during the day PHEVs are recharged. This paper analyzes the effects of a PHEV fleet in the state of Ohio. The analysis considers two different charging scenarios a controlled and an uncontrolled scenario which offer the grid operator different levels of control over the timing of PHEV charging. The analysis shows that PHEV use could result in major reductions in gasoline consumption of close to 70% per vehicle compared to a conventional vehicle (CV) under both charging scenarios.

The national standard, GB19577-2004, which sets the grade and scale of water chiller energy efficiency, has been implemented for five years and has produced achievements in energy-saving and emission reduction, which is a basic state policy in China. This paper presents extensive investigations on water chiller energy efficiency conducted in 2009 and compares these results with results from 2003. This analysis shows that the average energy efficiency level in 2009 was higher than in 2003. Moreover, large units with more than a 5000 kW cooling capacity have now appeared, and low efficiency units with EERs (energy efficiency ratios) below 3.8 have been phased out. The standard should be upgraded every five years. Therefore, this paper proposes a draft of a new energy efficiency standard. In the draft, thermodynamic perfectibility eta is presented to be used as an indicator instead of the EER; for eta, 0.4 is the minimum allowable value and 0.6 is the maximum value. There is one category of cooling capacities, from 100 to 2000 kW, in which the energy efficiency has a linear relationship with its cooling capacity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to assess the experience gained in this field in Europe overall, and in particular against the highly diverse settings of the different European nations, this paper examines the extent to which the Directive has been implemented by the 27 EU Member States. This is done via a comparative analysis assisted by two different indicators: of uniformity and of excellence. The measure of uniformity makes it possible to assess the degree of harmony of the individual Member States with regard to the parameters laid down by the European Commission, while the measure of excellence allows the Member States to be appraised and the best performers to be identified, i.e. the leaders as regards energy certification of buildings. The analysis conducted reveals how varied, the situation regarding energy certification in each country is in terms of implementation and scope of application and it also reveals that most countries are still at a halfway stage towards achieving excellence.

Since the early 1970s, growing dependence on foreign energy sources, oil in particular, has constrained US independence in foreign policy, and at times, inhibited economic stability and growth. Addressing oil dependence is politically and economically complex. Proposed solutions are multifaceted with various objectives such as energy efficiency and resource substitution. One solution is the partial transition from an oil- to coal-based economy. A number of facts support this solution including vast coal reserves in the US and the relative price stability, of coal. However, several roadblocks exist. These include uncertain recoverable reserves and the immaturity of clean coal technologies. This paper provides a first order analysis of the most efficient use of coal assuming the transition from oil to coal is desirable. Scenario analysis indicates two possible transition pathways: (1) bring the transportation sector onto the electric grid and (2) use coal-to-liquid fuels to directly power vehicles. The feasibility of each pathway is examined based on economic and environmental factors, among which are energy availability, affordability and efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Results indicate that partial transition of the transportation sector onto the electric grid offers the more viable solution for coal-based reduction of the US oil dependence. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent years have seen a growth in scenarios for assessing the implications of low carbor futures, but relatively little work has linked these energy scenarios to the broader literature on scenario development. This paper undertakes a methodological review of a selection of UK and international low carbon scenario studies, using a typology of 'trend based', 'technical feasibility' and 'modelling' studies. Dominant methodologies in such studies have been the 2 x 2 axis and the 'back-casting' approach. Strengths of the studies reviewed include technological detail, and identification of key economic and social constraints. Weaknesses include the over-reliance on constructs such as exogenous emissions constraints, and high level trends, which diminish the ability to understand how the various future scenarios could be brought about or avoided. This is compounded by the lack of depiction of specific system actors; the tendency to abstract policy from the scenarios; and the resulting failure to consider policy, technology and behaviour in an iterative, 'co-evolving' fashion.

A review of policies designed to stimulate the contribution of renewable sources highlights the continued reliance upon fossil fuels to supply current and future electricity needs in Australia. Potential CSP sites are defined in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia through overlaying environmental variables and electricity infrastructure on a high resolution grid using widely available datasets and standard geographical information system (GIS) software. The analysis confirms that CSP facilities can be sited over large areas of the Wheatbelt which can be tailored to local patterns of supply and demand. The research underlines the necessity to develop a policy regime which actively supports and stimulates CSP in order to capitalize upon its potential to facilitate rural economic development while contributing towards greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.

J,"Grubler, A",,,,"Grubler, Arnulf",,,The costs of the French nuclear scale-up: A case of negative learning by doing,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,France; Nuclear; Reactor costs,,"The paper reviews the history and the economics of the French PWR program, which is arguably the most successful nuclear-scale up experience in an industrialized country. Key to this success was a unique institutional framework that allowed for centralized decision making, a high degree of standardization, and regulatory stability, epitomized by comparatively short reactor construction times. Drawing on largely unknown public records, the paper reveals for the first time both absolute as well as yearly and specific reactor costs and their evolution over time. Its most significant finding is that even this most successful nuclear scale-up was characterized by a substantial escalation of real-term construction costs. Conversely, operating costs have remained remarkably flat, despite lowered load factors resulting from the need for load modulation in a system where base-load nuclear power plants supply three quarters of electricity. The French nuclear case illustrates the perils of the assumption of robust learning effects resulting in lowered costs over time in the scale-up of large-scale, complex new energy supply technologies. The uncertainties in anticipated learning effects of new technologies might be much larger that often assumed, including also cases of negative learning in which specific costs increase rather than decrease with accumulated experience.

Gasoline consumption is estimated using three approaches: from local fuel sales; by scaling from regional fuel sales; and from counts of vehicle kilometres travelled. A simplified version of an intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) method for estimating the GHG emissions from landfill waste is applied. Three measures of overall emissions are suggested: (i) actual emissions within the boundary of the city; (ii) single process emissions (from a life-cycle perspective) associated with the city's metabolism; and (iii) life-cycle emissions associated with the city's metabolism.

We compare two different policy instruments: a tax and purely domestic tradable permits, for the European Union, the US and Japan. Information on abatement costs and international permit price is imperfect and stems from nine global economic models. For a country party to the Protocol, the benefit of emission reduction is that it can sell more or has to buy less AAUs. We show that in this context, permits entail a slightly lower expected cost than a tax for the US and Japan, whereas both instruments yield an almost equal outcome for Europe. Applying Weitzman's framework (Prices vs. quantities. RES, 1974) in this context, we show the importance of the positive correlation between costs and benefits: technology shocks that lead to low abatement costs in one country generally lead to low abatement costs in other countries too, thereby leading to a low international permit price in the true-up period.

Without trade costs there is no role for geography. In empirical NEG studies the unavailability of direct trade cost data calls for the need to approximate these trade costs by introducing a trade cost function. In doing so, hardly any attention is paid to the (implicit) assumptions and empirical consequences of the particular trade cost function used. Based on a meta-analysis of NEG market access studies as well as on the results of estimating the NEG wage equation for a uniform sample while using different trade costs functions, we show that the relevance of the key NEG variable, market access, depends nontrivially on the choice of trade cost function. Next, we propose an alternative way to approximate trade costs that does not require the specification of a trade cost function, the so called implied trade costs approach. Overall, our results stress that the specification of trade costs can matter a lot for the conclusions reached in any empirical NEG study. We therefore call for a much more careful treatment of trade costs in future empirical NEG studies.","[Bosker, Maarten; Garretsen, Harry] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Int Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Bosker, M (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Int Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",e.m.bosker@rug.nl; j.h.garretsen@rug.nl,,,,,,,54,22,28,1,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1056-8190,,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

The possibility to realize an ambitious global emission reduction scenario is enhanced by coordinated action between countries in national policy implementation. An indicator for coordinated action is suggested. Targeted measures to increase deployment of nascent energy technologies and increasing energy efficiency in a small open economy like Norway are examined. The measures are evaluated against a set of baselines with different levels of spillover of technology learning from the global market. It is found that implementation of technology subsidies increase the national contribution to early deployment independent of the level of spillover. In a special case with no spillover for offshore floating wind power and endogenous technology learning substantial subsidy or a learning rate of 20% is required. Combining the high learning rate and a national subsidy increases the contribution to early deployment. Enhanced building code on the other hand may reduce Norway's contribution to early deployment, and thus the realization of a global emission reduction scenario, unless sufficient electricity export capacity is assured.

In contrast to former approaches, we take explicit account of the circulation of matter in the economy. We consider virgin resources and recycled wastes as essential inputs to production. These material inputs either end up as waste after consumption or are bound in the capital stock depending on the utilization of the produced output. As accumulating wastes can be recycled and again be employed in production, the waste stock serves as a source of valuable inputs in our model. We focus on the implications of recycling-related market failures and the integration of material balances on the dynamics of the economy. It is shown that a market for waste and subsidies to resource extractors and recycling firms can restore optimality in the decentralized economy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Enactment of the Electricity Act 2003 led to deepening of the reform process by dismantling this monopoly in the power sector. Primary issues emerging on account of transition from a single-buyer model to a multi-buyer multi-seller model include, among others, policy and regulatory initiatives related to open access, power exchanges, and transmission allocation and its pricing. The paper provides an overview of the status of competition in various segments of the power sector. It also reviews the phased program for open access outlined by various State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, including their status and impact on competition. The paper highlights a number of residual issues for the wholesale and retail competition, and also discusses the approach to address the same. These include liberalization of fuel markets, market monitoring, unbundling of retail tariffs, universal service obligation, supplier of last resort and demand response. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This is despite its potential to overcome some of the shortcomings associated with project-level assessment by intervening at higher levels of energy system planning. In this article, a review is presented of the extent to which SEA has been adopted and otherwise promoted in strategic energy planning processes in a wide range of countries throughout the world (with an emphasis on European Union nations). In this regard, the growing importance of regulatory compliance is underlined, especially within the EU, with a particular focus upon the application of SEA to grid systems. The case of the Belgian transmission system is described, illustrating a proactive approach to SEA. But the difficulties inherent in introducing SEA to an increasingly fragmented and liberalised sector are also drawn out, leading to suggestions by which these difficulties may be addressed.

The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) was established in 1999 and Australia also implemented one of the world's first renewable energy target schemes in 2001. With significant recent growth in wind generation, Australia provides an interesting case for assessing different approaches to facilitating wind integration into the electricity industry. Wind project developers in Australia must assess both potential energy market and Tradeable Green Certificate income streams when making investments. Wind-farm energy income depends on the match of its uncertain time varying output with the regional half hourly market price: a price that exhibits daily, weekly and seasonal patterns and considerable uncertainty. Such price signals assist in driving investments that maximize project value to the electricity industry as a whole, including integration costs and benefits for other participants. Recent NEM rule changes will formally integrate wind generation in the market's scheduling processes while a centralized wind forecasting system has also been introduced. This paper outlines experience to date with wind integration in the NEM, describes the evolution of market rules in response and assesses their possible implications for facilitating high future wind penetrations.

Given consumers' limited experience in residential buildings and the perceived uncertainty about their comfort benefits and resulting energy savings, these relatively new technologies might be undervalued by risk-averse consumers. Using the concept of certainty-equivalence, this paper proposes a model to assess the consumers' risk-aversion for adopting energy-efficient systems. These systems are treated as risky assets while conventional commodities are assumed to be risk-free. The curvature of the utility function is interpreted as a measure of aversion to perceived risks as opposed to explicit risks measured by observed variances. The proposed formulation is applicable in stated preference data with qualitative variables. The model is applied to data from a choice experiment conducted among 264 apartment tenants in Switzerland. The estimated curvatures reject the risk-neutrality hypothesis. The range of the estimated risk premiums suggests that risk considerations remain a central issue in dealing with energy efficiency in residential buildings. The analysis also indicates that assuming same risk attitudes toward new and conventional systems could bias the estimates of the willingness to pay, especially when the system is comprised of several components.

Everyday activities in the home are part of the private sphere that can be contested in relation to energy policies. This article discusses the public-private divide in energy policies and how Swedish municipal energy consultants understand the divide. By analyzing the actions of energy consultants and their efforts to influence households, as well as how households perceive this guidance, I will discuss the public-private discourse in relation to energy policy and how this discourse can be a restriction for the energy consultants to reach their full potential. The consultants found it problematic to discuss behavioral issues because they did not know how to relate to people's everyday life activities without intruding on private and personal matters. For the households tailored information and feedback was not perceived as the consultant trespassing in the private sphere. Instead, the householders highlight the possibilities of such mapping. Lessoned learned from Sweden is that state subsidies to local energy consultants is a good way to reach households, but that they need to develop their methods and use more tailored information.

The biofuel of choice, so far, has been ethanol produced from corn. The effects of increased corn-ethanol production on the consumer prices of food and energy continue to be studied and debated. This study examines, in particular, the effects of increased corn-ethanol production on US natural gas prices. A structural model of the natural gas market is developed and estimated using two stage least squares. A baseline projection for the period 2007-2018 is determined, and two scenarios are simulated. In the first scenario, current biofuel policies including EISA mandates, tariffs, and tax credits are removed. In the second scenario, we hold ethanol production to the level required only for largely obligatory additive use. The results indicate that the increased level of corn-ethanol production occurring as a result of the current US biofuel policies may lead to natural gas prices that are as much as 0.25% higher, on average, than if no biofuel policies were in place.

In this work we explore the potential of building-scale alternative energy technologies to reduce demand and emissions while also shielding building owners from the risks associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and grid electricity. We analyze the monetary costs and benefits over the life cycle of five technologies (photovoltaic and wind electricity generation, solar air and water heating, and ground source heat pumps) over three audience or building types (homeowners, small businesses, large commercial and institutional entities). The analysis includes a Monte Carlo analysis to measure risk that can be compared to other investment opportunities. The results indicate that under government incentives and climate of Toronto, Canada, the returns are relatively high for small degrees of risks for a number of technologies. Ground source heat pumps prove to be exceptionally good investments in terms of their energy savings, emission, reductions, and economics, while the bigger buildings tend also to be better economic choices for the use of these technologies.

Much analysis has been done of the Kyoto Protocol and other potential international greenhouse gas mitigation policies comparing the costs of achieving emission targets with and without trading. These studies often show large cost reductions for all Parties under trading compared to a no trading case. We investigate the welfare gains of including emissions trading in the presence of uncertainty in economic growth rates, using both a partial equilibrium model based on marginal abatement cost curves and a computable general equilibrium model. We find that the hedge value of international trading is small relative to its value in reallocating emissions reductions when the burden sharing scheme does not resemble a least cost allocation. We also find that the effects of pre-existing tax distortions and terms of trade dominate the hedge value of trading. We conclude that the primary value of emissions trading in international agreements is as a burden sharing or wealth transfer mechanism and should be judged accordingly. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

From this, the relative impact on UK transport oil demand from income, price, and efficiency are quantified. Moreover, the relative impact of the non-economic factors is also quantified, based on the premise that the estimated stochastic trend represents behavioural responses to changes in socio-economic factors and changes in lifestyles and attitudes. The estimated elasticities for income, price and efficiency are 0.6, -0.1, and -0.3, respectively, and it is shown that for efficiency and price the overall contribution is relatively small, whereas the contribution from income and non-economic factors is relatively large. This has important implications for policy makers keen to reduce transport oil consumption and associated emissions, but not willing to reduce the trend rate of economic growth. Taxes and improved efficiency only have a limited impact; hence, a major thrust of policy should perhaps be on educating and informing consumers to persuade them to change their lifestyle and attitudes and thus reduce their consumption through the non-economic instruments route.

One effect of this policy was a large increase in the consumption of low-sulfur bituminous coal by coal-fired power plants. However, low-sulfur bituminous coal is also the ideal coking coal for steel production. The analysis presented here will attempt to determine how the market responded to the increased consumption of low-sulfur bituminous coal by the electricity generation sector. Was there a decrease in the quality and/or quantity of coking coal consumption or did extraction increase? Most evidence suggests that the market for coking coal was unaffected, even as the extraction and consumption of low-sulfur bituminous coal for electricity generation increased substantially.

It has been claimed by many critics, however, that this 'entrepreneurial turn' presents conflicts with long established academic norms, procedures, and reward systems. This paper utilizes a national survey of faculty attitudes towards academic entrepreneurship to investigate the extent to which the 'entrepreneurial turn' has become accepted and taken-for-granted, to identify which academic entrepreneurial activities are deemed appropriate, or legitimate, and those that are widely regarded as inappropriate, and to identify the most salient dimensions by which faculty attitudes vary. The results provide evidence that the entrepreneurial turn within research universities in the US has not yet become 'taken-for-granted', that the norm of open science is still widely accepted and conflicts with some academic entrepreneurship activities. There seems to be a broad-though not consensual-agreement on the boundaries of what are deemed appropriate and legitimate entrepreneurial activities that spans disciplines and across prior levels of faculty experience in academic entrepreneurship.","Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Goldstein, HA (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, New E CB 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",hgold@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,26,83,83,2,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

According to the results, all power plants studied achieved acceptable overall operational efficiencies during 2004-2006, and the combined cycle power plants were the most efficient among all plants. The most important variable in this DEA model is the heating value of total fuels.

This paper examines the evolution of labour productivity in Japanese prefectures over the period 1968-2004. Employing Markov chain analysis, variance shift-share analysis, and analysis of variance, the paper demonstrates that during the period of fast productivity growth, the Japanese economy was characterized by an increasing polarization of productivity levels, while the period of slow growth since the early 1990s produced convergence in regional productivity levels.","[Essletzbichler, Juergen; Kadokawa, Kazuo] UCL, Dept Geog, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Essletzbichler, J (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Geog, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",j.essletzbichler@ucl.ac.uk; kazuo.kadokawa@ucl.ac.uk,,"Essletzbichler, Jurgen/0000-0002-2680-3691",,,,,37,9,10,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The large inflow of foreign direct investment into Romania, after the revolution in 1989, is exploited to study the determinants of foreign direct investment location in transition economies. Using a conditional logit set-up and choice-specific fixed-effects, it is found that external economies from service agglomeration are the main determinant of foreign direct investment location. An increase in service employment density by 10.0% makes the average Romanian county 11.9% more likely to attract a foreign investor. Industry-specific foreign and domestic agglomeration economies and labour conflicts also impact foreign direct investment location. A comparison with findings of other studies suggests that service agglomeration economies may be geographically quite localized.","[Hilber, Christian A.

Effects of interactions among social capital, income and learning from experiences of natural disasters: a case study from Japan, Regional Studies. This paper explores how and the extent to which social capital has an effect on the damage resulting from natural disasters. It also examines whether the experience of a natural disaster affects individual and collective protection against future disasters. There are three major findings. (1) Social capital reduces the damage caused by natural disasters. (2) The risk of a natural disaster makes people more apt to cooperate and, therefore, social capital is more effective to prevent disasters. (3) Income is an important factor for reducing damage, but hardly influences it when the scale of a disaster is small. [image omitted] Yamamura E.

This study presents a flexible fuzzy regression algorithm for forecasting oil consumption based on standard economic indicators. The standard indicators are annual population, cost of crude oil import, gross domestic production (GDP) and annual oil production in the last period. The proposed algorithm uses analysis of variance (ANOVA) to select either fuzzy regression or conventional regression for future demand estimation. The significance of the proposed algorithm is three fold. First, it is flexible and identifies the best model based on the results of ANOVA and minimum absolute percentage error (MAPE), whereas previous studies consider the best fitted fuzzy regression model based on MAPE or other relative error results. Second, the proposed model may identify conventional regression as the best model for future oil consumption forecasting because of its dynamic structure, whereas previous studies assume that fuzzy regression always provide the best solutions and estimation. Third, it utilizes the most standard independent variables for the regression models. To show the applicability and superiority of the proposed flexible fuzzy regression algorithm the data for oil consumption in Canada, United States, Japan and Australia from 1990 to 2005 are used. The results show that the flexible algorithm provides accurate solution for oil consumption estimation problem. The algorithm may be used by policy makers to accurately foresee the behavior of oil consumption in various regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As an illustrative example, an investigation is conducted for a typical residential building in Kitakyushu, Japan. A set of residential energy alternatives, including both conventional energy and renewable energy applications, are assumed for adoption. Based on the optimal design results from the linear programming, the various alternatives have been assessed against economic, energetic and environmental criteria. According to the evaluation results, currently, renewable energy systems are not competitive unless strong attention is paid to the environmental benefits.

It first focuses on the rising gas demand of the EU27 and elaborates alleged risks of dependence on Russia such as Gazprom's disagreement with Ukraine, which became an international gas crisis in January 2006 and also more recently in January 2009. Incentives and barriers of Europe's further cooperation with selected Caspian (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan) and Middle Eastern (Iran, Iraq and Egypt) countries are discussed. Supplies from Caspian are analyzed with a particular focus on Russia's role and the vested interests in the region. Supplies from the Middle East are elaborated with regard to Iran's huge and Iraq's emerging potentials in terms of natural gas reserves and foreign direct investments in the energy sector. The geopolitical analysis leads to a conclusion that the best strategy, and what seems more likely, for the EU is to include at least two countries from Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Iraq within its natural gas supply system.

In this paper, the acquisition and divestiture activities and strategies of utilities from France and Germany are analyzed in the context of the 2004 and 2007 EU enlargements. Through quantitative and qualitative data analysis, including the development of two case studies, the strategy for expansion and evolution in new member states is examined. The results demonstrate a concerted effort to establish economies of scale through ownership of distribution companies. A change in strategy occurs as these privatization opportunities disappear. Generation and trading activity become the growth area for these companies as electricity supply becomes another factor that can contribute to the economies of scale. Recent EU-supported efforts towards regionalization of electricity markets, positions these companies well due to their strong regional presence. This paper will explore these issues in the context of ownership and geographic distribution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, they expect a synergy effect between them. However, the two businesses do not have technology similarities at the level that the gas service produces a synergy effect with electricity. To examine whether there is a synergy effect of corporate diversification in the industry, we compare electricity-specialized firms with diversified utility firms in terms of their financial performance and corporate value.

In most cases, all three estimators display satisfactory performance, except when the number of time periods is very small.","[Arulampalam, Wiji; Stewart, Mark B.] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Arulampalam, Wiji] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Warwick; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Arulampalam, W (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",wiji.arulampalam@warwick.ac.uk; mark.stewart@warwick.ac.uk,"Stewart, Mark/A-9496-2008; Arulampalam, Wiji/D-3758-2012","Arulampalam, Wiji/0000-0002-6760-1412","ESRC [RES-000-22-0651, RES-000-22-2611]; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-0651, ES/F029969/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F029969/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The authors are grateful for financial support from the ESRC under research grants RES-000-22-0651 (Arulampalam) and RES-000-22-2611 (Stewart).

This includes the parameters of power, engine size and weight, which beyond the technological efficiency of the motor engine itself, are considered to be the main determinants of the fuel efficiency of the average car stock. Investigating the drivers of ever rising transport related greenhouse gas emissions is crucial in order to derive policies that strive towards more energy-efficient on-road passenger mobility. We focus on the efficacy of technological efficiency improvements in mitigating climate-relevant emissions from car use in light of shifting demand patterns towards bigger, heavier and more powerful cars. The analysis is descriptive in nature and based on a bottom-up database that was originally collated for the purpose of the present study. Technological data on car models, which includes tested fuel consumption, engine size, power and weight, is related to registered car stock and, in parts, to newly registered cars. From this, we obtain an original database of the Austrian passenger car fleet, i.e. information on consumer choice of specific car models, segregated by gasoline and diesel fuelled engines. Conclusions are derived for policies aimed at reducing the fossil fuel consumption of the moving vehicle fleet in order to contribute to a low carbon society. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the importance of research collaborations in network formation has been generally recognized, relatively little research has investigated why some regions are able to attain prominent network positions, while others do not. We analyze a spatially detailed data base of EU Framework Program-supported research ventures in Austria to understand how specific geographical nodes come to occupy important positions within key research networks. The paper deploys what is termed here a network positioning function to investigate the question of network centrality and at the same time to illustrate the possibilities of combining network and spatial analysis to examine this or other research questions where similar approaches might be applicable. Findings reveal the factors important for understanding advantageous positions enjoyed by regional districts as measured by alternative centrality concepts. Concepts that distinguish innovation exploitation from exploration were used to interpret network positions, which further clarify positioning in highly localized versus distant member networks.","[Bergman, Edward M.; Maier, Gunther] Vienna Univ Econ & Business Adm, Inst Reg Dev & Environm, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Bergman, EM (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business Adm, Inst Reg Dev & Environm, Vienna, Austria.",Edward.Bergman@wu-wien.ac.at; Gunther.Maier@wu-wien.ac.at,"Maier, Gunther/AAJ-7503-2020",,,,,,41,22,23,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

A time series analysis has been applied based on the logarithmic mean Divisia index I (LMDI I) methodology, which belongs to the wider family of index decomposition approaches. The particularity in road transport that justifies a profound analysis is its remarkably rapid growth during the last decades, followed by a respective increase in emissions. Denmark and Greece have been selected based on the challenging differences of specific socio-economic characteristics of these two small EU countries, as well as on the availability of detailed data used in the frame of the analysis. In both countries, passenger cars are responsible for half of the emissions from road transport as well as for their upward trend, which provokes the implementation of a decomposition analysis focusing exactly on this segment of road transport. The factors examined in the present decomposition analysis are related to vehicles ownership, fuel mix, annual mileage, engine capacity and technology of cars. The comparison of the results discloses the differences in the transportation profiles of the two countries and reveals how they affect the trend of CO2 emissions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The results are best interpreted as an estimate of the percentage growth in energy consumption that would have resulted from the change in the relevant factor (e.g. length of haul) had the other factors remained unchanged. The results demonstrate that the main factor contributing to the decoupling of UK road freight energy consumption from GDP was the decline in the value of domestically manufactured goods relative to GDP. Over the period 1989-2004 this largely offset the effect of increases in GDP on road freight energy consumption. While the decline in domestic manufacturing was to some extent displaced by increases in imports, the net effect of these supply factors, together with shifts in the commodity mix, has been to reduce UK road freight energy consumption by 30.1%. The net effect on global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is likely to be somewhat less beneficial, since many freight movements associated with the manufacture of imported goods have simply been displaced to other countries.

Monitoring cost and price decline for these technologies is thus important in order to establish effective energy policy. Here, we present experience curves and cost-benefit analyses for condensing gas boilers produced and sold in the Netherlands between 1981 and 2006. For the most dominant boiler type on the Dutch market, i.e., condensing gas combi boilers, we identify learning rates of 14 +/- 1% for the average price and 16 +/- 8% for the additional price relative to non-condensing devices. Economies of scale, competitive sourcing of boiler components, and improvements in boiler assembly are among the main drivers behind the observed price decline. The net present value of condensing gas combi boilers shows an overall increasing trend. Purchasing in 2006 a gas boiler of this type instead of a non-condensing device generates a net present value of 970 EUR (Euro) and realizes CO(2) (carbon dioxide) emission savings at negative costs of -120 EUR per tonne CO(2). We attribute two-thirds of the improvements in the cost-benefit performance of condensing gas combi boilers to technological learning and one-third to a combination of external effects and governmental policies.

To control the two-way flows of electricity, the current passive network configurations will need to be replaced by active network management. This will require, in particular, innovations in intelligent IT-based network control. This paper draws on research on Large Technical Systems (LTS) and control systems in other sectors to analyse the evolution of electricity network control in western Denmark and the UK, since the Second World War. It concludes that lack of progress in network control has only recently-largely because of the combined needs to provide greater reliability and 'green' electricity within liberallised markets-emerged as a 'reverse salient' that will prevent the further development of the ITS of electricity supply industry towards desired direction. Breaking the inertia in the LTS and its control systems will require determined government action to promote learning and collaborative search for solutions.

The methodology adopted proposes various procedures based on the water consumption profiles, total head, tank capacity and photovoltaic array peak power. A method of the load losses probability (LLP) has been used to optimize sizing of the photovoltaic Pumping systems with a similarity between the storage energy in batteries and water in tanks. The results were carried out using measured meteorological data for four localities in Algeria: Algiers and Oran in the north, Bechar and Tamanrasset in the south. The results show that the performance of the photovoltaic pumping system depends deeply on the pumping total head and the peak power of the photovoltaic array.

The consequence is increased desertification and high erosion and loss of soil nutrients leading to declining agricultural productivity. However, the social costs of the deforestation externality are not taken into account in present forest management and land use planning in Sudan leading to tinder-pricing and over-exploitation of the country's forest resources. This study evaluated the suitability of approaches commonly used by most forest resource management agencies for prediction of the state and control of harvesting of forest resources against alternative empirical simulation models using relevant information about economic behaviour of trading agents in the fuelwood market. Results showed the clear Superiority of models integrating market behaviour over current approaches in the ability to better simulate real trends of wood consumption and hence depletion rates. The study also adopted an optimal control model to derive socially optimal forest harvesting regimes. The results showed that Current rates of forest resource rent recovery and reforestation efforts are very far from optimal. Results also suggest that, in addition to optimal pricing and higher reforestation efforts, promotion and availability of fuel substitutes and investment in wood energy conversion efficiencies have a strong potential for curbing the problem of deforestation in Sudan.

This conversion can be achieved for example, by replacing electrical heating with DH and compression cooling with heat-driven absorption cooling. Conversion to DH must, however, always be an economically attractive choice for an industry. In this paper the effects for industries and the local DH supplier are analysed when pricing DH by marginal cost in combination with industrial energy efficiency measures. Energy audits have shown that the analysed industries can reduce their annual electricity use by 30% and increase the use of DH by 56%. When marginal costs are applied as DH tariffs and the industrial energy efficiency measures are implemented, the industrial energy costs can be reduced by 17%. When implementing the industrial energy efficiency measures and also considering a utility investment in the local energy system, the local DH supplier has a potential to reduce the total energy system cost by 1.6 million EUR. Global carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced by 25,000 tonnes if the industrial energy efficiency measures are implemented and when coal-condensing power is assumed to be the marginal electricity source.

These seven countries together generated 58% of global electricity and they are responsible for more than two-thirds of global CO(2) emissions from electricity generation in 2005. The analysis shows production effect as the major factor responsible for rise in CO(2) emissions during the period 1990-2005. The generation structure effect also contributed in CO(2) emissions increase, although at a slower rate. In contrary, the energy intensity effect is responsible for modest reduction in CO(2) emissions during this period. Over the 2005-2030 period, production effect remains the key factor responsible for increase in emissions and energy intensity effect is responsible for decrease in emissions. Unlike in the past, generation structure effect contributes significant decrease in emissions. However, the degree of influence of these factors affecting changes in CO(2) emissions vary from country to country. The analysis also shows that there is a potential of efficiency improvement of fossil-fuel-fired power plants and its associated co-benefits among these countries. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Explaining regional export performance in a developing country: the role of geography and relative factor endowments, Regional Studies. This paper investigates the role of geography in explaining trade. It estimates and contrasts two models, a so-called 'Skills-to-Land Heckscher-Ohlin Model' following the work of Wood and Berge (1997) and a 'Geography Heckscher-Ohlin-Von Thunen model' following that of Redding and Venables (2004). Using panel data across 354 South African magisterial districts over the period 1996 to 2000, it was found that only 22 magisterial districts in South Africa were responsible for 85% of the country's manufacturing exports. While the geography model (with distance, market effects, fixed costs and institutions) offers an overall better explanation for the manufactured export performance of the country's magisterial districts, evidence was also found to support the Skills-to-Land Heckscher-Ohlin model. The empirical evidence suggests that regions that are larger in terms of economic size, with good foreign market access and know-how of foreign markets, with competitive transport costs, good local institutions and higher proportions of skilled workers, will be more successful in exporting manufactured goods.","[Naude, Wim] United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, FIN-00160 Helsinki, Finland; [Naude, Wim] NW Univ, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Gries, Thomas] Univ Paderborn, Dept Econ, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany",North West University - South Africa; University of Paderborn,"Naudé, W (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, FIN-00160 Helsinki, Finland.",naude@wider.unu.edu; Thomas_Gries@notes.uni-paderborn.de,"Naudé, Wim/E-3812-2017","Naudé, Wim/0000-0003-2496-6945",,,,,32,10,10,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

At the national and international scales there have been some efforts for constructing measures of energy poverty. However, much more needs to be done to develop an internationally consistent measurement framework and to put in place data collection systems that will enable regular reporting. At the programme and project level, indicator systems by necessity need to be designed for specific purposes. Nevertheless, the article proposes that in many instances it is desirable to widen the scope of metrics used for designing and evaluating policies and programmes. In the past, monitoring and evaluation indicators have focused largely on outputs, service delivery or dissemination. Central to the recommendations laid out in the paper is the call for widening the focus of evaluation and necessity to design indicators that adequately assess the needs of beneficiaries and describe the living conditions of families and communities, who are targeted by such programmes and initiatives.

This study combined an evaluation of solar energy resources in Taiwan with land use analysis, which allows the potentials and restrictions of solar energy exploitation resulting from local land use conditions to be considered. The findings unveiled in this study indicate that photovoltaic electricity generation and solar water heating have the potential of producing 36.1 and 10.2 TWh of electricity and thermal energy annually in Taiwan, accounting for 16.3% and 127.5% of the total domestic consumption of electricity and energy for household water heating in 2009, respectively. However, the exploited solar photovoltaic power generation in 2009 accounted for only 0.02% of total potential in Taiwan, while the exploited solar water heating accounted for 11.6% of total potential. Market price and investment incentive are the dominant factors that affect market acceptance of solar energy installation in Taiwan. The administrative barriers to the purchase and transmission of electricity generated from renewable energy sources have to be removed before the potential contribution of solar energy can be realized.

First, we characterize the set of decentralized equilibria: a particular equilibrium is associated with any vector of policy instruments including a carbon tax and a subsidy to each R&D sector. Second, we show that it is possible to express any equilibrium as the solution of a maximization program. Third, we solve the first-best optimum problem and thereby deriving the optimal instruments. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical model using calibrated functional specifications. In particular, we investigate the effects of various combinations of policy instruments (including the optimal ones) by determining the deviation of each corresponding equilibrium from the laisser-faire benchmark. We find notably that introducing an R&D subsidy hardly affects emissions when a carbon tax is already implemented, thus revealing a complementary effect between these two policy instruments.

We build a novel database of worldwide patent applications in efficiency-improving fossil fuel technologies for electricity generation and then analyse patenting trends over time and across countries. We find that patenting has mostly been stable over time, with a recent decreasing trend. OECD countries represent the top innovators and the top markets for technology. Some non-OECD countries, and particularly China, are also very active in terms of patenting activity in this sector. The majority of patents are first filed in OECD countries and only then in BRIC and other non-OECD countries. BRIC and other non-OECD countries apply for patents that are mostly marketed domestically, but BRIC countries represent important markets for patent duplication of OECD inventions.

Four driving forces, including emission intensity, economic production structure, export composition, and total export volume, are compared for their contributions to the increase of embodied CO2 emissions using a structural decomposition analysis (SDA) technique. Although offset by the decrease in emission intensity, the increase of embodied CO2 emissions was driven by changes of the other three factors. In particular, the change of the export composition was the largest driver, primarily due to the increasing fraction of metal products in China's total export.

This is mainly triggered by the current success of Brazilian bioethanol production for the domestic market and for export. Furthermore, the global biofuel market is expected to increase due to ambitious biofuel programmes in the EU and in the USA. Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Guatemala are focusing on bioethanol production from sugarcane whereas biofuel production in Argentina is based on soy biodiesel. Recent developments of the biofuel sector take place extremely rapid especially in Argentina, which became one of the five largest biodiesel producers in the world in 2008. Till date no specific biofuel sustainability certification systems have been implemented in Latin American, as well as on global level. This fact and the predominant use of food crops for biofuel production raise concerns about the sustainability of biofuel production related to environmental and social aspects.

A major barrier to effective policymaking, and to more global acceptance of the energy efficiency potential in industrial motor systems, is the lack of a transparent methodology for quantifying the magnitude and cost-effectiveness of these energy savings. This paper presents the results of groundbreaking analyses conducted for five countries and one region to begin to address this barrier. Using a combination of expert opinion and available data from the United States, Canada, the European Union, Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil, bottom-up energy efficiency supply curve models were constructed to estimate the cost-effective electricity efficiency potentials and CO(2) emission reduction for three types of motor systems (compressed air, pumping, and fan) in industry for the selected countries/region. Based on these analyses, the share of cost-effective electricity saving potential of these systems as compared to the total motor system energy use in the base year varies between 27% and 49% for pumping, 21% and 47% for compressed air, and 14% and 46% for fan systems.

Durban's energy strategy prioritises energy efficiency at industries as a key action, whilst industries are also the focus of the city's air quality management plan (AQMP). In this paper, measures that have been introduced in industries in Durban to effect air quality improvements and reduce energy consumption are examined in terms of their respective impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions. It was found that co-benefits for GHG mitigation were achieved when petroleum refineries switched from using heavy fuel oil to refinery gas and methane rich gas. Within other industries, co-benefits for air quality stemmed from reducing fossil fuel energy consumption and the improved efficiency of combustion systems. Air quality and energy policies in the city are being executed independently, without consideration of the trade-offs or synergies of the interventions being implemented. Recommendations are made for authorities and industries to consider the co-benefits for GHG mitigation in their AQMPs and where these are not possible to consider offsetting the increased GHG emissions through improved alignment with energy strategies.

Consequently, it is crucial that oil exporters realize their full production potential. Current debates on energy security are often focused on short-term risks e.g. sudden disruptions due to wars, domestic instability, etc. However, when it comes to assessing oil supplier reliability it is equally important to assess their longer term ability and willingness to deliver oil to the global market. This study analyzes the effects of petroleum investment policies on crude oil production trends in 14 major oil producing countries (2000-2010) by focusing on the political-institutional frameworks that shape the investment conditions for the upstream oil sector. Our findings indicate that countries with less favorable oil sector frameworks systematically performed worse than countries with investor friendly and privatized sectors. The findings indicate that assessments based on remaining reserves and planned production capacities alone could inflate expectations about future oil supplies in a world where remaining crude reserves are located in countries with unfavorable investment frameworks.

In light of these circumstances, this empirical study set out with the intention of estimating the scope of households' response to, and assessing customers' perception of, a demand-based time-of-use electricity distribution tariff. The results show that households as a whole have a fairly high opinion of the demand-based tariff and act on its intrinsic price signals by decreasing peak demand in peak periods and shifting electricity use from peak to off-peak periods.

It presents the legal framework and current status of the Portuguese PV electricity sector, and compares the country to other European nations: France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. A model that combines PVGIS with a self-developed financial tool is used to assess the feasibility of a 150 kW mini-generation system using five different technologies: fixed mount, single-axis tracking, double-axis tracking, low concentration and medium concentration (MCPV). The profitability of the mini-generation systems in the seven countries studied is calculated and compared. According to this analysis. MCPV and, of the conventional technologies, the single-axis tracking systems are the most profitable technologies. Despite the attractiveness of the current Portuguese feed-in tariffs and of the abundant solar resource, investors are discouraged and the country's PV market is far from mature. Specific mini-generation regulations should focus on a fast and transparent licensing procedure and should promote the access to financing.

It reviews energy supply and demand, pricing and subsidies as well as institutional arrangements and respective reform projects from the perspective of assessing achievements. It identifies the consequences of the policy and the long-term outlook and reports on the internal policy struggle. The policy strategy of 2007 is directed at energy security, social and industrial development. Environmental or climate objectives play no role. Energy efficiency is at best considered an instrument. The implementation of the strategy has been successful on the supply side, but not on the demand side. Price reform, refocusing subsidies and sector reform were not achieved. This has negatively affected energy efficiency and diversification, energy availability and supply security, the State budget and the sector's financial capacity. It causes rising energy import requirements and increasing risks to the current account balance. In spite of that, old guard and industrial establishment favour the resource-based development based on cheap energy and protract price reform, whereas another group of businessmen wants a sustainable development concept and monetize the oil and gas production to invest in Egypt's competitiveness.

This development confronts their political leaders with the question of how to expand or diversify their countries' generation capacities. In this context, renewable energies and nuclear power constitute options that have rarely been exploited so far in the region. This article analyzes the drawbacks and benefits of both alternatives, with a special focus on import and export dynamics. When attempting to make the strategic decision between renewables and atomic power, North African regional specifics and circumstances have to be taken into account. Hence, in a first step, the article characterizes the energy systems of the North African countries and presents scenarios for their future development. In a second step, it scrutinizes the energy challenges these states face in terms of domestic concerns and foreign affairs. Finally, a case study of Algeria is used to demonstrate how renewable energies, but not nuclear power, are able to respond to North African energy challenges. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on a household survey conducted in rural Bangladesh, we first identify the impact of SHS on the reduction in energy costs and compare purchasing costs. We then examine household lifestyle changes following the adoption of SHS. Finally, we consider several price-reduction scenarios to examine the potential demand for SHS and to evaluate its future dissemination potential. The results of the analysis indicate that households with SHS successfully reduce their consumption of kerosene and dependency on rechargeable batteries, with the cost reductions accounting for some 20-30% of monthly expenditures on SHS. Moreover, most households with SHS can enjoy its benefits, including electric lighting, watching television, and the ease of mobile phone recharging at home. Further, the price reduction can make possible potential demand in more than 60% of households without SHS, while additional price reductions promote the purchase of even larger SHS packages. This study concludes that even though the scale of single SHS is small, the micro-benefits for each household and the dissemination potential are substantial. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Projected transport demand is calculated with Genetic Algorithm (GA) using population, gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC) and the number of vehicles. The energy consumption is modelled with the GA using the veh-km. The model age of the vehicles and their corresponding share for each year using the reference years is obtained. The pollutant emissions are calculated with estimated transport and energy demand. All the calculations are made in line to meet the European standards. For this purpose, two cases are composed. Case 1: Emissions based on energy consumption, and Case 2: Emissions based on transport demand. The both cases are compared. Three policies are proposed to control demand and the emissions. The policies provided the best results in terms of minimum emissions and the reasonable share of highway and railway mode as 70% and 30% usage for policy I. respectively. The emission calculation procedure presented in this study would provide an alternative way to make policies when there is no adequate data on emission measurement in developing countries.

The snow disaster that hit Southern China in 2008 caused serious damages to the power systems, which made Chinese government realize that they cannot solely depend on power enterprises to effectively control the risk involved in power system. The Chinese government needs to collaborate with power enterprises in strengthening Electricity Regulation and taking countermeasures to reduce the risk of Large-area Power Outages. This paper first proposes an objective, practical and adaptive Electrical Security Risk Assessment System based on Electricity Regulation. The system consists of an assessment process with 278 indices, which are used to calculate the risk of Large-area Power Outages by the use of Analytic Hierarchy Process and the Delphi Method. Then, an example of Guangdong power system serves to illustrate the detailed implementation procedures of the proposed assessment system and the results show that Guangdong power system faces a moderate risk of Large-area Power Outages. Finally, some countermeasures are proposed to overcome the defects in the existing power system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[You, A. Dahai; Chen, B. QingQian; Yin, C.

Three main determinants of the power sector's emissions are identified: the demand for electricity, the CO2 price, and fuel prices. A counterfactual scenario has been set up for each of these, i.e., what these parameters would have been if not affected by the recession. A simulation model of the European power sector is then employed, comparing a historical reference simulation (taking the parameters as actually occurred) with the counterfactual scenarios. The lower electricity demand (due to the recession) is shown to have by far the largest impact, accounting for an emission reduction of about 175 Mton. The lower CO2 price (due to the recession) resulted in an increase in emissions by about 30 Mton. The impact of fuel prices is more difficult to retrieve: an indicative reduction of about 17 Mton is obtained, mainly as a consequence of the low gas prices in 2009. The simulated combined impact of the parameters results in an emission reduction of about 150 Mton in the European power sector over the years 2008 and 2009 as a consequence of the recession.

From 1999 to 2009, this industry had a 42% compound annual growth-rate. From 2009 to 2013, it is expected to grow to 45%, and in 2013 the achievement of grid parity - when the cost of solar electricity becomes competitive with conventional retail (including taxes and charges) grid-supplied electricity - is expected in many places worldwide. Grid-connected PV is usually perceived as an energy technology for developed countries, whereas isolated, stand-alone PV is considered as more suited for applications in developing nations, where so many individuals still lack access to electricity. This rationale is based on the still high costs of PV when compared with conventional electricity. We make the case for grid-connected PV generation in Brazil, showing that with the declining costs of PV and the rising prices of conventional electricity, urban populations in Brazil will also enjoy grid parity in the present decade. We argue that governments in developing nations should act promptly and establish the mandates and necessary conditions for their energy industry to accumulate experience in grid-connected PV, and make the most of this benign technology in the near future.

Among all the economic and social effects originated by the arrivals of immigrants, the literature has paid some attention to the potential effect that this immigration can produce on the internal migration patterns (the so-called displacement effect). This paper proposes the use of a multi-region input output model of migrations for measuring how the reception of immigrants in one region displaces population among all the regions included in the model. From some basic assumptions, the input output methodology proposed describes how the arrival of one immigrant in one region i, by the dissemination of internal population from i, generates indirect effects on other region j.

Different growth patterns emerge among them. The most successful regions are those with a strong presence of high value-added functions, of best-performing vulnerable sectors, but also with high Structural Funds expenditure on human resources. Moreover, among the industrial strategies analysed, it is found that the only winning strategy explaining higher productivity gains is industrial reconversion at the expense of employment growth.","[Affuso, Antonio; Capello, Roberta; Fratesi, Ugo] Politecn Milan, Dept Bldg Environm Sci & Technol, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Affuso, A (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Bldg Environm Sci & Technol, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",antonio.affuso@polimi.it; roberta.capello@polimi.it; ugo.fratesi@polimi.it,"LABIB, RAFIK F/G-1619-2012; Fratesi, Ugo/IAM-5881-2023","Fratesi, Ugo/0000-0002-0755-460X; Capello, Roberta/0000-0003-0438-6900",,,,,42,20,21,4,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The issues of territorial cohesion and urban development are linked with several global challenges, therefore timely action might help to ensure that the planned legislative initiatives are in compliance with ongoing processes. This is also very important issue at national level in Latvia. The Territorial Agenda[2] approved in 2007 states that territorial features, specifics and existing potential should be used to promote territorial development based on integrated regional development policy. The author's research shows the importance to assess existing territorial divergence and to find the best ways for using existing specifics towards comparative advantages. In this context there is strong need for identifying existing potentials, cooperation solutions and the most effective forms of governance in order to promote regional competiveness and development of necessary infrastructure and find the right balance in the use of resources. The latest developments towards territorial cohesion show that the economic bases of regions have to be considered as a starting point for the strategic planning processes. Also the development scenarios should include region-specific opportunities for innovation and spread of economic activities in the regions.

This paper estimates price and income elasticities of demand for housing characteristics using the information of properties appraised in the city of Barcelona (1998-2001). It employs a two-stage approach, estimating hedonic price equations for different districts in order to estimate subsequently the corresponding demand equations. The results allow an analysis to be made of the complementarity or substitutability relationships among the characteristics analysed, and also to catalogue these characteristics as goods. By knowing the price, cross and income elasticities of housing characteristics, policy recommendations can be made about the type of housing units that are the most desirable to be subsidized.","[Garcia, Jaume] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, E-08005 Barcelona, Spain; [Maria Raya, Josep] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Escola Univ Maresme, E-08301 Mataro, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Pompeu Fabra University,"Garcia, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, C Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, E-08005 Barcelona, Spain.",jaume.garcia@upf.edu; josep.raya@upf.edu,"Villar, Jaume Garcia/D-7140-2013; Raya, Josep Maria/AAR-7073-2020","Raya, Josep Maria/0000-0002-2885-234X",,,,,37,18,21,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Focusing on one of Florida's first magnitude springs, we estimate average per-person per-trip use values of approximately $155, generating annual cave diving use values in the region of $1075. Further, in an investigation of potential site quality changes, we find that divers are sensitive to scope effects with an additional cave system increasing annual per-person use values by approximately $100, while improved access yields an additional $50 in per-person annual consumer surplus. Finally, three additional model specifications are estimated and indicate that divers use different travel cost preferences when assessing their revealed and stated preference trip counts but a single preference structure to evaluate site quality changes.

Employment is regarded as a particularly important factor promoting social inclusion. The aim of the article is to determine the HIV infection risk group's experience and interest in improving qualification necessary for finding a job that can improve social inclusion. Non-proportional quota sampling was used for the survey of persons belonging to the HIV infection risk group. The survey was carried out in the form of a questionnaire, and the sample included persons belonging to the HIV infection risk group - drug addicts, people involved in commercial sex, ex-convicts, etc. 320 complete answers were received from the respondents of both sexes from different Latvian cities and towns with high HIV incidence. An analysis of the research data proves that the largest part of the HIV infection risk group, who are of working age, cannot or do not want to integrate into the legal labour market due to such factors as addiction and health problems, the predominantly low level of education and professional skills, a lack of experience, the involvement in illegal employment, etc. Many members of the HIV infection risk group want to obtain information on training opportunities which are essential for employment, but social exclusion that affects them prevents their participation in training programmes that could promote employment and social inclusion. These exclusion traps are difficult for individuals to overcome without the help of the government and society. The successful inclusion in the labour market of the HIV infection risk group requires adequate informative activities as well as more extensive and individualized activation programmes that take into consideration the individual situation.","[Pranka, Ieva] Univ Latvia, LV-1009 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,ieva_sai@inbox.lv,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,113,119,,,,,,7,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100015,0

This work is among the first systematic attempts to analyse comparatively the distribution of inventive activity across regions in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) economies with a set of homogenous measures to measure the process of knowledge production and dissemination. The descriptive analysis shows that inventive performance is concentrated in some regions in Continental Europe, North America and Japan. Highly inventive regions tend to cluster together. This spatial dependence is found to have increased over time. The inventive performance of regions is directly influenced by the availability of human capital and research and development expenditure. Local agglomeration factors are also found to have a significant impact, while some negative effects appear when regions are mainly rural or when they are mainly service-oriented.","Univ Cagliari, Ctr Ric Econom Nord Sud CRENoS, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Usai, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Ctr Ric Econom Nord Sud CRENoS, Via St Ignazio 78, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",Stefanousai@unica.it,"Usai, Stefano/GPK-7547-2022","Usai, Stefano/0000-0001-5619-1350",,,,,45,60,64,1,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

For these reasons, energy conservation and efficiency have been essential elements of US energy policy since the oil embargos and price spikes of the 1970s. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) is the latest federal legislation to expand and strengthen US energy conservation and efficiency policies, programs, and practices. Specifically. EISA and its recent predecessor, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct05), contain almost 200 titles with new provisions for energy conservation and efficiency aimed at improvements in vehicle fuel economy. These provisions include efficiency of appliances and lighting; energy savings in residential, commercial, and government buildings; the efficiency of industrial manufacturing plants; and the efficiency of electric power delivery and end-use. These actions have begun to contribute to new federal, state, and local policies, programs, and practices across the US, and expectations are high for increases in the level of energy savings.

The Indian power sector is now going through a second stage of reforms in which restructuring of electric supply utilities has taken place. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) initiated reforms in 2005 by dividing the state electricity board into four separate companies. In this paper, the situations that led to the reform of the MSEB and the scope of the work required for an action plan initiated by the state electricity distribution company in the context of the proposed Key Performance Index are discussed. The post-reform status of the distribution company is analyzed with selected key parameters. The study also analyzes the electricity supply model implemented and the effect of a multi-year tariff plan as one of the key milestones of the tariff structure. The various new projects implemented by the distribution company to improve consumer services and the reform experiences of the other states are discussed, along with the future scope of the present reform process.

Several energy efficiency programs for light vehicles around the world are reviewed. The cases of Japan and Europe were selected for presentation here given their status as current and future world leaders in the control of passenger vehicle fuel consumption. The launching of the National Climate Change Plan and the pressure on the Brazilian car industry due to the world financial crisis make it a good time for the Brazilian government to implement such a program, and its various benefits are highlighted in this study. Three scenarios are established for Brazil covering the 2000-2030 period: the first with no efficiency goals, the second with the Japanese goals applied with a 10 years delay, and the third, with the Japanese goals applied with no delay. The consequences of a vehicular efficiency program and its middle and long-term effects on the consumption of energy and the CO2 emissions are quantified and discussed. The simulation results indicate that efficiency goals may make an important contribution to reducing vehicular emissions and fuel consumption in Brazil, compared to a baseline scenario.

Under a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, total energy demand in Shanghai will rise to 300 million tons of coal equivalent in 2020, which is 3.91 times that of 2005. Total CO2 emissions in 2010 and 2020 will reach 290 and 630 million tons, respectively, under the BAU scenario.

This paper re-examines the case for intensity targets by critically assessing several of its properties, namely (i) reduction of cost-uncertainty, (ii) reduction of 'hot air', (iii) compatibility with international emissions trading, (iv) incentive to decouple carbon emissions and economic output (decarbonization), and, (v) use as a substitute for banking/borrowing. Relying on simple analytical models, it is shown that the effect on cost-uncertainty is ambiguous and depends on parameter values, and that the same holds for the risk of 'hot air'; that the intensity target distorts international emissions trading; that despite potential asymmetries in the choice of abatement technology between absolute and intensity target, the incentive for a lasting transformation of the energy system is not necessarily stronger under the latter; and, finally, that only a well-working intensity target could substitute banking/borrowing to some extent but also vice versa. Overall, the results suggest that due to the increased complexity and the potentially only modest benefits of an intensity target, absolute targets remain a robust choice for a cautious policy maker.

Our analysis is based on a numerical general equilibrium model for a world-economy comprising two regions; North (Annex I) and South (non-Annex I). In a cooperative equilibrium, a technology transfer from the North to the South is clearly desirable from the perspective of a 'global social planner', since the welfare gain for the South outweighs the welfare loss for the North. However, if the regions do not cooperate, then the incentives to introduce the technology transfer appear to be relatively weak from the perspective of the North; at least if we allow for Southern abatement in the pre-transfer Nash equilibrium. Finally, by adding the emission reductions associated with the Kyoto agreement, our results show that the technology transfer leads to higher welfare in both regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is found that unlike what many literatures portray. China is actually among the world's leaders in coal-fired power plants' generating efficiencies; besides, although there are still numerous small and inefficient generating units in the current generation fleet, many of them are in fact playing important roles in supporting local economic development, meeting peak load needs, balancing heat and electricity supply and providing job opportunities to the local economy, therefore their existence does not necessarily mean low-cost mitigation potential. Given the efficiency and structural characteristics of China's electricity sector, it is pointed out that some other mitigation options, such as demand side management, IGCC and renewable energy as well as the break-through of CCS technology may play an even more important role in emission reduction. Considering the significant lock-in effects in electricity sector, it is warned that China, if continues putting majority investment in large and advanced coal-fired generating units, will face another round of chasing-after for the new and advanced renewable generation technologies. Therefore China should put more efforts in renewable generation technologies now. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It proposes an approach to project evaluation based on measures of additionality, economic viability and contribution to sustainable development specific to this sector and re-evaluates 460 registered CDM projects in China that generate electricity using wind, natural gas or small hydro. It concludes that many small hydro schemes would be viable without the CDM subsidy. Although these projects have zero emissions from operations, offsets issued to projects that are viable without subsidy permit increased emissions in developed countries and lead to a net increase in global emissions. To provide some indication of the sustainable development benefits that CDM projects bring to their host countries, the paper includes estimates of the projects' benefit to public health due to the reduced use of coal for generation. The paper provides insights into the economics of projects and their value to host countries that are missed by the official CDM methodologies. It contributes to the debate over the design of sector-specific offset schemes that may be part of a new global agreement on combating climate change. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The existing scale of these two distinct types of storage is considered in the UK context, followed by a review of rechargeable technology options. The storage is found to be overwhelmingly contained within the fossil-fuel stores of conventional generators, but their scale is thought to be determined by the risks associated with long supply chains and price variability. The paper also aims to add to the debate regarding the need to have more flexible supply and demand available within the UK electrical network in order to balance the expected increase of wind derived generation. We conclude that the decarbonisation challenge facing the UK electricity sector should be seen not only as a supply and demand challenge but also as a storage challenge. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

History does not repeat itself in detail, yet comparison with analogous processes already completed or in train could give shape to how we project the future. The author focuses not on the technical change required, but rather on the institutional and cultural changes that would be necessary to generate the political will and the consumer demand that would drive technical change and its widespread adoption. He examines a current crisis for most developed countries-that of old age pension provision, which - though lacking a link with new technology might have similar social dynamics to an impending crisis in energy. In the analysis of the pensions crisis, the focus is upon both how risk has been encountered and also the part played by trust/mistrust in engendering and prospectively resolving crisis: between citizens and state, between regulator and providers and between consumers and providers. Analogies are drawn from in a similar way for the impending energy crisis. A refrain throughout is the dialectic between 'market' and 'plan'. It is concluded that both the actual and the impending crisis have to be reviewed in a context of relations between states as well as relations within them. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We use data on employment growth of site-industries on 68 formal industrial sites in the municipality of Amsterdam between 1998 and 2006.

The study fails to establish long-run equilibrium relationship and long term causality between carbon emissions and economic growth; however, there exists a bi-directional short-run causality between the two. Hence, in the short-run, any effort to reduce carbon emissions could lead to a fall in the national income. This study also establishes unidirectional short-run causality running from economic growth to energy supply and energy supply to carbon emissions. The absence of causality running from energy supply to economic growth implies that in India, energy conservation and energy efficiency measures can be implemented to minimize the wastage of energy across value chain. Such measures would narrow energy demand-supply gap. Absence of long-run causality between carbon emissions and economic growth implies that in the long-run, focus should be given on harnessing energy from clean sources to curb carbon emissions, which would not affect the country's economic growth.

We study the problem of the land allocation between a traditional cropping system and an innovative one in a static framework, using four intertemporal choice models. We find that, in central France agronomic and economic conditions, switchgrass and miscanthus result to be less profitable in terms of annualised net margin than the usual rape/wheat/barley rotation.

An input-output approach combined with a sensitivity analysis has been developed to analyse the direct and indirect consumptions of electricity by eighteen manufacturing sectors in fifteen European countries, with indirect electricity demand related to the purchase of industrial products from other sectors which, in turn, require the consumption of electricity in their manufacturing processes. We identify the industrial transactions and sectors, which account for a greater share of electricity demand. In addition, the impact of an electricity price increase on the costs and prices of manufacturing products is simulated through a price model, allowing us to identify those sectors whose manufacturing costs are most sensitive to an increase in the electricity price.

The analysis demonstrates that the 'spatial hazard' framework is not only viable for studying urban form, but is extremely promising: the models do an excellent job of characterizing very different patterns of development, and they lend themselves directly to the kind of probative analysis needed to guide urban and regional policy. Compared to more traditional approaches to characterizing urban form - namely, density gradients - hazard models rest on a probabilistic worldview, and, so, they portray the built environment as a froth of stochastic transitions through which urban form unfolds in an irregular fashion until it at last comes undone. Several general conclusions and directions for future research follow from these findings.","[Carruthers, John I.; Renner, Robert N.] US Dept Housing & Urban Dev, Off Policy Dev & Res, Washington, DC 20410 USA; [Carruthers, John I.; Lewis, Selma; Knaap, Gerrit-Jan] Univ Maryland, Natl Ctr Smart Growth Res & Educ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Carruthers, JI (通讯作者)，US Dept Housing & Urban Dev, Off Policy Dev & Res, 451 7th St SW Rm 8216, Washington, DC 20410 USA.",john.i.carruthers@hud.gov; selma@umd.edu; gknaap@umd.edu; robert.n.renner@hud.gov,,,,,,,50,15,17,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

The analysis builds on a broad theoretical framework, which embraces both economic and norm-based motivations in explaining household behavior. The paper pays particular attention to the role of information about the availability of different behavioral changes that can be undertaken at the household level. The empirical results are based on a postal survey that was sent out to 1200 Swedish households, and the econometric analysis is carried out within a so-called ordered probit framework. Our results indicate that costs, environmental attitudes and social interactions are all important determinants of electricity saving activities within Swedish households. We tested the hypothesis that information about available savings measures that is presented in a more concrete and specific way is more likely to affect (stated) behavior than is more general information, and the data collected support this notion. The paper ends by discussing some implications of these results for the design of future informative policy measures in the energy-efficiency field. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These tax credits are available to all consumers equally and therefore do not account for the variability in social benefits associated with PHEV operation in different parts of the country. The tax credits also do not consider variability in consumer income. This paper discusses why the PHEV subsidy policy would have higher social benefits at equal or less cost if the tax credits were offered at different levels depending on consumer income and the location of purchase. Quantification of these higher social benefits and related policy proposals are left for future work. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

If past trends continue electricity use is expected to triple in the coming 20-25 years, with the residential and commercial sectors increasing their already high shares in total consumption. Besides this reference scenario it was attempted to assess the impact of climate change on electricity use. According to official projections, the average temperature in the Eastern Mediterranean is expected to rise by about 1 degrees C by the year 2030. Using our econometrically estimated model, we calculated that electricity consumption in Cyprus may be about 2.9% higher in 2030 than in the reference scenario. This might lead to a welfare loss of 15 million Euros in 2020 and 45 million Euros in 2030; for the entire period 2008-2030 the present value of costs may exceed 200 million Euros (all expressed in constant Euros of 2007). Moreover, we assessed the additional peak electricity load requirements in the future because of climate change: extra load may amount to 65-75 Megawatts (MW) in the year 2020 and 85-95 MW in 2030.

The large-scale production of biomethane has so far largely been overlooked in comparative studies that focus on the long-term renewable options. The aim of this article fills this gap and to provide a broad and systematic assessment of the future potential of biomethane compared to other biofuels. In order to become a large-scale option, biomethane production from woody biomass via gasification needs to be developed and commercialized. However, biomethane exhibits a clear development path with relatively low financial and technical risks starting with local solutions utilizing wet biomass resources towards medium and eventually large-scale gasification with economics similar to liquid second generation biofuels. The disadvantage of being a gaseous fuel is not insurmountable and can furthermore be relaxed by the integration and dual-use of the existing distribution system for natural gas. This assessment concludes that more emphasize should be given to biomethane as a large-scale option given the opportunity to use woody biomass from gasification. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A multilevel approach to geography of innovation, Regional Studies. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how research on geography of innovation can benefit from multilevel modelling. Using micro-data from the third Community Innovation Survey in the Czech Republic, the hypothesis that regional framework conditions determine the innovative performance of firms and that this effect differs for different kinds of firms is quantitatively assessed. The results indicate that the quality of the regional innovation system directly influences the likelihood of a firm to innovate and that this effect decreases with the size of the firm. Also, broader social characteristics of the region are relevant explanatory factors of innovation.","[Srholec, Martin] Univ Oslo, Ctr Technol, Innovat & Culture TIK, Moltke Moes Vei 31, N-0851 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Srholec, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Ctr Technol, Innovat & Culture TIK, Moltke Moes Vei 31, N-0851 Oslo, Norway.",martin.srholec@tik.uio.no,"Srholec, Martin/C-4254-2012","Srholec, Martin/0000-0001-6115-4116",,,,,51,56,61,3,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper presents a first cut assessment of this initiative. Results suggest that the majority of the pump owners benefit from the reforms in two ways: first by having to pay a lower electricity bill for same usage and second through increased profit margins by selling water. This is because in response to the changed incentive structure, water prices rose sharply by 30-50% immediately after metering. In contrast, water buyers have lost out by having to pay higher water charges and face adverse terms of contract. Impact of metering on operation of groundwater markets and volume of groundwater extracted is less clear; they may expand, contract or remain unchanged, though water use efficiency is likely to go up. At current tariff rates, the electricity utilities are likely to earn less revenue than before. These findings are context specific and hold good for West Bengal where high flat tariff had fostered competitive groundwater markets and hence cannot be generalised for other Indian states.

The results also show that the Turkish spot precious metals, exchange rate and bond markets do not also provide information that would help improve the forecasts of world oil prices in the long run. The findings suggest that domestic gold is also considered a safe haven in Turkey during devaluation of the Turkish lira, as it is globally. It is interesting to note that there does not seem to be any significant influence of developments in the world oil markets on Turkish markets in the short run either. However, transitory positive initial impacts of innovations in oil prices on gold and silver markets are observed.

Here, we have looked in more detail into the outcomes of specific models and also analyzed the economic potentials at the sectoral and regional level. At the aggregated level, the findings of the IPCC report are confirmed. However, substantial differences are found at the sectoral level. At the same time, there seems to be no systematic difference in the reduction potential reported by top-down and bottom-up approaches. The largest reduction potential as a response to carbon prices exists in the energy supply sector. Reduction potential in the building sector may carry relatively low costs. Although uncertainties are considerable, the modeling results and the bottom-up analyses all suggest that at the global level around 50% of greenhouse gas emissions may be reduced at carbon price (costs) below 100$/tCO(2)-eq-but with a wide range of 30-60%. At a carbon price (costs) less than 20$/tCO(2)-eq, still 10-35% of emissions may be abated. The variation of results is higher at low carbon-price levels than at high levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Out of this, 56% is industrial combined heat and power production (CHP) and 20% are renewables (RES-E), mainly runoff small scale hydro. Various technical and economical barriers have kept the DG share relatively low. This paper assesses how Turkey could increase the DG share. The methodology employed in this paper consist of a survey of the literature and legislation, combined with interviews with regulators, transmission and distribution system operators. Scenarios for DG are developed, barriers to increase the DG share are identified, DG and central generation (CG) are compared economically and regulatory measures are identified. The addition of long-run marginal transmission costs to the investment cost of new power generation units could close the long-run marginal cost difference between DG and CG. However, the share of DG is likely to stay low unless regulatory measures are taken. Moreover, a specific policy and regulation on DG is needed, the distribution grid needs strengthening, local dispatch centres need to become active and RES-E limits are needed for Turkey.

When analyzing these technologies in an integrated assessment model using endogenous technological learning, the uncertainty in the assumed learning rates (LRs) plays a crucial role in the production-cost development and model outcomes. This study examines the uncertainty in LRs of some energy technologies under endogenous global learning implementation and presents a floor-cost modeling procedure to systematically regulate the uncertainty in LRs of energy technologies. The article narrates the difficulties of data assimilation, as compatible with mixed integer programming segmentations, and comprehensively presents the causes of uncertainty in LRs. This work is executed using a multi-regional and long-horizon energy system model based on TIMES framework. All regions receive an economic advantage to learn in a common domain, and resource-ample regions obtain a marginal advantage for better exploitation of the learning technologies, due to a lower supply-side fuel-cost development. The lowest learning investment associated with the maximum LR mobilizes more deployment of the learning technologies. The uncertainty in LRs has an impact on the diffusion of energy technologies tested, and therefore this study scrutinizes the role of policy support for some of the technologies investigated.

This article considers scenarios implemented in a Markal energy model used for mitigation analysis. It outlines the empirical evidence that unit costs of renewable energy technologies decline, considers the theoretical background and how this can be implemented in modeling. Two scenarios are modelled, assuming 27% and 50% of renewable electricity by 2050, respectively. The results show a dramatic shift in the mitigation costs. In the less ambitious scenario, instead of imposing a cost of Rand 52/t CO(2)-eq (at 10% discount rate), reduced costs due to technology learning turn renewables into negative cost option. Our results show that technology learning flips the costs, saving R143. At higher penetration rate, the incremental costs added beyond the base case decline from R92 per ton to R3. Including assumptions about technology learning turns renewable from a higher-cost mitigation option to one close to zero. We conclude that a future world in which global investment in renewables drives down unit costs makes it a much more cost-effective and sustainable mitigation option in South Africa.

An important issue has been the extent to which the results are influenced by contextual factors. Among these, weather factors are frequently discussed as being important. We use factor analysis and two-stage data envelopment analysis techniques to examine the effect of a set of important weather factors (gale, hail, temperatures, rainfall and thunder) on the performance of electricity distribution networks in the UK. The results indicate that such factors often do not have a significant economic and statistical effect on the overall performance of the utilities. The weather parameters in some models are significant in terms of economic efficiency.

Using this indicator, simulations are made to calculate the average CO2 emissions if the average weight had stayed constant from 1995 to 2005. If the weight had remained constant, the 2008 target of 1998s voluntary agreement (VA) would have been met, and the recently approved regulation would probably have been unnecessary. Then, CO2 emissions are projected to 2015 using different vehicle characteristics and market penetration. Five scenarios have been introduced to study the different opportunities that could arise by 2015, including a backcasting scenario showing what is needed to reach the goal set by the recently approved EU climate package regulations. The analysis concludes that powertrain technologies alone are unlikely to bring the sufficient break in trends to reach set targets. Acting on average weight, through unitary vehicle weight or segment shifting, of new vehicles is key in reducing the average CO2 emissions in the short and medium term. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed approach exploits the input-output methodology for estimating the direct, indirect and induced employment effects associated with the energy project in question, as well as two different valuation techniques, namely the opportunity cost of labour approach and the public expenditures approach, for expressing these effects in monetary terms. This framework has been implemented to estimate the employment benefits resulting from the development of a lignite-fired and a natural gas-fired power plant in Greece, taking into account all the stages of the corresponding fuel cycles that are undertaken domestically. The results of the analysis clearly show that lignite-fired electricity generation results in significant employment benefits amounting to 2.9-3.5 is an element of/MWh in the basic scenario. On the other hand, the employment benefits associated with the examined natural gas unit were estimated at 0.4-0.6 is an element of/MWh in the basic scenario. It is also worth mentioning that the significant environmental externalities of the lignite-fired electricity in Greece that have been presented in a number of studies can only be partially compensated by the estimated employment benefits.

We review information from government, academic and industry sources, together with the newly created Cass Wind DT database, and consider the context, objectives, participants and nature of wind DTs in the EU, US and Japan. Overall, it is difficult to identify the benefits of wind DTs for many of the key actors. Government funding of DTs does not appear to be shaped by coherent or targeted strategic objectives-indeed governments use DTs differently despite similar stated objectives. A common theme has been the involvement of many stakeholders, with local authorities, utilities and operators taking the lead rather than manufacturers. Wind DTs appear to have neither enabled participating manufacturers to become significant global suppliers-with a few exceptions driven by additional financial and legislative support from national governments-nor to have established a dominant design. The major benefit of wind DTs; appears to have been 'learning by using' for utilities and wind farm operators, reducing operational costs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results show that the level and volatility of positive and negative minute reserve prices decreased substantially. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the degree of integration between reserve and spot markets has increased. Overall, prices reacted to the policy change in a manner that is in line with the regulator's objective. The reform can thus be viewed as a step towards an efficient reserve market.

This analysis extends the current discussion of SEPS adoption beyond internal variables, relying on innovation and diffusion theory. Logistic regression with SEPS adoption as the dependent variable is used to test internal determinants and diffusion measures for the years 1997-2008. Of the internal determinants variables, affluence and government ideology were found to be positive and significant. The results show that regional and neighbor diffusion variables are significant in SEPS adoption decisions-even when accounting for ideological distance from previous adopters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The links between market dynamics, Government strategies, and building designs are mapped to understand the steps that achieve carbon reduction from building operation. This is achieved using a model that takes financial and energy components with market and design variables to provide net present cost and annual carbon outputs. The financial component applies discounted cash flow analysis over the building lifespan, with discount rates reflecting contractual characteristics; the carbon component uses Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) 2005. A scenario approach is adopted to test alternative strategies selected to encourage low carbon solutions in two residential and two office designs. The results show that the forward assumption of energy price escalation is the most influential factor on energy investment, together with the expected differentiation between the escalation of gas and electricity prices. Using this, and other influencing factors, the research reveals trends and strategies that will achieve mainstream application of energy efficiency and microgeneration technologies, and reduce carbon emissions in the existing multi-residential sector.

Of late there has been a steep rise in the demand for electricity in the state. The present study undertakes a holistic view of growth of demand for electricity in the state. The technique applied is multiple regression and secondary data is used for the purpose of analysis. The study concludes that demand for electricity in the state is price inelastic but income elastic for majority of consuming sectors. An important policy implication thereof is that price hike will be ineffective in regulating and managing demand unless price is varied in an hourly basis. Therefore, the state has to resort to other demand-side management (DSM) measures, Such as improving efficiency of electricity use and its conservation. Considering the high income elasticity of electricity demand, Sufficient electricity-generating capacity needs to be created, since demand is expected to grow at an accelerated rate in future. This calls for a comprehensive electricity policy. The study further concludes that in the long run, price-demand as well as income-demand relationship in case of electricity is likely to remain uncertain especially in the post-reform era.

Two types of analysis were done: the first analysis examines the impact of DST on the lighting loads based on a survey study made for residential and commercial sectors. The second examines the impact of DST on the over all electricity generation through analyzing the daily load curves (DLCs) before and after the DST onset and removal in 2000 and 2007. The results show that the application of DST during the year 2000 saves the electricity used for illumination by -0.73% but it increases the overall generation at the onset and removal of DST by 0.5% and 1.4% due to increase in the heating and cooling loads. The analysis of DLCs during the year 2007 shows similar effects as in the year 2000 except during the early morning period at the DST onset where DST decreases the demand during this time. The analysis shows that DST decreases the electricity demand at DST onset by 0.2% and increases it at DST removal by 0.3%. A possible decrease in the electricity consumption may take place if the DST is implemented from April to end of August. Crown Copyright (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The bulk of this energy (85%) is exported but the revenue raised does not appear to have any appreciable impact on the host economy. Moreover it is estimated that a further 10% of the generated energy is lost along the 1414 km long transmission line to South Africa. So quite evidently, Mozambique would benefit more if its energy were utilized by locally based industry. This would also save on the losses that are currently incurred during regional transmission. In this paper the authors visit Tete, the Mozambican Province that hosts the Zambezi Basin. They examine its natural and human resources. They observe that its strategic location gives it easy access to regional markets. They also hold interviews with a number of administrators in the Province. Finally, they conclude that Tete is uniquely advantaged to develop into the next regional industrial hub for the Southern African region. This would also greatly add value to the local resources. To realize this dream will require, conviction supported by strong and timely political commitment as well as hard work. Current trends towards integrated regional trading blocks will provide an even easier access to potential markets and human skills pools. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Sebitosi, A.

On the other hand, plans promoting the natural gas-based electricity generation in big islands (such as Crete) question the future of wind energy. To recover wind energy curtailments and benefit from the introduction of natural gas, the adoption of compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems suggests an appreciable energy solution. Furthermore, to improve the economic performance of the proposed system, it is decided that guaranteed energy amounts should be delivered to the local grid during peak demand periods. In an effort to obtain favourable negotiation conditions for the selling price of energy delivered - and also improve the economic performance of the system, a dual mode CAES operation is currently examined. Proceeding to the economic evaluation of dual mode CAES configurations that ensure maximum wind energy recovery, the feasibility of the proposed system may be validated. Lower electricity production costs and considerable reduction of fuel consumption achieved - in comparison with the requirements of conventional peak demand power units - illustrate the system's advantages.

This study examined the potential energy demand for cooling in the 50 most populous metropolitan areas of the world, and assessed the incremental demand in developing countries that this would create on top of the current energy demand due to heating. The analysis used local cooling and heating degree-day data. The main results are as follows: (1) Most of the largest metropolitan areas are in developing countries (38 out of 50), and most of them, in turn, are in warm to hot climates. (2) All but two of the top 30 metropolitan areas in terms of cooling degree days are in developing countries, (3) The potential cooling demands are greater than heating demands in most of the metropolitan areas that are in developing countries (24 out of 38). The main implication of these findings is that increasing personal income is likely to lead to an unprecedented increase in energy demand in many developing countries. For example, the potential cooling demand in metropolitan Mumbai is about 24% of the demand for the entire United States. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper demonstrates that historic increases in efficiency over time, including those resulting from minimum efficiency standards, incur smaller price increases than were expected by the Department of Energy (DOE) forecasts made in conjunction with standards. This effect can be explained by technological innovation, which lowers the cost of efficiency, and by market changes contributing to lower markups and economics of scale in production of higher efficiency units. We reach four principal conclusions about appliance trends and retail price setting: 1. For the past several decades, the retail price of appliances has been steadily falling while efficiency has been increasing. 2. Past retail price predictions made by the DOE analyses of efficiency standards, assuming constant prices over time, have tended to overestimate retail prices. 3. The average incremental price to increase appliance efficiency has declined over time. DOE technical support documents have typically overestimated this incremental price and retail prices. 4. Changes in retail markups and economics of scale in production of more efficient appliances may have contributed to declines in prices of efficient appliances.

In addition, the literature has not yet identified the relevance of New Economic Geography, and spatial economics generally, for national spatial planning. This is surprising considering the interest in spatial planning policy in Europe. By combining old theories of trade and space with New Economic Geography, this paper applies spatial economics to national spatial planning and examines a case study of Ireland. The paper suggests that spatial economics provides a useful theoretical framework for the analysis of national spatial planning policy, but suffers from deficiencies in respect of its consideration of social and environmental aspects of planning and development.

The main interest of this paper is to introduce cooperation as a channel of spillovers directly into the knowledge production function. This enables one to test if geographic proximity is a necessary condition for diffusion or if the development of a cooperative network, whatever the distance between partners, also allows this transmission. The main result is that the distance separating French or European partners does not constitute a barrier to knowledge flows. However, intra sector-based spillovers are found from surrounding areas, but not from further areas, when they are measured by an external stock of knowledge. These spillovers are localized as suggested by the literature.

The essence of the modem service industry is the technology, information and knowledge-intensive modem production relative of the service sector. Modem service industry as a specific reference to China, began in September 1997. It is now widely used by academic, business and politicians. China's minority populations are widely distributed across the country over 20 provinces and autonomous regions of ethnic minorities. Ethnic minority areas, with lower levels of economic aggregate and unreasonable industrial structure, are underdeveloped in the service industry. The low level of economic development and low per capita income in minority areas has seriously hampered the development of the services industry, especially in the modern service industry. This research focuses on the current situation and problems of service industry development in ethnic minority areas.

The presence of 364 million people without access to electricity and 726 million who rely on biomass for cooking indicate both the failure of past policies and programs, and the need for a radical redesign of the current system. We propose an integrated implementation framework with recommendations for adopting business principles with innovative institutional, regulatory, financing and delivery mechanisms. The framework entails establishment of rural energy access authorities and energy access funds, both at the national and regional levels, to be empowered with enabling regulatory policies, capital resources and the support of multi-stakeholder partnership. These institutions are expected to design, lead, manage and monitor the rural energy interventions. At the other end, trained entrepreneurs would be expected to establish bioenergy-based micro-enterprises that will produce and distribute energy carriers to rural households at an affordable cost. The ESCOs will function as intermediaries between these enterprises and the international carbon market both in aggregating carbon credits and in trading them under CDM. If implemented, such a program could address the challenges of rural energy empowerment by creating access to modern energy carriers and climate change mitigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

By six arguments not widely recognized in the climate policy arena, we argue that unrealistic technology optimism exists in current climate change mitigation assessments, and, consequently, world energy and climate policy. The overarching theme of the arguments is that incomplete knowledge of indirect effects, and neglect of interactions between parts of physical and social sub-systems, systematically leads to overly optimistic assessments. Society must likely seek deeper changes in social and economic structures to preserve the climatic conditions to which the human civilization is adapted. We call for priority to be given to research evaluating aspects of mitigation in a broad, system-wide perspective. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index was applied for decomposition analysis. Our analysis has shown that energy efficiency falls during economic downturn. In order to facilitate these challenges the Lithuanian Government as well as business should opt for increasing energy efficiency in the most problematic sectors of transport and services.

This would be a critical juncture for Honduras, presenting an opportunity to move beyond the export of basic agricultural commodities and a history of path dependency and weak economic indicators. In order to glean lessons on how to approach palm oil expansion in the most effective manner, I turn to the Malaysian case. Once impoverished, Malaysia expanded plantations, promoted technological innovation, and provided financial incentives and tax structures to develop one of the most sophisticated palm oil industries in the world. In this paper, the insights to be gleaned from the Malaysian case are organized into three key themes: Governance, Investing in Research and Human Capital, and The Environment. Recommendations for Honduras include: increased collaboration with funding bodies, NGOs and universities to foster research; fiscal policies that support the development of a domestic market: and key environmental controls to ensure sustainability in the long term. These insights offer practical and pragmatic solutions not only for Honduras, but also the wider community of small, tropical, developing nations seeking to develop a viable biofuels sector.

Despite the clear cost disadvantage compared with direct disposal or storage of spent fuel, the Rokkasho reprocessing plant started active testing in 2006. Japan's cumulative consumption of plutonium has been only 5 tons to date and its future consumption rate is still uncertain. But once the Rokkasho reprocessing plant starts its full operation, Japan will separate about 8 tons of plutonium annually. Our analysis shows that, with optimum use of available at-reactor and away-from-reactor storage capacity, there would be no need for reprocessing until the mid-2020s. With an additional 30,000 tons of away-from-reactor (AFR) spent-fuel storage capacity reprocessing could be avoided until 2050. Deferring operation of the Rokkasho plant, at least until the plutonium stockpile had been worked down to the minimum required level, would also minimize international concern about Japan's plutonium stockpile.

This article uses nation-wide Swedish survey data from 2004 to 2007 to explore the potential for achieving those targets. Earlier findings that socio-economic characteristics such as age, housing type and income are strongly linked to higher propensities to save on heating and hot water usage are confirmed by ordered logistic regression models. However, general environmental attitudes are also found to play a crucial role. When assessing the relative importance of socioeconomic factors and environmental attitudes, the effect on energy saving is generally greater for the former than the latter. In addition, important interaction effects are identified. In relative terms, the effect of environmental attitudes is clearly stronger among households in apartment blocks than among those in detached housing, and stronger among households with higher income than among those with lower income. We end by discussing the implications for the selection and targeting of policy measures to tap the energy savings potential in the population. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyses in-depth the limits and opportunities of policy options currently under consideration at the international level to stimulate the sector to reduce its GHG emissions. In particular, in order for the maritime transport sector to become more environmentally friendly, the flexible nature of international market-based measures and the European Union Emission Trading Scheme provide a definite window of opportunity without placing unnecessary high burden on the sector. However, the development of a regional policy, such as at European level, for the international maritime transport sector faces several obstacles: allocation of emissions, carbon leakage, permit allocation, treatment of the great variety in ship type, size and usage, and transaction cost. Global market-based policies could overcome most of these challenges. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the policy instruments currently under discussion to reduce the sector's burden on the environment, and focuses on economic theory, legal principles, technological options, and the political framework that together make up the basis of decision-making regarding the international maritime transport sector's climate change policies.

In particular we focus on price movements between crude oil futures and a series of agricultural commodities and gold futures. A comparative framework is applied to identify changes in relationships through time and various cointegration methodologies and causality tests are employed. Our results indicate that co-movement is a dynamic concept and that some economic and policy development may change the relationship between commodities. Furthermore we show that biofuel policy buffers the co-movement of crude oil and corn futures until the crude oil prices surpass a certain threshold. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In light of this, a decision support system has been developed to forecast the cost of electricity production using non-stationary data by integrating the methodology of time series models with fuzzy systems and optimization tools. The method presented herein combines the potential of the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models, such as the forecasting tool, with the advantages of fuzzy set theory to compensate for the uncertainties and errors encountered in the observed data, which would degrade the validity of forecasted values. The results show that incorporation of the alpha-cut concept facilitated the evaluation of risks while allowing simultaneous consideration of intervals for the unitary cost of energy production. This provides the analyst with the ability to make decisions using various predicted intervals with different membership values instead of the common practice of simply using the specific costs.

In this paper, we investigate Swedish energy advisers' perceptions of homeowners' awareness of the energy advice service and their perceived ability to fulfil homeowners' expectations. Our study is based on a mail-in questionnaire survey conducted in 2009 and distributed to municipality energy advisers in all municipalities in Sweden. About 66% of the energy advisers responded. The results show that 43% of the energy advisers thought that fewer than 50% of the homeowners were aware of the service and that mass media advertisements and presentations at different organisations could improve homeowner awareness. Energy adviser attitudes, job satisfaction, and the perception that the advisers possessed up-to-date and good knowledge and sufficient financial resources to execute their duties had a significant influence on their perceived ability to fulfil homeowner expectations.

We derive theoretically the link between pathwise properties of the latent spot volatility and the VIX index, such as presence of continuous martingale and/or jumps, and further show how to make statistical inference about them from the observed data. Our empirical results suggest that volatility is a pure jump process with jumps of infinite variation and activity close to that of a continuous martingale. Additional empirical work shows that jumps in volatility and price level in most cases occur together, are strongly dependent, and have opposite sign. The latter suggests that jumps are an important channel for generating leverage effect.","[Todorov, Viktor] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Finance, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Tauchen, George] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Northwestern University; Duke University,"Todorov, V (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Finance, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",v-todorov@kellogg.northwestern.edu; george.tauchen@duke.edu,"Todorov, Viktor/KCX-9394-2024","Todorov, Viktor/0000-0002-2360-7812",,,,,44,131,153,1,19,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

J,"Wang, X; Li, JF; Zhang, YX",,,,"Wang, Xin; Li, Ji Feng; Zhang, Ya Xiong",,,An analysis on the short-term sectoral competitiveness impact of carbon tax in China,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sectoral competitiveness; Carbon tax; China,ENERGY,"Market-based instruments, particularly carbon tax, have recently drawn the attention of Chinese government by their cost-effective contribution to the achievement of China's climate targets. Most of the recent policy proposals have focused on its long-term impact. However, particularly for policy makers, both long term and short term effects of carbon tax would be necessary when determining tax rates. We provided a detailed analysis of short-term impacts of carbon tax on sectoral competitiveness in this paper. We divided China's economy into 36 sectors, based on its 2007 input-output table, in order to examine the ratio of carbon tax added costs to sector GDP. We were thus able to determine the impact level of a carbon tax on each sector. We then divided the sectoral trade impact into domestic competitiveness with regards to foreign imported products and international competitiveness external to the Chinese domestic market. We found that a high tax level (100 yuan/t CO2) may necessitate compensatory measures to certain highly affected industries, and that a low tax rate (10 yuan/t CO2) would generate few competitiveness problems for all industries and may therefore be considered as an appropriate starting point.

It is assumed that per capita CO(2) emissions are correspondent to the share of industrial value added in GDP. A model is developed using hidden Markov process to search this initial assumption. In the model, the data for industrial share in GDP are assigned to be the observations, while the data for per capita CO(2) emissions represent the hidden process, which may be then predicted using the ratio of industrial value added to GDP. The data set covers the period from 1970 to 2008 and the model is tested for the G-7 countries. The study findings show that, except in the case of Canada, the hidden Markov model performs reasonably well in tracking per capita CO(2) emissions.

However, this approach raises questions of threats to European energy security in such an import scenario, particularly in the light of increasing import dependency and Russia's use of the energy weapon in recent years. In this paper we investigate the threat of North African countries using the Desertec electricity exports as an energy weapon. We develop and use a new model to assess the interdependence - the bargaining power symmetry, operationalised as costs - of a disruption in a future renewable electricity trade between North Africa and Europe. If Europe maintains current capacity buffers, some demand-response capability and does not import much more than what is described in the Desertec scenario, it is susceptible to extortion and political pressure only if all five exporter countries unite in using the energy weapon. Europe is not vulnerable to extortion by an export cut from only one country, as the European capacity buffers are sufficient to restore the power supply: no single exporter country would have sustained bargaining power over Europe.

We summarize China's successful experiences on energy efficiency in past 30 years as the contributions of Energy Usage Management and Integrated Resource Strategic Planning, which are essential for low-carbon economy. In an Economy-Energy-Electricity-Environment (E4) framework, the paper studies the low-carbon development of China and gives an outlook of China's economy growth, energy-electricity demand, renewable power generation and energy conservation and emissions mitigation until 2030. A business-as-usual scenario is projected as baseline for comparison while low carbon energy and electricity development path is studied. It is defined as low carbon energy/electricity when an economy body manages to realize its potential economic growth fueled by less energy/electricity consumption, which can be characterized by indexes of energy/electricity intensity and emissions per-unit of energy consumption (electricity generation). Results show that, with EUM, China, could save energy by 4.38 billion ton oil equivalences (toes) and reduce CO2 emission by 16.55 billion tons: with IRSP, China, could save energy by 1.5 Btoes and reduce CO2 emission by 5.7 Btons, during 2010-2030.10 realize the massive potential, China has to reshape its economic structure and rely much on technology innovation in the future.

These 'possible adopters' tended to have large farms and might together utilise some 6560 ha of land for feedstock production along with the wastes from some 12,000 beef and dairy cattle and 9000 pigs. When raised to the national level, such a level of AD activity would produce around 3.5 GWh of electricity. This approximates to just 0.001% of national electricity generation. Further, there are considerable perceived barriers to the widespread adoption of AD on farms in England: these include the high capital costs of installing AD and doubts about the economic returns being high enough.

In this paper we discuss the governance and legitimacy aspects of the carbon and sustainability system of the UK Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), both before and after implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive. RTFO certification is of a meta-type, being built upon existing certification and labelling schemes, each of which are more or less contested by NGOs. Despite the RTFO being based on these non-state initiatives, so far the concerns of environment and development NGOs and others have not been given serious expression in regulatory terms. Indeed, biofuel policy development in the UK has arguably been unduly non-responsive to critical opinion, given the limited scientific base on biofuel impacts and the reliance of RTFO sustainability certification on non-state actors and schemes. Drawing on documentary evidence, interviews and three sets of literatures - co-production of regulation; post-normal science; and legitimacy of non-state certification and labelling processes - we suggest that until concerned voices are given a stronger expression in UK and EC biofuel policy development, the policy cannot yet be said to have achieved a wide social mandate.

Focusing on Fujian and Anhui provinces as case studies, this paper reviews two contrasting policies as a means for meeting the national reduction target. That of the coastal province of Fujian proposes to do so largely through the development of nuclear power, whilst the coal-rich province of Anhui proposes to do so through its energy consumption rate rising at a lower rate than that of the rise in GDP. In both cases renewable energy makes up a small proportion of their proposed 2020 energy structures. The conclusion discusses in depth concerns about nuclear power policy, energy efficiency, energy consumption strategy and problems in developing renewable energy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Starting from some evidence of spatial polarisation within Italian economy, the analysis aims at exploring the sources of this tendency. To this end, an approach based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) production frontiers is employed which allows to decompose labour productivity growth into efficiency change, technological progress and capital deepening, looking then at the relative contribution of each component to regional convergence. Moreover, some measures of human capital and public capital are used as augmentation factors of the conventional inputs. The study leads to the conclusion that polarisation is mainly due to regional differences in efficiency change.","[Piacentino, Davide] Univ Napoli Parthenope, Dipartimento Stat & Matemat Ric Econ, I-80133 Naples, Italy; [Vassallo, Erasmo] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Contabilita Nazl & Anal Proc Sociali, I-90128 Palermo, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; University of Palermo,"Piacentino, D (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli Parthenope, Dipartimento Stat & Matemat Ric Econ, Via Medina 40, I-80133 Naples, Italy.",davide.piacentino@uniparthenope.it; erasmo.vassallo@unipa.it,,"PIACENTINO, Davide/0000-0001-6252-1264",,,,,29,10,10,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

A unit commitment model which accounts for the uncertainty in wind power is used. It is shown that as wind penetration increases, the optimal operation of storage depends on wind output as well as load. The main benefit from storage is shown to be a decrease in wind curtailment. The economics of the system are examined to find the level at which storage justifies its capital costs and inefficiencies. It is shown that the uncertainty of wind makes the option of storage more attractive. The size of the energy store has an impact on results. At lower levels of installed wind (up to approximately 50% of energy from wind in Ireland), the reduction in curtailment is insufficient to justify building storage. At greater levels of wind, storage reduces curtailment sufficiently to justify the additional capital costs. It can be seen that if storage replaces OCGTs in the plant mix instead of CCGTs, then the level at which it justifies itself is lower. Storage increases the level of carbon emissions at wind penetration below 60%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we start by stating that there are two types of power exchanges in Europe, i.e. merchant and cost-of-service regulated power exchanges. We then discuss how regulation can be used to better align their incentives with the main power exchange tasks. We conclude that adopting the cost-of-service regulated model for all power exchanges in Europe could be counterproductive in the current context, but that regulation can help ensure that the benefits of the EU market integration materialize. Promising regulatory actions include tempering the reinforced market power of power exchanges, and quality-of-service regulation for the ongoing cooperation among power exchanges to organize trade across borders.

Evaluating Japan's national energy strategy under the DPJ administration,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Japan; Climate change; Public perception,CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLICY; WIND,"In August 2009, after 54 years of virtually unbroken rule, Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was ousted from power by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). The DPJ's campaign platform included a pledge to facilitate extreme reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Yet, at the COP16 meeting in Cancun, Japan announced that it would not accept further emission reduction targets without broader commitment from all nations. This paper seeks to explain this dichotomy by employing a targeted stakeholder evaluation based on surveys with 321 Japanese citizens to assess the extent to which influential stakeholder groups in Japan supports a potentially costly transition to a low-carbon energy infrastructure amidst severe economic challenges that the nation faces. Findings help explain Japan's adversarial role in COP16 negotiations in Cancun, despite the stated GHG reduction ambitions of Japan's current ruling party. The analysis concludes that if the DPJ does embrace aggressive CO2 reduction targets in the future, the strategic focus will likely mirror the former ruling party's energy policy of bolstering nuclear power generation capacity and promoting energy efficiency improvements while exhibiting lukewarm commitment to supporting capacity development in alternative sources of energy supply such as solar panels and wind turbines.

However, little is known about how this translates into an emerging economy context. This study investigates the level of willingness of residential households in South Africa's Cape Peninsula to pay a premium for electricity from renewable energy. It methodologically drew on recent contributions in the literature on norm-motivated behaviour used to identify testable factors that could influence residential consumers' willingness to pay (WTP). Interestingly, the study found a significant positive link between household income and WIT for green electricity, contrary to the findings of some previous studies. Not only are higher income households more likely to pay a premium, but typically they are also willing to pay a bigger premium. It was also further established that the view that green electricity is reliable, involvement in the recycling of waste and the belief that everyone should contribute to green electricity generation drive the WTP.

This attracts a larger number of abatement suppliers while possibly inducing each one of them to produce less. Total abatement always goes up, however, when the delivery of abatement goods and services exhibits decreasing returns to scale.

In order to achieve the set aim the following research objectives were defined: to analyze the perspectives of the partnership development between the local authority and community at the context of sustainable urban development; to study the opportunities of the mutual cooperation between local authority and community; to evaluate links between the modelling of the partnership between local authority and community and the concept of sustainable development; to make conclusions and give recommendations for the promotion of the partnership between local authority and community in Latvia at the context of sustainable urban development. This paper focuses on the study of the opportunities of the modelling of the partnership between local authority and community which is an important competitive advantage of the national social, economic and spatial development at the context of sustainable development. The hypothesis of the research is local authority and community are creators of the economic, social, environmental, recreational values. The close partnership between local authority and community is vitally important for the evaluation of the distinction of the different regions of Latvia and their potential contribution to the society development as well as to the prosperity of the Republic of Latvia. Analyzing the processes of the promotion of the partnership development between local authority and community in Latvia, it is necessary to note, that very often political decisions about support for cooperation between local authority and community are contrary to the coherent development strategies and action plans. Lack of initiative of the state and local government and lack of the support of the scientific researches in area of modelling of the partnership between local authority and community very often prevent practical possibilities to realize the best experience of cooperation between local authority and community. This means that sustainable urban development is impossible without cooperation between local authority and society. For this reason local authorities must to aware their strengths and weaknesses, to assess the current situation and to create strong but also on understanding oriented relationship and discussions with the various groups of community as well as to involve them in active cooperation. It is important to remember that sustainable urban development is not only administrative regulatory provisions and limitations but also communication with local inhabitants about the place of their residence urban development problems, tendencies and priorities. The research is based on the three methods: 1) logically constructive method - logical interpretation of the already published by the other author's data on the modelling of the partnership between local authorities and communities; 2) monographic method - interpretation of the data based on proven knowledge about the economic, social, environmental aspects of the partnership between local authorities and communities; 3) document analysis method - study and evaluation of the normative acts and scientific researches on interaction and partnership development between local authorities and communities at the context of the aim of this research. The results of this study showed that it is crucial to develop and to promote partnership between local authorities and communities on the basis of mutual benefit principle. It is important that urban areas become or remain attractive, both to residents and businesses. Their capacity to innovate and create new economic opportunities is a prerequisite to ensuring that these regions do not lose out in global competition.","[Grizans, Jurijs; Vanags, Janis] Riga Tech Univ, Fac Engn Econ & Management, Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,,jurijs_grizans@yahoo.com; vanags.janis@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,285,291,,,,,,7,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100039,0

Against the background of claims made about the emergence of a new knowledge-based economy, the paper explores the role of knowledge, learning, and innovation in the economy and in relation to regional economic development and to successive conceptions of regional development policies through the lens of the successive transformations of a particular regional economy - that of North East England. Rather than seeing knowledge as something that has only recently become relevant to economic performance and to understanding of the economy and economic development, it is argued that knowledge is central to all economic activity, and that different types of such activity draw upon and require different types of knowledge.","Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England",Durham University,"Hudson, R (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Sci Labs S Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",Ray.Hudson@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,19,22,1,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Consequently, the system is complicated. Accordingly, nowadays introductory courses focusing on the electricity market dynamics have been added to the curriculum at many universities. However, as the electricity market dynamics are complicated, it is not straightforward for students to understand. A teaching tool to assist students to better understand strategic behaviors in the market is thus in high demand. Due to these reasons, Liberalized Electricity Market Microworld (LEMM), incorporating a system dynamics based simulation model, is developed. The LEMM's contribution to the students learning and understanding of the decentralized and liberalized electricity market dynamics have been explored by organizing game sessions with the LEMM for totally 49 students who participated in Energy Policy and Planning course in Bogazici University. The findings obtained from the exploratory study reveal that the students improved their understanding of the liberalized and decentralized electricity market through the game session with the LEMM. In this paper, the general characteristics of the LEMM and the underlying model are presented, the microworlds', particularly the LEMM's potential contribution to learning and teaching is discussed.

By using the Granger's linear causality test, it is shown that (i) there is a bidirectional causality among TEC, ISC. and RGDP, but a neutrality between RSC and RGDP with regard to the linear causality and (ii) there is still a bidirectional causality between TEC and RGDP, but a unidirectional causality between RSC and RGDP with regard to the nonlinear causality.

The period of study is from 2009 till 2030. It consists of three scenarios using three different criteria: energy, environmental, and economic. The three scenarios are the Renewable Energy Source (RES), the lignite-RES, and the natural gas-RES. Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis is carried out for annual growth rate of electricity consumption and load demand. It is considered that there are no other energy sources beyond those already in use (lignite, oil, natural gas, biomass, solar, wind, and hydropower), no CO2 capture policies are implemented, and electricity production from RES meets targets of the European Union in 2020. The present paper completes the study started with the paper A model for the development of a power production system in Greece, Part 1: RES do not meet EU targets. It is shown that with regard to fossil fuels, the use of natural gas is the best choice. The use of RES, though environmentally friendly, is an expensive solution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The typical base of various policy instruments used for this purpose is gross energy output of renewable energy. However, we show that basing policy instruments on gross energy output will result in problems associated with energy waste, economic inefficiency, and negative environmental effects. We recommend using net energy output as the base to apply price or quantity measures because it is net energy output, not gross energy output, which contributes to energy security. The promotion of gross energy output does not guarantee a positive amount of net energy output.

Evidence is provided that the progressive relaxations in the UK's petroleum fiscal regime in 1983,1987-1988 and 1993 were: largely unnecessary to stimulate the development of new, smaller, 'marginal' fields: misguided in their assumption that such fields were more costly to develop than earlier counterparts or larger contemporary fields; and impotent compared with the effects of oil price movements. The paper concludes with a conceptualisation which illuminates why these failures of policy were not just random: they emerged from the UK's 'non-proprietorial' stance with respect to the country's oil and gas resources, a stance which assumes responsibility for oil company profitability and vainly tries to counter market forces at the expense of government revenues.

Critics contend that without adjustments to the prevailing consumptive lifestyle, energy efficiency improvement will generate only token reductions in GHG emissions. I address this concern by examining the extent to which technical efficiency improvement in energy use offsets the impacts of housing-related lifestyle on GHG emissions. I build from two perspectives, the physical-technical-economic models that consider energy efficiency improvement as a potent strategy to curb residential energy consumption, and the lifestyle and social-behavioral approach, which questions this view. The analyses reveal consistent positive relationship between lifestyle and energy consumption. The results also indicate that energy efficiency improvement has mixed effects on energy consumption. In fact, model-based figures show that technical efficiency improvement in energy use leads to slightly higher energy consumption if it is not accompanied by adjustments to lifestyle.

A static game is a generalization of a discrete choice model, such as a multinomial logit or probit, which allows the actions of a group of agents to be interdependent. While the estimator we study is quite flexible, in most cases it can be easily implemented using standard statistical packages such as STATA. We also propose an algorithm for simulating the model which finds all equilibria to the game. As an application of our estimator, we study recommendations for high technology stocks between 1998-2003. We find that strategic motives, typically ignored in the empirical literature, appear to be an important consideration in the recommendations submitted by equity analysts.","[Bajari, Patrick] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Bajari, Patrick] NBER, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Hong, Han] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Krainer, John] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA; [Nekipelov, Denis] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Bajari, P (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0339828, SES-0452143]; Sloan Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0924784] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

We compare component versus GARCH( I, I) models, affine versus nonaffine GARCH models, and conditionally normal versus nonnormal GED models. We find that nonaffine models dominate affine models in terms of both fitting returns and option valuation. For the affine models, we find strong evidence in favor of the component structure for both returns and options; for the nonaffine models, the evidence is less convincing in option valuation. The evidence in favor of the nonnormal GED models is strong when fitting daily returns, but not when valuing options.","[Christoffersen, Peter] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada; [Christoffersen, Peter] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Dorion, Christian] HEC Montreal, Dept Finance, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Jacobs, Kris] Univ Houston, CT Bauer Coll Business, Houston, TX 77024 USA; [Jacobs, Kris] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Wang, Yintian] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",McGill University; Copenhagen Business School; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of Houston System; University of Houston; Tilburg University; Tsinghua University,"Christoffersen, P (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada.",peter.christoffersen@mcgill.ca; christian.dorion@hec.ca; kjacobs@bauer.uh.edu; wangyt2@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,SSHRC; FQRNT; IFM2; McGill University; FQRSC,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); FQRNT(FQRNT); IFM2; McGill University; FQRSC,"Christoffersen and Jacobs are also affiliated with CIRANO and CIREQ, and would like to thank FQRSC, IFM2, and SSHRC for financial support.

Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the proposed tests are properly sized and equipped with enough power for sample sizes in excess of 1,000 observations. We apply the Wald tests to a comprehensive sample of Austrian firms. The estimation results indicate a substantial reduction in both the second and third central moments of log firm size over time for the younger age cohorts. For older ones, the log-normal distribution is a valid description of their size distribution.","[Huber, Peter] Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria; [Pfaffermayr, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Huber, P (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria.",Peter.Huber@wifo.ac.at; Michael.Pfaffermayr@uibk.ac.at,"Pfaffermayr, Michael/AAR-2786-2020","Pfaffermayr, Michael/0000-0002-8558-7757; Huber, Peter/0000-0001-6263-6395",,,,,47,9,9,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

The key ingredient is the following result of Bakirov and Szekely (2005) concerning the small sample properties of the standard t-test: For a significance level of 5% or lower, the t-test remains conservative for underlying observations that are independent and Gaussian with heterogenous variances. One might thus conduct robust large sample inference as follows: partition the data into q >= 2 groups, estimate the model for each group, and conduct a standard t-test with the resulting q parameter estimators of interest. This results in valid and in some sense efficient inference when the groups are chosen in a way that ensures the parameter estimators to be asymptotically independent, unbiased and Gaussian of possibly different variances. We provide examples of how to apply this approach to time series, panel, clustered and spatially correlated data.","[Ibragimov, Rustam] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mueller, Ulrich K.] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Harvard University; Princeton University,"Ibragimov, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, 1875 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",umueller@princeton.edu,"Ibragimov, Rustam/KAM-0133-2024; Ibragimov, Rustam/AAB-7979-2021","Ibragimov, Rustam/0000-0001-5742-9092","NSF [SES-0820124, SES-0518036]; Harvard Academy; Department of Economics, Harvard University; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0820124] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Harvard Academy; Department of Economics, Harvard University; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The authors would like to thank the Editor, Arthur Lewbel, an anonymous Associate Editor, a referee, seminar, and conference participants at Berkeley, Brown, Cambridge, N.

In order to assess whether the results depend on the estimation method, the paper applies and compares two relatively novel techniques: the highest conditional density region approach and a new mobility measure based on a discrete-time Markov chain approach. An interesting conclusion and a methodological lesson have been obtained. The conclusion is that, whatever the technique used, the degree of intra-distribution mobility-which has favoured convergence-has been much higher in the first than in the second period. The lesson is that the use of different approaches is highly recommended not only for the sake of robustness but also because they offer additional insights into intra-distribution dynamics.","[Maza, Adolfo; Hierro, Maria; Villaverde, Jose] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Maza, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Avda Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",adolfo.maza@unican.es,"Maza, Adolfo/H-5265-2019","Maza, Adolfo/0000-0002-7299-3449; Villaverde, Jose/0000-0002-5393-091X",,,,,49,22,23,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.
