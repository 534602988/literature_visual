Contrary to most literature, we find little evidence of a natural resource curse for all countries. Only the voice and accountability measure of institutional quality is negatively and significantly affected by oil wealth. In the economies in transition, there is some evidence that natural resource wealth is associated with lower primary school enrollment and life expectancy and higher infant mortality compared to other resource rich countries. Compared to other economies in transition, however, natural resource abundant transitional economies are not significantly worse off with respect to our indicators. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Theory suggests that when politicians belonging to different groups can form coalitions, the wealthy elites' influence on policy choices is endogenously higher when there is diversity in preferences among the poor. The pattern of public good provision by local governments in Indonesia is consistent with this intuition. Our analysis indeed shows that when individuals have different preferences - here due to different - ethnicities democratic policy outcomes are closer to the preferences of the elites, rather than the preferences of the poor majority.

This paper analyzes the strategic implications of delayed negotiations. While, as is well-understood, the incentive to free ride leads to excessive emissions prior to a binding agreement, the cost of delay is magnified by players' attempt to secure a favorable bargaining position in the future negotiation. A brinkmanship, an effort substitution, and a raising rival's cost effects all concur to generate high post-agreement emissions.

The equilibrium location choices are found to depend on the magnitude of the differentiation costs (relatively to the transportation costs supported by consumers). When the differentiation costs are low, there is maximum differentiation. When they are high, there is partial differentiation, with a degree of differentiation that decreases with the differentiation costs. In any case, the socially optimal degree of differentiation is always lower than the equilibrium level. We also study the case of collusion between firms. If firms can combine locations but not prices, they locate asymmetrically when differentiation costs are high and choose maximum differentiation when they are low. When collusion extends to price setting, there is partial differentiation.","[Correia-da-Silva, Joao] Univ Porto, CEF UP, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Correia-da-Silva, Joao; Pinho, Joana] Univ Porto, Fac Econp, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Correia-Da-Silva, J (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, CEF UP, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",joao@fep.up.pt,"Correia-da-Silva, Joao/B-5940-2009; Pinho, Joana/M-4008-2013","Correia-da-Silva, Joao/0000-0001-6040-2384; Pinho, Joana/0000-0001-6348-3108",,,,,20,5,9,1,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,,,PORT ECON J,Port.

The impact that this type of arrangement has on trade flows has been widely modelled; however, the extent to which it can be expected to affect economic vulnerability is an aspect that has largely been overlooked. Yet as the economic distance between negotiating partners widens, the likelihood that changes in trade flows will affect the economic structure of the less developed partner increase. This paper explores the components of two prominent highly asymmetric negotiations the Dominican Republic Central America Free Trade Agreement and the European Union Caribbean Forum Economic Partnership Agreement to assess the channels through which the resulting organisation of trade may impact the vulnerability profile of the developing country partners. We find that these FTAs have the potential to address economic vulnerability in the developing country partners in ways that would not be possible in their absence.","[Dicaprio, Alisa] UNU WIDER, Helsinki 00160, Finland; [Santos-Paulino, Amelia U.] UNCTAD, Div Africa Least Dev Countries & Special Programm, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Dicaprio, A (通讯作者)，UNU WIDER, Katajanokanlaituri 6B, Helsinki 00160, Finland.",dicaprio@wider.unu.edu; Amelia.Santos-Paulino@unctad.org,,,,,,,68,3,3,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

This is a unique, innovative program that combines social insurance, provided via solidarity funding, with self-insurance in the form of unemployment insurance sayings accounts (UISAs). The paper shows that beneficiaries who use solidarity funding are less likely to exit unemployment in early months than those relying on UISAs only. Moreover, job finding rates are found to be positively correlated with pre-separation UISA balances among those that use solidarity funding, but are found to be uncorrelated with balances for those relying on UISAs only. While the findings are consistent with the effects expected under the internalization of unemployment costs via UISAs, they do not pinpoint unambiguously the causal link, as alternative mechanisms may be responsible for the observed correlations, particularly selection into the use of UISAs.

Even as governments restrained the growth of public social spending, total public and private activity grew by more than 150 per cent in real terms between 1979-80 and 2007-8, and from 34 to 42 per cent of GDP. If state services have not grown rapidly enough, some have paid more privately for the services they want, and in other cases governments have ended up financing activity through indirect routes. There has always been a 'mixed economy' of welfare in terms of the balance between public and private provision, finance, and control. Changes in this balance have been slow, with the largest growth being in the 'pure private sector' (with private provision, finance, and control), but with some growth in publicly financed services that are contracted out to the private sector. The experience suggests that the Coalition government's initial ambitions for radically transforming the overall structure of public-private boundaries may be hard to realize.","London Sch Econ, Ctr Anal Social Exclus, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hills, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Anal Social Exclus, London, England.",j.hills@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/F040954/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F040954/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,18,21,22,2,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The contributors of Herbert Simon are well established, thanks to the popularity of bounded rationality and satisficing, and his being award Noble Prize in economics. However, economists are much less familiar with the contributions of George Katona that can be viewed as the father of behavioral economics. Furthermore, the author argues that Katona was also misunderstood by various economists when he was attempting to create a psychologically based economics that rejected the mechanistic psychology of neoclassical economics and introducing the survey method to economic research that he had been using in his experimental psychology research previously. He also had influenced various economists during their debates in the 1950s without given the credit for. Many historians of behavioral economics limit Katona's contributions to the start of behavioral economics only to his contributions to macroeconomics. However, the paper demonstrates that Katona's behavioral economics included his contributions to macroeconomics (bringing realism to Keynesian consumption function and consumption behavior), micro-economics (business behavior, the rationality assumption, etc.), public finance and economic policy, and his introduction of the survey method. To demonstrate these contributions, the author argues that Katona attempted to bring realism to economic analysis - through psychological concepts - beginning with his early days of research in Germany which coincided with German hyper inflation- and continued whether working at New school for Social Research, Chicago University's Cowles Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center. The author also argues that Katona's contributions went through stages, depending upon what economic problem persisted at the time, what advertises he was facing, and what institution/organization he was associated with.

China was an extreme example of a surplus labour economy, but the rapid economic growth during the period of economic reform requires a reassessment of whether the second stage of the Lewis model has been reached or is imminent. The literature is inconclusive. On the one hand, there are reports of migrant labour scarcity and rising migrant wages; on the other hand, estimates suggest that a considerable pool of relatively unskilled labour is still available in the rural sector. Yet the answer has far-reaching developmental and distributional implications. After reviewing the literature, the paper uses the 2002 and 2007 national household surveys of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences to analyse and explain migrant wage behaviour, to predict the determinants of migration, and to examine the size and nature of the pool of potential rural-urban migrants. An attempt is also made to project the rural and urban labour force and migration forward to 2020, on the basis of the 2005 1% Population Survey. The paper concludes that for institutional reasons both phenomena are likely to coexist at present and for some time in the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Postponing such tracking may increase university attendance among disadvantaged students if additional time in school enables them to catch up with their more privileged counterparts. However, if ability and expectations are fairly well set by an early age, postponing tracking during adolescence may not have much effect. This paper exploits an educational reform in Romania to examine the impact of postponing tracking on the proportion of disadvantaged students graduating from university using a regression discontinuity (RD) design. We show that, although students from poor, rural areas and with less educated parents were significantly more likely to finish an academic track and become eligible to apply for university after the reform, this did not translate into an increase in university completion. Our findings indicate that simply postponing tracking, without increasing the slots available in university, is not sufficient to improve access to higher education for disadvantaged groups.

The Korean panel data on the business group firms, allows us to compute ownership right and control right separately for each business group affiliated firm. Our measures are different from the similar measures on the Korean firms as in Back et al. (2004) or Joh (2003). Rather than confounding the two offsetting effects, this paper tests convergence of interest hypothesis and entrenchment hypothesis separately. Empirical findings show that, given control right, there is no clear-cut relation between firm value and the inside management ownership for most firms with the inside management ownership less than 42%, that there is a positive relation between firm value and the inside management ownership for those firms with the inside management ownership higher than 42%, and that, given ownership right, profitability decreases as control right increases.

J,"Teal, F",,,,"Teal, Francis",,,The price of labour and understanding the causes of poverty,LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNEMPLOYMENT; COUNTRIES; SIZE; FIRMS,"This paper provides a review of how questions in labour economics link to the central concerns of development economics in understanding the mechanisms that both create, and perpetuate, poverty in some countries and not others and in some areas within countries. The paper frames this link by asking what determines first the price of labour, then the nature of employment open to labour and finally discusses the links from the price of labour to incomes through the assets owned by the poor. The advent of micro data in developing countries has transformed our knowledge of what needs to be explained. While the price of labour clearly depends on education the links between incomes and education are much weaker than is frequently supposed. The finding from micro data that conditioning on a wide range of observable characteristics of human capital still leaves most of the variation in earnings to be explained suggests the importance of understanding what these other factors might be and how they may interact with human capital. One possibility is that markets are segmented so that individuals with the same skills earn different amounts depending on the sector in which they work. Another possible explanation is that the unobserved characteristics of workers are more important than the observed and that processes of matching and search lead to the outcomes we observe in labour markets. It is argued that these explanations are not mutually exclusive and that different processes may operate across labour markets both within and across countries. The review concludes by outlining outstanding research issues in labour economics where new models and data may well provide insights into explaining the extraordinarily diverse range of outcomes we observe for the price of labour in poor countries.

A novel feature of the approach is the use of an income-health matrix that relates socioeconomic class with health status; each row of the matrix corresponds to a socioeconomic class and contains the respective probability distribution of health. By invoking a monotone assumption on the income-health matrix, which is a direct translation of the well-known hypothesis of social gradients in health outcomes, we derive a set of welfare-dominance and inequality-dominance conditions for ranking health distributions. Unlike other existing health inequality measures, our conditions require no cardinal specification of ordinal heath data and, hence, are robust. We then apply the dominance conditions to compare socioeconomic health inequality in the US and Canada using the newly released JCUSH data.","Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80217 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Zheng, BH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",Buhong.Zheng@ucdenver.edu,,,,,,,45,38,40,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

To this purpose, this study relies on a two-country Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model, where the two countries are supposed to be differently sensitive to the bank capital channel. The model allows us to demonstrate how a given symmetric shock causes cyclical divergences inside a heterogeneous monetary union. On this point, it allows reproducing some stylized facts recently observed in the Euro Area. Moreover, it appears that the more heterogeneous the union, the larger the effects of financial asymmetries on the transmission of shocks. Finally, we show that a common monetary policy contributes to worsen cyclical divergences, in comparison with monetary policies that would be nationally conducted. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This is interpreted as evidence in support of the theory of real options in capital budgeting decisions, which predicts that uncertainty about, for example, commodity prices will cause firms to delay production and investment. We continue that investigation by analyzing the effect of oil price uncertainty on monthly measures of U.S. firm production related to industries in mining, manufacturing, and utilities. We use a more general specification, an updated sample that includes the increased oil price volatility since 2008, and we control for other nonlinear measures of oil prices. We find additional empirical evidence in support of the predictions of real options theory, and our results indicate that the extreme volatility in oil prices observed in 2008 and 2009 contributed to the severity of the decline in manufacturing activity.","[Elder, John] Colorado State Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Serletis, Apostolos] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",Colorado State University; University of Calgary,"Elder, J (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, 1272 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",,"Elder, John/HHS-3114-2022","Elder, John/0000-0003-1851-8601",,,,,20,41,45,1,23,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This issue is difficult to analyze with the commonly used applied trade models, because they represent trade flows at an aggregate level, while sensitive products are picked at the product level and their protection, under the form of tariff-rate quotas, is contingent on the level of imports. This paper assesses the effect of these exceptions, based on the case of agricultural trade protection in Europe and Japan, two countries where tariff dismantling in the agricultural sector is a particularly sensitive issue. Since agricultural border protection is heterogeneous, we avoid aggregation bias by extending a multi-country computable general equilibrium model to the product level. This allows us to represent trade policies explicitly and to account for their interdependencies. The results suggest that consideration of sensitive products strongly limits the potential gains from a possible agriculture agreement at Doha. Moreover, there is no aggregate trade-off between decreasing tariffs and increasing/opening quotas. To achieve substantial market access improvements in the agricultural sector, the objective should be most favored nation tariff reduction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We first attempt to utilize the so-called Madhavan-Richardson-Roomans model (MRR for short) to simulate the stochastic process of the price-change in empirical data sets (say, EUR/JPY or USD/JPY exchange rates) in which the Bid-Ask spread fluctuates in time. We find that the MRR theory apparently fails to simulate so much as the qualitative behaviour ('non-monotonic' behaviour) of the response function R(l) (l denotes the difference of times at which the response function is evaluated) calculated from the data. Especially, we confirm that the stochastic nature of the Bid-Ask spread causes apparent deviations from a linear relationship between the R(l) and the auto-correlation function C(l), namely, R(l) proportional to-C(l). To make the microscopic model of double-auction markets having stochastic Bid-Ask spread, we use the minority game with a finite market history length and find numerically that appropriate extension of the game shows quite similar behaviour of the response function to the empirical evidence. We also reveal that the minority game modeling with the adaptive ('annealed') look-up table reproduces the non-linear relationship R(l) proportional to-fC(l)) (f(x) stands for a non-linear function leading to 'lambda-shapes') more effectively than the fixed ('quenched') look-up table does.","[Ibuki, Takero; Inoue, Jun-ichi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0640814, Japan",Hokkaido University,"Inoue, JI (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Kita Ku, N14-W9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0640814, Japan.",ibuki@complex.ist.hokudai.ac.jp; j_inoue@complex.ist.hokudai.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22500195] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,27,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

This paper investigates the impact of financial globalization on the incidence of systemic bank crises in 20 emerging markets over the years 1976-2002 using measures of de facto and de jure financial openness. An increase in foreign debt liabilities contributes to an increase in the incidence of crises, but foreign direct investment and portfolio equity liabilities have the opposite effect. A more liberal de jure capital regime lowers the incidence of banking crises, while a regime of fixed exchange rates increases their frequency. The results of the econometric analysis is consistent with the experience of East European and central Asian emerging markets, which attracted a relatively large proportion of capital flows in the form of debt in recent years and have been particularly hard hit by the global financial crisis.","Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA",Wellesley College,"Joyce, JP (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA.",jjoyce@wellesley.edu,,,,,,,56,41,47,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Pulp and paper mill integrated forest biorefineries offer one important means to increase biofuel production. This study analyzes the effects of policies to support biofuel production in the pulp and paper sector. We study the relative effectiveness of three biofuel supporting policy instruments, namely production subsidy, input subsidy and investment subsidy. We present a partial equilibrium pulp and paper market model with a biorefinery investment option. A numerical model is used to evaluate the impacts of policy instruments on wood prices, as well as input choices and investment strategies of pulp and paper industries. The data represent the Finnish pulp and paper sector. We evaluate the values and direct costs of the policy instruments in a situation of exogenous biofuel production targets. The direct costs of input and investment subsidies are higher than those of a production subsidy. With all the policy instruments. Finnish pulp and paper mills would invest in wood-gasifying technology, instead of black liquor based one. The number of biorefinery units is dependent on the subsidy type - investment and input subsidies are likely to result in more numerous but smaller biofuel production units than a production subsidy. With all the policy instruments the demand for wood increases in Finland leading to higher wood prices. This, in turn, could reflect negatively on the profitability of the pulp and paper industries. To a significant degree, the model and the results can be generalized to other countries and markets where integrated pulp and paper mills are operating. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This trade-off is affected by market demand, cost differential, and market competition, among other things.

Under moment conditions alone, we suggest several easily implemented tests based on the parameter estimators for artificial autoregressions modeled by the differences in residuals. Under the null hypotheses, the tests for serial correlation are two-sided and asymptotically chi-square distributed, whereas those for random effects are one-sided, and are asymptotically standard normally distributed variables. Moreover, these methods can also be used similarly to construct tests for both serial correlation and individual effects jointly, whether or not time effects are present. The proposed tests are able to detect local alternatives that are distinct from the null at the parametric rate.

Under one formulation, raising the targeted savings rate increases labor supply regardless of the slope of the labor supply curve; under a second, raising the targeted savings rate has the same effect on labor supply as that of raising the labor income tax rate; and under a third, raising the targeted savings rate has no effect on labor supply.

Surprisingly, we then find that the equilibrium price of advertisements is first increasing, then decreasing, in the targeting capacity. We trace out the implications of targeting for competing media. We distinguish offline and online media by their targeting ability: low versus high. As consumers' relative exposure to online media increases, the revenues of offline media decrease, even though the price of advertising might increase.","[Bergemann, Dirk] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Bonatti, Alessandro] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Yale University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Bergemann, D (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",dirk.bergemann@yale.edu; bonatti@mit.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0851200] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,27,119,140,2,90,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0741-6261,,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

During the second half of this period, residential electricity tariffs remained nominally fixed, while rising incomes increased sales of durables. Our study is one of few that use monthly data to examine the contribution of prices to residential consumption growth, and it appears to be the first time-series study to explicitly consider the impact of air conditioners on residential demand. Results indicate that durables have an impact on residential electricity demand. Simulations illustrate how prices, income, and durables impact future demand. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper introduces a new condition, called regularity, that is simple and easy to verify. Regularity requires that if there is a sequence of strategies converging to s* such that the players' payoffs along the sequence converge to the best-reply payoffs at s*, then s* is an equilibrium. We show that regularity is implied both by Reny's better-reply security and Simon and Zame's endogenous sharing rule approach. This allows us to explore a link between these two distinct methods. Although regularity implies that the limits of epsilon-equilibria are equilibria, it is in general too weak for implying equilibrium existence. However, we are able to identify extra conditions that, together with regularity, are sufficient for equilibrium existence. In particular, we show how regularity allows the technique of approximating games both by payoff functions and space of strategies.","Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Managerial Econ & Decis Sci, Evanston, IL 60201 USA",Northwestern University,"de Castro, LI (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Managerial Econ & Decis Sci, Evanston, IL 60201 USA.",decastro.luciano@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,19,19,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Earlier empirical evidence in support of such a link was based on inappropriate econometric models. We show that there is no credible evidence that monetary policy responses to oil price shocks caused large aggregate fluctuations in the 1970s and 1980s or more recently. Our analysis suggests that the traditional monetary policy reaction framework should be replaced by models that take account of the endogeneity of the real price of oil and that allow policy responses to depend on the underlying causes of oil price shocks.,"[Kilian, Lutz] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, CEPR, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Kilian, L (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lkilian@umich.edu,,,,,,,34,178,194,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

The analysis builds upon a ten-region overlapping generations model of the world economy where capital is mobile across regions. Results show that, over the first half of the century, emerging regions will finance the demand of capital coming from the developed world where population aging is relatively advanced. In particular, the findings suggest that in the coming decades China will be the world's main creditor region. However, in the second half of the century, India will take over this leading position because of the predicted decline in the Chinese labor force.

The problem is how to explain this price dispersion on a market where there is no evident arbitrage. Explanations proposed by different authors include differences in organization, the characteristics of the good, and the influences of social interactions between buyers and sellers. In line with the last of these three approaches, we consider the fish market of Marseille as a seller-seller network We start by examining the influence of market interactions, through a static and then a dynamic econometric model. We then analyze the role of the seller's position in the network. We bring to light a surprising paradox, in that the sellers who share the most buyers with competitors (i.e. the most central sellers) charge the highest prices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate this proposition empirically using data on promotion decisions taken by senior English judges between 1985 and 2005. Throughout this period the popular view was one of ill-disciplined elitism: senior judges were alleged to be favouring candidates from elite backgrounds over their equally capable non-elite counterparts. We find evidence in support of this view to be surprisingly weak; most of the unconditional difference in promotion prospects between the two groups can simply be explained by differences in promotion-relevant characteristics. We then exploit an unexpected proposal to remove control over promotions from the judiciary and find that judges' behaviour dramatically changed. When faced by the prospect of losing autonomy, senior judges began to favour non-elite candidates, as well as candidates who were unconnected to members of the promotion committee.

This paper hypothesizes that immigrants can exploit social networks of different scales in order to substitute for costly integration. Using a novel dataset of Turkish households in Berlin, which was specifically collected for this analysis, we investigate the determinants of integration as well as the impact of integration and networks on households' economic success. We find evidence that integration promotes income even after accounting for potential endogeneity bias. Using endogenous switching regression model, we test whether local ethnic networks can be successfully used to generate household income. In line with the view that there is a trade-off between integration and the establishment of ethnic contacts, we find that local ethnic and familial networks increase the income of unintegrated migrants, while transnational networks decrease it. Moreover, education is more income improving for integrated than non-integrated immigrants and remaining closely integrated within their own ethnic group is more economically advantageous for poorer households. These results provide evidence that integration is the rational strategy for better-off immigrants while it may be too costly for poorer immigrants.","[Danzer, Alexander M.] Univ Munich LMU, Dept Econ, Munich, Germany; [Danzer, Alexander M.] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Ulku, Hulya] Univ Manchester, Inst Dev Policy & Management IDPM, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Munich; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Manchester,"Danzer, AM (通讯作者)，LMU Munchen, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",alexander.danzer@lrz.uni-muenchen.de; hulya.ulku@manchester.ac.uk,,"Danzer, Alexander/0000-0001-7920-7052",,,,,46,21,27,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2011,64.0,3,,,,,342,365,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00510.x,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,794BD,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292868300003,0

In particular, we show that the condition according to which the rate of growth of population should be higher than the interest rate is no longer sufficient for obtaining welfare improvements via debt increases and that the level of optimal debt is, ceteris paribus, lower than the one arising with exogenous fertility. Finally, a sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal level of debt is higher the lower the capital share, the higher individuals' degree of patience, the bigger the child-rearing cost and the lower the preference for children. On policy grounds we argue that debt-tightening policies may be optimal in the long run provided that the cost of rearing children does not increase (or, if anything, does decrease).","[Spataro, Luca] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Spataro, Luca] CHILD, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Spataro, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",l.spataro@ec.unipi.it,"Spataro, Luca/AAD-9002-2020","Spataro, Luca/0000-0002-5202-8879",,,,,22,5,5,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1465-6485,,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

The approach to macrodynamic modelling taken here extends the KMG model of Chiarella and Flaschel (2000), focusing in particular on the incorporation of financial markets and policy issues. The original KMG model considered three asset markets (equities, bonds and money) but depicted them in a rudimentary way so that they had little influence on the real side of the model. The only financial market influencing the real side of the economy was the money market (via an LM curve theory of interest). Here Tobin's portfolio choice theory models the demand for each asset in such a way that the total amount of assets that households want to hold equals their net wealth, which is a stock constraint attached to portfolio choice. There is also a flow constraint, that the net amount of assets accumulated (liabilities issued) by one sector must equal its net savings (expenditures). The Tobinian macroeconomic portfolio approach characterizes the potential for financial market instability, focusing on the interconnectedness of all three markets. The paper goes on to study the potential for labour market and fiscal policies to stabilize unstable macroeconomies.","[Asada, Toichiro] Chuo Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Chiarella, Carl] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Flaschel, Peter] Univ Bielefeld, D-4800 Bielefeld, Germany; [Mouakil, Tarik] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Proano, Christian; Semmler, Willi] New Sch Univ, New York, NY USA",Chuo University; University of Technology Sydney; University of Bielefeld; University of Cambridge; The New School,"Asada, T (通讯作者)，Chuo Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",,,"Semmler, Willi/0000-0002-8384-8159; Proano, Christian/0000-0002-5148-7635",,,,,23,10,10,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

To do this, we exploit variation in the living conditions experienced by Yemenite children after being airlifted to Israel in 1949. We find that children who were placed in a more modern environment (i.e. with better sanitary and infrastructure conditions) were more likely to obtain higher education, marry at an older age, have fewer children, and work at age 55.

The model chosen is the flexible accelerator and the classification of the attractors is made in terms of Wolfram four classes. The model at the origins of mathematical business cycle theories (Frisch, 1933) generates class 1 limit points. The model by Goodwin (1951) generates class 2 limit cycles. We construct a class 3 basin of attraction, strange attractors, by coupling through trade variants of the oscillators present in Goodwin (1951). It is shown that coupled oscillators may generate non-stochastic irregular dynamic behaviours of the Goodwin (1946) type. The irregularity is shown through the computation of very rugged devil staircases. Whether the system of coupled nonlinear oscillators presented here belong to the class 4 type is still an open question. The analogy with the system of coupled oscillators and the well-known Fermi-Pasta-Ulam experiment is also explored.","Univ Trent, I-38100 Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Zambelli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Trent, I-38100 Trento, Italy.",,,,,,,,29,11,12,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We find that cigarette price is an important determinant of smoking. In our two-part model, the overall price elasticity is -0.82. Nevertheless, tobacco demand is influenced by both price and quality. We net out the quality effect of tobacco demand to obtain standard price elasticities, which are between -0.70 and -0.35. In addition, when we estimate two demand systems of Chinese households, the estimated own-price elasticities of cigarettes are -0.57 and -0.81. These elasticities suggest that if the tobacco excise tax rate goes up, cigarette consumption will drop rapidly, and government revenue from the tobacco tax will increase. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The dependent variable is intermarriage across ethnic groups (on the basis of ancestry and country of birth) and the inclusion of the explanatory variables is justified by a simple rational choice economic model. A binomial logistic regression is estimated using data from the 1980 US Census, the last Census where post-migration marriages can be identified. Results show that the probability of intermarriage increases the longer a migrant resides in the U.S. and the younger the age at arrival. Both relationships can be attributable to the accumulation of US-specific human capital and an erosion of ethnic-specific human capital. Inter-ethnic marriages are more likely between individuals with similar education levels, providing evidence of positive assortative mating by education for immigrants. The construction of the availability ratio for potential spouses from one's own group and group size where one lives using data from several Censuses provides a the measure of the marriage market. Intermarriage is lower the greater the availability ratio and the larger the size of one's own group. Linguistic distance of the immigrant's mother tongue from English indirectly measures the effect of English language proficiency at arrival and is found to be a significant negative predictor of intermarriage. Those who report multiple ancestries and who were previously married are more likely to intermarry.","[Chiswick, Barry R.; Houseworth, Christina] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60628 USA; [Chiswick, Barry R.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Houseworth, Christina] Litigat Analyt, New York, NY USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Chiswick, BR (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60628 USA.",brchis@uic.edu,"Houseworth, Christina/ABB-1368-2020",,,,,,42,63,72,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Using three alternative econometric techniques on constructed pseudo-panels, the paper provides a set of estimators for the traditional notion of income mobility as well as for mobility around extreme and moderate poverty lines. The estimates suggest very high levels of time-dependent unconditional immobility for the Region. However, the introduction of socioeconomic and personal factors reduces the estimate of income immobility by around 30 percent. There are also large variations in country-specific income mobility (estimated to explain some additional 10 percent of inter-temporal income variation). Analyzing the determinants of changes in poverty incidence within cohorts revealed statistically significant roles for age, gender, and education of the household head, the latter subject to distinctive effects across levels of attainment and transition in and out of poverty.","[Cuesta, Jose] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Cuesta, Jose] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Pizzolitto, Georgina] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",The World Bank; Georgetown University; Yale University,"Cuesta, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jcuesta@worldbank.org,,"Nopo, Hugo/0000-0003-1769-2376",,,,,29,20,28,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Specifically, we explicate the behaviorist and empiricist foundations of the organizational routines and capabilities literature and the extant emphasis placed on experience, repetition, and observation as the key antecedents and mechanisms of routines and capabilities. Based on this discussion we highlight several, endogeneity-related concerns, namely: (1) the problem of origins and causation, (2) the problem of extremes, (3) the problem of intentionality, (4) the problem of new knowledge, and (5) the problem of the environment.

This paper builds upon a recent wave of empirical research to answer eight key questions underlying much of the brain drain debate: 1) What is brain drain? 2) Why should economists care about it? 3) Is brain drain increasing? 4) Is there a positive relationship between skilled and unskilled migration? 5) What makes brain drain more likely? 6) Does brain gain exist? 7) Do high-skilled workers remit, invest, and share knowledge back home? 8) What do we know about the fiscal and production externalities of brain drain?","[Gibson, John] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; [McKenzie, David] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [McKenzie, David] UCL, Ctr Res & Anal Migrat CReAM, London, England; [McKenzie, David] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Waikato; The World Bank; University of London; University College London; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Gibson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand.",jkgibson@waikato.ac.nz; dmckenzie@worldbank.org,"Gibson, John/AAM-6159-2020","Gibson, John/0000-0003-3886-6873",,,,,48,92,122,4,54,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

I present a model in which welfare-promoting adaptation of legal rules depends on the incentives of both judges (to risk rule change) and litigants (to bear the cost associated with informing the court about novel features of the environment and alternative rules.) I demonstrate that a legal system will not adapt through adjudication if legal costs relative to damages are either too high or too low, if judicial incentives for change are inadequate or if judicial error rates are initially too high. Comparatively, I show that a legal regime is likely to do better with improved mechanisms for processing information system-wide to reduce judicial error and lower absolute legal costs, but that other apparently beneficial institutional features such as lower relative legal costs, judges who are more willing to adapt law or who make fewer initial errors may or may not lead to lower welfare overall.

The article argues for an agnostic perspective on Tanzanian economic growth. Modelling efforts of African growth are more sophisticated than the quality of the data justifies.

We find that inflation rate differentials with respect to the US inflation rate are the driving forces for the nonlinear relationships in the monetary model for exchange rates for the data from Germany, the UK, Canada, France and Italy. In addition to the variables in the traditional monetary model, also the relative interest rates are relevant in determining exchange rate changes only when the inflation differentials are either very large or very small. In contrast to previous studies we find significant long-run effects in the error correction representation of the monetary model for exchange rates when the nonlinear dynamics is taken into account in the analysis.

The experience of the 1970s and 1980s showed that adverse unemployment shocks could have long-lasting effects with very serious economic and social consequences. A key mechanism producing these adverse consequences was hysteresis in unemployment whereby temporary rises in unemployment generated by supply and/or demand shocks had permanent (or, at least, very persistent) effects. Clearly, it is important to understand how hysteresis mechanisms might operate in order to avoid such adverse outcomes. On the other hand, experience during the subsequent two decades showed that, under more favourable macroeconomic conditions, it is possible to observe 'good' hysteresis effects. Now is a very appropriate time to re-visit the issue of hysteresis in unemployment in order to avoid the errors of the 1970s and 1980s and, if possible, to get hysteresis effects working in a positive direction.","Univ Oxford St Annes Coll, Oxford OX2 6HS, England",University of Oxford,"O'Shaughnessy, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford St Annes Coll, Oxford OX2 6HS, England.",terry.oshaughnessy@economics.ox.ac.uk,"O'Shaughnessy, Terry/GWC-6916-2022",,,,,,68,18,18,3,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Outside interference from stepchildren and/or in-laws significantly hastens the divorce decision, followed by sexual issues and/or a poor match. Intolerance of outside interference is explained by Hamilton's rule on genetics, with other problems explained by Becker's insights on the gains from marriage.

This paper revisits the role played by myopia in generating a theoretical rationale for pay-as-you-go (PAYG) social security in dynamically efficient economies. If the competing asset is linear storage and myopic agents are allowed to borrow against future pension benefits, there is no welfare-rationale for PAYG pensions. Sufficiently strong myopia may justify such pensions only if agents cannot borrow against their future pension, but then they are at a zero-saving corner. With enough myopia, co-existence of positive optimal pensions and positive private saving is possible if the return to saving declines with saving, as in a model with a neoclassical technology.","[Andersen, Torben M.] Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Bhattacharya, Joydeep] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Aarhus University; Iowa State University,"Andersen, TM (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Bldg 1322, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",tandersen@econ.au.dk; joydeep@iastate.edu,,"Bhattacharya, Joydeep/0000-0002-3148-4592",,,,,19,29,30,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In this paper we explore one possible reason: country specific labor market institutions, giving rise to different inflation volatilities. When unemployment insurance schemes differ, as they do in EMU, reservation wages react differently in each country to area-wide shocks. This implies that real marginal costs and inflation also react differently. We report evidence for EMU countries supporting the existence of a cross-country link over the cycle between labor market structures on the one side and real wages and inflation on the other. We then build a DSGE model that replicates the data evidence. The inflation volatility differentials produced by asymmetric labor markets generate welfare losses at the currency area level of approximately 0.3% of steady state consumption.

Our findings support the view of a heterogeneous informal sector that is not primarily host to subsistence activities. While an assessment of initial investment identifies some informal activities with negligible entry barriers, a notable cost of entry is associated with most activities. We find very heterogeneous patterns of capital returns in informal MSEs. At very low levels of capital, marginal returns are extremely high-often exceeding 70 percent per month. Above a capital stock of 150 International Dollars, marginal returns are found to be relatively low at around 4-7 percent monthly. We provide some evidence that the high returns at low capital stocks reflect high risks. At the same time, most MSEs appear to be severely capital constrained.","[Lay, Jann] Univ Gottingen, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany; [Grimm, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands; German Inst Global & Area Studies GIGA, Hamburg, Germany",University of Gottingen; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; German Institute of Global & Area Studies,"Lay, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Jungfernstieg 21, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.",lay@giga-hamburg.de,"Lay, Jann/AAP-7896-2020","Lay, Jann/0000-0002-0784-3807",,,,,26,42,43,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

This paper provides further discourse in this area with a study on Indonesia and its trade agreements with Japan (IJEPA) and ASEAN (AFTA). A static global CGE model, known as the Global Trade Analysis Project, was used to project the Indonesian economy to the year 2022, with and without tariff reforms agreed under the agreements. Environmental impacts are assessed using different pollution indicators air, water and waste. The study suggests that Indonesia would grow rapidly over the period considered with a large deterioration in its environment. Following these, however, the agreements only have a marginal positive impact on Indonesia's output but with a noticeable increase in trade flows and signs of trade diversion. Overall AFTA has a greater impact on the Indonesian economy compared to IJEPA. Similarly, the impact of trade liberalization on the environment is marginal. On the whole, tariff reform is inducing air pollution and reducing water pollution. In conclusion, the study suggests that Indonesia's participation in the AFTA and IJEPA agreements is not likely to bring drastic changes to her economic and environmental performance.

We give conditions under which there is a unique optimal contract, and show that it must have a simple flat payment plus bonus structure. That is, output levels are divided into two sets, and the optimal contract pays the same wage for all output levels in each set.

We study data on trade and currency bloc formation in Europe after the Great Depression. Far removed from being customs or currency unions, these blocs could not create much trade and should be mere placebos. Yet under conventional approaches to the gravity equation, they exhibit highly significant and sometimes very large trade effects. We employ treatment effect methods from labor econometrics to identify endogeneity both along the time axis and in the cross section. We find pervasive evidence of such endogeneity, which standard estimates of the gravity equation fail to detect. These findings are confirmed by matching models designed to eliminate the endogeneity of bloc formation itself.

The society consists of rich and poor. The rich are initially in power, but expect to transition to democracy, which will choose redistributive policies. Taxation requires the employment of bureaucrats. By choosing an inefficient state structure, the rich may be able to use patronage and capture democratic politics, so reducing the amount of redistribution in democracy. Moreover, the inefficient state creates its own constituency and tends to persist over time. Intuitively, an inefficient state structure creates more rents for bureaucrats than would an efficient one. When the poor come to power in democracy, they will reform the structure of the state to make it more efficient so that higher taxes can be collected at lower cost and with lower rents for bureaucrats. Anticipating this, when the society starts out with an inefficient organization of the state, bureaucrats support the rich, who set lower taxes but also provide rents to bureaucrats. We obtain that the rich-bureaucrats coalition may also expand the size of bureaucracy excessively so as to generate enough political support. The model shows that an equilibrium with an inefficient state is more likely to arise when there is greater income inequality, when bureaucratic rents take intermediate values, and when individuals are sufficiently forward-looking.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ticchi, Davide] Univ Urbino, I-61029 Urbino, Italy; [Vindigni, Andrea] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Urbino; Princeton University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",daron@mit.edu; davide.ticchi@uniurb.it; vindigni@princeton.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023","TICCHI, Davide/0000-0003-4166-1692",,,,,55,126,155,1,47,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We test the creditworthiness/trustworthiness nexus in an investment game experiment on a sample of participants/nonparticipants in a microfinance program in Argentina and find that trustors give significantly more to (and believe they will receive more from) microfinance borrowers. The first- and second-order beliefs of trustees are also consistent with this picture. Our findings then show that MF participants appear more trustworthy and this may help microfinance to work. A related consequence is that, if (and only if) borrower's trustworthiness is not public information, the mere loan provision acts as a reputation enhancing signal increasing the borrower's attractiveness as a business partner. In such case we have a channel through which a private financial intermediary contributes to the provision of a public good like information, thereby reducing the adverse consequences of market failures on the creation of economic value.

Germany is a good example where the spending on start-up subsidies for the unemployed accounted for nearly 17% of the total spending on ALMP in 2004. In contrast to other programs like vocational training, job creation schemes, or wage subsidies the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of such schemes is still scarce: especially regarding long-term effects and effect heterogeneity. This paper aims to close this gap. We use administrative and survey data from a large sample of participants in two distinct start-up programs and a control group of unemployed individuals. We find that over 80% of participants are integrated in the labor market and have relatively high labor income five years after start-up. Additionally, participants are much more satisfied with their current occupational situation compared to previous jobs. Based on propensity score matching methods we estimate the long-term effects of the programs against non-participation and take great care in assessing the sensitivity of our results with respect to deviations from the identifying assumption. Our results turn out to be robust and show that both programs are effective with respect to income and employment outcomes in the long-run, i.e., five years after start-up. Moreover, we consider effect heterogeneity with respect to several dimensions and show that startup subsidies for the unemployed tend to be most effective for disadvantaged groups in the labor market.

J,"Caputo, M",,,,"Caputo, Michele",,,Seismicity in Italy: The Problem of Insurance of the Real Estate Property,ECONOMIA POLITICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"After few considerations on the damage caused by earthquakes and on how different countries address the consequent economic implications, we consider the problem of the insurance of the buildings for the earthquake risk. The risk for insurance purposes may tentatively be estimated with the random walk (RW) method since the earthquakes are measured in the new scale of the seismic moment. The method is addressed to the case when only forward steps are possible and the probability density function (pdf) of their occurrence, that is the waiting time pdf, is formulated to lead to a Mittag Leffler function. It is seen that when pdf of the sizes of the steps is a negative power law then the integral equation leading to the solution of the problem is reduced to a fractional order differential equation with two different orders of fractional differentiation. The solution is then found in dosed form in the time domain using the Laplace Transform. It is finally shown how the theory may tentatively model the risk of real estate insurance providers to cover the cost of the damage caused by earthquakes and consequently guide the estimate of the premiums for the risk.","[Caputo, Michele] Univ Rome, Dipartimento Fis, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Caputo, Michele] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, College Stn, TX USA",Sapienza University Rome; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Caputo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rome, Dipartimento Fis, Piazzale A Moro 2, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",mcaputo@g24ux.phys.uniroma1.it,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,3,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1120-2890,,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

The market and welfare effects of MCOOL are shown to be case-specific and dependent on the labeling costs at the farm and retail levels, the strength of consumer preference for domestic products, the market power of retailers, the marketing margin along the supply chain, and the relative costs of imported and domestic products. Simulation results for the U.S. market of fresh apples indicate that domestic producers are the most likely beneficiaries of MCOOL, followed by domestic consumers. Being unable to exercise market power on consumers or suppliers of fresh apples, retailers will lose if the implementation of MCOOL entails fixed costs.

This is done by taking the direct product of the model with itself, i.e. we combine two similar system dynamics under a joint objective functional that is separable in both states and controls. This framework can be applied to the construction of various optimal control problems, such as optimal marketing of related products, optimal growth of separate but interacting economies, or optimal control of two related capital stocks. We study such a system for a particular case drawn from the domain of drug control. The main result of this paper is that in this domain even a modest amount of interaction can sometimes make a very big difference. Hence, drawing conclusions by simplifying the real world into two independent, one-dimensional models may be problematic. Methodologically the combination of two systems with DNSS property leads to a fascinating series of situations with multiple optimal steady states and associated threshold behavior. These instances reflect some important recent developments in optimal dynamic control theory. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Economic theorists have argued that the fragmentation of the global production chain is partly attributable to the high growth in international trade over the past several decades. In this study, we examine vertical specialization in China, Japan and Korea, and its contribution to these nations' trade. Using a multilevel model, it is illustrated that vertical specialization has encouraged increases in trade among all three countries. In particular, China's outcome is remarkable considering how recently it became a member of the WTO.","[Kim, Soo Eun] Kyung Hee Univ, Grad Sch Int Business & Trade, Seoul, South Korea; [Hwang, Yun Seop] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, Seoul, South Korea; [Song, Jun] Cheng Yinhe Dynasty Sub Branch Works Minist, China Cit Bank, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Kyung Hee University; Kyung Hee University,"Kim, SE (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Grad Sch Int Business & Trade, Seoul, South Korea.",rusiahys@khu.ac.kr; ck_sjun@hotmail.com; sookim@khu.ac.kr,"Hwang, Yun/AAJ-8792-2020","Hwang, Yun/0000-0001-7936-5632",,,,,40,2,2,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2011,19.0,2,,,,,109,126,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01238.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,745GS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289154500007,0

Our starting point is a simple game-theoretic model in which secular leaders enhance their power by influencing the location of sacred places. The model includes standard equilibria - such as pure competition and state-sponsored monopoly - as well as a novel equilibrium, which we call the neutral nexus, wherein a sacred place gains widespread authority precisely because it lies beyond the centers of secular power. The nexus can promote cooperation, innovation, and exchange. especially where markets are weak and power is fragmented. It can also sustain random divination - a surprisingly effective way to manage conflict and risk.

We argue that the decision to work and behavior at work is very much driven by the search for relational goods and moral goods, defined as intangible entities that emerge from social interactions. The goodness of relational and moral goods stems from their being commonly shared.

Thorstein Veblen articulated many of the early concerns in Higher Learning in America ([1918] 1965). Many current commentaries on the subject echo Veblen's sentiments but appear to be oblivious of his tremendous intellectual legacy. This sad state of affairs may be a product of the severe reaction of early critics to Higher Learning followed by years of scholarly indifference. Nevertheless, the modern critiques of corporatism in the academy attest to the remarkable prescience of Veblen and his unique evolutionary perspective. Furthermore, critical opinion to the contrary, Higher Learning lacks neither logical consistency nor methodological integrity.

We demonstrate that the environmental tax in the steady-state equilibrium in a dynamic environmental tax game is lower than that in a static environmental one. Therefore, the dynamic behaviour of the governments results in an increase in the environmental damage. Further, as a result of international cooperation on environmental taxes between two countries in the beginning of policy competition, there is an increase in the optimal environmental tax. This implies that it is important to set cooperative environmental taxes in the beginning of policy competition because non-cooperative environmental taxes in the dynamic game result in the race-to-the-bottom, which does not lead to environmental improvement.","Gifu Shotoku Gakuen Univ, Fac Econ & Informat, Gifu 5008288, Japan",,"Ohori, S (通讯作者)，Gifu Shotoku Gakuen Univ, Fac Econ & Informat, 1-38 Nakauzura, Gifu 5008288, Japan.",ohori@gifu.shotoku.ac.jp,,"Ohori, Shuichi/0000-0002-4155-1082",,,,,19,0,0,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Other exchange rates based on the euro also display mean reversion with the parametric methods. For the US dollar rates, the unit-root null hypothesis cannot be rejected in any single country, indicating that shocks affecting the exchange rates against the US dollar are of a permanent nature, while those directed against the euro are less persistent, and tend sometimes to disappear in the long run.

Performance is measured by the output response following recessions, by the capacity to rebound, as well as the depth and length of the crisis rather than average rates of growth that aggregate periods of recessions and periods of growth. Results highlight that the post-recession performance in Central and Eastern Europe resembles that of emerging and developing countries in the aftermath of banking and financial crises, often following significant liberalizations. In contrast, the post-crisis performance of CIS countries resembles the output response observed during episodes of civil wars, and remains significantly different from the normal response of an average market country.

Furthermore, the expenditure differs regionally, which may occur due to supply variations or historic-cultural distinctions.","[Diniz, Sibelle Cornelio; Machado, Ana Flavia] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Ciencias Econ, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Machado, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Ciencias Econ, Antonio Carlos Av 6627,Room 3040, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",sibelled@gmail.com; afmachad@cedeplar.ufmg.br,"Diniz, Sibelle/M-9355-2013","Machado, Ana Flavia/0000-0001-8573-7906; Cornelio Diniz, Sibelle/0000-0002-3183-3588",,,,,32,42,49,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The smoothing hypothesis is that remittances are countercyclical with respect to income in the worker's country of origin (the recipient of the remittance), while procyclical with respect to income in the migrant's host country (the sender of the remittance). The econometric results confirm the hypothesis. This affirmation of smoothing is important for two reasons. First, it suggests that remittances should be placed on the list of criteria for an optimum currency area. Second, it brings into doubt plans by governments in some developing countries to harness remittances for their own use, in that government spending in these countries generally fails the test of countercyclicality which remittances pass.","Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Frankel, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jeffrey_frankel@harvard.edu,,,,,,,47,88,98,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We construct measures of the ratio of skilled to unskilled employment and the ratio of skilled to unskilled wages in each industry. Using a relationship implied by profit maximizing behaviour on the part of representative firms, this data generates estimates of structural parameters.

In this case, an increase in specific training leads to greater job security and lower wages. The wage result, although perhaps counterintuitive, is supported by, and helps explain, published empirical work. Even with lower wages, training policies may be Pareto-improving or may lower welfare, depending on the elasticity of demand for labor. Training mandates and subsidies to training, because of their differing impacts on job security, have different unemployment and welfare effects; mandates are preferred. If government policy can influence specific training and job security independently, training is never optimally encouraged. Policies that promote general training and policies that promote specific training can both raise employment, but in different ways. Specific training lowers the employment outflow; general training raises the employment inflow.","Univ S Florida, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Carter, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",cartert@mail.usf.edu,"Campos Quispe, Andres/B-4247-2014",,,,,,29,0,0,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Particular attention is paid to the arbitrage and the spread in triangular foreign exchange trades. There is only one possible triangle when a bilateral exchange rate equals its trilateral rate. Otherwise, any third currency would potentially create arbitrage opportunities. Empirical testing evidence supports that small but possibly exploitable profitable arbitrage has significantly occurred over the very short haul of uncertainty and turbulence. In other words, we are convinced that the bilateral exchange rate could be diverged from one common currency side of the trilateral basket rates until markets function efficiently. This helps in better explaining foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, we find that the currency correlating decreases slightly but the volatility increases over time, as we expected.","Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Choi, MS (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",msc50355@yahoo.co.kr,"Choi, Myoung Shik/AGZ-8036-2022","Choi, Myoung Shik/0000-0001-7049-5799",,,,,24,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We present the implications for the unemployment-inflation trade-off. We show that, with norms and variable bargaining power, besides the natural rate of unemployment, the unemployment rate at which firms establish/cancel norms, and the one at which the labor bargaining power reach maximum are relevant to decision making We show that, in the presence of norms, the response of the unemployment rate to a change in the monetary policy stance is relatively large, and temporarily concomitant increases in the unemployment rate and inflation can occur.","Acad Econ Studies, Int Business & Econ Fac, Romanian Ctr Econ Policies, Natl Bank Romania, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Croitoru, L (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Int Business & Econ Fac, Romanian Ctr Econ Policies, Natl Bank Romania, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,11,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

This overview leads to discussion of the benefits of combining process-based water footprints with information from input-output techniques. The central theme and proposition is that environmental multi-region input-output analysis (E-MRIO) has a powerful capacity to establish the geography of embodied water, and to complement process-based approaches to WF by expanding their supply-chain coverage. Combining process and input-output information provides valuable information for a diverse set of water planning and water policy objectives. A comprehensive and systematic outline of potential policy applications of E-MRIO (and process analysis methods) is presented.","[Daniels, Peter L.] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Lenzen, Manfred] Univ Sydney, ISA, Sch Phys, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Kenway, Steven J.] Univ Queensland, Adv Water Management Ctr, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Griffith University; University of Sydney; University of Queensland,"Daniels, PL (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",p.daniels@griffith.edu.au,"Lenzen, Manfred/D-3161-2013; Kenway, Steven/J-8031-2013","Kenway, Steven/0000-0002-2095-9388; Lenzen, Manfred/0000-0002-0828-5288",,,,,45,96,107,9,102,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Events, however, differed widely from what happened during the Asian crisis that usually serves as the model case for the concept of twin crises. We look at three elements that help to explain the nature of events in Central and Eastern Europe: the problem of currency mismatches, the relation between currency and banking crises and the importance of multinational banks for financial stability. We show that theoretical considerations concerning internal capital markets of multinational banks help us understand what happened on capital markets and in the financial sector of the region. We discuss opposing effects of multinational banking on financial stability and find that institutional differences are the key to understanding different effects of the global financial crisis. In particular, we argue that it matters whether international activities are organised by subsidiaries or by cross-border financial services, how large the share of foreign currency-denominated credit is and whether the exchange rate is fixed or flexible. Based on these three criteria we give an explanation why the pattern of the crisis in the Baltic countries differed markedly from that in Poland and the Czech Republic, the two largest countries of the region.","[Dietrich, Diemo; Knedlik, Tobias; Lindner, Axel] Halle Inst Econ Res, Halle, Germany; [Dietrich, Diemo] Univ Halle Wittenberg, D-4010 Halle, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Knedlik, T (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res, Halle, Germany.",Tobias.Knedlik@iwh-halle.de,,"Dietrich, Diemo/0000-0002-0861-9380",,,,,47,15,15,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,4,,,,,415,432,,10.1080/14631377.2011.622561,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,883HL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299624800001,0

In this paper, we study how the entire distribution of markups affects resource misallocation and welfare in a general equilibrium framework encompassing a large class of models with imperfect competition. We then identify conditions under which trade opening, by changing the distribution of markups, may reduce welfare. Our approach is novel both in its generality and in the emphasis on the second moment of the markup distribution. Two broad policy recommendations stand out from the analysis. First, whenever there is heterogeneity in markups, be it due to trade or other distortions, there is also an intersectoral misallocation, so that the equilibrium can be improved upon with an appropriate intervention. This suggests that trade liberalization and domestic industrial policy are complementary. Second, ensuring free entry is a crucial precondition to prevent adverse effects from asymmetric trade opening. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We disaggregate cigarette advertising into (1) print, (2) outdoor, (3) entertainment and (4) store. How does advertising persist over time across advertising media? Are there differences in effectiveness of advertising across different smoking rates? Results show that the price elasticity of cigarette demand is negative and within the range of recent estimates, whereas border price elasticities and income elasticities are positive. All elasticities, however, are uniquely sensitive to smoking rates, as is the effectiveness of the Master Settlement Agreement. Current aggregate advertising increases cigarette demand, whereas accompanying negative advertising takes hold in the third year. Upon disaggregation, current store advertising increases smoking in most cases. However, store advertising has a negative effect by the third year, especially in states with smoking rates at or above the median.

Evidence from Spanish regions,LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Immigration; Open economies; Labor market; Employment; Instrumental variables,IMPACT; INFLOWS; CURVE,"We study the labor market effects of the large immigration wave in Spain between 2001 and 2006. In this period the foreign-born share increased from 6% to 13%, with a total inflow exceeding three million immigrants. Our analysis exploits the large variation in the size of immigration flows across Spain's regions. To identify causal effects, we take advantage of the fact that immigrants' location choices were strongly driven by early migrant settlements that arrived during the 1980s. We find that the relatively unskilled migration inflows did not affect the wages or employment rates of unskilled workers in the receiving regions. The growth of the unskilled labor force was absorbed mostly through increases in total employment. This increase did not originate in changes in the composition of regional output, but was instead driven by changes in skill intensity at the industry level. Regions that received a large inflow of unskilled immigrants increased the intensity of use of the now more abundant (unskilled) labor, relative to other regions. The key industries responsible for this absorption were retail, construction, hotels and restaurants and domestic services. These results are inconsistent with standard open economy models but are in line with recent empirical studies for the United States and Germany. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In a two-class economy with distorting taxation, public provision is always welfare improving with respect to pure taxation, given that the public input directly affects household productivity. Moreover, the case for public provision strengthens as households' heterogeneity in input demand fades out, contrary to consolidated results in the literature.

The paper elucidates that the key feature of the study of monetary policy in Pakistan has been preoccupied with neglect either of the demand or the supply function of money and shows how this may lead to imprecise policy actions and mistaken conclusions. Accordingly, we delineate the transmission mechanism of monetary policy by taking into consideration all structural money demand and money supply linkages along with the historically implied identifying assumption in the framework of a marginalized macroeconometric model. The within-sample and out-of-sample evaluations of the model are found satisfactory. The paper presents results of three policy simulations from the estimated model that highlight the impact of alternative monetary policy instruments on the monetary variables under a rule-based and a discretionary policy environment. We find that (i) the SBP subscribes to an unannounced monetary policy rule, (ii) the determination of the policy rate under the announced rule environment stabilizes the monetary sector in that convergence to full equilibrium is smooth and rapid, (iii) a 100 bps reduction in the discount rate, ceteris paribus, decreases money supply by 4.97%, and (iv) the long term implication of reducing (increasing) the reserve requirement ratio on time (demand) deposits, ceteris paribus, is only higher inflation. Finally, we establish that a 100 bps increase in interest rate increases money supply by 3.14% in full equilibrium. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that beyond inefficient regulation of the financial sector, the severity of the present crisis has been caused principally by increasing inequalities of income distribution and rising imbalances in the world economy as well as in the European economy associated with finance-dominated capitalism. From this it follows that in the near and not so near future, the USA will no longer be able to act as the driving force for world demand. In order to avoid a period of deflationary stagnation in major parts of the world economy and a disintegration of the Euro area, we finally propose the policy package of a Keynesian New Deal at the global and at the European level which should consist of: (i) the re-regulation of the financial sector; (ii) the re-orientation of macroeconomic policies along (Post-)Keynesian lines; and (iii) the re-construction of international macroeconomic policy coordination, in particular in the Euro area, and a new world financial order.","[Hein, Eckhard] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany; [Hein, Eckhard] Inst Int Polit Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Truger, Achim] Macroeconom Policy Inst IMK Hans Boeckler Fdn, Dusseldorf, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Hein, E (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany.",,"Hein, Eckhard/HQY-4102-2023","Hein, Eckhard/0000-0002-6542-6630",,,,,95,9,9,0,5,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-0-23030-768-1,INT PAP POLIT ECON,,,2011,,,,,,,190,230,,,,,,41,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BWV66,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295079400006,0

Strategies are applied by municipalities to develop their full potential. A key factor in effective use of strategies for local development are criteria for selecting strategic goals. The article is an attempt to provide applicable selection criteria recommended for local authorities for selection of strategic goals. Methods: Finding a solution to this crucial part of creating any local development strategy required a range of different exploratory methods and techniques. The research process was based on mixed (both qualitative and quantitative) research methods. Purposeful sampling was applied for choosing in-depth interviews. Results: Despite the huge differences in the level of development of municipalities in the Lower Silesia they exhibit remarkable similarities in the ways of creating and selecting goals. The conducted research showed that the criteria applied were inconsistent and varying which was a crucial drawback from the viewpoint of strategic management. The lack of stable, objective criteria impaired an effective attainment of strategic goals which in result hampered the implementation of local development strategy. Conclusions: The combination of results of literature review and advanced empirical research allowed to provide selection criteria applicable for selecting strategic goals. They should be considered as a starting point to create good practices regarded as general pattern solutions for local authorities. Practical implications: Research results indicate a neglected area in the field of local development - municipalities are mainly unaware of the factors resulting in the dramatically low level of implementation of strategic plans. Identified problems require local governments to take actions to overcome them. Current solutions to selecting strategic goals are unsatisfactory. The criteria presented in this paper offer crucial applicable recommendations to help municipalities overcome diverse difficulties of selecting goals in local development strategies. The additional value is the fact that the application of suggested criteria does not require large financial input, and are likely to support public sector's development efforts.","[Ignacy, Jaroslaw] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Strateg Management Dept, Wroclaw, Poland; [Kopyscianski, Tomasz] Wroclaw Sch Banking, Dept Publ Finance, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Ignacy, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Strateg Management Dept, Wroclaw, Poland.",,"Ignacy, Jaroslaw R./H-3221-2011","Ignacy, Jaroslaw/0000-0003-1498-5894",,,,,35,2,2,0,12,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

We employed two multivariate models, namely demand model and production model, based on vector error correction model. Then, we tested Granger causality after finding cointegration among variables for the both models. The results indicate that energy consumption and economic growth are cointegrated and there is bidirectional causality running from energy consumption to economic growth and vice versa. This means that an increase in energy consumption directly affects economic growth and that economic growth also stimulates further energy consumption. Consequently, we conclude that energy is a limiting factor to economic growth in Turkey and, hence, shocks to energy supply will have a negative impact on economic growth and vice versa.","[Ozturk, Ilhan] Cag Univ, Fac Econ & Business, TR-33800 Mersin, Turkey; [Kaplan, Muhittin; Kalyoncu, Huseyin] Meliksah Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-38010 Kayseri, Turkey",Cag University - Turkey; Meliksah University,"Ozturk, I (通讯作者)，Cag Univ, Fac Econ & Business, TR-33800 Mersin, Turkey.",mkaplan@meliksah.edu.tr; ilhanozturk@cag.edu.tr; hkalyoncu@meliksah.edu.tr,"Kaplan, Muhittin/AAB-7632-2020; Ozturk, Ilhan/B-9431-2009","Kaplan, Muhittin/0000-0002-0685-7641; Ozturk, Ilhan/0000-0002-6521-0901",,,,,24,51,52,2,18,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Findings show that a parsimonious FIGARCH model with an asymmetric error distribution characterizes the daily Turkish Lira (TL) returns against US dollar and euro considerably well. We find statistically significant asymmetry and peakedness in conditional returns and time-varying volatility with long-range dependence in conditional volatility. Long memory finding is robust to different specifications for the conditional returns as well as possible shifts in the return and volatility dynamics over sub-periods. Results in the article show that despite the decline in volatility over the course of the recent float, TL returns are still wild compared to developed economies exchange rates during the same period.

The main aim of this work is to open up possibility for a comparative analysis of European regions on the basis of creative potential. A new methodological approach which arises from Florida's 3T model, eliminating, however, its numerous drawbacks, was defined for this purpose. The consequent new creative index is there by the defining indicator of the creative potential of a region. A closer analysis of the individual elements of the model is consequently usable for directed support of development of regions. The work has demonstrated that regions with the highest creative potential are located in Germany and in larger cities in Sweden and Finland. The opposite side of this theoretical table is clearly inhabited by regions in Spain, followed by towns and cities in the Netherlands. Concerning Spain it was demonstrated that localities attractive for tourism do not result in increased creative potential. They instead draw an advantage at present from their geographic location and the range of recreational services which they provide. A question remains as to whether directed development of tourism will be able to maintain the competitiveness of regions within a European context Results of the research are from the project To establish a cross-border (Zlin-Trencin), creative industry-based network to facilitate long-term cooperation. The project is co-financed from the Program of Cross-Border Cooperation Slovak Republic-Czech Republic 2007-2013.","[Kloudova, Jitka; Chwaszcz, Ondrej] Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic; [Simberova, Iveta] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Brno University of Technology,"Kloudová, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",kloudova@fame.utb.cz; simberova@fbm.vutbr.cz; chwaszcz@seznam.cz,"Simberova, Iveta/B-2037-2009; Kloudova, Jitka/C-7634-2009",,,,,,16,0,0,0,8,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,232,+,,,,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200026,0

Our results show that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have higher leverage ratios than non-SOEs, and SOEs in regions with a poorer institutional environment have higher leverage ratios than SOEs in better regions. We also show that the largest shareholding (the percentage of shares held by the largest shareholder) in the SOEs has a negative relationship with the leverage ratio, while the largest shareholding in non-SOEs has a non-linear relationship with the short-term and long-term debt ratios. Finally, this study also shows that the share split reform and the improvement of institutional environment both weaken the negative relationship and strengthen the positive relationship between largest shareholding and leverage of SOEs and non-SOEs to some extent. This paper documents how the financing behaviour of SOEs is more influenced by government intervention, while the financing behaviour of non-SOEs is more market oriented.","[Liu, Qigui; Tian, Gary] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Liu, Qigui] Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoming] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Econ & Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Wollongong; Northeastern University - China; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Tian, G (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.",gtian@uow.edu.au,"Tian, Gary/P-1272-2019","Tian, Gary/0000-0002-7638-7606; Liu, Qigui/0000-0001-6247-5042",,,,,50,33,37,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The study has been inspired by Jones and Romer's article titled The New Kaldor Facts: Ideas, Institutions, Population, and Human Capital published in 2009.

Out of these, the two focused on the relationship among economic growth, population growth, and the distance of an economy from technological frontier have been chosen. The authors of this study conduct a research of validity of the original conclusions in the reality of the Czech Republic and some other selected economies and try to verify the relevance and robustness of Jones-Romer's findings for the reality of the Czech Republic and several other East-European countries. The authors attempted to prove the validity of two chosen new stylized facts using alternative data sources and slightly different time periods. The analyzed facts proved valid over very long periods of time and at the global scale. During decomposition at the regional or even national level, the conclusions seem to be affected by particular important historical milestones and other local specifics.

Accordingly, the analysis of the dynamic panel is carried out on an industry-by-industry basis, allowing the coefficients on the markup determinants to vary across industries. We find that the oligopoly theory of markup determination for the most part holds for the manufacturing sector as a whole, although large variability in markup determinants exists across industries within the Slovenian manufacturing. Our main conclusion is that each industry should be investigated separately in detail in order to assess the precise role of markup factors in the markup-determination process.","[Ponikvar, Nina; Tajnikar, Maks] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Ponikvar, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.",nina.ponikvar@ef.uni-lj.si; maks.tajnikar@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Ponikvar, Nina/0000-0003-3976-211X",,,,,29,6,6,0,7,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,2,,,,,229,244,,10.2298/PAN1102229P,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,818JW,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294749000005,0

The main argument is that investments in ICT fixed capital are a necessary but not sufficient condition leading to productivity gains, above all in late adopter countries. Their effective implementation indeed requires on the one hand a changing economic structure characterized by a growing weight of service sectors and on the other hand complementary investments in ICT services, directed to ease the integration of the new technologies within firms' boundaries. The analysis is conducted on a late industrialized country like Italy, and shows that in lagging countries the weak impact of ICT adoption is the result of three converging forces: relatively high share of manufacturing sectors, low-adoption levels of ICTs in traditional manufacturing sectors, inadequate investments in ICT services.","[Quatraro, Francesco] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Mocalieri, Italy; [Quatraro, Francesco] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS GREDEG, Valbonne, France; [Quatraro, Francesco] Univ Turin, Dept Econ, Turin, Italy",Collegio Carlo Alberto; Universite Cote d'Azur; University of Turin,"Quatraro, F (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Mocalieri, Italy.",francesco.quatraro@unito.it,"Quatraro, Francesco/S-3012-2017","Quatraro, Francesco/0000-0001-5746-2239",,,,,39,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Among the many approaches, a complete system of Engel curves stood out as more appealing as it explicitly imposes the important budget constraint in the allocation of family budgets. Further, extended researches were undertaken on nonlinear specifications as they are likely to produce results that are closer to the reality than the linear systems. Beneito (2003) attempted Box-Cox form of nonlinear specification but ended up estimating a set of linear equations using seemingly unrelated regression equations method. The present research extends the previous work on Engle curves in two ways; first by incorporating key demographic characteristics into the determination of expenditures in the specification of the Box-Cox form of nonlinear system, and second by using primary micro data from large household surveys to estimate the system by nonlinear estimation methods. Our estimations have produced robust results; the expenditure patterns are significantly nonlinear and the expenditure patterns are significantly different for different demographic groups.","Griffith Univ, Econometr & Econ Grp, Dept Int Business & Asian Studies, Griffith Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Rajapakse, S (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Econometr & Econ Grp, Dept Int Business & Asian Studies, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",s.rajapakse@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The strength of the shock transmission between the two countries is quite symmetric. Our approach to the identification of structural shocks allows us to construct confidence bands that account both for estimation and identification uncertainty.

Also the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) tends to intervene through FX selling auctions when one-day past volatility is higher.","Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Magosa, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Tuna, G (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Mersin 10, Magosa, Turkey.",gulcay.tuna@emu.edu.tr,,,,,,,23,7,8,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To achieve that an adequate training of staff is necessary, in addition to that the analysis of the situation and search for alternative solutions are required. To be able to properly get prepared for a crisis planning and strategy management process, both scholarly discussions and practical solutions are necessary. Action planning enables management not only to evaluate the dynamics within a business environment, but also evaluate similar changes related issues. So in this context the paper analyses the solutions of strategic changes, specifying crisis communication in an organization and employee's self-identification. The author claims that the main attention should be paid to the individual, improving his professional skills, developing his competencies, what helps him successfully identify in organization and enables to integrate in the labor activities in the nearest future. This is the essential principle of crisis situation management and decision making. The principle requires to evaluate the processes of employee socialization, individualization and adaptation as well as to form the expression of employee identification in an organization. Otherwise we have a, psychological tiredness crisis - because of the lack of collaboration among employers in a company. This crisis is described as physical and emotional tiredness of employees from the intensive team work and too high requirements for employers' innovations. It is important to know - the management in each organization should know the weak points in their personnel management and should have a built-in advance employee identification strategy, which would accelerate the process of the employee's adaptation to organizational goals and values and stipulate his/her efficiency and work satisfaction in order to manage crisis situations. Stress and ambiguity often follow crises, which negatively effect decision making. The sooner the managers are able to find the main factors for risk, the more the crisis plan is efficient regarding decision making. Efficient management of the strategy process may have impact on the organization in taking actions to minimize the crisis. Crisis management requires collaboration with systems, efficient internal and external communication, setting the persons and their roles expressed by special duties and responsibilities, effective collective decision making, control and collaboration responsibility. In this context the author presents the theoretical substation of the model of crisis management in an organization. The construct of the presumptive model of crisis management is presented and focused on the relation between thee elements: The strategy of crisis management in organization -the preparation of crisis situation prevention program, the identification of crisis nature, the operative actions when crisis appears and the liquidation of crisis consequences rehabilitating the organizational performance. The cycle reopens with the preparation of new crisis situation management programs. The efficient corporate communication - as a strategic management function, focusing nowadays challenges: the necessity to create confidence between internal and external audience of a company; to activate business forming responsible corporate culture as the prevention and management of crisis. The processes of employee socialization, individualization and adaptation as well as the means to form the expression of employee identification in organization. Try to manage the impact of the elements of discomfort. Scientific problem: applying systematic analysis of academic and practice literature the paper discusses topical and relevant issue - crisis management in an organization. While elaborating scientific discussions the paper introduces crisis management through the efficient corporate communication as a strategic management function and employee identification in organization covering wider perspective and dealing not only with the economic aspects on crises management. The aim of the article is to conceptualize the model of crisis management in organization, the structure of which is constructed in the perspective of communication and individual's social identification. In this case of the constructive methodological approach was chosen, which enabled to reveal the estimation of the subjective phenomena and to develop the researcher's attitude to the researched problems. In this way, action planning based on a crisis management model may be helpful in integration the constituent parts of a strategy process developing the crisis management perspectives. The structure of the paper: In the first part the conceptualization of the definition of crisis in an organization has been presented. The author seeks to define crisis concept. In the second part the process of crisis planning and strategic management has been discussed. The author tries to describe the strategy of crisis management in an organization and seeks to accept decisions. The author illustrates a new construct of a theoretical model of crisis management in an organization. The objective effect is a preparation to have a scenario of crisis management. It is necessary to revise the strategy of company which had been executed. This theoretical viewpoint illustrates the various approach of the crisis management in an organization and modifies a new strategic determination.","Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Valackiene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Nemuno Str 33, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania.",asta.valackiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,107,14,17,1,64,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

As in Segal's model, SBC may result in moral hazard. The opening to international trade adds another sort of inefficiency. Some firms that would have become exporters in the absence of SBC choose to apply low effort and not export in order to extract a subsidy from the government. This effect takes place when the trade costs are sufficiently low. Overall, however, trade liberalization reduces inefficiencies generated by SBC. The number of firms subject to moral hazard SBC decreases, aggregate effort level increases and aggregate profits lost due to SBC-induced sub-optimal effort decline as trade costs decrease.

We lean on evidence that the maintenance of low competition in these markets may have contributed to the recent poor performance of the Portuguese economy. The analysis is performed using PESSOA, a dynamic general equilibrium model for a small-open economy integrated in a monetary union, featuring non-Ricardian characteristics, a multi-sectoral production structure and a number of nominal and real rigidities. We conclude that measures aimed at increasing competition in the Portuguese non-tradable goods and labour markets could induce important international competitiveness gains and be valuable instruments in promoting necessary adjustments within the monetary union framework. However, in the short run, real interest rates are likely to increase, driving consumption and output temporarily downwards.","[Almeida, Vanda; Castro, Gabriela; Felix, Ricardo Mourinho] Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, P-1150165 Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal,"Almeida, V (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, Rua Francisco Ribeiro 2, P-1150165 Lisbon, Portugal.",vralmeida@bportugal.pt; ggcastro@bportugal.pt; rfelix@bportugal.pt,"Almeida, Vanda/ABG-1592-2021",,,,,,47,4,6,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,,,PORT ECON J,Port.

A major dividing line is over how to access and sustain the financing required to expand and maintain municipal grids. In the context especially of third world urban processes, a crucial determinant is whether market-based pricing of water can generate health benefits to justify new capital investments. Such benefits have typically required strong public systems that offer adequate water supply (with sufficient proximity to source) at an affordable price. A variety of financial and fiscal pressures emerged since the 1980s, leaving full cost recovery as the core practice required by international aid agencies, multilateral financiers, and multinational corporations. Those firms were attracted by high potential profits which, ultimately, could not be realized (in part because of currency deterioration and profit repatriation problems), and hence systems were not maintained or expanded, and health benefits not realized. As commodification of water spread during the era of globalization, so too did an international civil society network demanding-and often winning-decommodification of water and deglobalization of water-capital, returning service delivery to local public institutions, often on grounds of improved public health.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Dev Studies, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Bond, P (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Dev Studies, Durban, South Africa.",pbond@mail.ngo.za,"Bond, Patrick/N-5490-2013","Bond, Patrick/0000-0001-6657-7898",,,,,58,19,22,0,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The establishment of the G-20 gives Asian economies the global forum that they need to both represent their interests in global governance and deliver on responsibilities concomitant with their growing weight in the global economy. The region has a host of cooperation arrangements in APEC, ASEAN+3, and EAS (East Asian Summit), all with ASEAN as the fulcrum. They are huge assets, but they need to be repositioned to relate effectively to the G-20 process and other global arrangements. They also need to comprehend the politics of the changing structure of regional power. This paper discusses the challenges that Asia faces in aligning regional and global objectives in financial, trade, and other areas of cooperation, such as climate change and foreign investment. It argues that Asia is now a critical player in the global system and has a central contribution to make in strengthening global governance and international policy outcomes. The paper sets out ways to fill gaps in regional cooperation and link the agenda for regional cooperation more effectively to Asia's new role globally.

The productivity growth of the state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) is compared with the joint-stock banks (JSCBs) and city commercial banks (CCBs). In general, average TFP growth has been neutral over the period for the SOCBs and JSCBs but positive for the CCBs in the second part of the period. Efficiency gains (catch-up) were obtained through cost reduction and technical innovation was associated with greater diversification of revenue away from interest earnings.

As it has been found difficult to assess the current situation given the housing market being the most affected by the crisis, earlier data from 1995 to 2006 have been used. It generalizes previously available results by considering credit constraints together with endogeneity of housing prices. First, housing price appreciation implies improvement in aggregate welfare in a model with exogenous housing price and credit constraints. Then, housing price is endogenized by modelling the supply side of the housing market. In this model, housing price appreciation is caused by supply and demand shocks. The supply shock originates from a change in building permit cost. The demand shifts are generated by changes in household income and interest rates. Both credit-constrained and unconstrained versions of this model are considered. Finally, the combination of observed demand and supply shocks is used to quantify aggregate welfare effects on the US housing market. The results demonstrate that demand shocks dominated during that period and the aggregate welfare improved as a result of housing price appreciation.","[Tsharakyan, Ashot] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Janicko, Martin] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Tsharakyan, A (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",atsharak@cerge-ei.cz; martin.janicko@vse.cz,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,9,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In this paper, we focus on this line of research, contributing in two main ways. First, we present an alternative method to measure financial liberalization, based on the same International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual reports most studies currently use as source of data. Second, we use panel data for a group of relevant emerging countries in Latin America and East Asia, including the new proxy in an attempt to test its effects on economic growth during the recent period (1990-2004). The more reliable index has not changed the main consensus on the subject, though, as results are in accordance with the prevalent thesis on the literature, that is, the link between financial liberalization and economic growth might not be as strong as may be supposed in theory. This means the other basic theoretical determinants must instead be observed to spur growth, while countries should observe the Keynesian agenda of stabilizing international finance through the introduction of limits to the free mobility of capital flows, as IMF economists have recently supported.","[van der Laan, Cesar Rodrigues] Cent Bank Brazil, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Cunha, Andre Moreira] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, PPGE UFRGS, Econ Grad Program, BR-90046900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Cunha, Andre Moreira] CNPq, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Alves, Tiago Wickstrom] Univ Vale Sinos, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil",Central Bank of Brazil; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos),"van der Laan, CR (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Brazil, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",,"Rodrigues van der Laan, Cesar/HTT-2602-2023; Alves, Tiago W/D-8277-2014","Cunha, Andre Moreira/0000-0002-3746-5974; Wickstrom Alves, Tiago/0000-0001-9979-7133",,,,,34,5,6,0,7,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

German federal law reduced the legal obligation of German employers to provide 100% continued wage pay for up to six weeks per sickness episode. In 1996 statutory sick pay was decreased to 80% of foregone gross wages. Within the reform's target group - private sector employees - this measure increased the proportion of employees having zero days of absence between 6 and 8%. Quantile regression estimates indicate that employees with up to 5.5 annual absence days reduced their days of absence by about 12%. Extended analyses suggest that in industries that enforced the cut, behavioral effects were about twice as large. We show that the direct labor cost savings effect stemming from the cut in replacement levels clearly exceeds the indirect effect due to the decrease in absenteeism. Our calculations about the total decrease in labor costs are very much in line with official data which suggest that total employer-provided sick pay decreased by 6.7% or (sic)1.7 billion per year.

It is shown that such beliefs may be exploited strategically in signaling games of pure conflict of interest. Truth and lie detection is modeled by signals perceived by the receiver that are emitted with a probability contingent on the truth value of the sender's message. Truth or lie detection of this kind always shrinks the equilibrium set and if the probability for the truth or lie signal is sufficiently large the resulting equilibrium is unique.

This paper provides another ground for criticizing these plants. Historical corn and gasoline prices are uncorrelated. but widespread adoption of corn ethanol production might reasonably lead to future correlation between these prices. We present a real options like valuation of an ethanol plant as a spark spread between the corn price and the gasoline price. This analysis shows that the value of an ethanol plant monotonically decreases with increasing correlation and the optimal production schedule greatly depends on the correlation. Even relatively small new correlations can result in a significant proportional value decrease: a 50% correlation between corn and gasoline causes ethanol plants to lose 10% of their value. The limiting case of full correlation would lead to a 30% value loss. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The flexibility of SRE allows us to account for measurement error in consumption and for heterogeneity in intertemporal allocation parameters. An investigation of the small sample properties of the SRE estimator indicates that it dominates generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation of both exact and approximate Euler equations in the case when we have short panels and noisy consumption data. We apply SRE to two panels drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and estimate the joint distribution of the discount factor and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. We reject strongly homogeneity of the discount factor and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.

By signing the accession protocol, China not only agreed to reform its trade policy, but it also accepted regulations that implied reductions on government subsidies to the state-owned sector. In this paper we claim that the latter, largely ignored in the literature, generate important welfare gains that need to be attributed to WTO accession. We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model with state and private enterprises. We calibrate the model to the Chinese economy and we quantitatively assess the economic effects of reducing subsidies to the state sector as required by the WTO. We find the welfare benefits of such reduction in subsidies to be substantial. Using the context of China, this paper identifies a new channel through which WTO accession increases a country's welfare: it induces reforms on domestic subsidies which lead to an increase in economic efficiency.

The aim of this paper is to identify the preferences of participants with respect to conference characteristics. Based on a sample of European labour economists, preferences are measured using the vignette approach where participants are asked to choose between hypothetical European Association of Labour Economists (EALE) conferences. We find that the keynote speakers are the most important element in the preference for a conference, followed by the location of the conference. There is substantial heterogeneity in the taste of labour economists especially with respect to location, though the link between preference parameters and measured characteristics like gender, age and seniority is limited. Factor analysis suggests that the variety in preferences can be best described by a latent variable that reflects the weights people put on content versus fun. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, the available data on hours do not correspond precisely to the concept required for accurate inference. We study one source of mismeasurement-that the most commonly used source data measure hours paid instead of hours worked. In particular, we focus our attention on salaried workers, a group for whom the gap between hours paid and hours worked is likely to be large. We show that the measurement gap varies significantly and positively with changes in labor demand. As a result, we estimate that the standard deviations of the workweek and of total hours worked are 27 and 5 percent larger, respectively, than published measures of hours suggest. We also find that this measurement gap is unlikely to be the source of the acceleration in published measures of productivity in the early 2000s.","[Aaronson, Stephanie; Figura, Andrew] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Figura, A (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Mail Stop 80,20th & C St, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",Andrew.Figura@frb.gov,,,,,,,21,2,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

I consider a new reform. I eliminate capital income taxation and replace it with progressive consumption taxation, consisting of taxing necessities and luxuries at different rates. I compare steady states under various tax regimes. I find that progressive rather than uniform consumption taxation generates higher welfare gains in the long run and during the transition to the steady state. While this type of reform achieves redistribution neutrality only in the long run, it generates welfare gains for the whole population during the transition. These results stay robust when non-homothetic preferences are considered and progressivity in consumption taxation is achieved by subsidizing consumption of the poor. With respect to long term objectives, the choice of a more progressive consumption or labor-income tax system depends on the modelization of preferences. During the transition, a tax reform involving more progressive labor-income taxation generates smaller redistribution effects than any consumption tax reform. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

Second, our data, set across countries, is uniform in terms of economies adopting both inflation targeting and a flexible exchange rate. Third, our study sheds light on exchange rate determinants for emerging economies: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Mexico. Our results show strong predictability evidence for the Taylor model and indicate that assuming models of endogenous monetary policy and the present value of expected fundamentals is a rewarding strategy to model exchange rate determination.","Ibmec Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil",,"Moura, ML (通讯作者)，Ibmec Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Rua Quata 300, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",marcelom@isp.edu.br,,,,,,,33,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

When a firm hires a sequence of short-lived workers, turnover adversely affects the observability of history-the old worker may leave the firm before communicating the history to the young. However, turnover can also enhance profits if matching gains can be extracted up front. Disclosure of the workers' productivity information affects turnover by mitigating adverse selection. Thus, the optimal disclosure policy trades off matching efficiency with the sustainability of implicit contracts. I show that (i) opaqueness can be optimal only for firms with moderate reputation concerns, and (ii) an opaque firm's profit may decrease with its reputation concern.","Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Mukherjee, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",arijit@msu.edu,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0741-6261,,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

We control for the effect of firm ownership and for cross-country differences in the underlying energy demand and energy supply. To deal with potential endogeneity of the regulatory regime, we apply instrumental variable methods (2SLS and GMM). Our results show that investment rate is higher under incentive regulation than under rate of return regulation. Using original data on the regulatory tools (X factor and WACC), we find that investment of incentive regulated firms appears highly sensitive to the X factor, consistent with efficiency- and profit-seeking motivations. Electric utilities investment is also sensitive to the level and change in the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Finally, we find that the positive relationship between private control and investment is not robust to IV estimations, suggesting that in Europe regulation may have reduced the differences between private and public firms' incentives to invest.","[Cambini, Carlo; Rondi, Laura] CNR, CERIS, Politecn Torino, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Cambini, Carlo; Rondi, Laura] FEEM, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Fondazione Mattei,"Cambini, C (通讯作者)，CNR, CERIS, Politecn Torino, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",carlo.cambini@polito.it; laura.rondi@polito.it,"Rondi, Laura/ADS-4154-2022","CAMBINI, CARLO/0000-0002-7471-8133; RONDI, Laura/0000-0002-7683-1164",,,,,35,82,86,2,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

This work aims to bridge this gap by presenting an empirical analysis of the macroeconomic consequences of criminal activity. Italy is the case study for the time span 1979-2002. Dealing with a state space framework, a time varying parameter approach is employed to measure the impact of criminality on real Gross Domestic Product along time, and to measure the asymmetric impact in recession and expansion periods.

The three rounds of the Tanzania Household Budget Survey (1991/92, 2000/01 and 2007) are used to apply Deaton's method based on median unit values (prices) and household budget shares. The results indicate that real price increases over 1991-2007 have reduced welfare of the average household by 20 per cent of 1991 income, and the loss was fairly evenly distributed between the 1990s and 2000s. The welfare loss was much greater for the poor, especially the rural poor (a 27 per cent reduction), compared to the non-poor (in particular the urban non-poor, who suffered a five per cent loss). Although we cannot establish explicit links between tax reforms and domestic commodity price changes, to assess the extent to which welfare changes can be explained by tax reforms we simulate the effects of tax changes on domestic price changes. The simulation shows that tax reforms (tariff reductions) offset the welfare losses for all household groups, especially in the 1990s; although the differences were small, the urban poor benefit more in relative terms from tax reforms whereas the rural poor benefit least (the effect on the non-poor was similar irrespective of location).","[Morrissey, Oliver] Univ Nottingham, CREDIT, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Leyaro, Vincent] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Econ, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",University of Nottingham; University of Dar es Salaam,"Morrissey, O (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, CREDIT, Sch Econ, Room B4,Sir Clive Granger Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",vleyaro@yahoo.com; oliver.morrissey@nottingham.ac.uk; trudy.owens@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Owens, Trudy/0000-0001-8676-2919",,,,,32,9,10,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In developing countries these variables might be as important as or even more important than the tax variables themselves. Therefore, we analyze the policy changes in tax incentives and in the other investment climate variables for 12 CFA Franc Zone countries over the period 1994-2006. Because of their common currency (the CFA Franc) and common language (French) these countries constitute an exceptional basis of comparison to evaluate their 'policy experiments'. The use of panel data econometrics with fixed country and year effects allows us to isolate the impact of the policy changes on investment, as if it were a difference in differences analysis with multiple policy changes. We find no robust positive relationship between tax holidays and investment in the CFA Franc zone. However, increasing the number of legal guarantees for foreign investors and reducing the complexity of the tax system helps to attract investment.","[Van Parys, Stefan] Univ Ghent, Dept Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [James, Sebastian] World Bank Grp, Investment Climate Advisory Serv, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Ghent University; The World Bank,"Van Parys, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Econ, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",stefan.vanparys@ugent.be,,,,,,,43,28,37,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

First, based on forecasts we estimate standard fiscal rules. Then, we explore how fiscal policy responds to new information, especially on the business cycle. There are marked differences in behaviour between the planning and implementation stages, as well as between the fiscal policy of EU countries and other OECD countries. Planned fiscal policy is a-cyclical for EU countries and counter-cyclical for the other countries. However, in the implementation stage, the EU countries react pro-cyclically to unexpected changes in the output gap, while the responses of the other OECD countries are a-cyclical. Hence, the empirical distinction between the two fiscal stages is crucial, while the relatively strong emphasis on ex ante, as opposed to ex post, compliance with fiscal rules (such as Europe's Stability and Convergence Programs) seems misguided.","[Beetsma, Roel] CESifo, CEPR, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Beetsma, Roel] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Giuliodori, Massimo] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Beetsma, R (通讯作者)，CESifo, CEPR, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",R.M.W.J.Beetsma@uva.nl,,,,,,,32,36,37,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

To assess the economic implications, we use a numerical computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for Europe. It encompasses several decision margins of firms such as marginal investment, FDI decisions, and multinational profit shifting. The simulations suggest that consolidation does not yield substantial welfare gains for Europe. The variation of effects across countries is large and depends on the choice of the apportionment formula. Consolidation with formula apportionment does not weaken incentives for tax competition.

In this paper, we show that both approaches are special (boundary) cases of a technique called partial least squares (PLS) when this technique is applied to an autoregression. We outline this methodology and show how it unifies the other two. We also illustrate the practical relevance of the resultant PLS autoregression for 17 quarterly, seasonally adjusted, industrial production series.

I derive a criterion for this general framework that indicates when cycles are welfare-improving in a frictionless economy, and why frictions make cycles more likely to be optimal.

Increased profits, in turn, could give incentive to producers to invest more. On the other hand, because devaluation raises the costs of imported inputs, it could lower profits. Depending on the relative strength of these two channels, domestic investment could increase or decrease. By giving greater consideration to the short-run and the long-run effect of currency depreciation on domestic investment, this paper presents empirical results from a time-series model of 50 countries. We find that the devaluation investment link is mostly a short-run phenomenon. However, in 21 countries in which the short-run effects last into the long run, both views are supported, almost equally.","[Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen; Hajilee, Massomeh] Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",,,,,,,,30,29,33,0,9,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Previous evidence, which has offered support for this idea, suffers from a spurious regression problem. Once this problem is controlled for, the evidence suggests that the volatility of unemployment does not help explain inflation outcomes. There is some evidence of a relationship between inflation and its volatility, but overall the data does not support the view that changing economic volatility, as filtered through asymmetric central bank preferences, is an important driver of inflation trends.

Emergence and the co-evolution of institutions and group size,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Evolution of cooperation; Emergence of institutions; Group size; Network size; Expectations; Social capital; Trust; 'Meso'-economics,RATIONALITY; MODELS,"'Summing-up' aggregation of micro decisions contrasts with structural emergence in complex systems and evolutionary processes. This paper deals with institutional emergence in the 'evolution of cooperation' framework and focuses on its size dimension. It is argued that some 'meso' (rather than 'macro') level is the proper level of cultural emergence and reproduction. Also Schumpeterian economists have discussed institutions as 'meso' phenomena recently, and Schelling, Axelrod, Arthur, Lindgren, and others have dealt with 'critical masses' of coordinated agents and emergent segregations. However, emergent group size has rarely been explicitly explored so far. In an evolutionary and game-theoretic frame, 'meso' is explained in terms of a sustainably cooperating group smaller than the whole population. Mechanisms such as some monitoring, memory, reputation, and active partner selection loosen the total connectivity of the static and deterministic 'single-shot' logic and thus allow for emergent 'meso' platforms, while expectations 'to meet again' remain sufficiently high. Applications of 'meso-nomia' include the deep structure of 'general trust' and macro-performance in 'smaller' and 'well networked' countries which helps to explain persistent 'varieties of capitalism'.","Univ Bremen, Fac Econ & Business Studies, IINO Inst Inst & Innovat Econ, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Elsner, W (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Fac Econ & Business Studies, IINO Inst Inst & Innovat Econ, Hochschulring 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",welsner@uni-bremen.de,,,,,,,71,32,34,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

First, deregulated plants in restructured electricity markets were less likely to adopt more capital intensive environmental compliance options as compared to regulated or publicly owned plants.

At short as well as long lags, both of them display an autocorrelation structure in absolute and squared returns that comes fairly close to that of real data at a daily frequency. The note argues that these long memory effects are to be ascribed to the stochastic specification of the price equation, which despite the wide fluctuations in these models fails to normalize the price shocks. Under an appropriate respecification, the long memory completely disappears. It is subsequently shown that an alternative introduction of randomness, which may be called structural stochastic volatility, can restore the original properties and even improves upon them.

The Doha Round scenarios simulated in this paper consider the WTO agricultural production and export subsidy reduction requirement, and the application of the Harbinson approach, and Swiss formula to reduce import tariffs. Brazil and China present the highest GDP growth rate varying from 0.4% to 1.4%. India shows a negative GDP growth rate in all scenarios, except in that which replicates the Uruguay Round. The welfare gains are positive, but small, for Brazil, China and India.

Unit non-response is positively associated with the size of a city. No age and gender effects are found. Unit non-response is about 25 percent lower among individuals in the top than among individuals in the bottom of the distribution of neighborhood average income.

A search problem with probabilistic appearance of offers,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Search problems; Secretary problem; Value of information; Sequential decision-making,OPTIMAL SELECTION PROBLEM,"A problem that often arises in the process of searching for a job or for a candidate to fill a position is that applicants do not know if they will receive an offer from any given firm with which they interview, and, conversely, firms do not know whether applicants will definitely take positions they are offered. In this paper, we model the search process as an optimal stopping problem with probabilistic appearance of offers from the perspective of a single decision-maker who wants to maximize the realized value of the offer she accepts. Our main results quantify the value of information in the following sense: how much better off is the decision-maker if she knows each time whether an offer appeared or not, compared to the case where she is only informed when offers actually appear? We show that for some common distributions of offer values, she can expect to receive very close to her optimal value even in the lower information case, as long as she knows the probability that any given offer will appear. However, her expected value in the low information case (as compared to the high information case) can fall dramatically when she does not know the appearance probability ex ante but must infer it from data. This suggests that hiring and job-search mechanisms may not suffer from serious losses in efficiency or stability from participants hiding information about their decisions, unless agents are uncertain of their own attractiveness as employees or employers.

The strategies of the colluding parties must be mixed since agreeing to submit a bid equal to the reservation price of the seller provides the incentive for that bidder to cheat on the designated winner.

Some policy schemes subsidize biomass co-combustion while some do not. In this study, we analyze the impacts of a policy choice on the fuel uses, investment decisions, CO2 emissions, and on the values of renewable electricity promoting policy instruments. In particular, we look at the impacts of feed-in tariff and a subsidy to renewable energy, both together with CO2 emissions price. We present an electricity and heat market model, where all the solid fossil fuel power plants are able to co-fire biomass and fossil fuel. In the numerical application, the model is used to analyze the differences caused by the policy instruments. The results show that subsidizing biomass combustion in a co-firing power plant decreases the investments in pure renewable technology. However, the use of solid fossil fuels is not increased significantly. Also, the CO2 intensity levels of electricity production are nearly equal whether biomass co-combustion is subsidized or not.

On the other hand, Partial Equilibrium (PE) models, which are typically used for analysis at disaggregate levels, deprive the researcher of the benefits of an economy-wide analysis, which is required to examine the overall impact of broad-based trade policy reforms. Therefore, a PE-GE, nested modeling framework has the prospect of offering an ideal tool for trade policy analysis. In this paper, we develop a PE model that captures international trade, domestic consumption and output, using Constant Elasticity of Transformation (CET) and Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) structures, market clearing conditions and price linkages, nested within the standard GTAP model. In particular, we extend the welfare decomposition of Huff and Hertel (2001) to this PE-GE model in order to contrast the sources of welfare gain in PE and GE analyses. To illustrate the usefulness of this model, we examine the contentious issue of tariff liberalization in the Indian auto sector, using PE, GE and PE-GE models. Both the PE and PE-GE models show that the imports of motorcycles and automobiles change drastically with both unilateral and bilateral tariff liberalization by India, but the PE model does a poor job predicting the overall size and price level in the industry, post-liberalization. On the other hand, the GE model overestimates substitution between regional suppliers due to false competition and underestimates the welfare gain, due to the problem of tariff averaging in the aggregated model. These findings are shown to be robust to wide variation in model parameters. We conclude that the linked model is superior to both the GE and PE counterparts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To assess the quality of such approximations, we use a unique source of lifetime earnings the German pension system and focus on two important issues that have been largely ignored in the existing literature. The first is how to deal with zero income observations in the analysis of women. The second is whether these approximations differ between natives and guest workers. For female earners, we find that estimates of the associations between current and lifetime income are highly sensitive to the treatment of zero earnings. The reason turns out to be the highly cyclical nature of the labor supply behavior of mothers. Furthermore, immigrants' income proxies are prone to significantly larger attenuation biases over the entire life-cycle. This result is explained by the larger share of annual income variance attributable to the transitory income component for immigrants. Averaging income over up to 15 years alleviates the attenuation bias as well as the difference in biases between natives and guest workers. (C) 2009 Elsevier By.

In a benchmark case with certainty about where agglomeration takes place, a majority of voters favour economic integration and the resulting equilibrium is an industrialised core and a de-industrialised periphery. Allowing for uncertainty, a high level of trade costs may win the election and maintain the initial distribution of industry. The reason is that a coalition of risk-averse immobile factors of production votes for the status quo due to uncertainty about which region will attract industry if economic integration is pursued.

Moreover, when nonlinear identifying restrictions are used, no efficient algorithms exist for small-sample estimation and inference. This paper makes four contributions towards filling these important gaps in the literature. First, we establish general rank conditions for global identification of both identified and exactly identified models. These rank conditions are sufficient for general identification and are necessary and sufficient for exact identification. Second, we show that these conditions can be easily implemented and that they apply to a wide class of identifying restrictions, including linear and certain nonlinear restrictions. Third, we show that the rank condition for exactly identified models amounts to a straightforward counting exercise. Fourth, we develop efficient algorithms for small-sample estimation and inference, especially for SVARs with nonlinear restrictions.","[Rubio-Ramirez, Juan F.; Waggoner, Daniel F.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Rubio-Ramirez, Juan F.; Waggoner, Daniel F.; Zha, Tao] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA; [Zha, Tao] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Duke University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta; Emory University,"Rubio-Ramírez, JF (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,,,,,58,372,434,4,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Its cyclical behavior is important to our understanding of the functioning of LDC labor markets, but turns out to be surprisingly complex. We develop a flexible model with two sectors: a formal salaried (tradable) sector that may be affected by wage rigidities, and an informal (non tradable) self-employment sector faced with liquidity constraints to entry. This labor market is then embedded in a standard small economy macro model. We show that different types of shocks interact with different institutional contexts to produce distinct patterns of comovement between key variables of the model: relative salaried/self-employed incomes, relative salaried/self-employed sector sizes and the real exchange rate. Model predictions are then tested empirically for Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. We confirm episodes where the expansion of informal self-employment is consistent with the traditional segmentation views of informality. However, we also identify episodes where informal self-employment behaves pro-cyclically; here, informality is driven by relative demand or productivity shocks to the non tradable sector.

Our interest is in understanding how the social structure of comparisons, taken together with the familiar fundamentals of the economy (endowments, technology, and preferences), shapes equilibrium prices, allocations, and welfare. We show that equilibrium prices and consumption are a function of a single network statistic: centrality. An individual's centrality is given by the weighted sum of paths of different lengths to all others in a social network. In particular, prices are proportional to the sum of centralities, and an individual's consumption depends on how central she is relative to others in the network. Inequalities in wealth and connections reinforce each other in markets: A transfer of resources from less to more central agents raises prices.

We take advantage of an unusual natural experiment. In January 2004, more than 41,000 residents from various locations in Beira, Mozambique received two doses of oral cholera vaccine free of charge during the first vaccination trial to test its effectiveness in an endemic cholera zone of Africa. About 30,000 people participated from outside the target zone. resulting in long queues and an average waiting time of about 85 min per dose. We estimated travel cost models of the revealed demand for cholera vaccines among households informed of the trial using information collected in in-person interviews conducted during the summer of 2005. To explore households' participation in the trial, we used standard and zero-inflated household count models for all household members and dichotomous choice models for the head of the household. Our analysis shows that the quantity of vaccines obtained by households and the likelihood of participation decreased as travel cost-in time and transport expenses-rose. Our best estimates of per capita willingness to pay for the two required doses of cholera vaccine are about 0.85 USD. These estimates are sensitive to the assumed value of time spent acquiring vaccines. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One contributing development has been in the improvement and increased use in data analysis of structural methods; that is, the use of models based in economic theory. Structural modeling attempts to use data to identify the parameters of an underlying economic model, based on models of individual choice or aggregate relations derived from them. Structural estimation has a long tradition in economics, but better and larger data sets, more powerful computers, improved modeling methods, faster computational techniques, and new econometric methods such as those mentioned above have allowed researchers to make significant improvements. While Angrist and Pischke extol the successes of empirical work that estimates treatment effects based on actual or quasi-experiments, they are much less sanguine about structural analysis and hold industrial organization up as an example where progress is less dramatic. Indeed, reading their article one comes away with the impression that there is only a single way to conduct credible empirical analysis. This seems to us a very narrow and dogmatic approach to empirical work; credible analysis can come in many guises, both structural and nonstructural, and for some questions structural analysis offers important advantages. In this comment, we address the criticism of structural analysis and its use in industrial organization, and consider why empirical analysis in industrial organization differs in such striking ways from that in fields such as labor, which have recently emphasized the methods favored by Angrist and Pischke.","[Nevo, Aviv; Whinston, Michael D.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60201 USA; [Nevo, Aviv; Whinston, Michael D.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Nevo, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60201 USA.",nevo@northwestern.edu; mwhinston@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,27,65,73,0,26,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Using the polarization index P-G recently proposed by Deutsch et al. (2007) it shows that, when taking the identity of the individuals into account, a distinction can be made between a change over time in polarization that is the consequence of structural mobility (change over time in the overall, between- and within-groups inequality) and a change in polarization that is the sole consequence of exchange mobility (changes over time in the ranks of the individuals). This approach is then applied to the 1985-2003 Work Histories Italian Panel (WHIP), an employer-employee linked panel database. The empirical investigation attempts to improve our understanding of labor market segmentation in Italy, whether the groups are defined on the basis of the individual wages or derived from other criteria such as white- versus blue-collar workers.","[Poggi, Ambra] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Silber, Jacques] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel",University of Milano-Bicocca; Bar Ilan University,"Poggi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",ambra.poggi@unimib.it,,,,,,,34,14,15,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Using data from a panel of WorkFirst participants, empirical results indicate that employment levels and wage premiums vary significantly by demographics, both within and across regions, and that cultural filtering partly explains these variations. It is argued that if the shared goal of WorkFirst and TANF is to move people from welfare to work, participants should be directed toward those industries in which they have a relatively high probability of being favorably filtered, be better prepared to possess those attributes filtered for, and for WorkFirst to take on an active role as match-maker between program participants and employers.","[Friesner, Dan] N Dakota State Univ, Fargo, ND USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,,,"Friesner, Daniel/AAK-2377-2020",,,,,,38,3,3,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The return to managerial skill as a convex function of managerial skill arises naturally when firms engage in oligopolistic competition. Globalisation affects a firm's output and the price level. The change of the price level leads to the exit of less efficient firms and an increase of average firm size. Even though countries are identical and there is no fixed cost of production, globalisation can be beneficial to all countries.

EVIDENCE FROM A RANDOMIZED MALARIA PREVENTION EXPERIMENT,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TREATED BED NETS; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; CHILD-MORTALITY; PRICES; IMPACT,"It is often argued that cost-sharing-charging a subsidized, positive price-for a health product is necessary to avoid wasting resources on those who will not use or do not need the product. We explore this argument through a field experiment in Kenya, in which we randomized the price at which prenatal clinics could sell long-lasting antimalarial insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to pregnant women. We find no evidence that cost-sharing reduces wastage on those who will not use the product: women who received free ITNs are not less likely to use them than those who paid subsidized positive prices. We also find no evidence that cost-sharing induces selection of women who need the net more: those who pay higher prices appear no sicker than the average prenatal client in the area in terms of measured anemia (an important indicator of malaria). Cost-sharing does, however, considerably dampen demand. We find that uptake drops by sixty percentage points when the price of ITNs increases from zero to $0.60 (i.e., from 100% to 90% subsidy), a price still $0.15 below the price at which ITNs are currently sold to pregnant women in Kenya. We combine our estimates in a cost-effectiveness analysis of the impact of ITN prices on child mortality that incorporates both private and social returns to ITN usage. Overall, our results suggest that free distribution of ITNs could save many more lives than cost-sharing programs have achieved so far, and, given the large positive externality associated with widespread usage of ITNs, would likely do so at a lesser cost per life saved.","[Cohen, Jessica] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

However, human technology evolved from the simpler technologies of other species. Comparison with these other technologies should illuminate why human technology is distinct. Some birds and primates make tools, or simple technological objects whose function is closely related to their form. Humans, on the other hand, make machines-relatively complex objects whose functionality derives from the interaction of parts with respect to one another (e.g. a bow and arrow). Making machines requires a cognitive advance called 'second-order instrumentality', or the ability to invest in the production of an object that only has utility as part of, or for the making of, other objects. This ability enabled human societies to develop specialised forms of organised production, which in turn allowed the stock of artefacts to diversify and accumulate, whereas the technological repertoires of other species remain at a relatively constant level of complexity.","Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Hyg Ctr, London WC1E 7HT, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Aunger, R (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Hyg Ctr, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",robert.aunger@lshtm.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,14,15,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We use data from the children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort to investigate an additional consequence of childhood overweight - its effect on relative cognitive development. To control for unobserved heterogeneity, we estimate individual (child) fixed effect (FE) models and instrumental variable (IV) models. Although recent research suggests that there is a negligible effect of childhood overweight on cognitive ability, our results demonstrate that the effects are uncovered when examining the relationship separately by race. In particular, we find that overweight white boys have math and reading scores approximately an SD lower than the mean. Overweight white girls have lower math scores whereas overweight black boys and girls have lower reading scores. Our results suggest that in addition to well-documented health consequences, overweight children may also be at risk in terms of experiencing adverse education outcomes, which could lead to lower future wages.","[Averett, Susan L.; Stifel, David C.] Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA",Lafayette College,"Averett, SL (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",averetts@lafayette.edu,,"Averett, Susan/0000-0002-6499-3334",,,,,27,27,32,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We also examine the short-run dynamics in the relationship between the two markets. The econometric results indicate that the two exchange rates are cointegrated. Furthermore, we reject weak exogeneity in the case of the official exchange rate, but fail to reject it in the case of the black-market rate. Granger causality tests show that the black-market rate causes the official exchange rate. The results seem to support the efficiency hypothesis, suggesting that participants in the black-market are able to anticipate changes in the official exchange rate. The findings also suggest that Morocco's decision (in January 1993) to introduce only current account convertibility and keep controls on capital accounts was wise.","[Baliamoune-Lutz, Mina] Univ N Florida, Dept Econ & Geog, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [Baliamoune-Lutz, Mina] ICER, Turin, Italy",State University System of Florida; University of North Florida,"Baliamoune-Lutz, M (通讯作者)，Univ N Florida, Dept Econ & Geog, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",mbaliamo@unf.edu,", Mina/R-8591-2019",,,,,,43,6,6,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Results show that entrepreneurs' intentions to grow the business have a strong positive influence on both variables, whereas their formal education is negatively related to initial size and growth.

Due to computational advancements, models have become increasingly more complex and accurate, allowing for an in-depth analysis of the relationships between real economic variables and nominal variables. Therefore, using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, based on Gali and Monacelli (2005), we propose and estimate a model for the Brazilian economy by employing Bayesian methods so as to assess whether the Central Bank of Brazil takes exchange rate fluctuations into account in the conduct of monetary policy. The most striking result of the present study is that the Central Bank of Brazil does not directly change the interest rate path due to exchange rate movements. A simulation exercise is also used. Our conclusion is that the economy quickly accommodates shocks induced separately on the exchange rate, on the terms of trade, interest rate, and global inflation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The model extends upon the rent control model of Glaeser and Luttmer (2003) as well as the rent-seeking contributions of Hurley (1998), Dixit (1987), and Hirshleifer (1989) to consider the roles of chance and endogenously-chosen efforts in the allocation of rent-controlled apartments. Nash equilibrium effort levels for each consumer-type imply that the effort-inducing cost of rent control is greater than the misallocative cost. Further, misallocative costs are lower under the effort contest interpretation than under random allocation, as high willingness to pay consumers allocates more effort. The relationship between effort contest and misallocation influences the policy's overall social cost.","[Chang, Yang-Ming] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Sanders, Shane D.] Nicholls State Univ, Thibodaux, LA 70310 USA",Kansas State University; University of Louisiana System; Nicholls State University,"Chang, YM (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",ymchang@ksu.edu; shane.sanders@nicholls.edu,,,,,,,21,2,3,0,10,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This, however, also is prone to problems since the number of cites is correlated, among others, with the order of appearance in an issue. In particular, leading papers are more cited. It is, thus, difficult to assess whether they are of better quality, or whether this happens because they appear first in an issue. We make use of a natural experiment that was carried out by a journal in which papers are randomly ordered in some issues, while this order is at the editors' discretion in other issues. Our estimates suggest that approximately two thirds of the additional cites are due to going first, and one third to higher quality.","[Coupe, Tom] Kyiv Sch Econ, Kiev, Ukraine; [Coupe, Tom] Kyiv Econ Inst, Kiev, Ukraine; [Ginsburgh, Victor; Noury, Abdul] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Ginsburgh, Victor] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium",Kyiv School of Economics; Kyiv School of Economics; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Coupé, T (通讯作者)，Kyiv Sch Econ, Kiev, Ukraine.",anoury@ulb.ac.be,,,,,,,13,16,19,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

After briefly sketching out central features of mainstream (materialist) technovisions, this essay concentrates on recent ontological trends emphasizing the 'mutual becoming' of people and products. Symbolic and structuralist orientations enable archaeologists to 'see' something of the social values and cognitive structures shaping technological traditions in the deep past. As the question of gender has become an explicit topic of interest, archaeologists are able, at long last, to theorise about ancient technicians as thinking and feeling women and men. To appreciate ancient technology 'as if people mattered', I outline my own preferred ontology-grounded in phenomenology and agency theory. It argues that the ancient technician's body was a mindful, sensual, socially constituted and gendered being making sense of the world-and themself-by working through it. Chaine operatoire data on technical gestures and related strategic choices of artifact manufacture, use, and repair provide the necessary empirical and interpretive link between the making of personhood and the making and use of products within the (ancient) body politic.","Univ Maine, Dept Anthropol, Orono, ME 04469 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Dobres, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Maine, Dept Anthropol, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",madobres@maine.edu,,,,,,,82,81,115,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Within a simple two-period overlapping generation model, I show that given an increase of the desired number of children age at marriage is affected through two different channels. First, as population growth increases, the age structure of the population produces a thicker market for young people, inducing early marriages. The second channel comes from differential fecundity: if the desired number of children is not feasible for older women, women tend to marry younger and men older, with single men outnumbering single women in equilibrium. Using an extended version of the model to a finite number of periods and fertility data, I show that two mechanisms described above may have acted as persistence mechanisms after the U. S. Baby Boom. Specifically, I find that the demographic transitional dynamics after the Baby Boom may account for approximately 23 percent of the increase in men's age of marriage between 1985 and 2009, although the impact on women's age is small.","[Giolito, Eugenio] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,,,,"Giolito, Eugenio/0000-0003-1259-5235",,,,,29,3,3,0,7,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Both these decisions create opportunities for rent seeking. In this paper, we use a contest model to analyse the incentives to rent seek for pollution permits and to analyse the consequences for social welfare. We find differences in firms' rent-seeking choices compared to a conventional rent-seeking contest. We see that a fundamental aspect of firms' incentives to rent seek depends on the market value of the permits, that is, the value of the ex post reallocated rents. This impact depends on the responsiveness of the regulator to aggregate rent-seeking effort. The responsiveness, in some cases, may improve welfare by reducing the per-unit value of permits, which may lower the rent-seeking effort more than it increases the damages experienced from the additional emissions.","[Hanley, Nick] Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [MacKenzie, Ian A.] ETH, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Stirling; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Hanley, N (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",n.d.hanley@stir.ac.uk; imackenzie@ethz.ch,"Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012","Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499; MacKenzie, Ian A./0000-0002-4631-764X",,,,,31,6,7,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

However, because of omitted variables bias, simple cross-sectional relationships may provide a misleading picture of the causal impact of informal care provision on labor force status. To address this, I use panel data for the period 2001-2007, which make it possible to track the same individuals over time, and observe how their outcomes alter as their care arrangements change. While caregiving does appear to have a modest negative impact on labor force participation, this impact is only one-quarter to one-sixth as large in the panel as in the cross-section. Taking account of individual heterogeneity, the impact of caregiving on other labor force outcomes (and on life satisfaction) seems to be small or non-existent. Large estimated effects from cross-sectional regressions are most likely driven by individual heterogeneity. One possible interpretation of this result is that the impact of caregiving on labor market outcomes and life satisfaction takes several years to manifest itself. Another is that the causal effect of caregiving on labor force outcomes and life satisfaction is quite small. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A 10% increase in the user cost of the Machinery and Equipment (ME) relative to the price of labour results in a 3.3% decrease in the ME-labour ratio in the long run. Assuming complete exchange rate pass-through into imported ME prices, the maximum effect of a permanent 10% depreciation in the exchange rate is a 1.7% decline in the ME-labour ratio. This result implies that the cumulative growth of the ME-labour ratio during the 1991 to 1997 period would have been 2.3 percentage points higher had the dollar not depreciated. This may appear to be significant, but considering both ME as a share of total capital and the capital share of nominal output are both approximately one-third, in terms of a simple growth accounting framework, the effect on labour productivity is small.","[Leung, Danny; Yuen, Terence] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Leung, D (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",dleung@bankofcanada.ca,,,,,,,33,1,3,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A critical policy dilemma facing the middle economy is how to balance its R&D-driven technology inflows against its FDI-driven technology outflows. Numerical simulations are used for dynamic welfare analysis.

Information on aggregate productivity is dispersed across agents and there are two aggregate shocks: a standard productivity shock and a noise shock affecting public beliefs about aggregate productivity. Neither the central bank nor individual agents can distinguish the two shocks when they are realized. Despite the lack of superior information, monetary policy can affect the economy's relative response to the two shocks. As time passes, better information on past fundamentals becomes available. The central bank can then adopt a backward-looking policy rule, based on more precise information about past shocks. By announcing its response to future information, the central bank can influence the expected real interest rate faced by forward-looking consumers with different beliefs and thus affect the equilibrium allocation. If the announced future response is sufficiently aggressive, the central bank can completely eliminate the effect of noise shocks. However, this policy is typically suboptimal, as it leads to an excessively compressed distribution of relative prices. The optimal monetary policy balances the benefits of aggregate stabilization with the costs in terms of cross-sectional efficiency.","[Lorenzoni, Guido] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lorenzoni, Guido] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lorenzoni, G (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,42,43,56,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Yet the following key aspects of this model are little understood: (i) the existence of asymmetric price equilibria when consumers have unit demands and (ii) for a very broad set of model specifications, the non-monotonicity of price as a function of consumers' transportation cost, i.e., the degree of product differentiation in the market. We provide a complete characterization of the asymmetric equilibria, show that they exist for a comparatively 'wide' range of markets, and argue that their existence is robust to various extensions of the prototype model. Introducing elasticity into consumer demands suppresses the kink in the firms' demand functions and ensures the uniqueness (and symmetry) of the price equilibrium. However, the key perverse comparative static of the symmetric kinked equilibrium, decreasing price as a function of transport cost, survives relaxation of the unit-demand assumption. Indeed the symmetric kinked equilibrium of the unit-demand case is a special case of a general but largely unexplored set of equilibria in the Hotelling model we call weak duopoly. Weak-duopoly equilibria exist for intermediate values of transportation cost for a very broad class of consumer demands. They occupy a comparatively wide range of the model parameter space, and firm behavior in weak duopoly differs fundamentally from that which occurs for lower values of the transportation cost, or when consumers have no reservation price.","[Merel, Pierre R.; Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Mérel, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",merel@primal.ucdavis.edu; rich@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,24,11,11,1,9,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We analyse the dynamics of the East German housing market within the framework of the well known stock-flow model, proposed by DiPasquale and Wheaton. We show that the disequilibrium observable today is to a large extent caused by post-reunification housing policy and its strong fiscal incentives to invest in the housing stock. Moreover, in line with the stylised empirical facts we show that 'hidden reserves' of the housing market were reactivated since the economy of East Germany became market-organised. Since initial undersupply was overcome faster than politicians expected, the fiscal stimuli implemented were too strong. In contrast to the widespread opinion that outward migration caused the observable vacancies, this study shows that not weakness of demand but supply side policies caused the observable disequilibrium.","[Michelsen, Claus] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Dept Urban Econ, Halle, Germany; Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Michelsen, C (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Dept Urban Econ, Halle, Germany.",claus.michelsen@iwh-halle.de,,"Michelsen, Claus/0000-0001-6751-3271",,,,,47,10,10,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,3,,,,,387,409,PII 925504521,10.1080/14631377.2010.498686,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,636WF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280773700007,0

We provide evidence from a field study of wait times in Boston-area coffee shops that suggests that female customers wait an average of 20 seconds longer for their orders than do male customers even when controlling for gender differences in orders. We find that this differential in wait times is inverse to the proportion of employees who are female and directly related to how busy the coffee shop is at the time of the order. This supports the conclusion that the observed differential is driven at least in part by employee animus and/or statistical discrimination rather than unobserved heterogeneity in the purchasing behaviour of female customers.","[Myers, Caitlin Knowles] Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Myers, CK (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",cmyers@middlebury.edu,,"Myers, Caitlin/0000-0002-3065-5521",,,,,28,6,6,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Firstly, we wish to contribute to the debate on whether French inflation has been persistent since the mid-eighties. Empirical evidence in this domain has been mixed. We use the standard method of testing for breaks in the mean of the inflation series to conclude whether possible unit root findings are the result of neglected breaks. Then, we build standard autoregressive representations of inflation, using an automatic general-to-specific approach. We conclude against inflation persistence in the sample period, and the point estimates of persistence we obtain are several percentage points below those achieved with other break tests and model selection methods. Moreover, our final model is congruent. Secondly, we provide the first empirical application of the new impulse saturation break test. The resulting estimates of the break dates are in line with other literature findings and have a sound economic meaning, confirming the good performance the test had revealed in theoretical and simulation studies. Finally, we also illustrate the shortcomings of the Bai-Perron test when applied to a small sample with high serial correlation. Indeed, we show the Bai-Perron break dates' estimates would not allow us to build a congruent autoregressive representation of inflation.","[Santos, Carlos] Portuguese Catholic Univ, Dept Econ & Management, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal; [Oliveira, Maria Alberta] ISMAI, Maia, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Instituto Universitario da Maia (ISMAI),"Santos, C (通讯作者)，Portuguese Catholic Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal.",csantos@porto.ucp.pt,"Santos, Carlos/R-3064-2016","Santos, Carlos/0000-0002-5100-0794; Oliveira, Maria Alberta/0000-0003-2918-1354",,,,,60,8,9,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Offsets sometimes become involved in purchases of civil aircraft, but are primarily a characteristic of military sales. The involvement of offset agreements is particularly common in sales of military aircraft, where the buyer is normally a sovereign government that has an interest in promoting the interests of its domestic industry. The use of offset came into wide practice in the aerospace industry in Western Europe after World War II. Later, the concept of offsets became more complex and spread to other parts of the world. As the modern fully developed European aerospace industry began to export military aircraft to international markets, it also began to include offset commitments in its sales contracts. Since the end of XX century offsets were used also by East Europe countries, including Poland. The Polish experiences are diverse. On the one hand offsets were perceived as chance for the Polish arms industry, but on the other the transactions led to a lot of controversy.","[Skulski, Przemyslaw] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Int Econ Relat, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Skulski, P (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Int Econ Relat, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",przemyslaw.skulski@ue.wroe.pl,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-601-4,,,,2010,,,,,,,416,423,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9EP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000393151400050,0

Decisions need to be made quickly and no mistakes are tolerable, particularly in the case of disasters resulting in large number of injured people. A multiphase linguistic fuzzy model is introduced to assist the operator during the initial phase of the medical disaster response. Based on uncertain input data, we can estimate the severity of the disaster, the number of injured people, and the amount of forces and resources needed to successfully deal with the situation. The need of reinforcements is also considered. Fuzzy numbers, linguistic variables and fuzzy rule bases are applied to deal with the uncertainty. Results derived by the model are available both as fuzzy sets and linguistic terms. The paper focuses primarily on using the model as a decision making support for the Czech Emergency medical rescue services.

J,"Wabiri, N; Amusa, H",,,,"Wabiri, Njeri; Amusa, Hammed",,,Quantifying South Africa's crude oil import risk: A multi-criteria portfolio model,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Oil import risks; Portfolio theory; Analytical hierarchy process,,"A major consequence of South Africa's strong economic growth since the democratic dispensation of 1994 is the rapid increase in domestic demand for oil energy. With small amounts of proven oil reserves, the rise in oil demand as an energy source has resulted in South Africa's growing dependence on external sources for its domestic crude oil needs. High oil prices, instability in major oil producing regions and the rise in 'oil-nationalism' are major concerns for the security of South Africa's oil supplies. Accordingly, a comprehensive understanding of oil import security risks can serve as a vital guide in formulating any energy policy framework(s) aimed at alleviating the impact of such risks. This study utilises portfolio theory and develops an empirical framework to provide quantitative measures of systematic and specific risks of South Africa's crude oil imports over the period 1994 to 2007. The paper examines the relationship between supply sources diversification and oil energy security risks. and provides an objective evaluation of different import adjustment strategies on South Africa's total crude oil import risks. The results show that a policy of having constant monthly imports from each supply region reduces the specific and systematic risks of the oil import portfolio by an average rate of 71% and 2.9% respectively. Significant reduction in specific risks of South Africa's oil imports is achieved if imports from risky regions (mainly the Middle East) can be diversified to relatively less risky regions of Europe and North America.

Whereas previous quantitative research with deterministic models solely focussed on efficiency losses due to labor market distortions from pay-as-you-go (paygo) financing, stochastic simulation models highlight the insurance effects of social security systems and allow to quantify the welfare consequences from myopic behavior. The results from these studies challenge the common wisdom about the cost and benefits of social security. While previous studies typically either recommended a move towards a more funded system or proposed a tight tax-benefit linkage, recent results from stochastic models indicate that welfare losses due to reduced insurance coverage compensate the gains due to improved labor market incentives. Consequently, paygo financing and progressive benefit formulas should not be eliminated on pure efficiency grounds. Current research tries to qualify whether this conclusion is robust in models with private insurance institutions and/or macroeconomic risks.","Netspar & Univ Wuerzburg, Dept Econ, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Fehr, H (通讯作者)，Netspar & Univ Wuerzburg, Dept Econ, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",hans.fehr@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,,108,22,22,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2009,157.0,4,,,,,359,416,,10.1007/s10645-009-9131-8,0.0,,,58,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,562XD,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275088200001,0

We also indicate that the possibility of renegotiation drastically changes the results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A large household level panel is used to illustrate the large contribution of land markets to occupational diversification, productivity of land use, and household welfare. Factors affecting land market participation are derived from a household model with transaction cost and individual ability. Results suggest that, by transferring land from less able and more affluent households who joined the non-farm sector to poorer ones with ample family labor, land markets are critical not only for non-agricultural growth but, by allowing more effective use of potentially idle land can contribute to significant productivity gains.

We find that productivity of manufacturing industries in China relative to that in India improved substantially over the 1998-2003 period. Specifically, the average total factor productivity (TFP) growth for the manufacturing sector over this period was about 11% higher in China than ill India. We document two substantial changes in government policies in China that were not witnessed in India. First. the late 1990s saw all enormous wave of ownership restructuring due to the formal endorsement of private property rights by the Chinese central government. Second, in 1997 a large scale labour retrenchment program was launched to address the long standing problem of labour redundancy in the public sector. Using data from the Chinese survey of manufacturing industries, we quantify, the impact of these large scale institutional Changes on TFP of Chinese manufacturing industries. We find that these policy changes call explain about 30% of the growth in TFP of manufacturing industries. Hence we conclude that these institutional changes in China call account for a significant part of the gains in productivity of manufacturing industries ill China relative to that ill India over the 1998-2003 period.

The paper sets the stage with a puzzle: the average performance of private equity funds is above that of the Standard and Poor's 500 - the main public stock market index - before fees are charged, but below that benchmark after fees are charged. Why are the payments to private equity buyout funds so large? Why does the marginal investor invest in buyout funds? I explore one potential answer (and probably the most controversial): that some investors are fooled. I show that the fee contracts for these funds are opaque. Considering this and the way that compensation contracts bury, in details, costly provisions that are difficult to justify on the basis of proper incentive alignment, it would be premature to assert that the agency conflicts are lower in private equity than in public equity.","Univ Amsterdam, Sch Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Phalippou, L (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Sch Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",l.phalippou@uva.nl,,,,,,,21,39,45,0,14,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We analyze the behavior of real prices of crude oil, food, metals and industrial raw materials. The analysis is based on structural VAR models estimated on quarterly data over the period 1990q1-2007q4. Our results suggest that commodity prices increase significantly in response to reductions in real interest rates. Moreover, oil prices and prices of industrial raw materials tend to display overshooting behavior in response to such interest rate changes. The evidence also suggests that a weaker dollar leads to higher commodity prices.

Received wisdom suggests that when agent's interests are partially opposed, behavior is excessively competitive: keeping up with the Jones' lowers everyones' welfare. Here, we study the long-run consequences of imitative behavior when agents have sufficiently long memories and evaluate past actions in terms of (weighted) average payoff. Imitation robustly leads to cooperative outcomes (with highest symmetric payoffs) in the long run. Furthermore, lengthening memory reinforces this effect. This provides a rationale, for example, for collusive cartel-like behavior without collusive intent. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The theoretical model finds that the release of shares of state-owned banks to foreign investors will reduce the outputs of the state-owned banks. The direction of the change in the profitability of the state-owned banks depends on the percentage of the shares released. The direction of the changes in the levels of social welfare also varies.

Given that they took place long before women gained the right to vote, these changes amounted to a voluntary renunciation of power by men. In this paper, we investigate men's incentives for sharing power with women. In our model, women's legal rights set the marital bargaining power of husbands and wives. We show that men face a trade-off between the rights they want for their own wives (namely none) and the rights of other women in the economy Men prefer other men's wives to have rights because men care about their own daughters and because an expansion of women's rights increases educational investments in children. We show that men may agree to relinquish some of their power once technological change increases the importance of human capital.

A model is proposed showing that the interactions between inequality and the type of coalition formed in a society can give rise to self-sustained social contracts where inequality persists.

A Northern firm with a superior process technology chooses either exports or technology transfer through licensing as its mode of supplying the Southern market, based on local IPR policy. Given this decision, the North and South firms engage in Cournot competition in both markets. We find that stronger IPR would enhance technology transfer through licensing and reduce the South firm's marginal production cost, thereby increasing its exports. Welfare in the South would rise (fall) if that country has high (low) absorptive capacity. Excessively strong IPR diminish competition and welfare, however. Adding foreign direct investment as an additional channel of technology transfer sustains these basic messages. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

So too does the Korean president. The main purpose of overseas visits by Korean presidents is to develop and improve bilateral relations with counterpart countries. An important objective for recent visits has concerned economic relations and cooperation. In this paper, we attempt to examine the effects on international trade of Korean presidents' overseas visits. Utilizing the gravity model, we estimate the impact of Korean presidents' overseas visits on the export and import performance of Korea. The panel data set utilized in this study consists of the annual trade statistics of 54 countries where Korean presidents have paid official visits (both state and work visits) during the 27 years between 1981 and 2007. Our results show that Korean presidents' overseas visits are positively associated with Korea's exports and imports. Inbound visits by foreign politicians (presidents and prime ministers) as well as the prior experience of official visits also have influence on exports and imports. However, the effects of overseas visits on exports are greater than that on imports. Thus, although Korean presidents' overseas visits may generally enhance bilateral economic relations, they tend to promote exports more than imports. It is also confirmed that both exports and imports with counterpart countries are sufficiently large even before the visits take place. For this, we perform the Granger causality tests to determine whether Korean presidents' overseas visits have causal relations with the export and import performance of Korea or whether bilateral trade performance causes these visits.","[Lee, Min-Hwan] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Pusan, South Korea; [Yeo, Taek-Dong] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Int Econ & Business, Gyongsan, South Korea",Pusan National University; Yeungnam University,"Lee, MH (通讯作者)，Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Pusan, South Korea.",tdyeo@yu.ac.kr; minhwan2@hanmail.net,,,,,,,29,4,4,1,14,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

A key feature of human capital investments is whether they increase or decrease wage risk. In a benchmark model it is shown that this feature alone determines whether a constrained optimal allocation should be characterized by a positive or a negative education premium. In the same model a positive intertemporal wedge is optimal. The robustness of these results is explored in two generalizations: nonobservability of education and nonobservability of consumption. Finally, policies that implement the constrained efficient allocations are considered. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We use numerical simulation methods for insights and relate our discussion to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) in the WTO. We interpret the absence of intertemporal trade as an absence of intermediation services provided by both domestic and foreign service providers. For simplicity, we consider extreme cases where intertemporal intermediation services can only be provided by domestic providers, so that when intertemporal trade in services is not allowed, markets are not complete. To our knowledge, this type of models is not used in the trade literature as general comparative statics results are unavailable. We first consider the liberalization of trade in financial services in an inter-spatial and intertemporal model of two countries, and we show how services liberalization can be welfare worsening in the presence of a tariff on spatial trade in goods. We show that this can hold in an artificial world with no domestic financial services provider. We compare financial service trade autarky in which there is no intermediation to financial service trade liberalization which involves costless intertemporal intermediation provided by foreign service providers. We also consider a more complex (and realistic) world where costly intermediation services can be provided by both domestic and foreign providers.","[Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, Social Sci Ctr, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Whalley, John] CIGI, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Whalley, John] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA USA; [Whalley, John] Inst Econ Res CES Ifo, Ctr Econ Studies, Munich, Germany; [Huang, Hui] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand; [Huang, Hui] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Zhang, Shunming] Xiamen Univ, Ctr Macroecon Res, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shunming] Xiamen Univ, Dept Finance, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shunming] China Agr Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",Western University (University of Western Ontario); National Bureau of Economic Research; Ifo Institut; Victoria University Wellington; University of Waterloo; Xiamen University; Xiamen University; China Agricultural University,"Whalley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Social Sci Ctr, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",hui.huang@vuw.ac.nz; jwhalley@uwo.ca; szhang@xmu.edu.cn,,,,,,,19,1,2,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In other words, the model does not deliver a testable restriction on the impact of interest rates on inventory investment.

The rationale for this seems to be that when production risk is the only Source of uncertainty, additive uncertainty does not reduce output below the certainty level, while multiplicative uncertainty does. We show that, in the absence of hedging, this result is drastically modified when there is simultaneous price and output uncertainty. In this situation the theoretical implications of the two specifications are sufficiently similar to preclude any a priori choice between the two.

The model is solved for two exchange-rate policies, discretion and a rule with escape clause. It illustrates the behavior of international reserves and other macroeconomic variables when the policymaker pursues output and inflation stabilization and recognizes the supply of reserves can constrain the choice of exchange rate and the choice of exchange rate affects the supply of reserves. When output is below potential, it is optimal under both discretion and the rule to adopt a weak currency and promote export-led growth to achieve output and inflation stabilization. This policy leads to reserve accumulation and is consistent with the behavior of China. When reserves are low initially, welfare is higher when the policymaker follows a rule.","[Marion, Nancy P.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Bar-Ilan, Avner] Univ Haifa, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",Dartmouth College; University of Haifa,"Marion, NP (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",bar-ilan@econ.haifa.ac.il; nancy.marion@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,29,12,16,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Using a large sample of experimental data, we empirically recover the set of norms used most often by monitors and show first that the decision to punish should be modeled separately from the decision of how much to punish. Second, we show that absolute norms often fit the data better than the group average norm often assumed in related work.

While work experience had a reduced effect on earnings inequality, the effects of education and occupation have increased.

In our model, informed agents set up mutual funds as a means of selling their private information to uninformed agents. We study the case of imperfect competition among fund managers, where uninformed agents invest simultaneously in multiple mutual funds. The size of the assets under management in the mutual fund industry is determined by endogenizing the agents' information acquisition decisions. Our model yields novel predictions on the informativeness of price, the optimal fees of mutual funds, and the equilibrium risk premium. In particular, we show that a sufficiently competitive mutual fund sector yields more informative prices and a lower equity risk premium. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

First, we consider the case of strictly concave utility function: when the discount rate is either low enough or high enough, there will be one steady state toward which the convergence of the optimal path is monotone and asymptotic. When the discount rate is in some intermediate range, we will find sufficient conditions for having either one equilibrium or multiple equilibria steady state. Depending to whether the initial capital per capita is located with respect to a critical value, we show that the optimal paths monotonically converge to one single appropriate equilibrium steady state. Second, we consider the case of linear utility and provide sufficient conditions to have either unique or two steady states when the discount rate is in some intermediate range. In this range, we give conditions under which the above critical value might not exist, and the economy attains one steady state in finite time, then stays at the other steady state afterward.","[Hung, N.

Compared with the pre-WTO accession period, the efficiency score is found to have improved significantly after entry into the WTO as a result of the competition effect. This competition effect is particularly relevant for small city banks.

Independent of the level of size asymmetry, the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of our timing game predicts that the large firm is the price leader. Experimental data show that price leadership by the large firm is frequent, but simultaneous moves are also often observed. Profit outcomes in the previous period affect the subjects' decisions to announce or wait in a way that hampers convergence to the equilibrium. Furthermore, while both small and large firms display a strong tendency to wait to announce their price when firm size asymmetry is low, they often set prices early when size asymmetry is high. Prices are higher when price setting is sequential rather than simultaneous and when firm size asymmetry is high. Hence, price leadership by either type of firm has an anti-competitive effect that is more pronounced when the size difference between firms is large.","[Dechenaux, Emmanuel] Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Mago, Shakun Datta] Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, Richmond, VA 23173 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent; University of Richmond,"Dechenaux, E (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",sdatta@richmond.edu; edechena@kent.edu,,"Dechenaux, Emmanuel/0000-0003-4734-0793; Mago, Shakun/0000-0001-9616-3151",,,,,41,14,14,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

The study was motivated by the low and declining savings rate currently prevailing in South Africa, on the one hand, and the dwindling level of economic growth experienced in the country during the 1990s, on the other. Given the weakness associated with the bivariate causality framework, the current study incorporates foreign capital inflow as an intermittent variable in the bivariate model between savings and economic growth-thereby creating a simple trivariate causality framework. Using the cointegration-based error-correction mechanism, the study finds a bi-directional causality between savings and economic growth to prevail in the short run and a distinct unidirectional causal flow from economic growth to savings to dominate in the long run. On balance, the study finds growth-led savings to predominate in South Africa. The results also show that foreign capital inflow and savings Granger-cause each other, while economic growth Granger causes foreign capital inflow. The study, therefore, recommends that in the short run, South African policies should be geared towards achieving both higher savings and economic growth in order to boost investors' confidence and to attract foreign capital inflow. However, in the long run, the country should shift its focus towards achieving higher economic growth, in order to boost the domestic savings and to sustain a steady flow of foreign capital investment.

To analyse retail bank branch location, parametric Poisson, negative binomial, Poisson-hurdle, and finite-mixture count models that accommodate unobserved heterogeneity have been estimated with a data set of bank branches in municipalities in South Africa. The key finding is that aggregate income in a municipal area is a statistically significant determinant of the number of bank branches. The results also suggest that the four core banks tend to cluster their branches in the same areas-suggesting the possibility of oligopolistic collusion. A more recent entrant locates its urban branches slightly away from the cluster and in some areas where the core banks have no presence. In addition, several socio-economic variables, some of which are unique to South Africa, do not appear to affect branch location.","Benefit Advisory Res, Res & Advisory, ZA-2010 Johannesburg, South Africa",,"Okeahalam, C (通讯作者)，Benefit Advisory Res, Res & Advisory, Private Bag X9,Postnet Suite,410 Benmore 2010, ZA-2010 Johannesburg, South Africa.",co@groupagh.com,,,,,,,57,15,18,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

Although credible property rights, efficient bureaucracies and low corruption are desirable objectives, it remains questionable whether orthodox prescriptions are the most promising pathway to get there. By taking a detailed look into the political economy of the Javanese city Solo, it is found that informal, relation-based cooperation can provide a constructive platform for policy reform. In the present paper, it is demonstrated that a 'heterodox reform symbiosis' between a dedicated government leader and a diverse range of local firms can bring about important regulatory and administrative reforms and provide important impulses for private investment.","[von Luebke, Christian] Stanford Univ, Asia Pacific Res Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [McCulloch, Neil] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England; [Patunru, Arianto A.] Univ Indonesia, LPEM, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia",Stanford University; University of Sussex; University of Indonesia,"von Luebke, C (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Asia Pacific Res Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",cvluebke@stanford.edu; N.McCulloch@ids.ac.uk; patunru@lpem-feui.org,,"Patunru, Arianto/0000-0002-2222-2419; von Lubke, Christian/0000-0002-8826-4064",,,,,79,10,10,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

When tax revenue is used for publicly provided consumption or lump-sum transfers, leisure would be higher than its social optimum. Pareto optimal taxation requires taxing capital income more heavily than labour income and subsidizing investment at the same rate of the tax. Also, it requires either subsidizing labour at the same rate as a consumption tax or subsidizing consumption at the same rate as a labour income tax, and hence it is not a practical guide to policy. Further, a consumption tax, or equivalently a uniform income tax with investment subsidies at the same rate, can be improved on by taxing capital income more heavily than labour income.","[Davies, James B.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Zeng, Jinli; Zhang, Jie] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore, Singapore",Western University (University of Western Ontario); National University of Singapore,"Davies, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",ecszj@nus.sg,"Zeng, Jinli/V-7598-2019",,,,,,40,6,6,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

We analyze the effects of allowing a community of citizens to trade pollution permits in an imperfectly competitive permit market. Allowing the community to trade directly reveals its preferences, which enhances welfare. However, community participation may also exacerbate distortions due to market power, even though the community itself trades competitively. Including the community in permit distribution may exacerbate market power distortions by affecting a dominant trader's propensity to participate in the permit market. Second, the community's demand/supply for permits may be more inelastic than other traders and worsen distortions due to market power. We illustrate in an example that these negative effects on competition can dominate the positive effect from preference revelation through the market place.","[Eshel, Dafna M.

The list price acts as an outside option for the bargainers, so the higher the list price, the more the firms can extract from bargainers. We find that an increase in the proportion of consumers seeking to bargain can lower consumer surplus overall, even though new bargainers receive a lower price. The reason is that the list price for those who do not bargain and the bargained prices for those who were already bargaining rise: sellers have a greater incentive to make the bargainers' outside option less attractive, reducing the incentive to compete for price takers. Competition Authority exhortations to bargain can therefore be misplaced. We also consider the implications for optimal seller bargaining. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Our estimated weighted average of relative prices for China and the USA are the first to use the significantly revised purchasing power parities embodied in the price data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. Our analysis reveals several findings of interest. First, interactions between the structure of trade and the levels of relative prices are sufficiently important to induce divergences between the weighted average of relative prices and conventional real effective exchange-rate indexes. Second, revisions embodied in World Development Indicators price data generally lower the estimate of US international relative prices. Third, net exports are inversely related to the estimate of US international relative price, but, for China, the correlation is positive. Estimating this correlation for other countries reveals no systematic pattern related to the level of development alone. Fourth, unlike previous work, using our price measures we find that an increase in US prices relative to Chinese prices raises the share of China's exports to the USA. Finally, there is a distinct possibility of eliminating the long-standing differential in income elasticities of US trade in empirical applications.","[Thomas, Charles P.; Marquez, Jaime; Fahle, Sean] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Marquez, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",jaime.marquez@frb.gov,,,,,,,25,4,6,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

The paper shows that such indicators have a number of features that can lead to them obscuring underlying changes in exchange rates and that the signals they emit will often be difficult to interpret.

Mobility across labour market states increased in those countries where unemployment has been falling the most. Institutional reforms - such as declining employment protection for new entrants in the labour market and less generous unemployment benefits - account for this increase in mobility. Focusing on these reforms, we rationalize why EU workers, including those with permanent contracts, are increasingly unhappy about labour market conditions in spite of the disappearance of mass unemployment in Europe. Due to these perceptions, policy reversals cannot be ruled out. Governments wishing to minimize the risk of going back to Eurosclerosis should move towards flexicurity configurations, compensating workers for higher risks of job loss, and introduce tenure tracks to the labour market, preventing the development of dual labour market structures.

Next, the model explains the labor market dynamics from the supply side, while endogenizing the capital productivity response to changes in the aggregate labor demand composition.

Wage rates are only observed for those who are employed, and employment status itself may be affected by the training program. This paper develops an intuitive trimming procedure for bounding average treatment effects in the presence of sample selection. In contrast to existing methods, the procedure requires neither exclusion restrictions nor a bounded support for the outcome of interest. Identification results, estimators, and their asymptotic distribution are presented. The bounds suggest that the program raised wages, consistent with the notion that the Job Corps raises earnings by increasing human capital, rather than solely through encouraging work. The estimator is generally applicable to typical treatment evaluation problems in which there is nonrandom sample selection/attrition.","[Lee, David S.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Lee, David S.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lee, DS (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,46,583,700,4,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Our estimate of the elasticity of output with respect to piece rates is 0.39. Regression methods cannot predict performance under hypothetical contracts. Therefore, we apply structural econometric methods (without imposing profit maximization) to evaluate observed-contract optimality. Using profit as a metric, we estimate the distance between observed and profit-maximizing contracts to be negligible. This suggests that observed contracts closely approximate optimal contracts under asymmetric information about worker ability. Under complete information, the firm could increase expected profits by 14 percent keeping workers indifferent to the observed piece-rate contract. Profits could increase between 44 and 49 percent if the firm exploited information about ability to reduce worker utility to the outside alternative. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In most emerging market economies, total inflows are pro-cyclical, with debt and portfolio equity flowing in first, followed later in the expansion by foreign direct investment (FDI). To understand the dynamic composition of these flows, we use a small open economy (SOE) framework to model the composition of capital inflows as the equilibrium outcome of emerging market firms' financing decisions. We show how costly external financing and FDI search costs generate a state contingent cost of financing such that the cheapest source of financing depends on the phase of the business cycle. In this manner, the financial frictions are able to explain the interaction between the types of flows and deliver a time-varying composition of flows, as well as other standard features of emerging market business cycles. If, as this work suggests, flows are an equilibrium outcome of firms' financing decisions, then volatility of capital inflows is not necessarily bad for an economy. Furthermore, using capital controls to shut down one type of flow and encourage another is certain to have both short- and long-run welfare implications.

The economic system is related to the environment by a flow of virgin materials into the economy, and by the diffusion of waste into the environment. Eco-efficiency contributes to reducing material waste in all processes. Recycling can reduce the diffusion of waste by feeding it back into the economy. Human capital enhances productivity, eco-efficiency and the quality of all kinds of outputs. Recycling and human capital formation use productive factors and are rooted therefore, as all other activities, in the material basis of the economy.

We find a modest increase of the Gini coefficient, a substantial drop of median income and a remarkable growth of the income share accruing to the economic elite, which we define as the richest 0.001 percent of persons in the population. While the elite mainly obtains its income from business and capital, the income share that it receives in the form of wage income has been increasing. We also show that the dramatic decline of market income in the bottom half of the distribution is very much mitigated by income transfers within private households and by governmental redistribution.","[Steiner, Viktor] Free Univ Berlin, DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Bach, Stefan] DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, Berlin, Germany; [Corneo, Giacomo] Free Univ Berlin, CEPR, CESifo, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin; Ifo Institut,"Steiner, V (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",vsteiner@diw.de,,,,,,,25,54,57,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Our estimator is rooted in the economics of matching and thus accounts for three important features of typical merger protocol: two-sided decision making, multiple potential partners, and spatial interdependence. Rather than simply explaining when a particular region is likely to experience a wave of political integration, our method allows us to explore the factors driving which specific subregional mergers take place. This allows us to explore how those districts that merge choose with which of their neighbors to do so. Our results highlight the importance of state financial incentives for consolidation, economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, and a variety of heterogeneity measures in this particular application. We also demonstrate the power of our estimator, relative to existing estimators, to detect a statistically significant role for heterogeneity factors. While our application is limited to school district consolidation, our method can be adapted to include the salient features of many spatial integration problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The integrated assessment model FUND provides the cost-benefit payoff functions of pollution abatement for sixteen different world regions. The farsighted stability concept of Chwe (1994) is used and solved by combinatorial algorithms. Farsighted stability assumes perfect foresight of the players and predicts which coalitions can be formed when players are farsighted. All farsightedly stable coalitions are found, and their improvement to environment and welfare is considerable. The farsightedly stable coalitions are refined further to preferred farsightedly stable coalitions, which are coalitions where the majority of coalition members reach higher profits in comparison with any other farsightedly stable coalitions. Farsightedly stable coalitions contribute more to the improvement of environment and welfare in comparison to D'Aspremont et al.'s (1983) stable ones. Considering multiple farsighted stable coalitions, participation in coalitions for environmental protection is significantly increased, which is an optimistic result of our game theoretical model.","[Osmani, Dritan] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Marine & Atmospher Sci, Res Unit Sustainabil & Global Change, Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modeling IMPRS ESM, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Tol, Richard] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",University of Hamburg; Max Planck Society; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Osmani, D (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Ctr Marine & Atmospher Sci, Res Unit Sustainabil & Global Change, Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modeling IMPRS ESM, Bundestr 55,Room 31 Pavillon, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",dritan.osmani@zmaw.de,"Osmani, Dritan/ABE-3590-2021; Tol, Richard S.

Using both the Altonji and Shakotko instrumental variable and the Topel two-step estimation approaches, I find that for all male workers, tenure plays a modest role, increasing wages by about 1% each year over the first 10 years on the job. General labor market experience has a larger role, so that after 30 years wages have increased by about 60%. Individual and job match heterogeneity are important, and should be carefully modeled when estimating wage equations for the British labor market. These results are remarkably similar to the most recent evidence about these relationships in the US labor market. After extending the standard model to include industry and occupation experience, the estimated impact of job seniority becomes negligible for nonunion workers. Instead, the wages of nonunion workers rise because of the accumulation of general and sector-specific experience. The wages of union workers are still found to increase with job seniority over the first ten years with their employer, suggesting that if seniority matters for wages it is only for union workers.

These differences exist among virtually all subpopulations, are relatively constant over time, and are economically large. Although racial differences in utility preference parameters might account for a portion of these consumption differences, we emphasize instead a model of status seeking in which conspicuous consumption is used as a costly indicator of a household's economic position. Using merged data on race- and state-level income, we demonstrate that a key prediction of the status-signaling model-that visible consumption should be declining in reference group income is strongly borne out in the data for each racial group.

In the subgame perfect equilibrium of the game, the platform fully internalises the network externalities present in the market and firms and consumers all participate in the platform with probability one. The monopolist intermediary extracts all the economic rents generated in the market, except when firms and consumers can trade outside the platform, in which case consumers obtain a rent that corresponds to the utility they would get if they did trade outside the platform. The market allocation is constraint-efficient in the sense that the monopoly platform does not introduce distortions over and above those arising from the market power of the differentiated product sellers. An increase in the number of retailers increases the amount of variety in the platform but at the same time increases competition. As a result, the platform lowers the firm fees and raises the consumer charges. In contrast, an increase in the extent of product differentiation raises the value of the platform for the consumers but weakens competition. In this case, the platform raises both the charge to the consumers and the fee for the firms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The dataset is unique in the sense that it provides almost full coverage of a banking sector at the company level that expanded foreign operations during the period covered on an unprecedented scale at the time.

This paper investigates price discrimination in the shipping industry and the role it plays in determining transportation costs. In the presence of market power, shipping prices depend on the demand characteristics of goods being traded. We show theoretically and estimate empirically that ocean cargo carriers charge higher prices when transporting goods with higher product prices, lower import demand elasticities, and higher tariffs, and when facing fewer competitors on a trade route. These characteristics explain more variation in shipping prices than do conventional proxies such as distance, and significantly contribute to the higher shipping prices facing the developing world. A simple back of the enevelope calculation suggests that eliminating market power in shipping would boost trade volumes by 5.9% (for the US) to 15.2% (for Latin America). Our findings are also important for evaluating the impact of tariff liberalization. Cargo carriers decrease shipping prices by 1-2% for every 1% reduction in tariffs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Adam Smith is strongly associated with the invisible hand, understood as a general rule that people in realising their self-interests unintentionally benefit the public good. The attribution to Smith is challengeable. Adam Smith's use of the metaphor was much more modest; it was re-invented in the 1930s and 1940s onwards to bolster mathematical treatments of capitalism (Samuelson, Friedman) and to support innovative analysis by associating the metaphor with 'spontaneous order' (Hayek). The effect has been to ignore insightful explanations about how markets function as a process in favour of semi-mystical beliefs in imagined outcomes, wrapped in an isolated 18th-century literary metaphor, which does not explain anything.","Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University,"Kennedy, G (通讯作者)，Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",gavinK9@gmail.com,,,,,,,80,46,50,3,23,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

The generalized beta function of the second kind, which asymptotically reproduces a power law function, is applied to explain the distribution of labour productivity. By comparing the power law exponents that characterize high and low productivity ranges, the authors show that for manufacturing industries, inequality in the low productivity range is larger than that in the high productivity range. For the manufacturing industries, the authors also clarify that the change of inequality in the low productivity range has strong correlation with GDP. In addition, by comparing the power law exponents of the high productivity range in the manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries, the authors show that the inequality of the non-manufacturing industry is higher than that of the manufacturing industry.","[Souma, Wataru; Fujiwara, Yoshi] NiCT ATR CIS Appl Network Sci Lab, Kyoto 6190288, Japan; [Ikeda, Yuichi] Hitachi Ltd, Hitachi Res Lab, Ibaraki, Japan; [Iyetomi, Hiroshi] Niigata Univ, Dept Phys, Ikarashi, Niigata, Japan",National Institute of Information & Communications Technology (NICT) - Japan; Hitachi Limited; Niigata University,"Souma, W (通讯作者)，NiCT ATR CIS Appl Network Sci Lab, Kyoto 6190288, Japan.",souma@atr.jp,"Souma, Wataru/L-3652-2018","Souma, Wataru/0000-0002-1051-4350",,,,,18,10,11,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 22,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200914,,,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20LZ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208142800002,0

Specifically, I use a longitudinal data set to test whether and to what extent the intensive redistribution practiced by Israeli kibbutzim encourages exit of more productive individuals and entry of less productive ones. The findings support the theoretical prediction. Kibbutz-leavers are more skilled than both stayers and other rural migrants and they earn higher wages upon exit than observably similar city natives and other migrants. In contrast, individuals who earn lower wages in the city are more likely to enter a kibbutz, but they are not more likely to move to other rural areas. These findings also Support Borjas' hypothesis that migrants' self-selection depends oil the difference in returns to skills between the origin and the destination. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Structural breaks represent infrequent regime shifts, while dynamic factors capture common shocks underlying the comovement of economic time series. We examine the modified Sargan-Bhargava (MSB) test in the panel data setting and propose ways to handle multiple structural changes and dynamic factors. Properties of the MSB test under these non-standard conditions are derived. For example, the test statistics are shown to be invariant, in the limit, to mean breaks. This invariance does not carry over to breaks in linear trends, where the test statistics will converge to functionals of weighted Brownian bridges. A simplified test statistic is then proposed, which is invariant to both mean and trend breaks. We further study pooled test statistic based on standardization and combination of p-values. Response surfaces for p-values of all test statistics are computed to facilitate the empirical implementation of the proposed methodology. The pooled tests are shown to have good finite sample performance.","[Bai, Jushan] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Carrion-I-Silvestre, Josep Lluis] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",New York University; University of Barcelona,"Bai, J (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,"Carrion-i-Silvestre, Josep Lluís/K-8241-2014; Carrion-i-Silvestre, Josep Lluís/JCE-4759-2023","Carrion-i-Silvestre, Josep Lluís/0000-0003-2733-7677;",,,,,45,205,214,2,27,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Government ownership is more efficient than private ownership when private property rights are insecure. Improved institutional protection of property rights over time creates the need to privatize. The buyer's financial constraints affect the timing of privatization, causing the firm's post-privatization performance either to improve or to deteriorate in the short run. Financial constraints also have the possibility of inducing an underpricing phenomenon during privatization where the firm is priced below both what the buyer is willing to pay and the buyer's ability to pay. Faster institutional development calls for earlier privatization, but it also has the potential to either create or exacerbate deadweight losses associated with inefficient privatization. A host of empirically testable implications are derived.","Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Che, JH (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,34,4,4,2,29,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The integral is extended to fuzzy capacities, which assign subjective expected values to random variables (e.g., portfolios) and may assign subjective probability only to a partial set of events.

This improved economic behavior can be explained by both a reduction in the shocks faced by the country and a better monetary policy conduct. This paper explores the contribution of both factors to boosting Chile's economic performance in the past fifteen years through three measures derived from the economy's efficiency frontier. The measure capturing macroeconomic behavior presents an improvement (decline) of 200% between the periods 1992-2000 and 2001-2007-reflecting the reduction in output and inflation volatility-a fact that is explained by a reduction in the shocks (123%), and by by monetary policy efficiency gains (83%). Furthermore, between 2001 and 2006, the Chilean economy experienced the smallest magnitude of shocks since 1992, while the monetary policy was responsible for keeping the economy above the efficiency frontier.","Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Ochoa, JM (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",marcelo.ochoa@duke.edu,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,BANCO CENTRAL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"MORANDE 115 2ND PISO, AUGUSTINAS 1180, SANTIAGO, 6500-590, CHILE",0717-3830,,,ECON CHIL,Econ.

In this paper, we demonstrate by example how prediction markets make it possible to use markets to prospectively estimate policy effects. We exploit data from a market trading in contracts tied to the ouster of Saddam Hussein as leader of Iraq to learn about financial market participants' expectations of the consequences of the 2003 Iraq war. We conducted an ex-ante analysis, which we disseminated before the war, finding that a 10% increase in the probability of war was accompanied by a $1 increase in spot oil prices that futures markets suggested was expected to dissipate quickly. Equity price movements implied that the same shock led to a 1.5% decline in the S&P 500. Further, the existence of widely-traded equity index options allows us to back out the entire distribution of market expectations of the war's near-term effects, finding that these large effects reflected a negatively skewed distribution, with a substantial probability of an extremely adverse outcome. The flow of war-related news through our sample explains a large proportion of daily oil and equity price movements. Subsequent analysis suggests that these relationships continued to hold out of sample. Our analysis also allows us to characterize which industries and countries were most sensitive to war news and when the immediate consequences of the war were better than ex-ante expectations, these sectors recovered, confirming these cross-sectional implications. We highlight the features of this case study that make it particularly amenable to this style of policy analysis and discuss some of the issues in applying this method to other policy contexts.","[Wolfers, Justin] Univ Penn, CEPR IZA & NBER, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Zitzewitz, Eric] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Dartmouth College,"Wolfers, J (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, CEPR IZA & NBER, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,,,,,43,55,64,1,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0427,,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2009,76.0,302,,,,,225,250,,10.1111/j.1468-0335.2008.00750.x,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,421SR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264379100002,0

A theoretical investigation,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Child labor; Product boycott; Labor standards,ECONOMICS,"A popular form of action to curb child labor and uphold international labor standards in general is a 'product boycott' by consumers. There are labeling agencies that inform us if, for instance, a carpet or a hand-stitched soccer ball is free of child labor. The presence of a consumer boycott will typically mean that products tainted by child labor will command a lower price on the market than ones certified to be untainted. It is popularly presumed that such consumer activism is desirable. The paper formally investigates this presumption and shows that consumer product boycotts can, in a wide class of situations, have an adverse reaction that causes child labor to rise rather than fall. This happens under weak and plausible assumptions. Hence, there has to be much greater caution in the use of consumer activism, and one has to have much more detailed information about the context where child labor occurs, before using a boycott.

An important obstacle, however, has been moral biases: distortions created by self-interest can obscure our measures of social preferences. This paper describes a simple experiment to address this. We compare the decisions of implicated stakeholders with those of impartial spectators. We find that stakeholders are less inclined to respond to the generosity of others than are spectators. We also clarify a result in previous research [e.g., Offerman, T., 2002. Hurting hurts more than helping helps. European Economic Review 46,1423-1437] that stakeholders punish unkindness more than they reward kindness. We find that this asymmetry in reciprocity has two sources: an asymmetry in the underlying preference that even impartial spectators display and a moral bias: stakeholders punish more and reward less than spectators. In sum, we find that all three motives have important and significant effects on final allocations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Both the Pesaran bounds testing and the Johansen cointegration tests results suggest that there exists a long-run relationship between real exports, world income and the relative export prices in Indonesia. The long-run income elasticity of the demand for Indonesia's exports is significantly greater than one and the long-run relative export price elasticity of the demand for its exports is significantly lower than one. The recursive and rolling regressions and the Hansen-Johansen stability test results suggest that the export demand function for Indonesia has undergone a significant structural change since the late-1990s, which is reflected in the decrease of the income elasticity, and an increase in the relative export price elasticity, of demand for Indonesian exports.

The results provide no Support for the hypothesis that tax cuts restrain government spending; indeed, the point estimates suggest that tax cuts increase spending.

Government agencies faced severe constraints in addressing the crisis: lack of legal authority for potentially helpful financial stabilization measures, a Congress reluctant to grant such authority, and the need to act quickly ill the midst of a market panic. Treasury officials recognized the dangers arising from mounting foreclosures and worked to facilitate limited mortgage modifications, but going further was politically unacceptable because public funds would have gone to some irresponsible borrowers. The suddenness of Bear Stearns' collapse in March 2008 made rescue necessary and led to preparation of emergency options should conditions worsen. The Treasury saw Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's rescue that summer as necessary to calin markets, despite the moral hazard created.

We assume an overlapping generations model in which every consumer has identical instantaneous utility which is additively separable with respect to time. The parameters of utility here include character traits which influence the choice between consumption and savings. In this situation, young individuals choose between current consumption and current savings which lead to future consumption in their old age. Individual character traits, which appear both in the shape of utility functions and in evaluations about utility in the future, affect these choices. And since these choices determine savings, individual character traits can eventually determine how our economy moves. Focusing on the relationship between individual character traits and savings formation, we demonstrate that endogenous business cycles with two periods can occur, in an economy comprised of individuals who opt for current consumption and who are careless in relation to future events, like Aesopian grasshoppers, and in other cases they do not.","[Takata, Fujio] Kobe Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Kobe University,"Takata, F (通讯作者)，1-4-2 Tennouji Cho Minami,Abeno Ku, Osaka 5450002, Japan.",JikaiRF@aol.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

J,"White, MV; Schuler, K",,,,"White, Michael V.; Schuler, Kurt",,,Retrospectives: Who Said Debauch the Currency: Keynes or Lenin?,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"One frequently quoted passage from the work of John Maynard Keynes is that the best way to destroy the capitalist system [is] to debauch the currency. The passage, attributed to Vladimir Illyich Lenin, appears in Keynes' book The Economic Consequences of the Peace, which became an international bestseller when it was published in 1919. Economic historian Frank W. Fetter and others have expressed doubt that Keynes was really quoting Lenin because they found no such statement in Lenin's collected published writings. Fetter suggested that Keynes based his remark on stories about what the Soviets were supposed to be saying that he heard at the Paris peace conference of 1919. It is now possible to show that Keynes based his remark on a report of an interview with Lenin published by London and New York newspapers in April 1919. Keynes' discussion of inflation in the Economic Consequences can then be read as an extended commentary on the remarks attributed to Lenin in the interview. While the report of the interview was not reprinted after 1919, it will be also shown here that Lenin responded to Keynes in a speech that was reprinted in his Collected Works.","[White, Michael V.] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Schuler, Kurt] US Dept Treasury, Off Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20226 USA",Monash University; United States Department of the Treasury,"White, MV (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",mike.white@buseco.monash.edu.au; kurt.schuler@do.treas.gov,,,,,,,25,12,14,0,5,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The author will review, from macro growth regressions, studies that test primarily the performance of endogenous models in terms of significance and robustness of the coefficients of growth determinants. By highlighting methodological issues and critical discussion, she argues that: (i) causal inference drawn from the empirical growth literature remains highly questionable, (ii) there are estimates for a wide range of potential factors but their magnitude and robustness are still under debate. Her conclusion, however, is that, if properly interpreted, the predictions of endogenous growth models are gathering increasing empirical support.","[Capolupo, Rosa] Univ Bari, Dept Econ, Bari, Italy; [Capolupo, Rosa] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Glasgow,"Capolupo, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bari, Dept Econ, Via Camillo Rosalba 53, Bari, Italy.",r.capolupo@dse.uniba.it,,,,,,,301,0,0,0,1,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,FEB 12,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,73,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20LP,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208141800001,0

The analysis is based on data on over 8,000 individuals serving time in 169 juvenile correctional facilities during a two-year period in Florida. These data provide a complete record of past crimes, facility assignments, and arrests and adjudications in the year following release for each individual. To control for the nonrandom assignment to facilities, we include facility and facility-by-prior-offense fixed effects, thereby estimating peer effects using only within-facility variation over time. We find strong evidence of peer effects for burglary, petty larceny, felony and misdemeanor drug offenses, aggravated assault, and felony sex offenses. The influence of peers primarily affects individuals who already have some experience in a particular crime category. We also find evidence that the predominant types of peer effects differ in residential versus nonresidential facilities; effects in the latter are consistent with network formation among youth serving time close to home.","[Bayer, Patrick] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Yale University,"Bayer, P (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,,,,,34,234,308,1,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

A tractable linear-quadratic approximation permits a representation of the optimal policy plan in terms of targeting rules. In the optimal equilibrium, monetary policy should achieve aggregate price stability following a flexible inflation targeting rule. Fiscal policy should stabilize idiosyncratic shocks allowing for permanent variations of government debt but should abstain from creating inflationary expectations at the union level. Simple policy rules can approximate the optimal commitment benchmark through a mix of strict inflation targeting and flexible budget rules. Conversely, the welfare costs of balanced budget rules are at least one order of magnitude higher than conventional estimates of the costs of business cycle fluctuactions. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We expect that class will be less important than status in shaping cultural participation patterns. In addition, due to the importance of ethnicity and religiosity in Israeli society, we expect that these factors will be significant in shaping cultural participation. Data are based on two telephone surveys conducted in 2006 and 2007 of a random sample of the Jewish population in Israel. We find that, contrary to our expectation, class is more influential than status. We also find that ethnicity and religiosity are important factors that shape cultural participation patterns.

Equilibrium models have not worked well in explaining the actual exchange rate. However, the use of seasonally adjusted data might be responsible for the spurious rejection of the model. This article presents a new equilibrium model for the exchange rates that incorporates seasonal preferences. The fit of the model to the data is evaluated for five industrialized countries using seasonally unadjusted data. Our findings indicate that a model with seasonal preferences can generate monthly time series of the exchange rate without seasonality even when the variables that theoretically determine the exchange rate show clear seasonal behaviours. Further, the model can generate theoretical exchange rates with the same order of integration than actual exchange rates, and in some cases, with the same stochastic trend.","[Angel Jimenez-Martin, Juan; Flores de Frutos, Rafael] Univ Complutense, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Jiménez-Martín, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Madrid 28223, Spain.",juanangel@ccee.ucm.es,"MARTIN, JUAN ANGEL JIMENEZ/H-7230-2015","MARTIN, JUAN ANGEL JIMENEZ/0000-0001-5608-3288",,,,,33,3,3,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We review the evidence for both developed and emerging economies. The emphasis, though, is on emerging economies, which can be thought of as preparing the ground for the papers to follow that concentrate on the experience with inflation targeting in Brazil, Chile and Mexico. The results gathered in this study demonstrate that although inflation targeting has gone hand-in-hand with low inflation, it is very far from declaring the strategy a resounding success. The evidence produced in this paper suggests that non-inflation targeting central banks have also been successful on this score. At a general level this paper should be read as providing the necessary prolegomena for the studies that follow in this special volume on inflation targeting.","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Angeriz, Alvaro] Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of Cambridge; University of London,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",a.angeriz@qmul.ac.uk; pa267@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,53,2,4,0,1,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

An Application to Household Level Data from Turkey,B E JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS & POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,bank choice; household survey; Turkey; multinomial probit; banking sector,ACCUMULATION; DYNAMICS; GROWTH,"This paper uses a multinomial probit model to analyze individuals' choice of banks based on the types of banking services they use, their own characteristics, and their own perceptions about important factors in banking. Previous studies on this topic, which are limited in number, concentrate on the U.S. where financial markets are well-developed. This analysis uses a unique individual level data set from a nation-wide survey implemented after the 2001 crisis in Turkey, of which one major component was bank failures. Hence, it provides the first set of econometric evidence on the topic in an emerging market context. The study groups banks into three categories: public, large private and small private banks, among which the latter is perceived to be the potentially risky group. Investigating individuals' choice among these three types, the paper uncovers that while individuals tend to prefer small private banks on the basis of high interest rates, they tend to avoid them on the basis of trust. Additionally, the paper finds that the choice between public and large private banks mainly depends on structural factors. These results could be of potential use to policymakers in regulating the banking sector and to bank management in channeling marketing effort.","[Ardic, Oya Pinar] Bogazici Univ, TR-80815 Bebek, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Ardic, OP (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, TR-80815 Bebek, Turkey.",pinar.ardic@boun.edu.tr; uygar.yuzereroglu@turkcell.com.tr,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Second, for arbitrary level of discounting, all strictly enforceable subgame perfect equilibrium payoffs can be approximately supported with 1-memory if the number of players exceeds two. Furthermore, in this case all subgame perfect equilibrium payoffs can be approximately supported by an E-equilibrium with 1-memory. In two-player games, the same set of results hold if an additional restriction is assumed: Players must have common punishments. Finally, to illustrate the role of our assumptions, we present robust examples of games in which there is a subgame perfect equilibrium payoff profile that cannot be obtained with 1-memory.

In our model, a single 'insider' bidder possesses information about the asset's common value. Bidders are privately informed about their costs of exploiting the asset. Due to the insider's presence, uninformed bidders face a strong winner's curse in standard auctions. We show that the optimal mechanism discriminates against the informationally advantaged bidder. It can be implemented via a two-stage 'qualifying auction'. In the first stage, non-binding bids are submitted to determine who enters the second stage, which consists of a standard second-price auction augmented with a reserve price.","[Boone, Jan] Tilburg Univ, Tilec, CentER, ENCORE,Uva,IZA, Tilburg, Netherlands; CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Tilburg University; California Institute of Technology,"Boone, J (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilec, CentER, ENCORE,Uva,IZA, Tilburg, Netherlands.",,,"boone, jan/0000-0002-0958-2444; Goeree, Jacob/0000-0001-9876-3425",,,,,27,7,7,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

Characteristics such as openness. exchange rate pass-through and adverse balance sheet effects have been highlighted in the recent literature as being possible reasons for fear of floating. Motivated by recent experiences in East Asia, this paper examines a range of policy configurations in a small open economy macro-model that contains the above characteristics and finds the most suited policy for each one. The policy configurations differ in the degree of exchange rate involvement in the formulation of the policy. The ultimate objective is to ascertain whether the exchange rate can be used in some capacity as a feasible objective of monetary policy. The paper rinds that, for most model configurations, fear of floating policies perform well-in some cases they are the most suited policy. This suggests that fear of floating behaviour by central banks in open and developing economics is very much justified. (C) 2008 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This article shows that both CF and FF specialise in commodities in which they have a comparative advantage. CF specialise in capital-intensive products and in products with low labour monitoring requirements. FF specialise in products with higher labour monitoring requirements. The implication of this study is that farm structure indirectly determines in which products a country will be competitive on international markets.

Recent studies have derived ad valorem equivalents for NTBs for a large number of countries and/or products, but the derivation has been indirect, due to either lack of price data or NTB incidence measures. This paper uses city level retail price data to directly estimate the average impact of core NTBs on prices of 47 consumer products, grouped into four separate sectors, for more than 60 countries in 2001. The analysis uses both government self-reported data and a new database of private sector complaint data to assess NTB incidence. A differentiated products model is used to capture imperfect substitutability between products. With city level price data--including both inter- and intra-country price differences-a more precise distinction can be made between the impact of NTBs and the impact of local distribution costs in raising price. The model is estimated using an instrumental variables approach to incorporate the endogeneity of NTBs. Results suggest that core NTBs are still highly restrictive in many countries and for many traded goods. While NTBs appear to be complements to tariffs, in some sectors the presence of a tariff reduces the price impact of the NTB. Results also suggest that in some sectors, the restrictiveness of NTBs is highly correlated with country income.","[Ludema, Rodney D.] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,,judith.dean@usitc.gov; jose.signoret@usitc.gov; feinber@american.edu; ludemar@georgetown.edu; michael.ferrantino@usitc.gov,,"Feinberg, Robert/0000-0001-8087-3853; Dean, Judith/0000-0002-1158-6778",,,,,42,23,25,0,27,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We find a significant reciprocal positive relationship between trust and success. Other significant determinants of trust include the perceived quality of the entrepreneur and credibility of information (two proxy variables for measuring confidence), the perceived importance of reputation and the stage of the entrepreneur's venture. The level of monitoring and control is identified as a substitute for trust. We address a potential endogeneity of trust and success by estimating a system of two simultaneous equations by 3SLS and find the results to be robust. Finally, we use data from a second survey conducted in 2006 to assess whether trust predicts success. In fact, our results indicate that a higher level of trust in 2003 is associated with a higher success rate in 2006.","[Duffner, Stefan] Goldman Sachs & Co, New York, NY 10004 USA; [Schmid, Markus M.] Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Banking & Finance, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Zimmermann, Heinz] Univ Basel, Dept Finance, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland",University of St Gallen; University of Basel,"Duffner, S (通讯作者)，Goldman Sachs & Co, 85 Broad St, New York, NY 10004 USA.",stefan.duffner@gs.com; schmid@unisg.ch; heinz.zimmermann@unibas.ch,,,,,,,32,27,30,0,18,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,,2009,62.0,1,,,,,15,43,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00426.x,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,395GK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262512400002,0

Even less is known about how arrears compare between countries, although debt levels are known to vary widely. Using data from the European Community Household Panel, we first show that arrears are frequently associated with subsequent adverse consequences, such as future unemployment or bad health. Second, we find that arrears are often precipitated by an adverse shock to the household's income or health, but that there are large differences between countries in how households react to these events. Finally, we show that these differences can be partly explained by local financial and judicial institutions, as captured by contract enforcement and information sharing indicators. In other words, we show that while adverse shocks are highly important, the extent to which they affect repayment behaviour depends crucially on the penalty for defaulting. This finding suggests that although repayment problems often arise from a genuine inability to repay, some households seem to behave strategically.","[Duygan-Bump, Burcu] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA; Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston; University of Reading,"Duygan-Bump, B (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA.",,,,,,,,26,38,39,2,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

The proposed adaptable communication environment of distance learning is constructed by integration of new components of communication scenarios generation, adaptable for student's goals, multilayered domain ontology of learning subject and forming intelligent agents' framework possible. The paper presents the knowledge-based component architecture of the distance learning system, which enables a better adaptation of learning resources to students. The paper analyses the possibilities of integrating ontology into the e-learning system. The issues of decomposing ontology into different levels of understanding are discussed in order to adapt to learner's tasks and goals.

The findings show that the inferences regarding the the effectiveness of IMF pro grams obtained under different approaches seem robust: IMF programs M East European countries appear to be ineffective. However it may be simplistic to blame solely the IMF for ineffective programs, as effectiveness may be determined by many factors, including the nature of the programs, the commitment of the corresponding country's officials, policy, changes, and external shocks.","[Eke, Burcu] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kutan, Ali M.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Eke, B (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,,"Eke Rubini, Burcu/0000-0003-1957-0460",,,,,17,3,4,0,6,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

For this purpose, we use time-series and cross-section analysis. From a time-series viewpoint we disaggregate unemployment by regions, and use unit root tests, AR coefficients and fractional differencing parameters as indicators of persistence. For the cross-section approach, we first estimate mean regressions of regional unemployment rates. Then, using a panel of 114 periods and 50 provinces, we estimate pooled, fixed and random effects models. Finally, following some recent developments, we implement several panel data unit root tests. Previous studies had already shown the strong persistence of Spanish unemployment. Our disaggregated analysis extends the finding to reveal that the persistence is greater in the most industrialized regions. The results also suggest that a structural break took place in 1994, implying a decline in the unemployment persistence since then.","[Garcia-del-Barrio, P.] Univ Int Catalunya, Fac Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Gil-Alana, L.

J,"Gurkov, I",,,,"Gurkov, Igor",,,The strategy process in Russian 'non-strategic' companies: coping with economic recession,POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article reports on the behaviour of Russian medium-size companies during the first months of economic recession. Using a convenient sample survey and a series of corporate stories we examine the options for turnaround strategies and the patterns of strategic choice. We find that economic recession provoked the 'return' of company owners to the role of 'internal strategists' or even into operations management. Under such conditions companies with dispersed ownership have visible disadvantages in building a consistent strategic agenda and timely implementation of robust strategies, as any strategic actions largely depend on a 'concert' of corporate strategists. Factor analysis of the actions implemented or planned for implementation reveals two patterns of strategic behaviour - cost leadership and differentiation. Cost leadership is the more popular option as it provides more chances for sustainability in the short term. The selection between the two strategic options is less determined by the company's past performance and competitiveness than by ambitions of key 'internal strategists'.","State Univ Higher Sch Econ, Moscow 101000, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Gurkov, I (通讯作者)，State Univ Higher Sch Econ, Myasnitskaya St 20, Moscow 101000, Russia.",gurkov@list.ru,"Gurkov, Igor/H-1501-2015","Gurkov, Igor/0000-0001-8116-0425",,,,,9,7,9,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,4,,,,,439,451,,10.1080/14631370903339849,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,596GT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277673900004,0

Greater international mobility of economic activity, and associated responsiveness of the tax base to tax rates, increase the economic distortions created by taxation. Countries with small open economies have relatively mobile tax bases; as a result, they rely much less heavily on corporate and personal income taxes than other countries. The evidence indicates that a 10% smaller population in 1999 is associated with a 1% smaller ratio of personal and corporate income tax collections to total tax revenues. Governments of small countries instead rely on consumption-type taxes, including taxes on sales of goods and services and import tariffs, much more heavily than larger countries do. Since the rapid pace of globalization implies that all countries are becoming small open economies, this evidence suggests that the use of expenditure taxes is likely to increase, posing challenges to governments concerned about recent changes in income distribution.","[Hines, James R., Jr.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,43,16,18,0,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60 ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0892-8649,,978-0-226-07654-6,TAX POL EC,,,2009,23.0,,,,,,123,157,,10.1086/597056,0.0,,,35,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BKM84,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268600700004,0

An aggregate matching function is derived, which incorporates workers' preferences for firms. The aggregate level of matches is shown to be independent of the workers' preferences in the job acceptance stage. When firms' labor demands are heterogeneous, the matching market equilibrium outcome is suboptimal. Matching efficiency is, however, attained in equilibrium, when wages are employed as a rationing device. This results in wage dispersion, despite workers being homogeneous.","Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Sch Econ Math & Stat, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Hori, K (通讯作者)，Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Sch Econ Math & Stat, London WC1E 7HX, England.",k.hori@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,2,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We hypothesise that the distorted, low supply of bank debt in the late 1990's was a major imperfection affecting capital structure. The importance of this imperfection was enhanced by the major role of bank debt in transition economies' financing. Consequently the 1999 banking reform aimed at increasing the supply of funds. This paper uses annual observations from 1996 to 2004 on a sample of over 1.000 non-financial firms to explore variations in financial structure over time. A survey of the capital structure literature leads to an empirical model of the major determinants of leverage.

In this paper, we re-examine the scholarly consensus that Korea has become a neo-liberal state, while Japan has not changed much. On the basis of our comparison of the extent of the two countries' neo-liberal reforms using the business systems framework'' developed by Witt, we demonstrate that neo-liberal reforms observed in Korea and Japan are not substantially different enough to warrant the view that the two countries have taken divergent paths of institutional development. With this finding, we call for further empirical study, including the development and use of more qualitative data. We suggest that the future direction research should take on this issue in order to make theoretical contributions to the existing literature on institutional change and continuity in non-liberal'' capitalist countries. We do this by offering some methods in which future researchers could identify necessary and sufficient causes of Korea's and Japan's neo-liberal (or non-neo-liberal) shift.","[Lee, Yong Wook] Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwak, Sun Young] Univ So Calif, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",Korea University; University of Southern California,"Lee, YW (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Seoul, South Korea.",yongir@korea.ac.kr,"Lee, Yong Wook/A-9954-2013","Lee, Yong Wook/0000-0002-8173-0763",,,,,55,6,7,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Neither is the alternative target function proposed by Lenzen et al. (2007). This paper develops the exact Kullback and Leibler cross-entropy measure.

In the model, a two-equation simultaneous subsystem is formed, in which three regression equations are specified: a decision of RD intensity, and a yes/no decision of location to conduct RD together with a yes/no decision to invest in China Our results indicate that China investment and RD intensity are positively related such that ODI in China helps to raise significantly a firm's RD intensity as compared to the estimate if the endogeneity of China investment and the nature of data were not properly accounted.","[Lin, Hui-Lin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Yeh, Ryh-song] Asia Univ, Dept Int Business, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chung, Ching-Fan] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; Asia University Taiwan; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Lin, HL (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",huilin@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,33,15,16,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Different theories offer conflicting predictions regarding how they might affect each other. In the existing empirical literature estimating the trade impact on income convergence, a long-lasting problem is the reverse causality from income convergence to trade. This paper provides a disaggregated bilateral trade data analysis to solve this problem. The results show that the reverse causality from income convergence to trade exists in differentiated product sectors, but not in homogeneous product sectors. Trade in homogeneous sectors reduces the income gaps among trade partners, but it is not significantly affected by their income difference. Therefore, the negative effect of trade in homogeneous sectors on the income gap is free from the reverse causality problem. It can be taken as a pure evidence of trade-induced income convergence. This result is robust to various econometric methods.","Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Kennesaw, GA USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Liu, XP (通讯作者)，Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Kennesaw, GA USA.",xliu6@kennesaw.edu,,,,,,,59,4,4,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The main sources of household income are selling betel-nuts and cigarettes and working in full-time and casual unskilled jobs. Those individuals generating incomes make up 28 per cent of total household members. Of those household members generating incomes, 46.6 per cent are females. Some 50.5 per cent of the respondents did not have existing savings to start their income-generating activities. The average income from informal activities is two times more than the average fortnightly income from casual and full-time employment and 1.5 times more than the national minimum wage. This analysis draws a number of implications from the findings. These include building a traditional marketplace for selling betel-nut, the need for the government to fast track the implementation of development projects in the larger provinces, the need for research to investigate if low-income earners are paid at the minimum wage rate or lower, the need for relevant government departments and non-governmental organisations to conduct community-based short courses in the settlements that focus on appropriate income-generating enterprises, and the need for in-depth study into employment regulations and conditions in Solomon Islands.","[Maebuta, Helen Esther] Univ S Pacific, Ctr Dev Studies, Suva, Fiji",University of the South Pacific,"Maebuta, HE (通讯作者)，Univ S Pacific, Ctr Dev Studies, Suva, Fiji.",,,,,,,,12,11,11,0,2,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

We find that variables measuring external government intervention and loans to insiders and poor credit risk assessment influenced NPL in Turkey. We also show that communication facilities provided to credit managers, credit managers' years of service in the banks and years of experience in the bank of credit managers, were the significant determinants of non-performing loans in Pakistan.","[Aktan, B.] Yasar Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Finance, Bornova 35100, Izmir, Turkey",Yasar University,"Aktan, B (通讯作者)，Yasar Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Finance, Selcuk Yasar Campus, Bornova 35100, Izmir, Turkey.",,"Aktan, Bora/S-6019-2017","Aktan, Bora/0000-0002-1334-3542",,,,,40,1,3,0,11,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

We consider a partnership model where production takes place in teams consisting of two workers. We characterize the steady-state of the matching equilibrium. The constrained efficiency of the matching equilibrium depends on the distribution of talents. The constrained-efficient allocation can always be implemented by a type-specific tax.

The proliferation of the production of composite indicators by all the major international organizations is a clear symptom of their political importance and operational relevance in policy-making. As a consequence, improvements in the way these indicators are constructed and used seem to be a very important research issue from both the theoretical and operational points of view. This article aims at contributing to the improvement of the overall quality of composite indicators (or indexes) by looking at one of their technical weaknesses, that is, the aggregation convention used for their construction. For this aim, we build upon concepts coming from multi-criteria decision analysis, measurement theory and social choice. We start from the analysis of the axiomatic system underlying the mathematical modelling commonly used to construct composite indicators. Then a different methodological framework, based on noncompensatory/nonlinear aggregation rules, is developed. Main features of the proposed approach are: (i) the axiomatic system is made completely explicit and (ii) the sources of technical uncertainty and imprecise assessment are reduced to the minimum possible degree.","[Munda, Giuseppe; Nardo, Michela] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, IPSC, I-21020 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Munda, Giuseppe] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Munda, G (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, IPSC, TP 361, I-21020 Ispra, VA, Italy.",giuseppe.munda@jrc.it,,"munda, giuseppe/0000-0003-3398-2971",,,,,38,164,172,0,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on the assessment of the current situation, and building on the achievements since 2005, the Commission envisages strengthening some of the ongoing initiatives and launching some new initiatives in response to recent challenges. Although the general design of the EU Industrial Policy still remains valid, some challenges remain and some have grown in significance. The added value of industrial policy at EU level is that it complements measures taken by the Member States. It makes it possible to tackle important challenges that either can not, or can only be insufficiently addressed at national level, and hence require action at European level as well. The renewed Lisbon strategy provides a good opportunity to strengthen these interactions, especially as the integrated guidelines adopted by the Council include a guideline on Industrial Policy.","[Opreana, Alin] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,,aopreana@yahoo.com,"Opreana, Alin/I-1178-2016; Opreana, Alin/B-9453-2015",,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,227,232,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS68,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287983800034,0

If an employer's private learning is reflected in a worker's wage and one employer's private information is transmitted to the next when the worker makes a job-to-job transition, then asymmetric employer learning will appear in wage regressions as learning over an employment spell. Extending previous work that assumes all learning takes place publicly, this paper develops wage regressions that test for both asymmetric employer learning and public learning. The empirical results, including tests of alternative explanations, are consistent with asymmetric employer learning's having at least as much of an effect on wages during an employment spell as does public learning. The model developed in this paper illustrates how the story suggested by the empirical work might unfold. It shows that outside firms can profitably compete with a better-informed employer through bidding wars, even when the worker is equally productive in all firms. Furthermore, this competition results in different wages for workers with the same publicly observable characteristics, a result that previous models of asymmetric learning have not produced.","US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA",United States Department of Labor,"Pinkston, JC (通讯作者)，US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA.",,,,,,,,36,54,76,0,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

It aims to discover to what extent inefficiency arises from both quality considerations and external factors beyond the organization's control, or alternatively, how much inefficiency is due to inadequate resource management. As a component of inadequate resource management, we test the existence of political-budgetary cycles in the temporal evolution of inefficiencies. The results show that on the whole there is still a wide margin within which local government efficiency and quality levels could be increased, although it is revealed that a great deal of inefficiency is due to exogenous or noncontrollable factors. In particular, it has been found that the size of the municipality, the per capita tax revenue, the per capita grants and the amount of commercial activity are some of the factors related with local government efficiency.","[Teresa Balaguer-Coll, M.] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Finanzas & Contabilidad, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Prior, Diego] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Balaguer-Coll, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Finanzas & Contabilidad, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",bcoll@uji.es,,"Balaguer-Coll, Maria Teresa/0000-0003-2126-0963; Prior, Diego/0000-0002-4669-2861",,,,,22,62,66,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The study finds the lowest radiative forcing categories to be feasible under full participation, certainly if overshoot of targets is allowed and when bio-energy and carbon-capture-and-storage is added to the mitigation portfolio. In cases with severe delay in participation, the lowest targets become infeasible. For less strict targets (e.g. 3.7 W/m(2)), delayed participation leads to considerable costs increases (up to 90% for the stabilisation case).

It has been established that the volume of supplementary pension saving is insufficient at present in Slovenia to compensate for the deterioration of rights from the first pension pillar. Not only is the participation in the second pillar insufficient but the premia especially are too low. The macroeconomic consequences of introducing fully-funded mandatory pension insurance would not be unfavourable. Increased pension saving reduces current consumption and increases the labour supply of active generations, but also increases the volume of disposable savings, so the increased investment may increase capital stock and production, which leads to an increase in economic growth and potential future consumption. Increased labour supply of insured persons would also lead to a higher volume of contributions for mandatory pension insurance, which would reduce the state pension fund deficit.","[Verbic, Miroslav] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Verbic, Miroslav] Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Verbic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",miroslav.verbic@guest.arnes.si,,"Verbic, Miroslav/0000-0001-5506-0973",,,,,13,5,5,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,3,,,,,373,382,,10.1080/14631370903090681,0.0,,,10,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,596GR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277673700007,0

The fiscal system, with all its implications and functions, could not be made active without the existence of the fiscal body as this represents the engine that makes the fiscal mechanism function. Among all the functions of the fiscal system, it is considered that the control function on the national economy plays a very important role, because of its positive effects and its corrections in the application of the public funds. The control function on the national economy is performed by the Ministry of Public Finance, through the National Agency Of Financial Administration and its territorial units or, as the case might be, by the specialty compartments of the local public administration authority or by other authorities that are qualified, according to the law, to manage/ administer duties, taxes, shares or other sums of money owed to the consolidated general budget. Since the 1st of January 2004, the fiscal activities performed by the Ministry of Public Finances have been regrouped as part of a unique entity, respectively the National Agency of Financial Administration (ANAF), subjected to the Ministry. ANAF's creation aims to guarantee a better fund rising for the state incomes budget. It must allow for a better adaptation to the way of functioning of the fiscal administration to the Romanian society and its evolution in a national and international environment. This reorganization takes part in the reformation process performed by the Romanian Government which aims to modernize the administration authorities. Another target of the fiscal authority modernization is to offer the tax payer quality assistance based on a new relation between the tax payers and the public clerks. Through the present work, the authors want to present a study regarding the positive and the negative aspects which can influence the performing of a quality fiscal inspection, as well as some analysis of essence which can occur as a result of a good quality fiscal inspection.","[Voicu, Dan Mihail] DGFP Arges, Pitesti, Romania",,,danmihail_voicu@yahoo.com; dinescuemilian@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,376,382,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS68,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287983800056,0

Motivated by a passage from the Bible, we will focus on three dimensions of love in our simple economic framework of love from parents to children. The first dimension is related to time, namely, its everlasting nature. In our economic framework, the planning horizon is effectively infinite, incorporating children's concern into the optimization of parents. The second dimension is altruism, which is a care for others with sacrifice. Parents invest their time and money in the future of their children instead of enjoying consumption and leisure for themselves. These efforts by the parents are sacrifices, or costs of producing love for their children. Are there benefits of producing love for their children? The benefits could be tangible or intangible in the form of future support from their children in old age and returned love from their children. However, these future benefits rely on hopes or expectations which may not even materialize eventually. The final dimension of love in our model is a value system of rights and wrongs perceived by the parents and to be transmitted to their children. Without this value system, love will not rejoice with truth and what is produced may become hatred instead of love. Based on simple optimizations of parents and children, a demand-supply framework of love will he developed. Shifts in the demand and supply curves will be used to illustrate changes in the equilibrium of love. A simple empirical study on love among parents and their children will be presented, illustrating how love may be quantified in a simple manner.",,,,,"HO, Kong Weng/H-1139-2015",,,,,,0,0,0,0,3,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-281-557-6,,,,2009,,,,,,,195,208,,,,,,14,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BIS32,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262422300012,0

Some initial evidence from Australia,APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This study statistically analyses the location and distribution of some aspects of mental health in Queensland. The health status measured here is not the conventional 'count' approach, i.e. counting people diagnosed with/without illness, but rather an approach that was developed in the context of mortality, by Silber and subsequently Le Grand. The present context is morbidity. We measure the years lived free of serious mental illness, for people who subsequently contract these illnesses. A complete enumeration dataset (i.e. not a sample), namely, the Queensland hospital admissions dataset commencing in 1964, is available. Specific illness codings are for conditions so consistently serious that hospital admission invariably occurred throughout the 40-year period. The present study is partial, but has two major advantages. First, the measure incorporates the notion that the later in life is the onset of serious mental illness, the better. Second, although age distribution measurement is not possible with 'count' data, it is possible with this approach. Inequality measures, such as the Gini coefficient, are applied to measure the inequality in the distribution. Time series on mental health and mental health inequality, for males and females, are thus generated and statistically analysed.","[Williams, Ruth F.

The serial correlation tests indicate inefficiency in daily returns and borderline efficiency in monthly returns, while the runs tests conclude that both series are weak form inefficient. The unit root tests suggest weak-form inefficiency in both return series. The results of the more stringent and least restrictive variance ratio tests indicate that the monthly returns series is characterized by a homoscedastic random walk, but the daily series violates weak-form efficiency because of the short-term autocorrelation in returns.","[Worthington, Andrew C.] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Higgs, Helen] Griffith Univ, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia",University of Wollongong; Griffith University; Griffith University - Logan Campus,"Worthington, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.",andreww@uow.edu.au,,"Worthington, Andrew/0000-0003-4113-9036",,,,,13,8,13,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This paper develops a model with an endogenously expanding service sector, where the constant flow of workers in and out of employment leads to structural unemployment. The main finding is that the level of unemployment is different between the initial period and the long-run equilibrium growth path, and that along the transition path, the level of unemployment will overshoot its equilibrium level, which can explain the long-run pattern of unemployment in most industrialized countries.","Vienna Univ Econ & BA, WU Wien, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Zagler, M (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & BA, WU Wien, Augasse 2-6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",zagler@wu-wien.ac.at,"Zagler, Martin/C-5677-2016","Zagler, Martin/0000-0003-0863-7375",,,,,26,8,17,0,18,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

The new data confirm the robustness of results previously reported in Baker et al. (2009) to the change in laboratory procedures and incentives. The new data are then used to extend the parameter space in which the two matching mechanisms are studied, including: varying within-round information regarding the current level of public-good allocations and varying group size from four to twenty group members.

Decentralization is efficient. This incentive equivalence is well-known. However, the first-order approach used in virtually all the literature may obscure the fact that no convexity assumptions need be made about technology or tastes. This fact underscores the relevance of incentive equivalence, even when there are scale economies in the public sector. Here, the consequences of positive migration costs for this incentive equivalence are considered. In contrast with much of the literature, migration costs are assumed the same for everyone. This formulation differs from the more common attachment to home assumption of heterogeneous migration costs. Conditional on the direction of migration, interests of different communities are still perfectly aligned. But natives of different communities may prefer different directions of migration, weakening incentive equivalence if local policy makers have the power to induce large changes in migration flows. However, incentive equivalence fails only if economies of scale in population are important, so that communities may be under-populated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We find that workers with higher levels of education have a stronger probability of finding a permanent job. In contrast, low-educated workers have a stronger probability of ending in unemployment or another temporary contract. Furthermore, we show the importance of employment protection in affecting the threshold level above which workers gain access to a permanent contract.","[Casquel, Elena; Cunyat, Antoni] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Casquel, E (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",,"; Cunyat, Antoni/K-9777-2014",", E Casquel ; Elena Casquel; Casquel, E/0009-0005-2809-1076; Cunyat, Antoni/0000-0001-8670-7901",,,,,21,2,2,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

We use panel data to analyze how individuals portfolio allocation between risky and riskless assets varies in response to changes in total financial wealth. We find the elasticity of the risky asset share to wealth to be small and statistically insignificant, supporting the CRRA assumption; this finding is robust when the sample is restricted to households experiencing large income variations. In addition, we find a small but significant negative correlation between wealth and risk aversion.

Empirical evidence based on multiple data sources fails to validate the arrival of the Lewis turning point in China, showing continuous and coordinated wage growth across rural and urban sectors instead. Consistent with the neoclassical view, we find that rural workers expanded off-farm work when mobility restrictions were lifted, interprovincial migration responded to expected earnings and local employment conditions, and returns to education converged gradually to the international standard. These findings suggest major progresses in the integration of labor markets in China. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, I examine whether differences in asthma diagnosis can be attributed to differences in breastfeeding incidence and duration. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Survey, I examine whether unobserved heterogeneity in the breastfeeding decision plays a role in childhood asthma propensity. I use the recursive bivariate probit framework to account for potential endogeneity by modeling the breastfeeding and asthma equations jointly. Results indicate that after accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity found in infant feeding practices, breastfeeding leads to lower rates of asthma diagnosis in children at age one. Breastfeeding for at least 3 months appears to have the strongest effects in children diagnosed at age one. However, there are no discernible effects of breastfeeding on the incidence of asthma by age three. These results indicate that breastfeeding can result in lower rates of wheezing and better respiratory health in small children.","Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI 53726 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Green, T (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, 610 Walnut St,707 WARF, Madison, WI 53726 USA.",tlgreen2@wisc.edu,,,,,,,55,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

While Wisconsin economists made notable contributions to both the theory and practice of public finance in the United States during this period, we conclude that the failure to develop a particularly Wisconsin Institutionalist version was due to (1) the absence of a dominant proponent/advocate during a pivotal time, (2) the necessity to differentiate graduate programs, (3) the number of competing subject areas providing contemporary economics problems to study, and (4) the co-opting of the department of economics at Wisconsin to serve Commons's labor research program.","Univ Wisconsin, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Johnson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA.",,"Johnson, Marianne/CAF-5068-2022",,,,,,46,4,6,0,8,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for governments to publicly fund transport infrastructures given the current economic uncertainty. Revenues from road tolls are thus an important financial source for road investment and management. Financial sustainability in an era of scarce financial resources requires authorities or concessions (under some form of Public-Private Partnership) to adopt some form of maximization of potential toll revenues as well as to benefit the national economy. The role of technology is often overlooked as it can affect financial and economic viability of road infrastructure investment. This paper explores the role and impact of technology such as GNSS and DSRC on cost-benefit outcomes.

However, emerging Asia's local currency bond markets remain generally segmented, being neither regionally nor globally integrated. There are potential benefits from increased regional integration of financial markets. Financial integration at the regional level allows for the region's economies to benefit from allocation efficiency and risk diversification.

Because the diminishing returns to labor are less pronounced, high labor intensity (as in rice production) leads not only to a larger population density but also to lower output per capita and a larger share of labor in agriculture. Agronomic and historical evidence confirm that there are distinct, inherent differences between rice and wheat production. A calibration of the model shows that a relatively small difference in labor intensity in agriculture can account for a large portion of the observed differences in industrialization, output per capita, and labor productivity between Asia and Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution. Significantly, these differences can be explained even though sector-level total factor productivity levels and the efficiency of factor markets are held constant in the two regions.","Univ Houston, 201C McElhinney Hall, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Vollrath, D (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, 201C McElhinney Hall, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",,,"Vollrath, Dietrich/0000-0003-2532-2009",,,,,77,40,44,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

One important aim of micro-econometric studies is to uncover stylized facts that hold over space and time, and that can both inspire theoretical models that are based on realistic assumptions, and inform policy debates in an evidence-based way. Which results from the thousands of empirical estimates reported in the literature on the micro-econometrics of international firm activities do we consider as convincing? Based on my own experience from the last twenty years I use the opportunity of this paper to make twelve recommendations that, hopefully, will help to find the right way on the thorny road from estimation results to stylized facts. I will deal with the following topics: comparisons of means vs. comparisons of distributions; extremely different firms, or outliers; unobserved heterogeneity; simultaneous occurrence of differences across quantiles, outliers, and unobserved heterogeneity; heterogeneous effects of international firm activities on firm performance; replication; within-study replication by international research teams; meta-analysis; and talking to practitioners.","[Wagner, Joachim] Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Bonn, Germany; [Wagner, Joachim] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Wagner, J (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Bonn, Germany.",wagner@leuphana.de,"Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020; Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536",,,,,56,19,20,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2011,159.0,4,,,,,389,412,,10.1007/s10645-011-9167-4,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,890KN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300143600002,0

When fertility returned to its original level, agriculturalists were more numerous, more poorly nourished, and worked longer hours than their hunter-gatherer ancestors. We develop a dynamic price-theoretic model that rationalizes these events. In the short run, people are lured into agriculture by the increased labor productivity of both adults and children. In the long run, the growth in population overrides the productivity gains, and the later generations of agriculturalists end up being worse-off than the hunter-gatherers. Counter-intuitively, the increase in the labor productivity of children causes the long-run reduction in welfare. In the long run, the increase in adult labor productivity only contributes to population growth. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

First and foremost, we develop a theoretical framework in which sequestration and permit-trading markets are analyzed jointly in the context of a competitive fringe model. Our framework formalizes the linkage between regulatory policy changes (as they manifest themselves in the permit market) and subsequent equilibrium allocations in the sequestration market. Second, we perform a numerical analysis demonstrating the role market structure. or market power, might play in the determination of the equilibrium sequestration allocation and carbon price. Both our analytical and numerical results demonstrate the importance of incorporating into empirical supply-side models demand-side information that is reflective of an underlying market structure.

Unlike traditional regional trade agreements, by lowing tariffs on participant's low carbon emission goods and setting penalties on outsiders to force them to join such agreements, carbon motivated regional trade agreements reflect an effective merging of trade and climate change regimes, and are rising in profile as part of the post 2012 Copenhagen UNFCC negotiation. By adding country energy extraction cost functions, we develop a multi-region general equilibrium structure with endogenously determined energy supply. We calibrate our model to business as usual scenarios for the period 2006-2036. Our results show that carbon motivated regional agreements can reduce global emissions, but the effect is very small and even with penalty mechanisms used, the effects are still small. This supports the basic idea in our previous policy paper that trade policy is likely to be a relatively minor consideration in climate change containment.

The Qu and Perron (2007) and the Bai and Perron (1998, 2003a and 2003b) methods identify different periods across the sample. Evidence of a diminishing effect of oil price shocks on GDP growth and on inflation is found from the 1970s until the mid 1980s. However, in contrast with previous literature, we find a renewed effect on both these macroeconomic variables after the mid 80s. In Spain, it recovers some of its initial importance in the second half of the 1990s for GDP and between 1986 and 1994 and the 2000s for inflation. In the regions, the influence of oil price shocks on the GDP progressively disappears while the impact on inflation decreases from 1986 onwards but becomes significant again ten years later. The most outstanding result is that oil price movements explain at least some of the recent inflation. Therefore, policy measures to control the economic impact of oil shocks should be implemented in the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, procedures based on dummy variables are proposed to detect structural breaks, types and sizes of jumps caused by such events. Then we propose to apply a hierarchical CMS (Constant Market Share) model to all sub-periods determined by the detected change points to study the short- and long-term impact of those events on growth causes. Application to China-Germany trade in agri-food products shows that China's accession to WTO had a negative short-term impact on corresponding series. But its long-term impact on China's export competitiveness was clearly positive. The short-term impact of the EU's CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) reform on Germany's exports to China was also negative. Its long-term impact on export competitiveness was sometimes positive and sometimes negative. The financial crisis of 2008 caused a significant reduction of China's agri-food exports to Germany.

To address it, most papers define regions on the base of normative/administrative criteria, although some consider that it could lead to misleading conclusions. In view of that, this article explores, over the period 1995-2006, the per capita income distribution of two sets of European regions: administrative (NUTS2) and functional (Metropolitan) regions. From a methodological point of view, a distribution dynamics approach examining the external shape and movements within these distributions - is applied to analyse the issue of convergence. The study does reveal the presence of a process of convergence across both types of regions: however, this seems to be more rapid with Metropolitan than NUTS2 regions, which prompt us to proposing some relative major changes in the EU regional policy.

Most policies favoured the continuation and deepening of reform; but some were contradictory or even led to regression in the reform process. How have the rural reforms affected China's agricultural production over the past three decades; and what lessons can be learned to aid the future course of reform? To answer these questions, this study estimates productivity change in China's agriculture and evaluates the effects of policy on agricultural output during the reform period. Aggregated provincial-level data for the 1979-2008 period are used in a translog production frontier model to estimate indices of total factor productivity (TFP) change and its three components-technical change, technical efficiency change, and a scale effect-with a focus on explaining the variation in technical efficiency. The estimation results show that the impressive improvement of TFP change is dominated by the technical change component. However, technical efficiency change and scale effects have worked against the improvement in TFP change in most periods. To improve technical efficiency, social welfare policies designed to eliminate the rural-urban divide, and reform polices focusing on factor market reforms, such as reform of the household registration system (hukou) and reform of land rights, seem to hold some potential.","[Zhang, Yanjie] Univ Gottingen, Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany; [Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth Developing &, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Zhang, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany.",,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009","Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346",,,,,33,21,23,1,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

The latter is conceptualized in terms of three general stages: prime movers or drivers of change, change processes, and change attractors. Furthermore, any real-world firm is both a technical and an institutional unit. To emphasize the importance of real firm analysis, the discussion presented here revolves around an understanding of the much considered case of General Motors and Fisher Body integration has developed over time. Generalization from this case suggests that an integrated view of the firm is necessary that combines the three stages and the two bases (technical and institutional). Six general perspectives on the firm are identified as having technical or institutional bases that are relevant in each of the three stages. This integrated approach to the firm is explored in terms of the general topic of firm development. It is concluded that, without an integrated approach to firm development, a potentially biased or incomplete analysis can result.","[Krafft, Jackie] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, CNRS, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Dietrich, Michael] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; University of Sheffield,"Krafft, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, CNRS, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",m.dietrich@sheffield.ac.uk; Jackie.Krafft@gredeg.cnrs.fr,"krafft, jackie/J-6278-2012","KRAFFT, Jackie/0000-0002-8011-9866",,,,,64,2,3,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The basic idea is to relate announcement and decision abnormal returns. Under a set of four maintained assumptions, merger control might be interpreted to be effective if rents accruing due to the increased market power observed around the merger announcement are reversed by the antitrust decision, i.e. if there is a negative relation between announcement and decision abnormal returns. To clearly identify the events' competitive effects, we explicitly control for the market expectation about the outcome of the merger control procedure and run several robustness checks to assess the role of our maintained assumptions. We find that only outright prohibitions completely reverse the rents measured around a merger's announcement. On average, remedies seem to be only partially capable of reverting announcement abnormal returns. Yet they seem to be more effective when applied during the first rather than the second investigation phase and in subsamples where our assumptions are more likely to hold. Moreover, the European Commission appears to learn over time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The model inspires from stylised facts on developing and Euro-Mediteranean countries where family plays a central role in risk insurance. The rational is emphasised by lower costs compared to private and public insurance systems. Given an initial distribution of the informally employed individuals, the model captures the effects of social security decisions and anticipated bequests on the preference of the agents for formal or informal employment. The impact of fiscal policies on the distribution of employment to formal and informal categories is analysed through the political competition.

We address these questions in the context of high-stakes poker tournaments in which the last few players often negotiate the division of the remaining prize money rather than risk playing the tournament to the end. In 63% of the tournaments in our sample players enter into negotiations, and in 31%, they successfully reach an agreement. We find that the identity of the player who initiates bargaining affects whether a deal is completed but does not affect the terms of the eventual deal. The initiator tends to have a weaker than average position at the table, but the likelihood that a deal will be completed increases in the initiator's strength in the game and history of winning past tournaments. These findings indicate that initiating negotiations conveys information that is relevant to whether a deal will emerge. Nevertheless, initiating bargaining does not affect the initiator's pay-off in a completed deal. Lastly, we find strong evidence that bargaining tends to be initiated and is more likely to be successful when participants' stakes are about equal, consistent with the theoretical work of Cramton, Gibbons and Klemperer (1987, Dissolving a Partnership Efficiently, Econometrica, 55, 615-632).","[Goldreich, David; Pomorski, Lukasz] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Goldreich, D (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,40,3,5,2,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Buchanan; Nobel prize,CHOICE,"Winner of the Nobel Prize in 1986, James M. Buchanan has been one of the pioneers and founders of Public Choice theory and Constitutional Economics. The key to Buchanan's work lies in his deep-rooted devotion to the notions of voluntary exchange, self-determination, individualism, nondiscrimination, and absence of coercion. In this, Buchanan is a rather unique figure within his peer group of Nobel Laureates. This paper provides a short biographical sketch, highlights Buchanan's lasting achievements, defines and analyzes the overlaps of his work with the writings of other Nobel Laureates, such as Paul A. Samuelson, Kenneth J. Arrow, Friedrich A. Hayek, Milton Friedman, George Stigler, Gary Becker, Ronald Coase, Douglass North, Vernon Smith, Elinor Ostrom, Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott. The paper also looks at the future of economics as an academic discipline in general. Future research would greatly benefit from an attitude inspired by the Scottish Enlightenment, focusing on empirical observation and practical reason, concentrating on rules and institutions, looking more at exchange relationships than at pure allocational choice, and opening up to heterodox approaches and interdisciplinary research.

We estimate a spatial model of consumer demand for retail bank deposits that explicitly accounts for consumer disutility from distance traveled. This is important given the substantial changes in banks' branch networks observed in the data. Our model indicates that cross-price elasticities between banks whose branches are close to consumers ('close' banks) are larger than those between 'far' banks and more than double the cross-price elasticity of 'close' banks with respect to 'far' banks. We distinguish between thrifts and other banks and find that within-thrift competitive effects are stronger than within-bank effects or those between thrifts and banks. We use our estimates to predict the effect of changes in market structure on consumer welfare following the branching deregulation of the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994. Our results indicate that the median household gained around $60 per year from the changes. Approximately two thirds of the gains come from within-market changes in market structure. The gains were greater in markets with high initial numbers of banks than elsewhere. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We characterize the conditions under which the reputation force alone induces a central bank to behave in a socially optimal way. When these conditions fail, an incentive contract is invoked, whose cost is significantly reduced by the presence of the reputation force. The contract poses a penalty threat that is a concave function of wage growth, which in equilibrium is tied to expected rather than realized inflation, with a global maximum that provides the least upper bound on all threatened penalties. This bound can be used as a uniform penalty threat to achieve optimal economic outcomes and still, for moderate to large shocks, its magnitude can be much smaller than the size of the transfers required by the standard contracts that are linear functions of realized inflation rates. Further, under both the concave and the uniform penalty threats, the central bank will behave in the socially optimal way and no transfer is materialized in equilibrium.

The overall welfare gains from such programs are likely to be large, but when women obtain access to services only through marriage, some of these gains may be partially offset by changes in their bargaining power and in the dowries that they pay their husbands. I examine these marriage market effects using a family planning and health services program in rural Bangladesh, finding that compared to women without program access, women in the treatment area are 35% less likely to be able to make purchases without permission from their husbands or another household member. Moreover, a difference-in-difference specification confirms that women pay 14% higher dowries in order to obtain husbands with access to the program. The fact that adjustments are made both before and within marriage suggests that marital contracts in rural Bangladesh are negotiated along multiple margins.","Metropolitan State Coll, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80217 USA",,"Peters, C (通讯作者)，Metropolitan State Coll, Dept Econ, Campus Box 77,POB 173362, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",cpeter80@mscd.edu,"Peters, Christina/K-9327-2019","Peters, Christina/0000-0001-9854-8573",,,,,27,11,13,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We find that the difficulties faced by mothers in finding appropriate child care in terms of both cost and quality hinder them from returning to the labour market following childbirth. Maternity leave entitlements lead to an earlier return to the labour market following the birth of a child, relative to those who have no leave rights at all. Mothers with higher wages in their pre-birth employment and mothers with higher education levels tend to return to the labour market earlier than their lower wage and less educated counterparts. More flexible pre-birth jobs are associated with an increase in the likelihood of mothers returning to the workforce earlier than the average. Household wealth, however, seems to play a facilitating role in mothers taking a longer period of maternity leave to look after the newborn child. That is, mothers who have higher wealth levels can 'afford' to stay on maternity leave longer, to look after their children better during their primary developmental months. We believe that this article provides useful insights into the employment transitions of Australian mothers after having a baby.","[Ulker, Aydogan; Guven, Cahit] Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Ulker, A (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",ulker@deakin.edu.au,,"Guven, Cahit/0000-0001-8346-772X",,,,,36,14,17,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

It offers four major findings. First, the stock and oil futures prices are inter-related. Their correlation follows a time-varying dynamic process and tends to increase when the markets are more volatile. Second, conditioned on the past information, the volatility in each market is very persistent, i.e., it varies in a predictable manner. Third, there is inter-market dependence in volatility. Innovations that hit either market can affect the volatility in the other market. In other words, conditioned on the persistence and the past volatility in their respective markets, the past volatility of the stock (oil futures) market also has predictive power over the future volatility of the oil futures (stock) market. Finally, the model produces more accurate Value-at-Risk estimates than other benchmarks commonly used in the financial industry. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The reduced-form approach is generalized to include a constant elasticity of variance (CEV) process for equity price prior to default. In order to approximate the CEV process while taking into account stochastic interest rate and the correlation between stock price and interest rate.! first propose a transform that is uncorrelated with interest rate, and then construct a new lattice method which can ensure the validity of branching probabilities for all nodes. The lattice framework performs properly when it is used to value European call options. Based on the empirical results in Duffie et al. (J. Fin. Econ. 83(3): 635-665, 2007) and Jankowitsch et al. (J. Bank Fin. 32(7): 1269-1285, 2008), a novel default intensity process is constructed which is specified as a function of time, stock price, and interest rate. When valuing the asset swaps, the counterparty risk is taken into consideration. Based on the results of the numerical experiments, the impacts of different parameters on the prices of CBs and CBASs are explained. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The risk-sharing mechanism central to the model permits, but does not force, agents to be fully insured. Structural parameters are estimated using a maximum-likelihood procedure on US data. Formal hypothesis tests reveal that the data favor a model in which agents only partially insure each other against employment risk. The results also show that limited risk sharing helps the model capture many salient properties of the business cycle that a restricted version with full insurance fails to explain.

Previous studies on the subject have been hampered by inadequate measures of teacher training and difficulties in addressing the non-random selection of teachers to students and of teachers to training. We address these issues by estimating models that include detailed measures of pre-service and in-service training, a rich set of time-varying covariates, and student, teacher, and school fixed effects. We find that elementary and middle school teacher productivity increases with experience (informal on-the-job training). The largest gains from experience occur in the first few years, but we find continuing gains beyond the first five years of a teacher's career. In contrast, we do not find a consistent relationship between formal professional development training and teacher productivity. However, this may be partly driven by estimation issues as we find more significant positive effects of formal training in the subject-grade combination where estimates should be most precise (middle school math). There is no evidence that teachers' pre-service (undergraduate) training or college entrance exam scores are related to productivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Using unique data from small-and medium-sized establishments, our empirical analysis provides strong evidence that learning indeed plays a crucial role in the functioning of works councils. First, the probability of an adversarial relationship between management and works council is decreasing in the age of the council. Second, the council's age is positively associated with the probability that the council has an influence even on decisions where it has no legal powers. Third, productivity is increasing in the age of the council. Fourth, the quit rate is decreasing in the age of the council.

Offshore banks can be encouraged to comply with rigorous monitoring of an investor's identity and the origin of his/her funds when pressure creates a sufficiently high risk of reputational harm to the investor. We show that such pressure policies harm both offshore and onshore investors and can benefit both the bank industry and tax administrations. We show that social optimal pressure policies are dichotomous decisions between no pressure at all and a pressure great enough to persuade offshore banks to comply. The delegation of pressure policies to onshore tax institutions may be inefficient. Deeper financial integration fosters compliance by the offshore center. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

They did not predict that the financial crisis would happen; and when it did, they understated its effects. Monetary authorities allowed bubbles to grow and focused on keeping inflation low, partly because the standard models suggested that low inflation was necessary and almost sufficient for efficiency and growth. After the crisis broke, policymakers relying on the models floundered. Notwithstanding the diversity of macroeconomics, the sum of these failures points to the need for a fundamental re-examination of the models-and a reassertion of the lessons of modern general equilibrium theory that were seemingly forgotten in the years leading up to the crisis. This paper first describes the failures of the standard models in broad terms, and then develops the economics of deep downturns, and shows that such downturns are endogenous. Further, the paper argues that there have been systemic changes to the structure of the economy that made the economy more vulnerable to crisis, contrary to what the standard models argued. Finally, the paper contrasts the policy implications of our framework with those of the standard models.","Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Stiglitz, JE (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jes322@columbia.edu,,,,,,,181,111,125,1,101,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The foreign firm from a developed country decides where to locate afterwards with complete information about its own damage. Results show that the developing country can be better off encouraging FDI if and only if the marginal damage of pollution is sufficiently low. The optimal level of pollution taxes attracting FDI is higher than the marginal damage of pollution.

The model follows the standard two-stage budget optimisation of the consumer by first optimising between domestically produced and imported goods and, then, by country of origin. A panel data econometric framework is used here with dynamic adjustment to capture both the long and short term elasticities for the studied six aggregated sectors in Europe. The estimated long-term elasticities are in line with the literature, but higher than those used in the GEM-E3 model.

We consider the extent to which the impacts of energy price shocks depend upon the economy's internal production structure and its access to the world financial market. We find that the effect on the long-run growth rate depends heavily on the former and is independent of the latter. The effect of accessibility to the world financial market on long-run welfare depends heavily on the elasticity of substitution in production. We supplement the formal analysis with numerical simulations, thereby enabling us to characterize the short-run dynamics. Overall, the simulations can replicate much of the empirical evidence used to characterize the effects of the recent oil price increases on the economy. They also highlight the sensitivity of the effect of the energy price to the elasticity of substitution.","[Turnovsky, Stephen J.] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Schubert, Stefan F.] Free Univ Bozen, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Turnovsky, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Box 353330, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",sturn@u.washington.edu,,,,,,,29,6,7,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

However, history is replete with examples of spinoffs that were launched to continue with old ideas that their parents were in the process of abandoning. We develop a model of technology choice in which spinoffs may form to implement new or old technologies. A team of managers engaged in production using technology x, is considering switching to technology y. The value of y is not known and disagreements may emerge among team members. Managers who develop sufficiently strong disagreements with their colleagues choose to form new companies to implement their preferred strategy. Two distinct classes of spinoffs arise. In the first, a spinoff forms when an employee comes to believe it is worth adopting y but the firm does not. In the second, a spinoff arises when an employee sufficiently disagrees with the firm's decision to adopt y that he is willing to invest in order to continue with x. We explore the implications of the model for the comparative dynamics of spinoff formation, and the performance of firms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

First, by exposing the non-computational content of classical mathematics, and its foundations, it is shown that both set theory and the tertium non datur can be dispensed with, as foundational concepts. Next, then, as a natural sequel, it follows that every kind of economic theory that bases its theoretical underpinning on classical mathematics can be freed from these foundations and can be made naturally algorithmic. This will make the subject face, in an all pervasive way, absolutely (algorithmically) undecidable decision problems. The thrust of the path towards an algorithmic revolution in economics lies, then, in pointing out that only a radically new mathematical vision of microeconomics, macroeconomics, behavioural economics, game theory, dynamical systems theory and probability theory can lead us towards making economic theory a meaningfully applied science and free of mysticism and subjectivism.","Univ Trent, I-38100 Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Velupillai, KV (通讯作者)，Univ Trent, I-38100 Trento, Italy.",,,,,,,,78,6,6,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,,,J ECON SURV,J.

In contrast, the second takes full account of these holding gains and losses on assets in corporations' returns. The analysis highlights in particular the effects on profitability measures of the huge variations in asset prices observed in recent years in the two countries.

The acceptance or rejection of a proposal is determined by an acceptance rule represented by the collection of decisive coalitions. The focus of the paper is on the asymptotic behavior of subgame perfect equilibria in stationary strategies as the players become infinitely patient. We show that, along any sequence of stationary subgame perfect equilibria the social acceptance set collapses to a point. This point, called the limit of bargaining equilibria, is independent of the sequence of equilibria and is uniquely determined by the set of players, the utility functions, the recognition probabilities, and the acceptance rule. The central result of the paper is a characterization of the limit of bargaining equilibria as a unique zero of the characteristic equation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Overall, the paper advocates a Keynesian view of the NAIRU, where effective demand determines unemployment in the short run and the deviation of actual unemployment from the NAIRU determines the change in inflation.

This paper examines the relationship between returns to higher education and college quality in China. We find that returns to higher education vary significantly depending on school quality. In addition, we find that the relationship between earnings and school quality is stronger for cohorts of workers that have entered the workforce more recently. This finding may result from the fact that as the transition toward a market system progresses in China, the wage system becomes increasingly responsive to key components of human capital. We also find that the earning gap between graduates from lower-quality colleges and those from vocational/technical schools decreases over time. Our results may help to inform individual decision-making on investment in education, effective expansion of the higher education system, and efficient resource allocation across different levels of the education system.

Various studies have started to estimate and compute the role of the different tourism sectors' contributions to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These estimations have been made from a sectoral perspective, assessing the contribution of air transport, the accommodation sector, or other tourism-related economic sectors. However, in order to evaluate the impact of this sector on energy use the approaches used in the literature consider tourism in its disaggregated way. This paper assesses the electricity demand pattern and investigates the aggregated contribution of tourism to electricity consumption using the case study of the Balearic Islands (Spain). Using a conventional daily electricity demand model, including data for daily stocks of tourists the impact of the different population growth rate scenarios on electricity loads is also investigated. The results show that, in terms of electricity consumption, tourism cannot be considered a very energy-intensive sector. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a model in which firms post job offers characterized by an hours requirement and workers pay search costs to find jobs. We present evidence supporting three predictions of this model by analyzing bunching at kinks using Danish tax records. First, larger kinks generate larger taxable income elasticities. Second, kinks that apply to a larger group of workers generate larger elasticities. Third, the distribution of job offers is tailored to match workers' aggregate tax preferences in equilibrium. Our results suggest that macro elasticities may be substantially larger than the estimates obtained using standard microeconometric methods.","[Chetty, Raj] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University,"Chetty, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,"NIA NIH HHS [P30 AG012810, P30 AG012810-18] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,41,285,405,6,62,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

In particular, it is established that an increase in the average degree of product diversification in an industry increases the incentive for a producer to reduce the time to market for innovations at the expense of product quality. However, if all firms adapt their strategies according to these incentives, this results in a severe loss of average firm profits in the industry and also to a reduction in consumer surplus. It is then studied how the strength of this dilemma depends on several parameters describing the market structure and patent policy.","[Dawid, Herbert] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Business Adm & Econ, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; [Dawid, Herbert] Univ Bielefeld, Inst Math Econ, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; [Reimann, Marc] Graz Univ, Inst Stat & Operat Res, Graz, Austria",University of Bielefeld; University of Bielefeld; University of Graz,"Dawid, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Dept Business Adm & Econ, POB 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",hdawid@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de,"Dawid, Herbert/K-8627-2012","Dawid, Herbert/0000-0002-8536-9960",,,,,40,8,9,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

However, if the private firm acts first, it moves aggressively to locate at the middle point (one-half), forcing the public firm to locate nearer the periphery (one-sixth), to minimize consumers' transportation cost.

The economy of Bangladesh, having spectacular output growth and rising energy demand as well as energy efficiency in recent decades, can be an ideal case for examining energy-output dynamics. We find that while fluctuations in energy consumption do not affect output fluctuations, movements in output inversely affect movements in energy use. The results of Granger causality tests in this respect are consistent with those of innovative accounting that includes variance decompositions and impulse responses. Autoregressive distributed lag models also suggest a role of output in Bangladesh's energy use.

It finds that local community benefits from more intense interaction with the local religious leaders of Islamic boarding schools (Pesantren) than does the external community. But the direct benefit of living close to Pesantren only matters for religious participation, not for earnings. However, the study finds that religiosity is more positively significant for earnings of the community surrounding the Pesantren, probably due to networking effects. Hence, community involvement of religious leaders can indirectly and positively affect earnings of the surrounding community. The overall results suggest that Pesantren contribute to the formation of social capital, particularly in the form of religiosity, which contribute to the improved welfare of the surrounding community.

According to the predictions of our calibrated model, the dispersion of rental prices across low- and high-wage MSAs should be larger than we observe: High-wage MSAs like San Francisco are puzzlingly inexpensive relative to low-wage MSAs like Pittsburgh.

The simplest example of household formation is the case in which pairs of individuals engage themselves in a bargaining process on the division of some wealth: if an agreement on the distribution is (not) reached, we can say that the household is (not) formed. The vast majority of existing bargaining models predicts agreements on an efficient outcome. A seminal paper by Crawford (Econometrica 50:607-637, 1982) describes a very simple game with incomplete information in which, even with rational agents, disagreement causes welfare losses. We embed that model in a general equilibrium framework and present some results on equilibria both in the bargaining game and the associated exchange economy. Crawford's results support Schelling's intuition on the reasons of disagreement: it may arise if players' commitments are reversible. Crawford shows that high probabilities of reversibility tend to favor the bargaining impasse, in fact with low probability. We prove that even if those probabilities are arbitrarily close to zero, disagreement is an equilibrium outcome, with high probability. That conclusion seems to be an even stronger support to Schelling's original viewpoint. In the exchange economy model with that noncooperative bargaining game as a first stage, we present significant examples of economies for which equilibria exist. Because of disagreement, Pareto suboptimal exchange economy equilibria exist for all elements in the utility function and endowment spaces and they may coexist with Pareto optimal equilibria even at the same competitive prices.","[Gori, Michele; Villanacci, Antonio] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Matemat Decisioni, I-50134 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Villanacci, A (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dipartimento Matemat Decisioni, Via Lombroso 6-17, I-50134 Florence, Italy.",michele.gori@unifi.it; antonio.villanacci@unifi.it,,"Gori, Michele/0000-0003-3274-041X; VILLANACCI, ANTONIO/0000-0002-0309-4618",,,,,17,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Unlike prior research in this genre, this study assesses the relative impacts of economic education scholarship by examining published research in (strictly) economic education journals. In order to do so, we use the Harzing database of citations to articles published in (strictly) economic education journals from 1990 to the present. Supporting some of the measures found in prior research, we find that the Journal of Economic Education (JEE) is unambiguously the dominant source of influential scholarship in the field of economic education. Interestingly, the JEE's closest competitors among active economic education journals are the International Review of Economics Education and Computers in Higher Education Economics Research, both of which are published under the auspices of the Economics Network, which is located in the UK.

Reaching the optimal solution is simply a matter of having government adjust the price of unwanted behavior through punishments or fines. But Adam Smith highlighted the importance of another type of constraint, the internal moral constraint. In recent years behavioral, experimental, and other economists have documented that people often do not act according the assumptions of the homo economicus model and instead appear to incorporate moral constraints into their decision making process. In light of this growing body of research, this article argues that many economists have placed too much emphasis on external constraints and that more emphasis should be placed on internal moral constraints. After discussing possible sources of internal moral constraints, the paper describes how these constraints can help strengthen cooperation in the short and long run. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

First, requiring settlement with money can induce market trades that generate information-revealing prices to discipline the intermediary. Second, it is optimal for the intermediary to issue money that can record its own history of being used in settlements, and to require that settlements be made with only money that has been returned to the intermediary every settlement period.

It is shown that, when a public firm's union is prohibited from collective bargaining, the firm is more competitive, and the degree of differentiation is less.

We show that the game has a unique subgame perfect equilibrium in which the firm always moves first in the wage bargaining game. The equilibrium wage is, therefore, unique. In the second example, we examine a two-part-tariff alternating offers bargaining protocol, where the parties bargain over the wage and transfer payments. We show that this bargaining protocol has a Pareto efficient, unique subgame perfect equilibrium. Thus, although the parties do not bargain over the level of employment, the outcome under this protocol is, nevertheless, socially optimal. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

But their notions of malinvestment, structural tensions, and development blocks provided an original explanation of the turning points in the business cycle.

We consider a large population that interacts as specified by a random network with a given degree distribution. Motivated by the complexity of the induced network, we assume that the only precise information agents have is local; that is, it is restricted to their immediate neighborhood. Each agent chooses an investment level, which, in turn, imposes a payoff externality on his or her neighbors that is captured by a (local) Cobb-Douglas production/payoff function. We find that, in the unique interior equilibrium, the induced externality is positive or negative, depending on whether investment costs are, respectively, above or below a certain threshold. This also has implications for the nature of the equilibrium strategy, which is increasing in the degree, in the first case, and decreasing in the second. Finally, we also characterize how the equilibrium changes when the network topology varies and becomes more connected, or when its degree distribution becomes more polarized.","[Galeotti, Andrea] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Vega-Redondo, Fernando] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Vega-Redondo, Fernando] Inst Valenciano Invest Econ, Valencia, Spain",University of Essex; European University Institute,"Galeotti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",fvega@eui.eu,,,,,,,32,10,11,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

This process, initiated by Boris Yeltsin, was furthered by his successor: Vladimir Putin devoted his two terms as president to reforming the party system so as to block free political competition and keep the opposition from playing an institutional role. The goal of an authoritarian modernization of the country was not achieved by the end of Putin's second term; indeed, it is ever farther away. Once installed as president, Dmitry Medvedev sternly criticized the legacy bequeathed by his predecessor for its chronic backwardness and corruption, its primitive economy dependent on exporting raw materials and its ineffective system of governance. He declared that his presidency would conduct an in-depth modernization of Russia based, for the first time ever, on democratic values and institutions. He failed, however, to recognize that political modernization was a precondition for this.

For this purpose, the paper develops and evaluates a model that is distinguished by its use of the Eaton-Kortum framework to explain intra-industry trade instead of the usual Armington assumption. It is found that the magnitudes and in many cases signs of the effects of capital stock and technology on specialization are very country-specific. This implies that the regression studies that estimate cross-country average effects have limited value. Looking at the volume of trade, the paper finds that capital endowments and industry-level comparative advantages have little effect on the volume of trade the reduced inter-industry trade between more similar countries is compensated by increased intra-industry trade.

COOPER; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; INDUSTRY; PRODUCTIVITY; MODELS,"This study discusses a new DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) approach to measure the unified (operational and environmental) efficiency of energy firms. It is widely known that they produce not only desirable (good) outputs (e.g., electricity) but also undesirable (bad) outputs (e.g., CO2) as a result of their plant operations. The proposed approach incorporates an output separation (desirable and undesirable outputs) for the performance evaluation of energy firms. In addition to the output separation, this study separates inputs into energy and non-energy inputs. Consequently, the proposed approach incorporates not only the output separation but also the input separation within a computational framework of DEA non-radial measurement. This study compares the proposed approach with other previous DEA approaches used for the performance evaluation of energy firms. After the methodological comparison, this study applies the proposed approach for measuring the unified efficiency of Japanese fossil fuel power generation. This empirical study confirms that the implementation of Kyoto Protocol (2005) has not been effective on the unified efficiency of Japanese fossil fuel power generation during the observed period (2004-2008). Although the empirical result is inconsistent with the current Japanese environmental policy under Kyoto Protocol, it contains policy implications for guiding the future direction of Japanese environmental policy on the electric power industry.

At the same time wind energy impacts both, the utilization of thermal power plants and the market prices. While the market prices tend to decrease, the impact on the utilization of different plant types is at the outset unclear. To analyze the incentives to invest in thermal power plants under increased wind energy supply, we develop a computational model which includes ramping restrictions and costs and apply it to the German case. We find that due to current wind supply the market prices are reduced by more than five percent, and the incentives to invest in natural gas fired units are largely reduced. An increased wind supply erodes their attractiveness further. Consequently, a gap between the need for and the incentive to provide flexibility can be expected. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Firm level incentives for producing high quality can be achieved with an informal enforcement mechanism, reputation, the efficacy of which is enhanced by consumers investing in connectedness: or with a formal mechanism, legal enforcement, the effectiveness of which can be reduced by means of bribes. We show that formal and informal enforcement mechanisms do not necessarily substitute each other: while high levels of judicial efficiency decrease consumers' incentives to connect, higher consumers' connectedness leads to higher levels of judicial efficiency. We then look at how the equilibrium institutional mix evolves with the level of development. In doing so we show the presence of a new, physical, channel that can affect institutions-i.e. the frequency of bad productivity shocks that, in less developed settings, can impact on firms' incentives to cheat.

In this regard, the new e-trade hub function for the SCPS (Supply Chain Payment System) gateway, which is an electronic trade settlement system based on the purchasing card, should replace the current trade settlement methods in trading, such as L/C and T/T. As the number of banks and e-Marketplaces increases, SCPS is a solution adopted by banks and financial institutions which requires transactions to take place through a gateway by connecting banks, customers, and e-Marketplaces. SCPS is a model of a purchasing card system used in electronic commerce expanded for trade in alliance with global credit cards (e.g. VISA). The global purchasing card system possesses the advantages of existing credit cards which include loans, payment guarantees, credit limits, and electronic transactions as well as new features such as a flexible maturity date at the disposition of clients, advance cash payment in installments, and electronic documentation for B2B e-Marketplace transactions. It can be further developed as an international standard and model based on its ability to facilitate understanding and utilization of market participants. If this system is developed and distributed in the future, it will take a role as a B2B e-Marketplace gateway that is suitable for the demand of each nation and bank, and will help to secure the stability of services connecting payment and networks.","[Keehong, Kim] Pyeongtaek Univ, Dept Business & Commerce, Pyeongtaek Si, Gyeongi Do, South Korea; [Kijin, Jang] Far E Univ, Dept Informat Management, Cheongju, South Korea",Pyeongtaek University,"Keehong, K (通讯作者)，Pyeongtaek Univ, Dept Business & Commerce, Pyeongtaek Si, Gyeongi Do, South Korea.",Kjjang@kdu.ac.kr; alex6700@hanmail.net,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

This paper provides conditions such that no success bonus induces the agent to exert more effort and the optimal contract is independent of success. Moreover, success bonuses may even reduce effort and thus the probability of success. The reason is that bonuses increase the perceived income of the agent and can hence reduce his willingness to exert effort. This perceived income effect has to be weighed against the incentive effect of the bonus. The tradeoff is determined by the marginal effect of effort on the success probability in relation to this probability itself (success hazard-rate of effort).

On the basis of interviews with trade and WTO experts and a closer comparison between the GATS commitments and actual policies of the selected WTO members in the telecommunications sector, we argue that unilateral liberalization, in most cases, acts as a push factor and provides the grounds for making multilateral WTO commitments. Apart from unilateral liberalization, a country also requires the achievement of 'sufficient conditions' before agreeing to undertake liberalization commitments under GATS. Furthermore, the study suggests that the desire to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and also to overcome domestic resistance to reform may encourage each WTO member to make higher commitments. Conversely, a countries' intention to remain unconstrained by WTO commitments may induce them to commit at a lower level than their actual level of openness.","[Alam, Quamrul; Abu Yusuf, Mohammad; Coghill, Ken] Monash Univ, Dept Management, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia",Monash University,"Abu Yusuf, M (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Management, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.",mohammad.yusuf@buseco.monash.edu.au,,"Coghill, Ken/0000-0002-6823-5223",,,,,69,0,0,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Higher education institutions (HEI) are required to regularly review the quality of education and services rendered to their students. In the past, there was no special study focusing on the quality of education taking into account evaluations particularly from students' perspective. Therefore, this study is attempted to assess quality performance on the basis of educational program resources in selected Malaysia's Northern public universities. Researchers focused on variables such as general facilities, library system and education program in relation to the study. Generally, this study attempted to examine in what ways do these variables (general facilities, library system and education program) contribute to the quality performance of the educational program resources. The researchers used descriptive analysis, factor analysis (KMO and Bartlett's Test), reliability and correlation analysis in order to evaluate the data collected. From the findings, it was concluded that there were strong relationship between quality performance and the independent variables under study. It is, hence, suggested that these aspects should be given priority if the higher institutions want to meet students' expectation of quality. However, further research should be done on other areas of quality as specified by MOHE in order to maximize the performance of HEI.","[Ali, Norhidayah; Isa, Zuraidah Mohamed; Ibrahim, Dahlia] Univ Teknol Mara, Fac Business Management, Merbok 08400, Kedah, Malaysia",,,zuraidah588@kedah.uitm.edu.my,"Isa, Zuraidah Mohamed/AAK-8317-2020","Isa, Zuraidah Mohamed/0000-0002-7830-1466",,,,,10,1,1,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9083-4,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,10.0,,,,,,479,483,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZY02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303284800090,0

For the empirical assessment of a sample of 14 countries that have continuously appeared in the GEM project, this study adopts a panel data analysis, combining time-series with cross-sectional data. The results show how in GEM environments, entrepreneurs running consolidated enterprises have the following characteristics: (1) they are motivated by recognition of entrepreneurial opportunity, especially if they are male; (2) they consider enterprise creation a good option for their professional careers; and (3) they have a high risk perception. The findings offer several implications for both entrepreneurs and economic agents in charge of regional development policies.","[Alvarez-Herranz, Agustin] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ Espanola & Int Ecometria & Hist & Inst, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Albacete 02071, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Alvarez-Herranz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ Espanola & Int Ecometria & Hist & Inst, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Plaza Univ S-N, Albacete 02071, Spain.",,"Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/IUM-9361-2023; Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/B-7200-2012","Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/0000-0002-5890-5174; Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/0000-0002-5890-5174; Alvarez Herranz, Agustin/0000-0003-1438-2495",,,,,36,1,1,0,23,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.
