That is, hidden Markov chain can be utilized to better describe the stock return dynamics when moving averages are correlated. Based on the MS-MA model, a recursive method of EM algorithm for parameter estimation is proposed and a numerical analysis is demonstrated. Furthermore, we empirically test the hidden Markov, chain model using Dow Jones thirty stocks' data. The empirical results show that the dynamic process of stock returns exhibits MS-MA property, meaning the moving averages of stock returns are correlated. Therefore, the MS-MA model allows us to better understand and to predict stock return stochastic process. This model also helps in pricing equity derivatives. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

An important channel that is explored is the interaction between international risk sharing and the stabilization role of monetary policy in each country. The main finding is that the welfare costs of incomplete markets and the gains of deviating from a policy of price stability are increasing with the cross-country asymmetries in the initial net international positions and in particular they become nonnegligible when the persistence of the shocks increases (1% of a permanent shift in steady-state consumption, for the welfare costs of incomplete markets, and 0.2%, for the gains of deviating from a policy of price stability). When global imbalances become larger, optimal monetary policy requires an increase in the volatilities of the real returns on assets and in particular of the nominal interest rates, which should happen to be more correlated across countries.","LUISS Guido Carli, Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University,"Benigno, P (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli, Rome, Italy.",pbenigno@luiss.it,,"BENIGNO, PIERPAOLO/0000-0003-3332-7213",,,,,43,118,135,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

To measure the quality of industrial relations, the author uses the results of surveys in which senior business executives characterized the industrial relations of their countries of residence. According to the regression results, cooperative (confrontational) industrial relations are likely to lower (increase) unemployment. In general, the magnitude of the effect appears to be moderate. It seems to be small among women.

We do this by reference to three, interrelated arguments. The first is that the student evaluation of teaching cannot claim to capture the wisdom of a crowd because, as a research program, it fails to meet Surowiecki's conditions for the existence and articulation of the wisdom of a crowd. The second argument extends the first, by stating: (a) the student evaluation of teaching research program fails to provide the methodological controls needed to differentiate cause from effect, or put differently (b) the methodological underpinnings of this research program is tantamount to the misapplication of a closed-system paradigm to an open social system. The third argument has two parts. These are that this research program is predicated on: (a) a false analogy between the workings of a business and a university, and therefore (b) on a mischaracterization of the student-professor relationship. These three arguments, these three failures, suggest that the student evaluation of teaching research program is methodologically ill-conceived and incoherent, and therefore cannot, with any credulity, serve as a guide to the administration and governance of a university.","[Sproule, Robert; Valsan, Calin] Bishops Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1M 0C8, Canada",Bishops University,"Sproule, R (通讯作者)，Bishops Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1M 0C8, Canada.",cvalsan@ubishops.ca,,,,,,,99,1,1,0,17,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2009,11.0,25,,,,,125,150,,,,,,26,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,437LN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265489100013,0

Underwriter profits and the cost of going public,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Initial public offering; Gross spread; Venture capital; Underpricing,VENTURE; ALLOCATIONS; CERTIFICATION,"This paper addresses three empirical findings of the literature on initial public offerings. (i) Why do investment banks earn positive profits in a competitive market? (ii) Why do banks receive lower gross spreads in Venture capitalist (VC) backed than in non-VC backed IPOs? (iii) Why is underpricing more pronounced in VC than in non-VC backed IPOs'? While each phenomenon can be explained by itself, there is no explanation yet why all three occur simultaneously. We propose an integrated theoretical framework to address this issue. The IPO procedure is modeled as a two-stage signaling game: In the second stage banks set offer prices given their private information and the level of the spread. Issuing firms anticipate their bank's pricing decision and, in the first stage, set spreads to maximize expected revenue. Investors are aware of this process and subscribe only if their expected profits are non-negative. Finns' equilibrium spreads are large so as to induce banks to set high prices, allowing banks to make profits. Superiorly informed VC backed firms impose smaller spreads but face larger underpricing than non-VC backed firms. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This paper focuses on one large employer that has remained in the central city over the twentieth century-the U.S. Postal Service. We find that blacks substitute towards postal work as other employment opportunities leave the city circa 1960. The response is particularly strong in segregated areas, where black neighborhoods are clustered near the central business district. Furthermore, this pattern only holds for non-mail carriers, many of whom work in central processing facilities. More recently, the relationship between black postal employment and segregation has declined, suggesting that spatial mismatch has become less important over time. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Similarly, in case of natural catastrophes when the losses reach huge levels, the alternative risk transfer market provide some solutions, among of them are cat bonds.

Analyzing the pre-election survey of the House of Representatives candidates in 2003 and also the voting patterns of Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members on a set of postal privatization bills in 2005, this paper asks why some politicians fiercely opposed (or supported) privatization. The econometric results show that multiple factors are important: the private interests of local postmasters and postal workers, politicians' fundamental ideologies on the size and role of government, party disciplines and factional affiliations within the LDP. Legislative behavior on postal privatization in Japan, thus, turns out to be one case in which legislative behavior is more complex than any single theory predicts.","Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",Wesleyan University,"Imai, M (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, PAC 123,238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",mimai@wesleyan.edu,,,,,,,35,11,11,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2009,138.0,1-2,,,,,137,160,,10.1007/s11127-008-9343-5,0.0,,,24,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,378SH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000261343700010,0

Factors that increase competitiveness of an educational establishment are analyzed. The solution to the problem of increasing the education establishment competitiveness may be achieved on the basis of forming and effectively using intellectual capital and also on the basis of integrating innovative strategies of higher education establishment growth and enterprises. Innovative development lines of the higher education establishment are suggested in order to form a strategy and increase competitiveness of economic players. Adoption of innovative factors of development influences all elements of the economic system. An education establishment should react promptly to changing needs of the society. The necessity to conform educational standards to requirements of an employer and society and also to improve education quality at all levels is a new challenge to educational system.

We have analysed the overall exports for the period of twelve years and can say that all RTAs witness the continuous growth of total exports; however, there are huge differentiations between particular trade agreements. The results show enormous differences between chosen regional groups which can be caused by the level of development of the member states in the regional trade agreements. Even if the value of traded products increased over the monitored period of time we can conclude that the structure of foreign trade of analysed regional trade agreements exactly shows the position of developing countries on the international market. They are competitive in agricultural products and fuels but not in processed products or products with higher value added. The problem is even the structure of agricultural products, when some of the RTAs (ECOWAS, CARICOM, COMESA) focus on cash crops where the price is fluctuating. The main aim was to find any evidence of whether the regional trade agreements promote trade. On the basis of our analyses we cannot prove that there is any direct impact of the RTA on increasing value of trade, or even the changing structure of trade.

We find that large family CEO firms are more likely to engage in corporate diversification than are small non-family CEO firms and their CEOs are seldom replaced. Large family CEO diversified firms also have lower turnover sensitivity relative to focused firms. The results imply that the CEOs of diversified firms have entrenched themselves, thereby increasing agency costs within family businesses. However, we fail to find diversification discounts in family businesses. It is interesting that CEOs tend to diversify their businesses in order to decrease firm risk. Founding families favor risk-reducing decisions in order to maintain family wealth and prestige; suggesting that family businesses are more interested in survival than growth. Although family businesses may benefit from risk reduction, a negative relationship between diversification level and CEO turnover is still evidence of poor corporate governance. Agency theory may not completely account for the adoption of diversification strategies in family businesses and corporate diversification may weaken the effectiveness of internal monitoring mechanisms.","[Tsai, Wen-Hsien; Hung, Jung-Hua] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Business Adm, Jhongli 320, Taiwan; [Kuo, Yi-Chen] St Johns Univ, Dept Business Adm, Tamsui 251, Taiwan",National Central University,"Tsai, WH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Dept Business Adm, Jhongli 320, Taiwan.",whtsai@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,61,33,40,3,68,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The first study investigated factors affecting people's perception and comprehension of information about the risks related to retirement investments. First, we asked respondents to list possible risk factors related to investment in a pension plan. Then we obtained ratings of different factors (e. g., the perceived level of knowledge about an investment) that could affect perception of the risk of financial products and retirement investment decisions. Finally, we asked the subjects to rate 11 different descriptions presenting risk information about the same financial product. The risk information framing that received highest rating presented risk as variation between minimum and maximum values with an average in between. The second study demonstrated the risk framing that received highest ranking also prompted more stable risk preferences over a 3-month testing period in comparison to standard measures of risk aversion. Thus, the second study corroborated the importance of the findings in the first study and also indicated that, although people can exhibit stable risk preferences if we ask them the right questions, these preferences were very specific to the risk domain.","[Vlaev, Ivo; Chater, Nick] UCL, London WC1H 0AP, England; [Stewart, Neil] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of London; University College London; University of Warwick,"Vlaev, I (通讯作者)，UCL, 26 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AP, England.",i.vlaev@ucl.ac.uk,"Stewart, Neil/A-1555-2010; Chater, Nick/GRX-6742-2022; Stewart, Neil/R-2282-2019","Stewart, Neil/0000-0002-2202-018X; Stewart, Neil/0000-0002-2202-018X",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-538-28-1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,51,42,45,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

It also explores the adjustment each individual rate undergoes to move the spread to its equilibrium during widenings and narrowings. While the results show strong asymmetry in the spread movements, the adjustment clearly shows a shift in spread risk in 2007. Both asymmetry and convergence are also restored when the shift in risk is addressed. While the T bills generally adjust faster than LIBOR as our findings suggest, the speed for the three-month bills is phenomenal in the subperiod 2007-2008. The fast convergence of the shorter term than the longer term maturities during negative shocks and under higher risk indicates that the diagnostic of the crisis in 2007-2009 pertains to elevated risk than to lack of liquidity. The results should be valuable to investors, policy makers and researchers working on the 2007-2009 financial crisis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Banister, D",,,,"Banister, David",,,"Cities, mobility and climate change",JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transport; Cities; Climate change; Development,,"Societies gain enormous benefits from travel, as economies have become more globalised and as the new communications infrastructure allows international networking and travel at a low cost. There has been a true internationalisation of all activities, and travel forms an essential part of that process. However, this mobility is fuelled by carbon, and there is clear scientific agreement that carbon emissions are affecting the global climate with irreversible long term consequences. Transport is the one sector where a reduction in energy use and emissions is proving to be extraordinarily difficult to achieve despite some success in urban areas. This paper focuses on cities, mobility and climate change, highlighting recent trends in both developed and developing countries. It is argued that the current situation is unsustainable, and that transport must contribute fully to achieving carbon reduction targets. An alternative is presented, based on the sustainable mobility paradigm (Banister, 2008) that looks at ways to reduce the need to travel in cities. The belief that high mobility and technology provides the solution is misplaced, as technological innovation can only get us part of the way to sustainable transport, and this may facilitate more travel. There are opportunities for cities to switch to low carbon transport futures, where vision and action are based on a combination of economic, planning and technological innovations working in mutually supporting ways. Potentially, the future is bright for low carbon transport in cities, but the real question is whether there is the commitment and leadership to follow such a path.

We argue that one way to assess the influence of international trade upon income distribution is to take account of each country's specific trade patterns by measuring the changes in the factor content of trade. The econometric specification is based on changes in Gini indices (over non-overlapping 4-year intervals), computed exclusively from series drawn from the same source. Our results show that a change in the factor content of trade has a significant impact on income distribution. The sign and magnitude of this impact is conditional on the national income level. We find that an increase in the labor content of trade raises income inequality in poor countries, but reduces it in rich countries (the reverse is true for the capital content of trade). In particular, we show that in the 1980s and 1990s, international trade may have contributed significantly to widening income inequalities in developing countries.","[Jean, Sebastien] INRA, UMR Econ Publ 210, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Bensidoun, Isabelle; Jean, Sebastien] Ctr Etud Prospect & Informat Int, F-75007 Paris, France; [Bensidoun, Isabelle; Sztulman, Aude] Ctr Etud Emploi, F-93166 Noisy Le Grand, France; [Jean, Sebastien] AgroParisTech, UMR Econ Publ 210, Thiverval Grignon, France; [Sztulman, Aude] Univ Paris 09, LEDa, F-75016 Paris, France; [Sztulman, Aude] IRD, DIAL UMR225, F-75010 Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; AgroParisTech; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Jean, S (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR Econ Publ 210, 16 Rue Claude Bernard, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",sebastien.jean@grignon.inra.fr,,"Jean, Sebastien/0000-0003-1895-0955",,,,,43,10,11,5,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The effect of fiscal policy on output is different depending on the different debt dynamics, the different degree of openness, and the different fiscal reaction functions across different countries.

In this market, issuers compete monopolistically by differentiating their credit card products. The fact that consumers perceive credit cards and all other banking services as a bundle allows banks to also employ bank level characteristics to differentiate their credit cards. Thus, the features and service quality of banks are expected to affect credit card rates. Panel data estimations also control for various costs associated with credit card lending.

This paper provides a signaling explanation for this race for risk. If banks returns can be observed while risk cannot, the less efficient banks can hide their type by taking more risks and paying the same returns as the more efficient banks.

Ecological functions were based on estimating the abundance, distribution and diet of cormorants; economic values were attached to a selection of goods, services and attributes. Based on available information, we selected four ecological-economic functions of cormorants: harvesting for food; contributors to fish diversity; indicators of fish schools; and contributors to fish biomass, due to guano production. Cormorants consumed nine commercial fish species. Mean consumption was 225 g/ind/day. All ecological-economic functions were positive except for the role as contributors to fish biomass. Total value of the cormorant population to fishermen was $5,429,703/year. Unlike many studies, our results show that Neotropic Cormorants have a negligible impact on artisanal fisheries.

These paths allow partners to exploit and stretch existing, and explore new capabilities and partner resources across time and contexts of collaboration. Paths are promoted by connecting practices partners apply to establish task and team linkages between past, present and potential future projects.

We used weekly data for the period 1997-2009 in order to capture potential contagion effects among the US, German and Russian stock markets and the CEE stock markets. The main finding of the present analysis is that there is a statistically significant increase in conditional correlations between the US and the German stock returns and the CEE stock returns, particularly during the 20072009 financial crises, implying that these emerging markets are exposed to external shocks with a substantial regime shift in conditional correlation. Finally, we demonstrated that domestic and foreign monetary variables, as well as exchange rate movements have a significant impact on the corresponding conditional correlations. Macroeconomic fundamentals have been shown to have substantial explanatory power in explaining these conditional correlations during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Results show that light users cognitively can distinguish between the social and temporal dimensions of the Brundlandt definition, as well as the People. Planet and Prosperity dimensions of the Triple-P definition of sustainability. In the motivational structure of light users of sustainable products, all attributes that do not offer direct and personal benefits are collapsed into a single dimension. This single dimension explains purchases more parsimoniously than a more complex structure, and is itself explained by a set of psychographic predictors that appears to be related to identity. Theoretical implications are that research into consumers' cognitive understanding of abstract constructs may fail to predict purchase behaviour of light users, because their motivational structure is not related to this understanding. Practical implications are that focusing on sustainability as a container construct that incorporates various approaches to sustainable development matches with motivations of light users and thus may induce them to purchase more sustainable products.

Controlling for simultaneity issues, time-invariant workplace characteristics and dynamics in the adjustment process of productivity, empirical results reveal the existence of a positive impact from conditional intra-firm wage dispersion to firm productivity ( measured by the average value added per hour worked), which however decreases for higher dispersion levels. Findings thus suggest that the incentive effect of wage dispersion, predicted for instance by the 'tournament' model, dominates 'fairness' and/or 'sabotage' considerations. Further results reveal that the influence of wage dispersion on firm productivity is stronger among firms with a larger proportion of highly skilled workers but does not depend on whether wages are collectively renegotiated at the firm level.","[Mahy, Benoit] Univ Mons UMONS, Warocque Res Ctr, Mons, Belgium; [Rycx, Francois] Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, SBS EM, Brussels, Belgium; [Rycx, Francois] CEB & DULBEA & IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany",University of Mons; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Mahy, B (通讯作者)，Univ Mons UMONS, Warocque Res Ctr, Mons, Belgium.",,,,,,,,54,18,20,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

The model suggests that bookmakers require a premium for quoting the odds several days before an event. This premium reflects the uncertainty of public information that can be exploited by expert bettors. The model predicts that when bookmakers set optimal prices, expected returns to bettors increase as a monotonic function of winning probabilities. In this manner, an information-based explanation is given for the celebrated favourite-longshot bias in fixed-odds. Using an extensive data-set of football odds from two major European bookmakers, we estimate the probability of informed betting.","[Makropoulou, Vasiliki; Markellos, Raphael N.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Makropoulou, V (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece.",,,,,,,,31,11,11,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0036-9292,,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

The consequence was that lenders were able to remove poorly performing assets from their balance sheets at attractive prices. While this meant the HOLC's ability to seek principal reductions was somewhat limited, borrowers still received significant relief through the terms of the HOLC's more modern and forgiving mortgage contracts.","Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Rose, JD (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",jonathan.d.rose@frb.gov,,,,,,,37,16,24,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We then go on to assess the economic value of the covariance forecasts based on our proposed model under a mean-variance framework. The out-of-sample forecasting performance reveals that investors would be willing to pay between 39 and 2081 basis points per year to switch from a dynamic trading strategy under the return-based volatility model to a dynamic trading strategy under the range-based volatility model, with more risk-averse investors being willing to pay even higher switching fees.

Comparable enterprise surveys today cover more than 100,000 firms in 123 countries. The literature that has analyzed this data provides evidence that a good business climate favors growth by encouraging investment and higher productivity. Various infrastructure, finance, security, competition, and regulation variables have been shown to have a significant impact on enterprise performance. The authors state their motivation for their review by explaining why a disaggregated, firm-level analysis of the relationship between enterprise performance and business climate-as opposed to a more macroaggregate analysis-is important to gaining insights into these issues. They review the main findings of the empirical microliterature based on enterprise surveys and consider the robustness of the results. To conclude they put forward some ideas to advance research on business climate and growth, and they suggest possible improvements in survey design.

The analysis shows that national patterns of disease burden explain neither public nor private aid flows during this period.

In Brazil, 45% of workers in the urban labor force are employed informally. The degree of informal employment, however, varies substantially across regions, with some cities having 20% and others having 80% or more of their labor force in the informal sector. The hypothesis assessed here is that the quality of local governance-or government effectiveness-affects the decisions of workers and businesses as to whether to participate in the formal or the informal sector. The empirical analysis, based on data from 5500 Brazilian municipalities, shows that informal employment is lower in regions with better governance, higher average education, and with a relatively large manufacturing sector.

The resulting increase in reserve balances exerted downward price pressure in the federal funds market, and the effective federal funds rate began to deviate from the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee. In response, the Federal Reserve revised its operational framework for implementing monetary policy and began to pay interest on reserve balances in an attempt to provide a floor for the federal funds rate. Nevertheless, following the policy change, the effective federal funds rate remained below not only the target but also the rate paid on reserve balances. We develop a model to explain this phenomenon and use data from the federal funds market to evaluate it empirically. In turn, we show how successful the Federal Reserve may be in raising the federal funds rate even in an environment with substantial reserve balances.

Demand substitution occurs when individuals on the margin between certain city pairs affect demand patterns in the aggregate, causing certain cities to be better substitutes than others. Using a discrete model of city choice, I derive two predictions for migration flows and test them empirically using city-to-city migration data from the US Census. I show that cities which are similar on a variety of observable measures have higher levels of gross migration flows in the steady state and higher net migration flows in response to labor demand shocks. Finally, I propose pairwise correlation in metropolitan home prices as a price-based measure of substitutability and show that it contains substantial predictive power for migration flows relative to observable similarity.

In particular, it examines the impact of the size of a city and business risks on the organizational structures of firms located in urban agglomerations, and it also discusses the impact of organizational structure on incentives to insure workers against income risks. It is shown that manufacturing firms suffer from a coordination game in their decision to outsource production. The existence of idiosyncratic risks causes manufacturers to refrain from outsourcing. The incentives to offer wage and employment protection to workers are more pronounced when manufacturers outsource the production of their inputs to a local market, which mitigates the impact of labor market pooling.

Econometric approaches to measuring long-term risk are developed in order to estimate the term structure of value at risk and expected shortfall. Long-term negative skewness increases the downside risk and is a consequence of asymmetric volatility models. A test is developed for long-term skewness. In a Merton style structural default model, bankruptcies are accompanied by substantial drops in equity prices. Thus, skewness in a market factor implies high defaults and default correlations even far in the future corroborating the systemic importance of long-term skewness. Investors concerned about long-term risks may hedge exposure as in the Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM). As a consequence, the aggregate wealth portfolio should have asymmetric volatility and hedge portfolios should have reversed asymmetric volatility. Using estimates from VLAB, reversed asymmetric volatility is found for many possible hedge portfolios such as volatility products, long- and short-term treasuries, some exchange rates, and gold.

In our paper, we examine how U.S. equity traders, who are (un)informed about future price changes, trade-off between speed and cost in their order-routing decisions. We find that informed traders are more likely to choose trading systems that allow them to trade-off lower cost for faster speed; whereas, uninformed traders are more likely to choose trading systems that allow them to sacrifice speed for lower costs. Our results indicate that traders have varying preferences for the different dimensions of execution quality based on their information levels.

Conditions necessary and sufficient for Mossin's Theorem depend on the stochastic dependence between risks. The correlation coefficient, however, is not an adequate measure of stochastic dependence in the general expected-utility model, and so other notions of dependence are used to investigate Mossin's Theorem. The inadequacy of the correlation coefficient is illustrated with two counterexamples. Then, using notions of positive and negative dependence measures, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a generalized Mossin Theorem to hold. In addition, a generalized Mossin Theorem is interpreted using the notion of a mean preserving spread made popular by Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970). Given a fair premium and dependent stochastic conditions, we show that an individual can obtain a final wealth distribution with less weight in its tails by selecting less than or more than full insurance.","[Hong, Soon Koo; Lew, Keun Ock] Seoul Natl Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea; [MacMinn, Richard] Illinois State Univ, Coll Business, Insurance & Financial Serv, Normal, IL 61761 USA",Illinois State University,"Hong, SK (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea.",rmacmin@ilstu.edu,"MacMinn, Richard D/D-1909-2010",,,,,,19,30,32,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Moreover, high levels of derivative use increase the leverage gains attributable to reinsurance.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Business Adm, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Shiu, YM (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Business Adm, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",yungming@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,"Shiu, Yung-Ming/0000-0002-5024-3946",,,,,44,39,48,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

This illusion occurs because future effort is discounted more heavily than future monetary outcomes. In this research, we show that this bias of differential discounting can be corrected by asking consumers to perform effort at the time of decision-making. We further outline three explanations for why this intervention attenuates the illusion of delayed incentives, and discuss whether these explanations constitute a debiasing effect or a rebiasing effect (Larrick, 2004). We report the results of two laboratory experiments and discuss theoretical and practical implications of our findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Price differences between A and B shares are higher in firms with a greater disparity in the disclosures that they make to domestic and foreign investors. This association is more pronounced when the cost (benefit) of information transfer is higher (lower). The results suggest that disclosure disparity creates meaningful differences in investors' average information precision across A and B shares and thus influences the cross-sectional variation in price differences.

Indeed, many countries look to Ireland as an economic development role model, and it has been suggested that Ireland might provide key lessons for other EU members as they seek to achieve the objectives set out in the Lisbon Agenda. Much of the discussion of Ireland's growth has focused on its possible triggers: the long-term consequences of the late 1980s fiscal stabilisation, EU structural funds, education, wage moderation and devaluation of the Irish punt. The industrial policy perspective has highlighted the importance of inflows of foreign direct investment, but a notable absence from the discourse on the 'Celtic Tiger' has been any mention of the role of new business venture creation and entrepreneurship. In this paper we use unpublished Irish VAT data for the years 1988-2004 to provide the first detailed look at national trends in business birth and death rates in Ireland over the 'take-off' period. We also use sub-national VAT data to shed light on spatial trends in new venture creation. Our overall conclusions are that new business formation made no detectable contribution to the acceleration of Ireland's growth in the late 1990s, although we do find evidence of spatial convergence in per capita business stocks.","[Anyadike-Danes, Michael] Econ Res Inst No Ireland, Belfast BT1 3NQ, Antrim, North Ireland; [Lenihan, Helena] Univ Limerick, Dept Econ, Kemmy Business Sch, Limerick, Ireland; [Hart, Mark] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",University of Limerick; Aston University,"Anyadike-Danes, M (通讯作者)，Econ Res Inst No Ireland, 2-14 E Bridge St, Belfast BT1 3NQ, Antrim, North Ireland.",m.anydike-danes@erini.ac.uk; mark.hart@aston.ac.uk; helena.lenihan@ul.ie,"Lenihan, Helena/KBD-4415-2024","Hart, Mark/0000-0002-0402-4128; Lenihan, Helena/0000-0001-6038-0904",,,,,45,17,17,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

To further the understanding of the factors affecting market development, this study evaluates the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE). The Greek market provides a unique opportunity to isolate market efficiency as a factor in market development. Since its membership to the European Union (EU) in 1981, political and legal risks in the Greek market are similar to those of the other EU member countries such as the U. K., Germany and France. Greece's inclusion in the Eurozone in 2000 has eliminated many of the economic risks. The unrealized potential of the ASE is therefore questioned. Considering the relatively small number of stocks in the ASE, market level analysis is potentially inappropriate: studies may be rejecting the ASE's efficiency due to irregularities in a few influential stocks. Thus, this study analyzes the efficiency of the ASE by evaluating the market's, as well as individual stocks', returns. A well documented anomaly for the ASE, the day-of-the-week effect, is evaluated as are return predictability tests including a runs test, causality from other markets, and causality from liquidity. Both on the market level and on the individual level, evidence of inefficiencies are found. Based on the evidence that about 94% of Greek stocks' returns are Granger-caused by at least one foreign market, it is concluded that the Greek market lacks the appeal for international diversification. Overall, the ASE's unrealized potential is blamed on lingering market inefficiencies and especially on its causal relationship with international markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Importantly, this form of overconfidence is endogenous and dynamic. We also examine the effect of this cognitive bias on the managerial credibility. Consistent with the existence of dynamic overconfidence, managers who have predicted earnings accurately in the previous four quarters are less accurate in their subsequent earnings predictions. These managers also display greater divergence from the analyst consensus and are more precise. Lastly, investors and analysts react less strongly to forecasts issued by overconfident managers.

We examine this hypothesis in the context of Walmart Supercenters, whose advancements in retail logistics have translated to substantial reductions in the prices of food and other consumer goods. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System matched with Walmart Supercenter entry dates and locations, we examine the effects of Supercenters on body mass index (BMI) and obesity. We account for the endogeneity of Walmart Supercenter locations with an instrumental variables approach that exploits the unique geographical pattern of Supercenter expansion around Walmart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. An additional Supercenter per 100,000 residents increases average BMI by 0.24 units and the obesity rate by 2.3% points. These results imply that the proliferation of Walmart Supercenters explains 10.5% of the rise in obesity since the late 1980s, but the resulting increase in medical expenditures offsets only a small portion of consumers' savings from shopping at Supercenters.

Nonlinearity is introduced via a logistic transition function. The model can capture smooth changes in the volatility across different regimes as well as asymmetric response to negative and positive shocks and allows for nonzero thresholds. Simulations find that the Smooth Transition FIGARCH model outperforms the standard FIGARCH model when nonlinearity is present, and ignoring nonlinearity in the data may induce considerable costs in terms of bias and efficiency. Applications to exchange rate and stock market data show that the proposed model performs well both in-sample fit as well as in forecasting one-day ahead volatility. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper introduces the notion of adjustment need, which is a period of severe fiscal distress that signals a clear need for consolidation. This new concept allows the author to empirically investigate the role of political and institutional factors in determining why countries get into fiscal distress, why some are able to fiscally consolidate when required, and why others are unable to adjust despite an evident need to do so. For developing economies, strong scores for broad measures of institutional quality (e.g. rule of law indices) are found to help avoid situations of fiscal distress, but weaker scores characterize those countries that actually manage to make large adjustments. For advanced countries, the results highlight the importance of budgetary institutions: fiscal rules contribute to avoiding situations of fiscal distress, and fiscal performance management systems improve the odds of implementing adjustments.

Our model captures three important features of commodity futures-the heteroskedasticity of the convenience yield, the positive relationship between spot-price volatility and the convenience yield and the dependence of futures risk premium on the convenience yield.

Are there any risks or vulnerabilities in this success story? This paper analyzes Australia's systemic banking risk and attempts to determine if this risk increased with the recent global crisis and whether this risk is related to the downturn experienced in the real estate market. We use extreme value theory to measure banks' and property firms' univariate Value at Risk, as well as multivariate intra-sector and inter-sector contagion risks. Of the 13 sectors analyzed, we find that the property sector exhibits the highest level of extremal dependence with the banking sector. The credit crisis significantly increased the probability of a bank or property firm crashing. Moreover, contagion risks significantly increased not only within the banking and property sectors, but also between those sectors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In a panel design conducted 2 months before and after a raise in value-added tax (VAT), 303 participants had to estimate the current prices for four products affected and four products not affected by this raise in VAT and the anticipated or recalled prices of these products. Before the VAT increase, an undifferentiated belief in strong future price increases was prevalent. After the VAT increase, a confirmation bias was found: in retrospect, participants reported price increases that were significantly higher than the official price development and in line with an undifferentiated belief in marked price increases. Two theoretical explanations for confirmation bias, i.e., the biased use of price information and the selective distortion of memory, fit the data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we harness two databases, on wildlife surveys and financial benefits, to address these issues for communal conservancies in northwest Namibia. We use ordination methods to characterize the diversity and stability of large wildlife assemblages on conservancies, and demonstrate that diversity (but not stability) is an important explanator of conservancy financial benefits.

In our estimations, we employ a panel vector autoregression framework that also controls for the business cycle. In developed countries, we find fiscal behavior in the aftermath of disasters that can best be characterized as counter-cyclical. In contrast, we find pro-cyclical decreased spending and increasing revenues in developing countries following large natural catastrophes. These pro-cyclical fiscal dynamics are likely to worsen the adverse consequences of natural disasters on middle- and low-income countries. We quantify these dynamics. The canton of Unterwald in Switzerland is frequently ravaged by storms and inundations, and is thereby exposed to extraordinary expences. Upon such occasions the people assemble, and every one is said to declare with the greatest frankness what he is worth in order to be taxed accordingly.

The findings reveal that while the non-cash component that is common to both FFO and net income is significantly associated with the level of dividends distributed by REITs, the additional non-cash component in net income but not in FFO has no association with dividends. The findings also show that the non-cash component in net income becomes significantly associated with dividends only when measurement errors in depreciation are low (i.e., reporting quality in depreciation is high). By suggesting that the inclusion of depreciation distorts the dividend-relevance of REIT net income, this paper provides further support to the dominance of FFO over net income for financial reporting in the REIT industry.","[Ben-Shahar, Danny] Technion Israel Inst Technol, IL-32000 Technion, Haifa, Israel; [Sulganik, Eyal] Interdisciplinary Ctr Herzliya, IL-46150 Herzliyya, Israel; [Tsang, Desmond] McGill Univ, Quebec City, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada",Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Reichman University; McGill University,"Ben-Shahar, D (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, IL-32000 Technion, Haifa, Israel.",dannyb@technion.ac.il; sulganik@idc.ac.il; desmond.tsang@mcgill.ca,"Tsang, Desmond/O-6079-2017","Ben-Shahar, Danny/0000-0002-9077-993X",,,,,51,21,21,0,23,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

DEA, basically, takes into account the input and output components of a decision making unit (DMU), to calculate technical efficiency (TE). TE is treated as an indicator for safety performance of DMUs and comparison has been made among them. Thirty Indian organizations under three industrial categories such as construction, refractory and steel are chosen for comparison purpose. It has been observed that safety performance of construction industries is consistently low as compared to other categories of industries.

We find that households have responded to cuts in pension benefits mostly by increasing real estate wealth, and that this response is stronger among households able more accurately to estimate future social security benefits.

The HBS covers private households in Slovenia with the basic socio and demographic data for the household members observed within the surveys, data on income, assets and final consumption. In the probit analysis we focus on the determinants of the undergraduate and postgraduate higher education participation separately for different age groups. Based on the results of the three probit models we find six different determinants of the undergraduate higher education participation. The first two most important determinants are the availability of internet access in a household and education of parents.

A general population sample of Greek citizens was chosen to examine this research question (n= 277). The scales used were self-determined; our instrument was validated through confirmatory factor analysis, which presented overall good fit. Binary logistic regression showed that significant predictors of taking loans were Personal Marital Status, Customer service, shop design (number of automatic transaction machines, bank branches and personnel education) and Interest Rates whose odds ratios were all significantly above 1. These results have important implications for bank managers who should focus giving loans to single individuals as well as change their interest rates policy by decreasing the rates for all kinds of loans, especially housing loans.","[Frangos, Christos C.] TEI Athens, Dept Business Adm, Athens, Greece; [Fragkos, Konstantinos C.] UCL, Div Med, London, England; [Sotiropoulos, Ioannis] Technol Educ Inst TED Epirus, Dept Finance & Auditing, Preveza, Greece; [Manolopoulos, Giannis] Univ London, Technol Educ Inst TED, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Valvi, Aikaterini C.] Univ London, Dept Management Birkbeck, London, England",University of West Attica; University of London; University College London; University of London,"Frangos, CC (通讯作者)，TEI Athens, Dept Business Adm, Athens, Greece.",cfragos@teiath.gr; constantinos.frangos.09@ucl.ac.uk; a.valvi@bbk.ac.uk,"Valvi, Aikaterini C/A-6176-2013; Fragkos, Konstantinos/B-8861-2009; Sotiropoulos, Ioannis/B-3316-2010","Fragkos, Konstantinos/0000-0002-7677-7989; Frangos, Christos/0000-0002-1743-5962",,,,,62,0,0,0,7,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,651,+,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550000060,0

The past 10 years have seen dramatic changes in higher education in terms of increased access to education, lifelong learning, increased choice in areas of study and the personalization of learning. The widespread availability of digital learning resources in a variety of media formats, anytime and anywhere offers the possibility to make a profound difference in education. E-learning means not only Information and Communication Technologies, complex media or Internet. In the new vision e-learning is a complex field involving institutional, individual, technical and social components. This entire environment is changing dynamically day by day. The associated technologies are evolving rapidly especially the mobile communication technologies. E-learning is a success story from many years. Everybody talks about e-learning advantages and disadvantages but few about the necessity of standardization in this area.

In case of public finance our estimates suggest that debt usually decreases as economic regulation goes down while the effect on budget deficit goes both ways.

While Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is the most widely used of the three potential approaches, the recent interest in the wider economic benefits of transport infrastructure has spawned a variety of macroeconomic models. However, the estimates of magnitudes and direction of economic impacts of infrastructure by various macroeconomic models are sharply different, and these models shed little light on causal mechanisms linking transport and the economy. This paper has two aims: first, to highlight the wider economic benefits of transport infrastructure from the observed role of railroads and waterways in economic development, and two by reviewing recent theoretical developments to identify the multiple causal mechanisms which link transport and economic growth such as : market expansion, gains from trade, technological shifts, processes of spatial agglomeration and processes of innovation and commercialization of new knowledge in urban clusters (made possible by transport improvements). Hence the need for developing general equilibrium analyses of transport-economy linkages. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Travellers are willing to spend several hours extra driving to a larger airport in order to take advantage of lower fares and more convenient airline services. Traffic leakage from regional airports is high when the service from the regional airport is indirect and fare differences are large. Public service obligation tenders (PSO) set maximum fares on the regional legs, but do not cover through travel from regional airports which involve commercial legs. Traffic leakage is particularly evident in the leisure segment. Leakage levels tend to increase as competition is intensified at main airports, but the evidence is rather mixed. Logistic curves of airport market shares have proven to be useful when comparing spatial variations in leakage levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper concludes that the expected utility function is consistent with that anticipated in Markowitz [1952] and Sharpe [1964] except that the investors did not consider time horizon. The paper argues that the analysis of investor behavior is best served by considering the behavior of a group as a whole rather than investors as individuals, and by assessing their choices when faced with successive similar tasks.","[Livanas, John] Univ New S Wales, Sch Actuarial Studies, Fac Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Livanas, J (通讯作者)，AMIST Super, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",jlivanas@yahoo.com,,,,,,,31,7,10,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Based on Indonesian data, we show that children's school enrolment increases with the number of foster grandchildren in their sibship. Given that grandchildren fostering is associated with positive transfers from biological to host parents, this result reflects either a release of liquidity constraints in the host household or the uncommon preferences of host grandparents. Conversely, the proportion of other foster children in a sibship does not have any effect. The latter result's explanation depends on the reason children other than grandchildren are fostered.","[Marazyan, Karine] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Pantheon, Sorbonne, France",,"Marazyan, K (通讯作者)，112 Blvd Hop,Maison Sci Econ, F-75013 Paris, France.",karine.marazyan@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,12,12,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Moreover, among the three factors, online auction price is the most significant factor toward online consumers' intention to purchase.","[Saputra, Ruswiati Surya; Warokka, Ari; Naruephai, Nanchaya] UUM, Coll Business, Sintok, Malaysia",,,ruswiati@uum.edu.my; ari.warokka@uum.edu.my,"Warokka, Ari/M-1314-2019; Warokka, Ari Ari/P-5066-2016","Warokka, Ari/0000-0003-2332-4780; Warokka, Ari Ari/0000-0003-2332-4780",,,,,61,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,580,596,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550000054,0

Using newly available yield curve data from 10 different countries with independent monetary policy, I test the robustness of Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005). For most countries in my sample, I find more modest predictive power for forward rates than originally found by Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005) for the US. Their single-factor model captures well the predictability in international data, and this factor also tends to have a tent-shape in most countries of my sample. CP factors are more idiosyncratic across countries than yields or forward rates. Finally, I show that the recent financial crisis has significantly affected the predictability of excess bond returns.

We analyze the differences in merger decisions and the consequences between them by using a unique Japanese dataset from a period of high economic growth. Empirical results suggest that family firms are less likely to merge than non-family firms are. Moreover, we find a positive relationship between pre-merger family ownership and the probability of mergers. Thus, ownership structure is an important determinant of mergers. Finally, we find that non-family firms benefit more from mergers than family firms do. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We believe that the liquidity management and counterparty risk are in generally the two biggest problems of the corporate finance at present. We also know that the agricultural enterprises have greater exposure to risk than other industry of the economy. This risk exposure has serious consequences for income generation and loan repayment capacity of these enterprises. We deal with several aspects of liquidity measurement and working capital management of agricultural enterprises in our paper. An effective liquidity and working capital management can provide a strategic advantage especially in difficult economic times. We found during our researches of corporate financing that the traditional liquidity ratios do not give an accurate picture of the enterprise liquidity position, and therefore it is necessary to adjust them. The problems in the calculation of the traditional liquidity ratios are caused thereby they do not take into account the turnover ratio of the current assets and the current liabilities. An other important financial indicator closely related to liquidity is the cash conversion cycle what should also adjust in order to measure more accurately. The adjusted ratios using for the business analysis provide a more accurate picture of the current company's financial position for the stakeholders, while the traditional ratios under-or overvaluate it. Using the new ratios will support the firms' risk assessment a lot better. The ratios above mentioned were using for analysis of agricultural enterprises.","[Tarnoczi, Tibor; Fenyves, Veronika; Bacs, Zoltan] Univ Debrecen, Fac Appl Econ & Rural Dev, Inst Accounting & Finance, H-4012 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Tarnóczi, T (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Fac Appl Econ & Rural Dev, Inst Accounting & Finance, H-4012 Debrecen, Hungary.",tarnoczi@agr.unideb.hu; fenyves@agr.unideb.hu; bacs@agr.unideb.hu,"Fenyves, Veronika/HPC-1363-2023",,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,255,262,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100027,0

EMH and other current paradigms are extended to accommodate situations having higher information complexity and interactions coupled with positive feedback. The herding behavior literature in finance marks a significant recognition that interdependent trader behavior may result in deviation from normal distribution of returns, as does chartist trading. Further legitimization of the separate-but-equal status of EMH and fractal finance is pursued. Research on the nonlinear models giving theoretical underpinning to equations representing mirror markets as complex dynamical systems is encouraged. Why some herding-and chartist-behaviors scale up and then die off whereas others result in significant crashes is explained. The buildup to the 2007 liquidity crisis offers an example of nonlinear scale-free dynamics.

We find that on average stock returns decrease with PIN in January, in contrast to other calendar months. This pattern is more apparent for small stocks. We argue that this seasonality is related to the January effect. According to the analysis, the December selling pressure associated with the January effect decreases in PIN, especially for small stocks. This suggests that when the price bounces back in January, low-PIN stocks will exhibit a larger return within a small stock group, leading to the negative PIN-return pattern. Furthermore, this seasonality is not the same as other January anomalies associated with momentum and idiosyncratic risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

New Results for the Euro Area,INTERNATIONAL FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INFLATION; INFORMATION; OUTPUT; RULES; MODEL; VARIABLES,"In recent years, the relevance of money growth indicators for the conduct of monetary policy has been questioned in the mainstream academic literature. It is widely argued that monetary policy should directly relate short-term interest rates to inflation and the output gap. The present paper investigates whether the performance of this type of interest rate rule can be significantly improved by adding a policy response to money growth. In contrast to most previous studies, our analysis explicitly takes into account the fact that real-time data on both actual and potential output, and hence the output gap, may be subject to substantial measurement errors. Broadly speaking, we find that the greater the degree of output gap uncertainty, the greater the benefits of incorporating a money growth response are in terms of reducing volatility in output, inflation and interest rates. The main reason is that real-time data on money growth contain valuable information on the true level of current output growth, which is not otherwise known to policy makers in real time with a sufficient degree of precision. Hence, we conclude that policy makers should explicitly account for money growth in the setting of policy rates.","[Scharnagl, Michael; Gerberding, Christina] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Seitz, Franz] Univ Appl Sci Amberg Weiden, Weiden, Germany; [Seitz, Franz] WSB Poznan, Poznan, Poland",Deutsche Bank,"Gerberding, C (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany.",christina.gerberding@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,50,3,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

From a merger policy perspective, this paper's main contribution is two-fold. First, it shows that if mergers do not involve all firms in the industry, then merger remedies help the AA to increase consumer surplus only if assets are divested to competitors already in the market. Second, it presents a model which clarifies that there can only exist social costs to 'over-fixing' the anticompetitive effects of a merger if merger review policy treats mergers as one-time events. When a more dynamic view is taken of sequential merger review, then there can never be an 'over-fixing' problem. In this case, however, remedies are shown to be needed to make myopic merger review optimal.","[Vasconcelos, Helder] Univ Catolica Portuguesa CEGE, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal; [Vasconcelos, Helder] CEPR, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Vasconcelos, H (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa CEGE, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal.",hvasconcelos@porto.ucp.pt,"Vasconcelos, Helder F/B-5966-2009","Vasconcelos, Helder/0000-0002-2584-4352",,,,,17,25,33,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

We set up an empirical model that relates a government's decision whether to cut its corporate tax rate to the country's own inherited tax and taxes in neighboring countries. Using comprehensive data on corporate tax reforms in Europe since 1980, we find evidence suggesting that the position in terms of the tax burden imposed on corporate income relative to geographical neighbors strongly affects the probability of rate-cutting tax reforms. Countries are particularly likely to cut their statutory tax rate if the inherited tax is high and if they are exposed to low-tax neighbors.","[Rincke, Johannes] Univ Munich, Seminar Econ Policy, Dept Econ, D-80799 Munich, Germany; [Heinemann, Friedrich] Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany; [Overesch, Michael] Univ Mannheim, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany",University of Munich; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Mannheim,"Rincke, J (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Seminar Econ Policy, Dept Econ, Akad Str 1-2, D-80799 Munich, Germany.",johannes.rincke@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,"Overesch, Michael/AAZ-6573-2021","Overesch, Michael/0000-0002-1531-0357",,,,,39,22,22,3,16,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

It shows that because of conditional access to international credit markets, the immediate impact of an adverse shock on an emerging economy is a lower level of international reserves and a procyclical fiscal policy. However, facing the uncertainty of future shocks, the authorities in this economy then have a strong incentive to hoard more precautionary reserves if possible. If the economy successfully accumulates more reserves, it can have a lower tax rate in the second period and its fiscal policy would be more countercyclical.

The examined data contain two bust phases interrupted by a mild bullish period. Employing cointegration analysis, reported results initially indicate that changes in market performance affect the stability of long-run relations, therefore suggesting that arbitrageurs should perform rebalancing among the examined indices when a change in a market trend is evident. Furthermore, extreme market performance harms the mean-reverting properties of a potential long-run relation while moderate market performance points to cointegration between a pair of indices. However, the absence of a stationary spread does not suggest the potential of abnormal returns realization, in the short-run, through exploitation of deviations from its mean value. The applicability of our results may be of importance to market participants since the cointegration approach has recently received considerable attention by hedge funds adopting statistical arbitrage strategies.

Firms overcome the lack of adequate collateralisable firm assets in two ways: by providing personal assets as collateral for business debt, and by employing additional external equity to finance research and development projects.","[Bhaird, Ciaran Mac An] Dublin City Univ, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Lucey, Brian] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Business, Dublin 2, Ireland",Dublin City University; Trinity College Dublin,"Bhaird, CM (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, Dublin 9, Ireland.",ciaran.macanbhaird@dcu.ie,"Bhaird, Ciarán Mac an/J-9480-2019; lucey, brian/AAY-3885-2021","Bhaird, Ciarán Mac an/0000-0003-2863-3398; lucey, brian/0000-0002-4052-8235",,,,,74,124,165,2,67,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

A credible fix must take on the excessive risk-taking of financial institutions created when uninsured creditors of important financial institutions expect government protection from loss (i.e., the too-big-to-fail problem). The vast majority of SLR's recommendations constitute important contributions to addressing TBTF; the analysis offered in support of recommendations is sound and brings modern economics and finance to bear. The clarity and focus of SLR offers a model for academics writing for a policy audience. We differ in emphasis with SLR on a few issues, including capital and living wills, but support moving forward with the core of SLR's recommendations even in these cases. Legislation (i.e., Dodd-Frank) seeking to fix the financial sector became law around the time SLR was published. The legislation includes in one form or another the predominance of credible recommendations made to address TBTF, including the majority of those in SLR. The ultimate success of the legislation, however, depends on implementation. We hope the government focuses on a macroprudential regime that reduces fallout from financial spillovers, considers new efforts to measure and tax expected TBTF subsidies, and reconsiders aspects of Dodd-Frank that expand the safety net. Given the stakes, another SLR-caliber effort, this time centered on Dodd-Frank implementation, promises high returns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

An examination of one aspect of south-south international migration, Nicaraguan migrant economic integration into Costa Rica's export agriculture sector, reveals how production systems in the traditional and nontraditional agricultural sectors shape migrant social networks in distinct ways in the global south and its significance for both migrant workers and the agricultural sectors they work in. The rapid expansion of nontraditional export agriculture - the essence of agricultural development in Costa Rica - depends on the traditional crop production structure of coffee farms. The experiences of Nicaraguan migrant workers and their social ties to each other in nontraditional export agriculture and the coffee farms in Costa Rica demonstrate how different production structures call for distinct fragile and conflicted social networks ties between migrants. The economic integration of migrant workers relies on opportunistic and weak ties that are both gendered and contradictory.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Div Soc & Environm, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Lee, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Div Soc & Environm, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",salee@nature.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,47,6,9,2,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Measures of account activity substantially improve default predictions and are especially helpful for monitoring small businesses and individuals. Furthermore, early warning indications result in higher loan spreads, and in a higher likelihood of limit reductions and complete write-offs.

We find a decline in idiosyncratic risk as well as a rise in average REIT correlation during the new REIT era, from 1993 to 2008. This recent downward trend of idiosyncratic risk among REITs is different to the stylized upward trend of idiosyncratic risk among stocks. There is bi-lateral Granger causality between the market and idiosyncratic risks. Finally, we detect a positive relationship between the idiosyncratic risk and expected returns, implying that the risk premium of REITs is positively related to the idiosyncratic risk during the period new REIT era, 1993-2008.

As many newly developed and developing countries are following demographic trends of first world countries, but offset by some decades, the problem is, however, not limited to the industrialised nations. The focus of this paper is on Metro Manila and analyses travel patterns by those aged 60 or over. Trip frequency and tour complexity are analysed with ordered probit regression, separating the effects of socio-demographic characteristics as well as land-use patterns. The results are compared to observations made for cities in developed countries, in particular London as an example for a city in a first world country. We show that there is a more pronounced decrease in total trips made with increasing age in Manila. However, analysing for specific trip purposes we find, similarly to trends in developed countries, that the number of recreational trips is fairly constant in all age groups. Recreational activities also seem to take more time per day than average for younger old, possibly indicating the advent of similar active ageing trends as in industrialised nations. The paper concludes by discussing some implications given future economic trends and advocates that better datasets from developing and newly developed countries are required for urban planning in developing countries.

The nodes are the stocks, and the connections are determined by cross correlations of the variations of the stock prices, price returns and trading volumes within a chosen period of time. Specifically, a winner-take-all approach is used to determine if two nodes are connected by an edge. So far, no previous work has attempted to construct a full network of US stock prices that gives full information about their interdependence. We report that all networks based on connecting stocks of highly correlated stock prices, price returns and trading volumes, display a scalefree degree distribution. The results from this work clearly suggest that the variation of stock prices are strongly influenced by a relatively small number of stocks. We propose a new approach for selecting stocks for inclusion in a stock index and compare it with existing indexes. From the composition of the highly connected stocks, it can be concluded that the market is heavily dominated by stocks in the financial sector. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In our model, legal immigration of skilled labor is controlled through a quota, while outsourcing is determined both by the firms in response to market conditions and through policy-imposed barriers. A loosening of the immigration quota reduces outsourcing, enriches capitalists, leads to losses for native workers, and raises national income. If the nation targets an exogenously determined immigration level, the second-best outsourcing tax can be either positive or negative. If in addition to the immigration target there is a wage target arising out of income distribution concerns, an outsourcing subsidy is required. We extend the analysis to consider illegal immigration of unskilled labor. A higher legal immigration quota will lead to more (less) illegal immigration if skilled and unskilled labor are complements (substitutes) in production.","[Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu; Wall, Howard J.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO 63166 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Bandyopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, POB 442, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",bandyopadhyay@stls.frb.org; wall@stls.frb.org,"Wall, Howard/HCG-8393-2022; Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/I-5739-2016","Wall, Howard/0000-0003-0411-9749; Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/0000-0003-1626-6543",,,,,8,4,4,2,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

However, it is unclear whether this is evidence of a generalized aversion to rewards or, rather, an aversion to receiving specific material prizes, such as cash. We conducted a randomized-controlled experiment, through a survey administered to 467 blood donors in an Italian town, and found that donors are not reluctant to receive compensation in general; a substantial share of respondents declared that they would stop being donors if given 10 Euros in cash, but we do not find such effects when a voucher of the same nominal value is offered instead. The aversion to direct cash payments is particularly marked among women, but does not emerge among individuals who have only recently become donors. All of our findings are robust to regression analyses. Implications for research and public policy are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The authors also give particular attention to the special problems that arise when the policy rate reaches the zero lower bound. They show that it is possible within a single unified framework to identify the criteria for policy to be optimal along each dimension.

The reaction of exchange rate returns to news is very quick and occurs within the first 5 min of the release with very little reaction in the 15 min before and after. These findings show that exchange rates are strongly linked to fundamentals in the 5-min intervals immediately following the data release.

To understand who supports and opposes foreign aid, we utilize theories of foreign economic policy preferences. By examining different types of aid policy, we show that domestic politics and especially the distributional consequences of economic aid can matter. The economic characteristics of a district and its left-right ideological predispositions influence support for aid in a systematic fashion over the nearly 25-year period.

Estimation of the worker's multi-choice migration problem shows that previously unobserved employer covariates are significant predictors associated with migration flows. These results support the idea that globalization acts on internal migration through job stability at exporting establishments and employment opportunities at locations with a concentration of foreign owned establishments. A 1% increase in exporter employment predicts a 0.3% reduced probability of migration.

We identify the economic factors employing a semistructural regime-switching model for state variables such as interest rates, inflation, the output gap, and cash flow growth. We also view risk aversion, uncertainty about inflation and output, and liquidity proxies as additional potential factors. We find that macroeconomic fundamentals contribute little to explaining stock and bond return correlations but that other factors, especially liquidity proxies, play a more important role. The macro factors are still important in fitting bond return volatility, whereas the variance premium is critical in explaining stock return volatility. However, the factor model primarily fails in fitting covariances.","[Baele, Lieven] Tilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Bekaert, Geert] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Bekaert, Geert] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Inghelbrecht, Koen] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; [Inghelbrecht, Koen] Univ Coll Ghent, Ghent, Belgium",Tilburg University; Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Ghent University; HOGENT University College of Applied Sciences & Arts,"Baele, L (通讯作者)，Dept Finance, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",Lieven.Baele@uvt.nl,,,,,,,66,230,253,2,68,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The proposed regime includes increasing the availability of water in the dry season, increasing irrigation frequency water sharing with downstream water users, set against the introduction of a semi-volumetric irrigation price. The majority of farmers chose the status quo (SQ) option. Given the large heterogeneity in farmers' SQ water availability irrigation practices and current water tax payments, the SQ could not be given a unique baseline interpretation. This poses a potential problem for choice model estimation. By coding the individual SQ situation of farmers, we observed considerable increase in the explanatory power of the choice experiment models. The results may be of general interest for choice experiments of environmental goods and services with heterogeneous spatial distribution, heterogeneous respondents and/or contentious policies that are expected to elicit considerable SQ response.","[Barton, David N.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Bergland, Olvar] Univ Life Sci IOR UMB, Inst Econ & Resource Studies, N-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Barton, DN (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",david.barton@nina.no,,,,,,,35,29,33,2,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Drawing on innovation search theory and the literatures on licensing and absorptive capacity (AC) we address the issue of the factors that affect how technologically distant from the existing technological portfolio in-licensing firms are able to move when they in-license externally developed technologies. We posit that a long technological distance reflects the outcome of more exploratory search, while a short distance reflects the outcome of exploitative search. We conjecture two distinct dimensions of AC in terms of the firms' stock of knowledge (assimilation capacity) and the degree to which firms have searched broadly in the past (monitoring ability) to affect the distance of exploration from the existing technological portfolio. Furthermore, we compare firms that explore through licensing and firms which do not explore through licensing, but do so through search reflected in own patenting activities. We propose that the effects of assimilation capacity and monitoring ability should be more pronounced for licensees. Combining data on 176 license agreements and related patent information and while using a control sample of non-licensing firms we find-with exceptions-support for these ideas.","[Laursen, Keld] Copenhagen Business Sch, DRUID, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, DK-2000 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Leone, Maria Isabella] LUMSA, Dept Law, I-00192 Rome, Italy; [Torrisi, Salvatore] Univ Bologna, Dept Management, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Torrisi, Salvatore] KITES Bocconi Univ, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Copenhagen Business School; Universita LUMSA; University of Bologna; Bocconi University,"Laursen, K (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, DRUID, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, DK-2000 Copenhagen, Denmark.",kl.ino@cbs.dk; mleone@luiss.it; torrisi@unibo.it,"Leone, Maria Isabella/AAP-7364-2020; Laursen, Keld/A-3441-2009","TORRISI, SALVATORE/0000-0003-4194-5644; Laursen, Keld/0000-0002-2763-3989",,,,,54,90,99,2,70,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

These typically include economic rationalism, political competition or power struggles, and policy imitation of the kind that diffuses across spatially proximate neighbors In this paper, we ex-amine the factors that have influenced a recent local policy trend in California inclusionary zoning (IZ). IZ programs require developers to make a certain percentage of the minus within their market-rate residential developments affordable to low- or moderate-income households. By 2007, 68 percent of jurisdictions in the San Francisco Bay Area had adopted some type of 17 policy. We test the relative importance of economic, political, and spatial factors in explaining the rapid diffusion of 17, across 100 cities and towns in the Bay Area. Consistent with an economic efficiency argument, results of hazard models provide some evidence that IZ is adopted in places with less affordable housing. However, political factors, such as partisan affiliation and the strength of affordable housing nonprofits, are even more robust predictors of whether or not a local government adopts IZ. There is no evidence of spatial diffusion in the case of IZ adoption; jurisdictions are not, on average, responding to the behavior of their neighbors.

This satisfaction stands for the essence of the achieved economic actions. On the other hand, the consumer has become prudent, exigent and determined while selecting the goods and this is due to the fact that s/he has acquired extensive knowledge on the issue that allows her/him to use an adequate competence level to be able to set the directions that mostly fit her/his interests. The modern product's success on the market is triggered by the simultaneous use ( which means conception and distribution) of a wide range of knowledge, methods and managerial tools, not only in a systemic and systematic approach, but also in a global one, too. The eco-design, seen as a managerial tool, influences a surprisingly big number of company parameters, starting from its public particularities and image, then, getting through the practical aspects of the offered product range, the impact and the efficiency of the distribution means, and continuing with the methods used to communicate with customers and with their own employees. The present paper will refer not only to the eco-design applied to the concrete products destined to the individual clients or to the end users from the consumption markets, but to the necessity of applying an eco-design strategy means developing innovative products with a high effectiveness, which promote sustainable consumption and environmental protection. To this purpose, an ecological product could be a social, educational factor, and eco-design should be a pro-active approach on its way to legal complacency and consumer protection.","[Pamfilie, Rodica; Procopie, Roxana; Bobe, Magdalena] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Bobe, M (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",magdalena.bobe@com.ase.ro,"Procopie, Roxana/ABC-8593-2020; Azonnoudo, Seyido/ISU-7505-2023","Procopie, Roxana/0000-0002-2295-0678;",,,,,17,4,4,0,20,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,12.0,28,,,,,454,465,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279314000014,0

We find that the regulations creating tCERs partially internalize the carbon sequestration function of the forest. The amount of carbon re-released into the atmosphere, due to timber harvest, and sequestered, after the project period, is not internalized in the private landowner's decision, which induces shorter rotation intervals than socially optimal. Furthermore, the carbon sequestered during the project is over-credited because credits are counted based on accumulated carbon instead of marginally sequestered carbon, which induces longer rotations intervals. Simulation results for the Philippines and Tanzania show that the difference in social welfare between the tCERs system and a socially optimal policy is only about 2% because of the countervailing effect of the inefficiencies on rotation interval choices.","[Galinato, Gregmar I.] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Uchida, Shinsuke] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",Washington State University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Galinato, GI (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",ggalinato@wsu.edu; suchida@arec.umd.edu,,"Uchida, Shinsuke/0000-0002-2803-4734",,,,,29,8,10,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This exploration calls for a set of concepts that developed as analytical tools of their own, primarily transaction costs and contracts.

However, the effectiveness of BITs in inducing higher FDI inflows is still open to debate. It is in several ways that we attempt to clarify the inconclusive empirical findings of earlier studies. We cover a much larger sample of host and source countries by drawing on an extensive data set on bilateral FDI flows. Furthermore, we account for unilateral FDI liberalization, in order not to overestimate the effect of BITs, as well as for the potential endogeneity of BITs. Employing a gravity-type model and various model specifications, including an instrumental variable approach, we find that BITs do promote FDI flows to developing countries.

The lack of post-taking accountability tends to create power ripe for abuse, and RR appears to be an effective device for constraining Leviathan's opportunism.

We analyze inflation risk in a framework that encompasses the International Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) of Adler and Dumas (1983). In contrast to the extant empirical literature on the ICAPM, we relax the assumption that inflation rates are constant. We estimate and test a conditional version of the model for the G5 countries (France, Germany, Japan. the UK, and the US) over the period 1975-1998 and find evidence of statistically and economically significant prices of inflation risk (in addition to priced nominal exchange rate risk). Our results imply a rejection of the restrictions imposed by the ICAPM. In an extension of our analysis to 2003, we show that even after the termination of nominal exchange rate fluctuations in the euro area in 1999, differences in inflation rates across countries entail non-trivial real exchange rate risk premia.

The main conclusions are that (1) indirect taxes are regressive with respect to disposable income but proportional or progressive with respect to total expenditures, and (2) indirect taxes are in any case less progressive than other components of the tax system, making the proposed measure a regressive one.

This study looks at the effects of the minimum wage on the prices of UK goods and services by comparing prices of goods and services produced by industries in which UK minimum-wage workers make up a substantial share of total costs with prices of goods and services that make less use of minimum-wage labour. Using sectoral-level price data matched to Labour Force Survey data on the share of minimum-wage workers in each sector, it is hard to find much evidence of significant price changes in the months that correspond immediately to the uprating of the national minimum wage. However, over the longer term, prices in several minimum-wage sectors - notably, take-away food, canteen meals, hotel services and domestic services - do appear to have risen significantly faster than prices in non-minimum-wage sectors. These effects were particularly significant in the four years immediately after the introduction of the minimum wage.","[Wadsworth, Jonathan] Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Wadsworth, Jonathan] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany",University of London; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Wadsworth, J (通讯作者)，Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England.",j.wadsworth@rhul.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,32,9,11,1,21,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Rational investors are unlikely to value safeguards against unlikely events. Yet, few studies of the relation between governance and firm value control for investor perceptions of the likelihood of agency conflicts. Shleifer and Vishny [Shleifer, A., Vishny, R-W., 1997. A survey of corporate governance. journal of Finance 52, 737-783] identify investment-related agency conflicts as the more severe type of agency conflicts in the US. We measure the perceived likelihood of this type of agency conflict using free cash flow (Jensen, M.C., 1986. Agency costs of free cash flow, corporate finance, and takeovers. American Economic Review 76, 323-329). We find that firm value is an increasing function of improved governance quality among firms with high free cash flow. In contrast, governance benefits are lower or insignificant among firms with low free cash flow. We show that not controlling for this conditional relation between governance and firm value could lead to erroneous conclusions that governance and firm value are unrelated. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper revisits the issue from the vantage point of close to two decades of additional experience by examining a sample of foreign IPOs-firms from both financially integrated and segmented markets-in U.S. markets. The evidence indicates that signaling does matter in determining IPO underpricing, especially for firms domiciled in countries with segmented markets, which as a result face higher information asymmetry and lack access to external capital markets. We find a significant positive and robust relationship between the degree of IPO underpricing and segmented-market firms' seasoned equity offering (SEO) activities. For firms from integrated markets, in contrast, the analyst-coverage purchase hypothesis appears to matter more in explaining IPO underpricing, and the aftermarket price appreciation explains these firms' SEO activities. The evidence, therefore, clearly supports the notion that some firms are willing to leave money on the table voluntarily to get a more favorable price at seasoned offerings when they are substantially wealth constrained, a prediction embedded in the signaling hypothesis.","[Francis, Bill B.; Hasan, Iftekhar] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Lally Sch Management & Technol, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Hasan, Iftekhar] Bank Finland, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Lothian, James R.] Fordham Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Sun, Xian] Johns Hopkins Univ, Carey Business Sch, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; Bank of Finland; Fordham University; Johns Hopkins University,"Francis, BB (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Lally Sch Management & Technol, 110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",francb@rpi.edu; hasan@rpi.edu; lothian@fordham.edu; xian.sun@jhu.edu,"Hasan, Iftekhar/IUM-3182-2023","Hasan, Iftekhar/0000-0003-2469-0539",,,,,34,41,48,3,37,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Because credit market imperfections mute this effect, the extent to which house spending predicts future income measures the imperfectness of mortgage markets.

Results suggest that CRP participation had the largest effects in the Mountain, Southern Plains, and Northern Plains regions, where it increased average farmland values by 5% to 14%, 4% to 6%, and 2% to 5%, respectively. The CRP also had a statistically significant effect on developed land values, but the percentage increases were smaller. Implications of the results for the design of conservation programs are discussed.

An interesting setting for research is developing economies, because of the nature of changes characterizing their economical and accounting environment. The issue of accounting change is a fruitful field of research for management accounting (Atkinson et al., 1997), yet little is known regarding the practice of management accounting (change) in Romania. The purpose of this paper is in this context, to explore and understand the process of fabrication (in Latourian terms) of management accounting systems in several Romanian companies. Data for this study were collected between 2005 and 2010 from 20 companies acting in the constructions field. We find that an originally-well designed and internally-supported system may be detracted from its initial purposes and use via complex relationships between the actors constituting the project's network (each of whom are animated by their own interests). This is a testimony about management accounting change and failure in our country.","[Albu, Catalin Nicolae; Albu, Nadia; Guinea, Flavius Andrei] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,catalin.albu@cig.ase.ro,"Albu, Nadia/AAT-5491-2020; Albu, Catalin/A-5735-2010; Guinea, Flavius Andrei/C-6477-2017","Albu, Nadia/0000-0003-2953-9619; Albu, Catalin/0000-0002-3282-8414;",,,,,44,0,0,0,4,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,531,554,,,,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100033,0

The main goal of our study is to analyze the role of the availability heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman [1973, 1974]) in financial markets. The availability heuristic refers to people's tendency to determine the likelihood of an event according to the easiness of recalling similar instances and, thus, to overweight current information as opposed to processing all relevant information. We define and test two aspects of the availability heuristic, which we dub outcome and risk-availability. The former deals with the availability of positive and negative investment outcomes and the latter with the availability of financial risk. We test the availability effect on investors' reactions to analyst recommendation revisions. Employing daily market returns as a proxy for outcome availability, we find that positive stock price reactions to recommendation upgrades are stronger when accompanied by positive stock market index returns, and negative stock price reactions to recommendation downgrades are stronger when accompanied by negative stock market index returns. The magnitude of the outcome availability effect is negatively correlated with firms' market capitalization, and positively correlated with stock beta, as well as with historical return volatility. Regarding risk availability, we find that on days of substantial stock market moves, abnormal stock price reactions to upgrades are weaker, and abnormal stock price reactions to downgrades are stronger. Both availability effects remain significant even after controlling for additional company-specific and event-specific factors, including market capitalization, stock beta, historical volatility of stock returns, cumulative excess stock returns over one month preceding the recommendation revision, rating category before the revision, and number of categories changed in the revision.","[Kudryavtsev, Andrey] Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Kudryavtsev, A (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",kud.andrey@gmail.com,,,,,,,47,49,63,7,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

To minimise these risks, many governments around the world have developed ex-post insolvency remedies, including, most importantly, debt-restructuring mechanisms. In an effort to resurrect borrowing for local infrastructure development, the Indonesian government has designed and begun to implement debt-restructuring programs for sub-national government and sub-national government-owned water supply company defaulters. These programs constitute a major effort to reform an important, long-neglected and problematic aspect of sub-national public finances in Indonesia. There are a number of potential difficulties with the design and execution of the reforms, however, which collectively do not inspire much optimism for rapid progress in reviving financial flows to the sub-national public sector.

We will proceed along two routes, one conceptual and one temporal/contextual. Using time-series cross-section data from 132 countries between 1977-2006 we find that Ross' theory does not stand the test of time, and that a broader conceptual take on the notion of democracy has left the theory more inconclusive than in previous studies.

Authors use deduction and synthesize the SSME knowledge to formulate particular suggestions for changes in education process on the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences, Prague. Employees for service sector need more than one basic specialization. Enterprises need T-shaped professionals. T-shaped professional has three knowledge areas which create letter T. The base is being created by comprehensive knowledge of one specialization (usually excellent technological knowledge). Shoulders of letter T are being created by two additional specializations (usually management and soft skills). Modern studying specializations contain all these three components. There is a long history of academic and industrial interest in the service sector - starting with Adam Smith and continuing right up to the present day. Yet most such interest in service has focused narrowly on marketing or management or economics.

A subnational comparison of land struggles among the Diaguita Calchaqui in Tucuman and the Mbya Guarani in Misiones shows that changing global and national opportunity structures, most prominently a new multicultural citizenship regime, set the stage for indigenous mobilisation. In turn, local transformations of capitalist development motivate indigenous mobilising efforts, whereas leadership patterns and state-movement relations shape the capacity to mobilise. Diaguita and Mbya mobilisation reveals that indigenous movements play a central role in the activation of formal citizenship rights and the contestation of dominant notions of poverty.

Compared to standard OLS estimation, the jackknifing procedure delivers virtually unbiased estimates with mean squared errors that generally dominate those of the OLS estimates. The jackknifing method is very general, as well as simple to implement, and can be applied to models with multiple predictors and overlapping observations. Unlike most previous work on inference in predictive regressions, no specific assumptions regarding the data generating process for the predictors are required. A set of Monte Carlo experiments show that the method works well in finite samples and the empirical section finds that out-of-sample forecasts based on the jackknife estimates tend to outperform those based on the plain OLS estimates. The improved forecast ability also translates into economically relevant welfare gains for an investor who uses the predictive regression, with jackknife estimates, to time the market.

This paper provides a unifying conceptual framework to characterize three major factors affecting the changes in vertical coordination arrangements (transaction, production, and management costs). Regulation and government policy have altered these determinants of organizational change. Transaction costs have been reduced by state intervention into the price for green leaf which subsequently lowered the risk of processors re-negotiating prices downward. Production costs, which continue to be dominated by labor expenses due to the lack of technological developments for harvesting, have increased more for plantations than independent producers due to union pressures.

The systemic risk is measured by the price of insurance against financial distress, which is based on ex ante measures of default probabilities of individual banks and forecasted asset return correlations. Importantly, using realized correlations estimated from high-frequency equity return data can significantly improve the accuracy of forecasted correlations. Our stress testing methodology, using an integrated micro-macro model, takes into account dynamic linkages between the health of major US banks and macro-financial conditions. Our results suggest that the theoretical insurance premium that would be charged to protect against losses that equal or exceed 15% of total liabilities of 12 major US financial firms stood at $110 billion in March 2008 and had a projected upper bound of $250 billion in July 2008.

They not only use energy in a direct way (gas, electricity and fuel) but also in an indirect way (embedded in the production, consumption and disposal of goods). During a period of five months (viz., October 2002-March 2003), direct and indirect energy use and direct and indirect energy savings of 189 Dutch households were monitored. The study examined the relative importance of socio-demographic variables and psychological variables in relation to household energy use and changes in energy use (viz., energy savings). For this purpose, variables from the theory of planned behavior [Ajzen, 1. (1991). The theory of planned behavior. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 179-211] and the norm activation model [Schwartz, S. H. (1977). Normative influences on altruism. in L. Berkowitz (Ed.). Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 10, pp. 221-279). New York: Academic Press] were used. Results indicate that energy use is determined by socio-demographic variables, whereas changes in energy use, which may require some form of (cognitive) effort, appear to be related to psychological variables. The variables from the norm activation model were able to significantly add to the explanation of energy savings, over and above the variables from the theory of planned behavior. Also, different types of energy use and energy savings appeared to be related to different sets of determinants. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We employ a Bayesian model averaging procedure on a wide range of models which differ in several dimensions to account for the uncertainty that the policymaker faces when setting the monetary policy and evaluating its effect on real economy. We find evidence of a high degree of dispersion across models in both policy rule parameters and impulse response functions. Moreover, monetary policy shocks have very similar recessionary effects on the two economies with a different role played by the participation rate in the transmission mechanism. Finally, we show that a policymaker who does not take model uncertainty into account and selects the results on the basis of a single model may come to misleading conclusions not only about the transmission mechanism, but also about the differences between the euro area and the United States, which are on average essentially small.","[Altavilla, Carlo] Univ Naples Parthenope, Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples,"Altavilla, C (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Naples, Italy.",altavilla@uniparthenope.it; matteo.ciccarelli@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,39,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Adam Smith's dictum that the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market has created difficulties when applied to a division of labor among firms (rather than within a firm). The problems are both for analytical attempts to formalize it and for empirical attempts to test it. Bresnahan and Gambardella show that the Smith-Stigler theorem holds when the extent of the market is defined in terms of the number of users instead of simply the total size of demand; therefore, division of labor is increasing in the number of users and decreasing in the average size of users. This article provides an empirical test of Bresnahan and Gambardella's theoretical argument, using data from the chemical industry. The chemical industry shows systematic variation across technologies and countries in the extent of the division of labor in plant design and engineering. We develop an empirical model in which large firms decide whether to build plants using in-house resources or to contract out, and small chemical firms also decide whether to invest in a plant. The number of specialized suppliers of plant design and engineering services (SEFs) vary with the demand for their services. The empirical results support the predictions of Bresnahan and Gambardella. We find that the number of SEFs increases when the market expands through an increase in the number of potential buyers but not when the market expansion is due to an increase in the average size of buyers. Moreover, an increase in the share of large-firm investment decreases small-firm investment, which decreases the number of SEFs. In turn, this further depresses small firm investment.","[Arora, Ashish] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Cambridge, MA USA",Duke University,"Arora, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Cambridge, MA USA.",ashish.arora@duke.edu; william.b.vogt@gmail.com; jiwoongy@khu.ac.kr,"arora, ashish/A-2513-2008; arora, ashish/M-1720-2013","arora, ashish/0000-0001-5097-8646",,,,,20,4,7,2,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We use the results from a LES estimation to calculate the consumption reductions, compensating variations and excess tax burdens of three different tax schemes: one linear and two non-linear. Unless the tax scheme is optimally designed to correct for externalities, there is a conflict of interests between the aims of reduced consumption and efficient policy-making. When ranking different tax schemes, there is a conflict between the aims of redistributing welfare and reduced consumption if we are concerned with the well-being of individual households, but not if we are concerned only with the mean household in different parts of the income distribution.","Stat Norway, Res Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Halvorsen, B (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, Kongensgate 6,POB 8131, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",bente.halvorsen@ssb.no,,,,,,,24,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

One of the most striking results is that many negative (positive) alpha funds, measured relative to the CAPM risk adjustments, would be reclassified as positive (negative) alpha funds using a model with coskewness. Therefore, performance ranking based on risk-adjusted returns without considering coskewness could generate an erroneous classification. Moreover, some fund characteristics, such as turnover ratio or category, are related to the likelihood of managing coskewness. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, candidates in different districts face widely different advertising prices and this paper shows that differences in advertising costs are one source of the apparent ineffectiveness of campaign spending.

This holds up; the pace of the process differs by type of venture as do, in line with theory-based hypotheses, the effects of certain human capital (HC) and social capital (SC) predictors. Importantly, and somewhat unexpectedly, the theoretically derived models using HC, SC, and certain controls are relatively successful explaining progress in the creation process for the minority of innovative ventures, but achieve very limited success for the imitative majority. This may be due to a rationalistic bias in conventional theorizing and suggests that there is need for considerable theoretical development regarding the important phenomenon of new venture creation processes. Another important result is that the building up of instrumental social capital, which we assess comprehensively and as a time variant construct, is important for making progress with both types of ventures, and increasingly, so as the process progresses. This result corroborates with stronger operationalization and more appropriate analysis method what previously published research has only been able to hint at.","[Samuelsson, Mikael] Stockholm Sch Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Samuelsson, Mikael; Davidsson, Per] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, SE-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Davidsson, Per] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane Grad Sch Business, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Stockholm School of Economics; Jonkoping University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Samuelsson, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, POB 6501, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",mikael.samuelsson@hhs.se; per.davidsson@qut.edu.au,"Davidsson, Per E L/I-9989-2012; Samuelsson, Mikael/AAS-1775-2021","Samuelsson, Mikael/0000-0003-4349-9895; Davidsson, Per/0000-0002-6363-1382",,,,,127,150,171,1,65,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We first propose rigorous definitions of the BGE for multiple regions and under uncertainty. We show that the change in the BGE is independent of the assumed scenario of per capita income. For comparable welfare economic assumptions as the Stern Review, we calculate lower changes in BGE between a business as usual scenario and one without climate impacts with the model FUND than the Stern Review found with the model PAGE. We find that mitigation policies give even lower changes in BGE and argue that those policy choices should be the focus of the research effort rather than total damage estimates. According to our results, the current carbon tax should be below $55/tC. Sensitivity analyses show that the Stern Review chose parameters that imply high impact estimates. However, for regionally disaggregated welfare functions, we find changes in BGE that are significantly higher than the results from the Stern Review both for total damage as for policy analysis. With regional disaggregation and high risk aversion, we observe fat tails and with that very high welfare losses.","[Anthoff, David] Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling, Hamburg, Germany; [Anthoff, David; Tol, Richard S.

Since the early 1980s, the most important changes in the Fed's conduct of monetary policy refer to the role of the federal funds rate target and the reserve requirement system. We show that the improved communication and transparency regarding the federal funds rate target has significantly increased the Fed's influence on the federal funds rate since 1994. By contrast, the declining role of required reserves in the US has contributed to higher federal funds rate volatility. Our results suggest that the introduction of remunerated required reserves will further enhance the controllability of the federal funds rate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

With this approach, we find robust evidence of information asymmetry in both coverage area and coverage amount choices, which we could not find with the dichotomous measurement approach.

The Armington framework (source-differentiation) is often used when estimating import demand for a similar product from different sources; however, the results of this study indicated that country of origin is not a factor in the Netherlands when importing Nile perch. Results showed that the responsiveness of importers to price changes was the same regardless to the supplying country.

This is because household borrowing is likely to reveal information regarding the credit constraints faced by households. Moreover, debt may also give information on expected income growth and interest rate movements. The aim of this study is to examine empirically if household borrowing data, indeed, is of importance in a dynamic housing price model. In line with the prior expectations, it is found that housing appreciation in the Helsinki Metropolitan area is Granger caused by the household debt-to-GDP ratio both in the short and in the long run. Causality from the housing market to credit, in turn, seems to run only through a cointegrating long-run relation. While the estimated long-run relation between housing prices, income and debt-to-GDP ratio appears to have remained stable through the sample period (1975Q1-2006Q2), the short-run dynamics changed somewhat due to the financial liberalization in the late 1980s. The stability of the long-run relation implies that the loan data are able to cater, at least to a notable extent, for the effect of the changes in Finnish households' liquidity constraints on housing demand. In line with previous literature, it is also found that housing price adjustment is sluggish and includes notable backward-looking features. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

By exploiting a data set in which we observe a measure of a borrower's default risk that the lenders observe only imperfectly, we find evidence of these informational improvements. Mergers lead to a closer correspondence between interest rates and individual default risk: after a merger, risky borrowers experience an increase in the interest rate, while nonrisky borrowers enjoy lower interest rates. These informational benefits appear to derive from improvements in information processing resulting from the merger, rather than from explicit information sharing on individual customers among the merging parties. Our evidence suggests that part of these informational improvements stem from the consolidated banks using hard information more intensively.","[Schivardi, Fabiano] Univ Cagliari, EIEF, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy; [Shum, Matthew] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",University of Cagliari; California Institute of Technology,,fabio.panetta@bancaditalia.it; fschivardi@unica.it; mshum@caltech.edu,,"SCHIVARDI, FABIANO/0000-0001-7708-1011",,,,,37,28,35,1,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Moreover, because the probability of default is specified as a function of the age of the contract, the model provides sonic information on the timing of the defaults.

In Study 1, both justice motives predicted equally well the decision for an equal allocation, whereas the explicit justice motive predicted the avoidance of an egoistic allocation. A similar pattern of results emerged in Study 2. Additionally, the explicit but not the implicit justice motive covaried with social desirability, and social desirability explained the decision for equality and the avoidance of an egoistic allocation just as well as the explicit justice motive. Finally, allocation decisions were better explained in Study 2, where real money was at stake. The findings support the idea that allocation decisions can best be understood by taking the just world justice motive and social desirability into account. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A far-sighted planner chooses the high-growth strategy, unless damages are irreversible in which case the cautious strategy again dominates. Regulatory options in the market economy are investigated.

Estimating a dynamic factor model for 404 inflation sub-indices of the euro area CPI allows to decompose the dynamics of inflation sub-indices into a part due to a common macroeconomic shock and to sector specific idiosyncratic shocks. Although idiosyncratic shocks dominate the variance of sectoral prices, one common factor appears to be the main driver of aggregate dynamics. In addition, the heterogenous propagation of this common shock across sectoral inflation rates, and in particular its slow propagation to inflation rates Of Services, generates the persistence of aggregate inflation. We conclude that the aggregation mechanism explains a significant amount of aggregate inflation persistence. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates whether and how rating agencies respond to such pressure and criticism. We find that the rating agencies not only improve rating timeliness, but also increase rating accuracy and reduce rating volatility. Our findings support the criticism that, in the past, rating agencies did not avail themselves of the best rating methodologies/efforts possible. When their market power is threatened by the possibility of increased regulatory intervention and/or reputation concerns, rating agencies respond by improving their credit analysis.

Proponents of book-tax conformity argue that the current dual system in the U.S. allows firms to simultaneously manage their taxable income downward while managing their book income upward. By requiring book-tax conformity, they contend that firms will be forced to trade off reporting high earnings numbers to shareholders and reporting low earnings to the taxing authority, resulting in improved financial reporting and less tax avoidance. Reduced compliance costs and easier auditing have also been cited as potential benefits of book tax conformity. However, before one can evaluate the costs and benefits of book-tax conformity it is necessary to understand international implications Of conformity, particularly regarding the foreign operations of U.S. multinationals. We describe several possible approaches to implementing book-tax conformity for firms that have both domestic and foreign operations. We discuss issues likely to arise with each approach and conjecture at the behavioral responses to each. Using firm-level financial data from Compustat, we simulate the effects of book-tax conformity on publicly traded U.S. firms. Specifically, we simulate the effects of book-tax conformity oil the level and variability of tax payments/collections.","[Hanlon, Michelle] Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Maydew, Edward L.] Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Hanlon, M (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,,29,16,18,1,28,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

A decline in the number of partisan voters in a constituency results in greater campaign spending by the candidates. If the voters are risk-averse, the candidates who maximize their expected office rents minus the cost of campaigning will choose divergent policy platforms strategically in order to reduce the costs of subsequent campaign spending.

My argument is that exogenous shocks to the inflation rates in industrialized economies have not produced the permanent change to inflation necessary for testing the Fisher effect. Instead of finding a nonstationary, unit-root process for inflation like previous Fisher effect studies, here each country's inflation rate is found to follow a mean-reverting, fractionally integrated, long-memory process. Applying a bivariate, maximum likelihood estimator to a multivariate, fractionally integrated model of inflation and nominal interest, I find that the estimated inflation rates in 17 developed countries are highly persistent, fractionally integrated, mean-reverting processes with order of integration parameters significantly less than one. Since a permanent change to inflation has not occurred, a test of whether a permanent change to inflation affects the nominal interest rate one-for-one will be uninformative as to the truth or fallacy of the Fisher effect hypothesis.","Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Jensen, MJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA.",Mark.Jensen@atl.frb.org,"Jensen, Mark/N-7285-2018",,,,,,32,13,13,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Since then it suffered some modifications and completions. For the hotels and the restaurants sector, a special interest is given by the completions brought by the Mandate no. 149/2006. Positions and the base callings were established in 1995. This way there has been established denominations such as hotel reception chief, hotel receptionist, concierge, executive/supervisor housekeeper and chamber maid; executive chef, cook, head waiter (maitre d'hotel)and waiter. Subsequently were added other positions and vocations such as hotel director, rooms division manager, restaurant director, sommelier and hotel animator. Still, in the professional language we register some other positions, such as revenue manager, front office manager, night auditor, porter and host/hostess.

We find two main results. First, on average, and at least in the sample 1991-2004, one international common factor explains between 15% and 30% of the variance of consumer prices (depending on the transformation applied to the data). Given the high level of disaggregation of our panel, this estimate is best viewed as a lower bound for the contribution of international factors to inflation dynamics. Second, we find a strongly positive and statistically significant relationship between exposure of consumer inflation to international shocks and trade openness at the sectoral level. The latter result holds regardless of whether the original data are expressed in local as opposed to common currency.","[Monacelli, Tommaso; Sala, Luca] Univ Bocconi, IGIER, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Monacelli, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, IGIER, Milan, Italy.",,,"SALA, LUCA/0000-0001-8528-031X",,,,,26,41,44,0,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Only a small amount of gross advertising expectancy was spended to acquire elderly people. But amongst all European societies Germany is the one that is ageing the most/fastest. Due to decreasing birth-rates, an escalating life expectation as well as a declining population rate the elderly will be numerically exceeding the younger generation in only a few years time, so that, for the first time in Germany's history, the generation 50plus is going to be the largest section of the population. This also poses challenges for the German economy. Although the potential of the 50plus market is already well-known to enterprises, it seems problematic for them to utilize it. The distinctive heterogeneity of the generation 50plus, its high expectations and the apprehension of image and turnover losses among younger target groups when addressing marketing strategies at the elderly still decelerates the exploitation of this profitable market segment. Taking the line of the least resistance is therefore commonly preferred this very day, so that, albeit the demographic trend, marketing activities often are still focussed on younger target groups. This raises the question which effects the demographic change should have on supply, service and communication strategies of the enterprises. It proves very difficult to include the age of consumers as a subject of communication. The term senior marketing has an unpleasant taste to it. The authors furnish proof of the fact that the generation 50plus is of great importance for the marketing in the near future. Communication strategies, especially for a focussed advertisement for different elderly target groups, are recommended, exemplified by the automotive sector.","[Baer, Soeren] Saxon Univ Cooperat Educ State Acad Riesa, Orchideenweg 5, D-04827 Gerichshain, Germany; [Eilemann, Kristina] Univ Bernburg, Fac Econ, Saxon ]Anhalt Univ Appl Sci, D-16348 Wandlitz, Germany",,"Bär, S (通讯作者)，Saxon Univ Cooperat Educ State Acad Riesa, Orchideenweg 5, D-04827 Gerichshain, Germany.",soerenbaer@web.de; k.eilemann@gmx.de,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,5,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,31,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000003,0

Further, there are derived dynamic parameters which measure the share of intensive and extensive factors in economic growth.

Controlling for the assessed value of the property and length of residential ownership, we find strong evidence that all three measures of expressive behavior are statistically significant predictors of a greater likelihood of voting than occurred at residences showing no evidence of these expressive behaviors. These findings suggest that voting may be more completely understood not as politically-expressive behavior but, rather, as a generally expressive tendency that happens on occasion to be manifested in a political context. That is, an understanding of why some people vote and others do not may require an understanding of why some individuals are more expressive (generally speaking) than others.","[Laband, David N.; Pandit, Ram] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Sophocleus, John P.] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Montgomery, AL 36124 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University System; Auburn University Montgomery; Auburn University,"Laband, DN (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, 602 Duncan Dr, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",labandn@auburn.edu; pandira@auburn.edu; sophocls@yahoo.com,,"Pandit, Ram/0000-0003-4053-5694",,,,,24,14,16,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2009,138.0,1-2,,,,,97,108,,10.1007/s11127-008-9341-7,0.0,,,12,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,378SH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000261343700008,0

On this aspect, many multinational corporations have established different effective cross-cultivation modes. Studying these successful modes will provide important revelations to Chinese corporations on their way of globalization. They could overcome the cross-cultural obstacles and adapt to the demand towards globalization. The paper describes acculturation phases in the context of cross-culture communication. Starting from the research trends of acculturation, the paper introduces patterns of acculturation, points out acculturation problems existing in multinational corporations, and finally proposes acculturation strategies to be implemented in cross cultural management.

Though, in case of tax administrations the Risk Management process can help identify the different steps in the decision-making process, in order to allow to make explicit and educated decisions, in each stage of the process before moving on to the next one. As a result, Risk Management can allow tax administrations to better measure the quality of each of the individual stages of the decision-making process, making it easier to detect mistakes and to: achieve equal treatment of the taxpayers; focus the burden of audit to non-compliant taxpayers; best use of the available human, financial and technical resources; increase the level of voluntary compliance of taxpayers; adjust available resources to the levels of risks; weigh the possibilities that a compliant taxpayer could become noncompliant.","[Toma, Andrei; Cindea, Diana Marieta] Univ Lucian Blaga Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,,andrei.toma@mfinante.ro,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,623,629,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000095,0

Based on event study methodology, we analyze the abnormal fluctuation of share prices in the event window of relevant information disclosure. The cumulative average abnormal return (CAAR) showed the market had a significant antedating reaction to the event and the market efficiency is not high enough to avoid insider trading. Furthermore, we apply principal component analysis to examine other factors, in the semi-annual report, that might also influence share prices fluctuation.

The value of shame education is that it is the foundation of the concept of what is right or wrong, the representation of self-esteem, the spirit's force to defend against unhealthy temptation, the starting point of moral education. We can cultivate students' shame through cultivating their concept of what is right or wrong, self-esteem, sense of honor and responsibility.","[Zhang Xu] Cent S Univ Forestry & Technol, Coll Forestry, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Central South University of Forestry & Technology,,csfuzzf@163.com,"Li, Fan/JRY-4017-2023",,,,,,7,1,1,0,1,M & D FORUM,ALLAWAH,"17 AUGUSTA STREET, ALLAWAH, NSW 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-1-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,233,239,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BOT96,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277573000043,0

Despite the voluminous literature on this subject, we have a limited understanding of those structural features of the models that are important in practice. Given that the key distinguishing characteristic of the affine models is the specification of the conditional volatility of the factors, we explore models that have critical differences in this respect: Gaussian (constant volatility) and stochastic volatility models. We estimate the models using the Eurodollar futures and options data as a basis. We subject these models to an exhaustive set of diagnostics. In particular, we develop a finite-sample version of the encompassing test for non-nested models. We find, based on the statistical tests and pricing errors, that there is little difference between the models when the models are estimated using only the yield curve information. Using options data enables us to separate the models very clearly. The stochastic volatility model is the most successful according to our diagnostics.

Acquiring information allows him both to reduce the uncertainty on the dangerousness of this project and to limit potential damages that it might cause on people's health and on the environment. In this paper, we study whether there exist situations in which the agent does not acquire information. We find that an agent with time-consistent preferences, as well as an agent with hyperbolic ones, will acquire information unless its cost exceeds the direct benefit they could get with this information. Nevertheless, a hyperbolic agent may remain strategically ignorant and, when he does acquire information, he will acquire less information than a time-consistent type. Moreover, a hyperbolic-discounting type who behaves as a time-consistent agent in the future is more inclined to stay ignorant. We then emphasize that this strategic ignorance depends on the degree of precision of the information. Finally, we analyse the role that existing liability rules could play as an incentive to acquire information under uncertainty and with regard to the form of the agent's preferences.

This paper pursues three empirical questions. First, at what rates do Canadian parents choose various school options and engage in different forms of choosing? Second, what demographics predict these choices? Third, what educational attitudes and behaviours predict choosing? Data come from a 2005 national survey of Canadian parents that contains comprehensive measures of school options and forms of choosing. Three sets of findings are reported. First, the prevalence of choosing is substantial, with one-third of families opting for a school other than a standard public school, and two-thirds exercising some form of school choosing. Second, many of these choices are shaped by parental income and education, though interesting exceptions emerge. Third, school choosing appears to be an extension of parents' participation in their children's education. Policy implications of these findings are discussed.","[Davies, Scott] McMaster Univ, Dept Sociol, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Aurini, Janice] Univ Waterloo, Dept Sociol & Legal Studies, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",McMaster University; University of Waterloo,"Davies, S (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Sociol, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,43,29,38,0,4,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Correlations for domestically as well as internationally diversified portfolios are computed to unveil the relationship between stock prices of various firms as well as domestic and internationally diversified portfolios of investments. Further, to understand the effect of diversification on the risk associated with each of the portfolios of investments employed, value at risk analysis (VaR) is undertaken for studying the benefits associated with domestic as well as international diversification (if any). The study results show that domestic diversification lowers the expected losses associated with each of the domestic portfolios of investment employed where the international diversification substantially mitigates the portfolio risks.

Our results suggest that increases in the volatility of regularly-collected and cyclical revenues such as the VAT and income taxes tend to tilt the expenditure composition in favour of public investment. In contrast, increases in the volatility of ad hoc taxes such as capital taxes tend to favour public consumption spending, albeit only a little. We interpret such volatility innovations as conveying news to the fiscal policymaker about the underlying economic conditions, with especially regularly-collected and cyclical taxes prompting short-term cyclical fine-tuning.","[Riscado, Sara Maria] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Riscado, SM (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy.",sara.riscado@eui.eu; juraj.stancik@gmail.com; t.valila@eib.org,"Valila, Timo/JPK-4759-2023","Valila, Timo/0000-0002-6817-6577",,,,,19,1,3,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We hypothesize that bilateral donors ought to have greater freedom to condition aid on recipient governance quality than multilateral donors, which are often bound by institutional rules to provide aid more impartially. Compared to their multilateral counterparts, bilateral donors may have advantages in overcoming adverse selection, resulting in bilateral aid's boosting enrollments to a greater degree. Aid Data's extensive coverage of multilateral aid enables this analysis for up to 100 low- and low-middle-income countries from 1995 to 2008. Latent growth regression analysis suggests that, compared to multilateral donors, bilateral donors indeed condition their primary education aid on recipient control of corruption and that bilateral aid is significantly related to improved enrollments.

The transport sector in particular is finding it difficult to reduce CO2 emissions. This paper reports on two studies carried out by the authors in London (UK) and Delhi (India). It considers the common objectives for transport CO2 reduction, but the very different contexts and baselines, potentials for change, and some possible synergies. Different packages of measures are selected and scenarios developed for each context which are consistent with contraction and convergence objectives. CO2 reduction potentials are modelled and quantified by package and scenario. London is considering deep reductions on current transport: CO2 emission levels: Delhi is seeking to break the huge projected rise in transport CO2 emissions. The scale of policy intervention required to achieve these goals is huge and there is certainly little public discussion of the magnitude of the changes required. The paper argues for a 'strategic conversation' at the city level, using scenario analysis, to discuss the priorities for intervention in delivering low carbon transport futures. A greater focus is required in developing participatory approaches to decision making, alongside network investments, urban planning, low emission vehicles and wider initiatives. Aspirations towards equitable target emissions may assist in setting sufficiently demanding targets. Only then is a wider awareness and ownership of potential carbon efficient transport futures likely to take place. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We provide new evidence consistent with the argument that particular group structures emerge not only to perpetuate control, but also to alleviate financing constraints at the country and firm levels. At the country level, family groups, especially those structured as pyramids, are more prevalent in markets with limited availability of capital. At the firm level, investment intensity is greater for firms held in pyramidal rather than in horizontal structures, reflecting the financing advantages of the former. Within a pyramid, internal equity funding, investment intensity, and firm value all increase down the ownership chain.

The paper compares the surcharges to the base rates and discusses some of the implications for shippers who face increasing uncertainty in planning supply chains. Some of the issues for academic research on freight rates is also examined and points to the need to clearly identify what is included in the freight rate data employed.

Two concepts of vertical control of the development process are proposed in this paper, beginning with Inside-Out, whereby inland intermodal terminals seek greater integration with their sea ports, often driven by public body intervention. By contrast, Outside-In development is displayed by the conscious use of an inland node as a tool for sea port actors (whether port authorities or terminal operators) to expand their hinterland and capture discretionary cargo. One of the key distinctions between the two models is the role played by different government approaches to the development of inland terminal facilities. Therefore three national examples are discussed: Sweden, where the public sector is directly involved in development; Scotland, where the private sector is left to develop terminals but government encourages the process through spatial planning and modal shift funding; and the USA, where the national government has traditionally taken little action. The primary contribution of this paper is the research agenda developed out of the conceptual model above, which should be applied to additional case studies in future work. Arising from the conceptual model and the examination of the role of public bodies is a debate on the role of regulation. However the subject of regulation is only touched upon in this paper, therefore more research is required on the government's role in infrastructure planning and regulation in order to determine the best approach in this policy area.

We show that rather than leading to new insights, the simple reconfiguration of CIP to solve for the time t + 1 spot exchange rate leads to tautological expressions that, when estimated, might appear to successfully explain the forward bias, but in actuality are trivial. Results from simple simulation exercises further illustrate the inconclusiveness of the proposed solution method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

It also predicts (counterfactually) the rejection of more sizable and very attractive bets. If additional background uncertainty affects wealth, this result also applies to non-expected utilities. The authors describe a set of reasonable conditions under which an individual may reject the small bet but accept the large bet, even in the presence of background uncertainty. The two critical assumptions that the authors use are rank-dependent utility and a discrete distribution for background risk. Plausible calibrations can reconcile large/small bet risk attitudes and the empirical evidence on limited stock market participation in the presence of labor income risk.","[Chapman, David A.] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Polkovnichenko, Valery] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA",Boston College; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Chapman, DA (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",,,,,,,,24,3,3,2,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Policies are determined by governments at central and local level, implying that decisions can be affected by strategic considerations. In this article, decentralization of wetland policies is analyzed with regard to the environmental and economic consequences. A two-stage game is used to investigate strategic abatement decisions regarding nitrogen fertilizer reductions, waste water treatment plant phosphorus reductions and wetlands, assuming that wetland decision can be decentralized. It is shown that under particular circumstances, strategic consideration may imply that a central government undertakes more abatement than socially optimal, but in most cases the opposite is likely to occur. Decentralization of wetland decisions is advantageous to the central government but only benefits the local government if its wetland technology is considerably more efficient that the central government's. This paper explains why local governments often hesitate to take on additional responsibilities for environmental management, and identifies conditions under which local governments make smaller losses or even gain from delegation. The results also contribute to understanding how strategically optimal matching grants are chosen when governments only take into account their own direct costs of abatement and the central government needs to satisfy the local government's participation constraint.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Elofsson, K (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden.",katarina.elofsson@slu.se,,"Elofsson, Katarina/0000-0003-1653-3437",,,,,39,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

To adequately model the underlying distribution, a less restrictive model is needed. A relaxed binomial model is developed here that can account for the skewness of the underlying distribution and a relaxed trinomial model is developed that can account for the skewness and kurtosis of the underlying distribution. The new model incorporates the usual binomial and trinomial tree models as restricted special cases. Unlike previous flexible tree models, the size and probability of jumps are held constant at each node so only minor modifications in existing code for lattice models are needed to implement the new approach. Also, the new approach allows calculating implied skewness and implied kurtosis. Numerical results show that the relaxed binomial and trinomial tree models developed in this study are at least as accurate as tree models based on lognormality when the true underlying distribution is lognormal and substantially more accurate when the underlying distribution is not lognormal.","[Brorsen, B.

We relax the common knowledge feature of the model by assuming that a person's risk in any time period is known only by that individual and the current insurer. One might suspect that a premium sequence with higher later period premiums would be incentive compatible because low risks will have less desirable offerings from alternative insurers.

Aircraft enabled passengers to accomplish journeys, which would once have taken many days or weeks to complete, in a matter of hours, and transformed the sensory experiences of being mobile. However, while much has been written about the development of global commercial aviation and the metaphorical compression of time and space air travel has effected, research into the individual embodied human experiences of being aeromobile remains relatively scarce. Drawing on powerful theoretical arguments inspired by the mobilities turn within the social sciences and recent concern with the 'affective' dimensions of everyday life, this paper uses firsthand written historical records of passengers' experiences of travelling by air during the 1920s and 1930s to uncover the diverse kin/aesthetic and affective experiences of flight. While recognising that such experiences are shaped, at least in part, by gender, age, nationality, race, and past experiences of air travel, passengers' descriptions of the unique bodily (dis)comforts, fears, and anxieties associated with flying are used to illustrate how aeromobile bodies experience their airborne environment in ways which have yet to be adequately addressed. The paper concludes by calling for a more nuanced understanding of air travel that recognises that the advent of powered flight has fundamentally changed our perceptions of time, space, distance, and speed, and transformed what it means to be mobile.

For a set of emerging market economies, the paper finds that financial markets react more favorable to PIN releases for politically influential member countries. Moreover, IMF surveillance appears to be systematically more favorable for countries with larger IMF loans outstanding, consistent with the finding in the literature that the IMF may engage in 'defensive surveillance'.

We unravel three important dimensions of this relation. These pertain to (i) the long-run expectation of the H- (to A-price) discount; (ii) the level of short-run co-movement in prices; and (iii) the magnitude of error corrections. Findings point to significant improvements in all three areas. Policy and corporate governance change appears to be the principal force driving the efficiency gains. Weakening informational asymmetries underlie much of the change in the markets' relative pricing. In contrast, sentiment effects strongly underpin the contemporaneous response and error correction adjustments. Finally, the escalating Global Financial Crisis of 2008 appears to have not only bolstered the A- and H-markets' short-term pricing dynamic but also temporarily increased the long-term H-share discount.

This study tests whether the perceptions of market participants regarding these underpricing issues in an emerging market context confirm the international empirical evidence or not. One advantage of measuring the perceptions is that immeasurable factors that are explored through proxies in empirical studies - such as information asymmetry - can be directly surveyed. Findings reveal that among the two types of market participants (market professionals and public company executives) market professionals have a better insight into IPO dynamics.

The identification of the multiple drivers of land-use change, past and present forest cover change and associated carbon budget, and the presence of locally adapted systems to allow for proper monitoring are particularly lacking in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Any incentive system to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) will have to overcome those limits. This paper reviews the main challenges to implementing effective REDD+ mitigation activities in SSA. We estimate that SSA is currently a net carbon sink of approximately 319 TgCO(2) yr(-1). Forest degradation and deforestation put the forest carbon stock at risk (mean forest carbon stock is 57,679 TgC).

Due to lack of capacity in the affected countries, achieving reduction or avoidance of carbon emissions will require extensive REDD-plus programs.

What impact has the real appreciation of the renminbi exerted on the labour productivity is therefore a topical issue.

The econometric results show that the appreciation of the real exchange rate has a favourable effect on the labour productivity growth, leading to a kind of virtuous circle: the real appreciation of the currency boosts the growth of labour productivity while, according to the Balassa-Samuelson effect, productivity growth in turn tends to push up the real appreciation. Moreover, this favourable effect is stronger in inland provinces than in coastal provinces, contributing to a minimizing of the gap of GDP per capita between inland and coastal provinces.","[Jeanneney, Sylviane Guillaumont; Hua, Ping] Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, CNRS, Ctr Etud & Rech Dev Int, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Jeanneney, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, CNRS, Ctr Etud & Rech Dev Int, BP 10448, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",S.Guillaumont@u-clermont1.fr; P.Hua@u-clermont1.fr,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,14,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We argue that the Yangtze River system is going through a regionalization phase, mainly in relation to the port of Shanghai. This process started on the lower Yangtze but is now also moving upstream. The transition towards the port regionalization phase is typically a gradual and market-driven process that mirrors the increased focus of market players on logistics integration. This paper builds on the existing literature on port systems and adapts port development models to river ports. Furthermore, we employ some statistical techniques that are common to the analysis of port systems, and introduce some techniques that have not been used much by transport geographers in ports. This paper will address the dynamics in the Yangtze River ports system by analyzing the level of cargo concentration and the degree of inequality in operations of the container ports. The paper also assesses observed differences in development of ports in different areas along the river (upstream/downstream) and reflects on the role of ownership structures in shaping regional load centre networks.

Studies show that not all people will choose to evacuate an at-risk region or seek protection at shelters. To this point there have been relatively few efforts exploring the use of geographic information systems in conjunction with spatial optimization models in post-hurricane settings to accomplish efficient placements of facilities for distributing relief services. Despite the fact that hurricane relief strategies could benefit from a standardized methodology that reliably provides efficient placements for relief facilities, no research has examined the possibility of implementing a hierarchical structure among these facilities. This paper suggests a type of hierarchical capacitated-median model for this purpose. Two variations of this model are tested and their solutions are compared to that of a non-hierarchical version of the capacitated-median model. Findings suggest that if there is limited availability of certain services it could be useful to employ the use of a hierarchical capacitated-median problem to help place distinct facilities that provide different levels of assistance.

A case study of fossilised dinosaur eggs,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Collecting behaviour; Honest signalling; Scarcity effect; Conspicuous consumption; Sexual selection under parental choice,PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT; INVESTMENT; SELECTION; EVOLUTION; CHOICE; MARKET,"Collecting entails substantial costs in terms of effort, money, time and space needed to find, obtain and store desirable items. Still, the non-utilitarian nature of collectibles suggests that a simple economic justification of this behaviour is unlikely. Moreover, the apparent sex difference, with collectors being almost exclusively men, indicates a possible reproductive motive. However, presently available theories have failed to identify these motives and predict its patterns leaving collecting behaviour unexplained. This paper employs recent developments in the fields of evolutionary psychology and theoretical biology in order to construct a plausible theory which accounts for collecting behaviour. In particular, it is argued that collecting has evolved to facilitate reliable communication between males with respect to their unobserved resource acquisition capacity. Based on this theoretical framework three hypotheses are derived: the desirability of a collectible item is positively related to its rarity, aesthetic pleasingness, and size. Evidence based on eBay auction sales of fossilised dinosaur eggs provides support for all three hypotheses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Jung, H",,,,"Jung, Haeil",,,Increase in the Length of Incarceration and the Subsequent Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from Men Released from Illinois State Prisons,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EMPLOYMENT; EARNINGS; IMPACT; PUNISHMENT; PROGRAMS; US,"The sharp rise in U.S. incarceration rates has heightened long-standing concerns among scholars and policymakers that lengthy incarceration permanently harms the future labor market outcomes of prisoners. If true, then lengthy prison sentences will not only punish criminals for crimes committed, but will also make it far more difficult for ex-prisoners to reenter society as productive citizens. To investigate this claim I examine how increase in duration of incarceration affects subsequent earnings and employment. Comparing long-serving prisoners with short-serving ones in the Illinois state prison system, I find that the length of incarceration is positively associated with earnings and employment, even though these effects attenuate over time. The positive effects are stronger for individuals convicted of economically motivated and less violent crimes (such as property-and drug-related offenses) than for those convicted of violent crimes (such as person-related offenses). The effect is also stronger for prison entrants with self-reported drug addiction problems. The deterrent effect of lengthy incarceration and rehabilitation during incarceration are possible reasons for this positive effect. However, because this paper analyzes men who served less than four years in Illinois prison and excludes the population of men who served their terms exclusively in jail, readers should be cautious about generalizing findings of this paper.

This finding is consistent with the following view: Tax avoidance facilitates managerial rent extraction and bad news hoarding activities for extended periods by providing tools, masks, and justifications for these opportunistic behaviors. The hoarding and accumulation of bad news for extended periods lead to stock price crashes when the accumulated hidden bad news crosses a tipping point, and thus comes out all at once. Moreover, we show that the positive relation between tax avoidance and crash risk is attenuated when firms have strong external monitoring mechanisms such as high institutional ownership, high analyst coverage, and greater takeover threat from corporate control markets.

Experimental works in psychology relate bad mood to increased risk aversion. Studies in financial economics report an observed link between mood effects and stock market returns. This study therefore investigates whether the mood effects caused by air pollution can have economic implications. It examines the relationship between air pollution and stock returns using data from the Air Quality Index, and stock returns from four stock exchanges in the US. We find that air pollution is negatively related to stock returns, even when controlling for other variables. The relationship becomes weaker as the distance of the stock exchange from the polluted area increases. The results also indicate that air pollution may even affect local traders investing in securities exchanges located far from the polluted area. The findings imply that a profitable trading strategy can be constructed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Previous literature mainly identifies environmental and organizational factors that influence the effective transfer of knowledge. However, the focus shifts to the analysis of personal determinants as antecedents for the individual's engagement in knowledge sharing activities, like personality traits. In this paper, we introduce employees' goal orientations (i.e. learning orientation or performance orientation) to the individual antecedents of knowledge sharing behavior. It is argued that learning orientation positively influences knowledge sharing, whereas performance orientation is a negative influence factor. As goal orientations are determined by personality traits, we can also confirm existing hypotheses regarding this relationship. The theoretical model developed in this paper is empirically tested on a sample of 124 engineers of an internationally operating engineering company, and significant relationships among the constructs were found.

As Cochrane (2007a, b) argues, it has no credible mechanism for ruling out bubbles (or deal with the non-uniqueness problem that arises when the Taylor principle is violated) and as a result fails to provide a reason for private agents to pick a unique stable path. We propose a way forward. Our proposal is in effect that the New Keynesian model should be formulated with a money demand and money supply function. It should also embody a terminal condition for money supply behaviour. If in determinacy of stable(or unstable) paths occurred the central bank would switch to a money supply rule explicitly designed to stop it via the terminal condition. This would therefore be a 'threat/trigger strategy' complementing the Taylor rule - only to be invoked if inflation misbehaved. Thus, we answer the criticisms levelled at the Taylor rule that it has no credible mechanism for dealing with these issues. However, it does imply that money cannot be avoided in the New Keynesian setup, contrary to Woodford (2008).","[Srinivasan, Naveen] IGIDR, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India; [Minford, Patrick] Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Minford, Patrick] CEPR, London, England",Cardiff University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Srinivasan, N (通讯作者)，IGIDR, Gen AK Vaidya Marg, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India.",naveen@igidr.ac.in,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1367-0271,,,INT FINANC,Int.

We study the systematic risk of banks before the crisis, using two samples of banks respectively trading Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and issuing Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs). After their first usage of either risk transfer method, the share price beta of these banks increases significantly. This suggests the market anticipated the risks arising from these methods, long before the crisis. We additionally separate this beta effect into a volatility and a market correlation component. Quite strikingly, this decomposition shows that the increase in the beta is solely due to an increase in banks' correlations. Thus, while banks may have shed their individual credit risk, they actually posed greater systemic risk. This creates a challenge for financial regulation, which has typically focused on individual institutions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In particular we examine retail bank lending in Germany using a unique data set of German savings banks during the period 2006 through 2008 for which we have the universe of loan applications and loans granted. Our experimental setting allows us to distinguish between savings banks affected by the US financial crisis through their holdings in Landesbanken with substantial subprime exposure and unaffected savings banks. The data enable us to distinguish between demand and supply side effects of bank lending and find that the US financial crisis induced a contraction in the supply of retail lending in Germany. While demand for loans goes down, it is not substantially different for the affected and nonaffected banks. More important, we find evidence of a significant supply side effect in that the affected banks reject substantially more loan applications than nonaffected banks. This result is particularly strong for smaller and more liquidity-constrained banks as well as for mortgage as compared with consumer loans. We also find that bank-depositor relationships help mitigate these supply side effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Secondly, international transfer-pricing guidelines may reduce the tax incentives for debt financing. And thirdly, debt as a tax planning tool may be especially used by large multinationals.

The study was carried out in February 2009 in Poland. The participants represented two groups: financial analysts and laypeople (people without knowledge or skills in finance). All participants were asked to forecast future stock market performance and foreign exchange rates. Additionally, they marked their confidence on a 100-point scale. The results showed that the forecasts significantly differed from the real values. In forecasting both the stock market and the currency exchange market, the prediction error significantly differed from zero. Even if the participants were optimistic in making the directional stock market forecasts, they were pessimistic when making point index predictions, which suggests a judgmental paradox. The experts were slightly better than the non-experts in predicting the stock market. However, their accuracy was generally not better in the exchange market forecasts. The next step of the analysis focused on the confidence factor. The results of this part of the research showed that the laypeople were less confident than the experts in all the judgments.

Unlike previous studies, the results indicate that both political and fiscal factors matter for credit risk in emerging markets. Lower levels of political risk are associated with tighter spreads, particularly during financial turmoil. Efforts at fiscal consolidation narrow credit spreads, especially in countries with high initial public debt levels.

J,"Wheelock, DC",,,,"Wheelock, David C.",,,Have Acquisitions of Failed Banks Increased the Concentration of US Banking Markets?,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COMPETITION,"During 2007-10, failures eliminated 318 U.S. commercial banks and savings institutions, about 4 percent of the total number of banks operating at the end of 2006. The assets and deposits of many failed banks were acquired by institutions that already had offices in markets served by the failed banks. This article investigates the impact of in-market acquisitions of failed banks on the concentration of local U.S. banking markets. Most banks that failed during 2007-10 were small, and their acquisitions generally had little impact on market concentration. Acquisitions of larger banks that failed, such as the acquisition of Washington Mutual Bank by JPMorgan Chase Bank, also had only limited impact on the concentration of most banking markets. Among large metropolitan statistical area markets, the Houston and New York City banking markets were most affected by the acquisition of Washington Mutual, but these markets remained relatively unconcentrated after the acquisition. Hence, the article finds that except for a few rural banking markets, acquisitions of failed banks by in-market competitors generally had only a small impact on market concentration.

In contrast to the literature, we find that capital investment and profitability increase substantially after the initial public offering (IPO).

In particular, the paper examines both the stock price and trading volume response to dividend distribution announcements. Dividend distributions in Greece demonstrate noticeable differences to those of the US, the UK and other developed markets. First, dividends in Greece are paid annually rather than quarterly or semi-annually. Second, the Greek corporate laws 2190/1920 and 148/1967 specifically designate the minimum amount for distribution from the taxed corporate profits. Third, neither tax on dividends nor on capital gains was imposed during the period under examination. Fourth, Greek listed firms are characterized by high ownership concentration where major owners are usually involved in management and therefore have less need for dividend announcements as an information source. Despite this neutralized information and tax environment, we document significant market reaction to dividend change announcements, lending support to the information content of dividends hypothesis.

Most of the previous studies have mainly focused on efficiency performance, and we have little knowledge of the impact of MCS on both quality and productivity performance. In this study, we use both non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) and parametric stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to examine how MCS affects efficiency and quality performance in correctional institutions. Our results show that correctional institutions in Taiwan have considerable technical inefficiency, which is attributable to their unfavorable resource usage. We also find that correctional institutions with tight MCS have higher efficiency and quality performance.

However, little research has investigated the role measurement error plays in the liquidity puzzle. since in nearly every case, work investigating the liquidity puzzle has used one of the official monetary aggregates, which have been shown to exhibit significant measurement error. In this paper, we examine the role that measurement error plays in the liquidity puzzle by (i) providing a theoretical framework explaining how the official simple-sum methodology can lead to a liquidity puzzle, and (ii) testing for the liquidity effect by estimating an unrestricted VAR.

It presents an empirical analysis of the importance of relative consumption for people's feelings of adequacy in five consumption domains (food, housing, education, clothes and health care). Against the assumption that relative consumption only matters for the rich and drawing on recent empirical work in Latin America, the study hypothesises that participants are likely to be influenced by the level of consumption of the area where they live when evaluating their situation. The data come from two surveys implemented in 2004 and 2005 in Peru by the Wellbeing in Developing Countries (WeD), ESRC research group at the University of Bath. The results indicate a negative effect of relative consumption on participants' appraisal of their households' clothes, housing and children's education. However, the study also shows that in domains linked to the need for physical health such as health care and food, appraisals are made based on households' objective situations and that the average consumption in the community does not play a significant role.

We apply a two-step estimation procedure using bank-level panel data for commercial banks in 10 Asian and 10 Latin American countries during the period from 1996 to 2006. In the first step we measure the degree of banking competition by applying the methodology proposed by Panzar and Rosse (1987). In the second step we estimate a loan growth equation where the explanatory variables include the Panzar-Rosse measure of banking competition. The estimation results provide consistent evidence that increased competition in the banking sector weakens the transmission of monetary policy through the bank lending channel. This is especially true for banks in Latin American countries and banks of small size, low liquidity, and low capitalization.

Entrepreneuring as a practice is ontologically/epistemologically qualified by presenting phronesis as the relevant guiding intellectual virtue in the knowledge-creating process. A constructionist view invites different modes of coping with an ambiguous environment, including the use of analogizing and bricolage when enacting entrepreneuring by way of improvisation and personal networking. The notion of organizing context is introduced to grasp how collective support for entrepreneuring may be mobilized. Enactive research as an interactive way for doing field research is outlined and illustrated in order to complete the paradigmatic and theoretical arguments for a practice-theory approach to entrepreneuring with an adequate methodology.","[Johannisson, Bengt] Vaxjo Univ, S-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden; [Johannisson, Bengt] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden",Linnaeus University; Vaxjo University; Jonkoping University,"Johannisson, B (通讯作者)，Vaxjo Univ, S-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden.",bengt.johannisson@vxu.se,,"Johannisson, Bengt/0000-0002-9591-5654",,,,,85,225,247,4,99,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Applied till the 80s of the 20th century, the system of European subsidies which aimed at developing a functioning agricultural sector led to constant surplus of basic agricultural goods with high budget prices. During the 90s production quotas (e. g. the milk quotas of 1983) were introduced an emphasis was put on ecologically clean agricultural production. The CAP reform of 2003 reorganized the European subsidies in accordance with demand and stimulated farmers to produce what the market needed. Direct subsidies changed from payments based on territory to payments for farms. In order to cut surplus, the EU introduced an intervention system; fix quotas for the production of milk and sanctions for breaking them; restrictions on the export subsidies and the amount of cultivated land/number of bred animals for which farmers can receive subsidies. Bulgarian and Romanian farmers receive direct payments which maintain their incomes stable but lower compared to these of their European counterparts. At the same time they have to meet the same requirements concerning environment preservation, food safety, and humane treatment of animals (a requirement for cross compliance). These factors together with the heavy dependence of the agricultural sector on climate make the issue of researching the possibilities for minimizing investment risks through product diversification extremely significant. The main aim of this article is to identify the risks in the agricultural sector and assess the priority usage of various forms of diversification as an instrument for controlling risks. In addition, the article outlines / studies the possibilities for adding value to the agricultural sector by diversification of products and activities. The article is written as follows: M.

Contrary to the common belief that financial satisfaction mainly depends on an individual's income, evidence for the US indicates that life course financial satisfaction steadily increases from the thirties onwards, whereas life course income shows an inverted U-pattern with a peak at midlife. To judge from other studies in the US and Norway, this pattern for financial satisfaction is not unique. The aim of the present analysis is to explore the determinants of this life course financial satisfaction pattern, taking into account not only income but also the possible impact of assets and liabilities. The analysis suggests that while income has the expected positive relation, increasing financial satisfaction at older age can be partly explained by decreases in liabilities and increases in financial assets, and that assets and liabilities considered separately provide a better explanation than net wealth. In addition, reduction in the dependency burden at old age leads to increased financial satisfaction while the deterioration of health has a negative impact. The data are from the second and third waves of the US National Survey of Families and Households. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

By taking into account the extracted qualitative data, an intelligent agent, previously trained on a set of companies, computes the qualitative values, which are then included in the classification model based on neural networks. The proposed ontology takes into consideration the guidelines proposed by the ISO 26000 Standard for Social Responsibility. Having this model, and being aware of the positive relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility and financial performance, an overall perspective on each company's activity can be configured, this being useful not only to the company's creditors, auditors, stockholders, but also to its consumers.","[Smeureanu, Ion; Diosteanu, Andreea; Delcea, Camelia; Cotfas, Liviu] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Diosteanu, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",andreea.diosteanu@gmail.com,"Delcea, Camelia/C-4343-2011; Cotfas, Liviu-Adrian/D-2317-2009","Delcea, Camelia/0000-0003-3589-1969; Cotfas, Liviu-Adrian/0000-0002-4192-183X",,,,,25,18,19,1,33,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2011,13.0,29,,,,,28,42,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,710QA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286525100003,0

For the survey village of Nyakatoke in Tanzania the results suggest that information flows exist within all types of groups analysed but output externalities are limited to kinship groups.

Analyzing determinants of women's job search propensity reveals significant effect of personal, household characteristics and labor market conditions. There is an inverted U-shaped relation between age and female's job search propensity. Education and previous work experience positively affect women' job search. Women living in households with high dependency ratio and those living in areas with high unemployment rates have higher job search propensity.","[Abdel-Mowla, Somaya Ahmed Aly] Helwan Univ, Fac Commerce & Business Adm, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Helwan University,,somaya204@yahoo.com,"Abdel-Mowla, Somaya Ahmed Aly/I-3869-2019",,,,,,22,2,2,0,6,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9925-7,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,16.0,,,,,,28,36,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEW95,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000318459200006,0

Files like cache, browser history and other temporary Internet files can be used to store sensitive information like logins and passwords, names addresses, and even credit card numbers. Now, a hacker can get at this information by wrong means and share with someone else or can install some nasty software on your computer that will extract your sensitive and secret information. Identity Theft posses a very serious problem to everyone today. If you have a driver's license, a bank account, a computer, ration card number, PAN card number, ATM card or simply a social security number you are more than at risk, you are a target. Whether you are new to the idea of ID Theft, or you have some unanswered questions, we've compiled a quick refresher list below that should bring you up to speed. Identity theft is a term used to refer to fraud that involves pretending to be someone else in order to steal money or get other benefits. Identity theft is a serious crime, which is increasing at tremendous rate all over the world after the Internet evolution. There is widespread agreement that identity theft causes financial damage to consumers, lending institutions, retail establishments, and the economy as a whole. Surprisingly, there is little good public information available about the scope of the crime and the actual damages it inflicts. Accounts of identity theft in recent mass media and in film or literature have centered on the exploits of 'hackers'-variously lauded or reviled-who are depicted as cleverly subverting corporate firewalls or other data protection defenses to gain unauthorized 'access to credit card details, personnel records and other information. Reality is more complicated, with electronic identity fraud taking a range of forms. The impact of those forms is not necessarily quantifiable as a financial loss; it can involve intangible damage to reputation, time spent dealing with disinformation and exclusion from particular services because a stolen name has been used improperly. Overall we can consider electronic networks as an enabler for identity theft, with the thief for example gaining information online for action offline and the basis for theft or other injury online. As Fisher pointed out These new forms of hightech identity and securities fraud pose serious risks to investors and brokerage firms across the globe, I am a victim of identity theft.  Being a victim of identity theft I felt the need for creating an awareness among the computer and internet users particularly youngsters in India. Nearly 70 per cent of Indian's population are living in villages. Government of India already started providing computer and internet facilities even to the remote villages through various rural development and rural upliftment programmes. Highly educated people, established companies, world famous financial institutions are becoming victim of identity theft. The question here is how vulnerable the illiterate and innocent rural people are if they suddenly exposed to a new device through which some one can extract and exploit their personal data without their knowledge? In this research work an attempt has been made to bring out the. real problems associated with Identity theft in developed countries from an economist point of view.","[Arunachalam, P.] Serials Publicat, New Delhi, India; [Arunachalam, P.] Cochin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Econ, Kochi 22, Kerala, India",Cochin University Science & Technology,"Arunachalam, P (通讯作者)，Serials Publicat, New Delhi, India.",arunachalam14@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,6,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9173-2,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,12.0,,,,,,235,240,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392895700042,0

Therefore, The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) has been reviewed as a guideline with the other three sources, i.e. higher academic institutions, Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) and Malaysian government. However, there is no common ground among them. Each of them has been looking in generic skill set rather than specific set, i.e. accounting. This research takes a comprehensive view of IT competence for professional accountants. The role of professional accountants is particularly intensive in small medium sized enterprises (SMEs). These types of organisations are extremely dynamic, customer oriented, information driven, project based, flatter in structure, and consist of a number of functional and cross functional teams. Role of IT in accounting and finance small to medium sized enterprises extends from simple data collection, aggregation, processing, and storage, to integration, strategic advisory, control, and management of the overall business. This research employs a qualitative interpretive research methodology with exploratory case study method. It uses diverse data collection strategies including, and relies on triangulation of evidence to resolve the research questions in this study.

Our contribution to the literature is a clean identification of a causal effect of access to finance on productivity. Specifically, we exploit an exogenous shift in demand for a product to expose how producers adapt their productivity in the presence of varying levels of access to finance. We use a triple differences testing approach and find that production increases the most over the sample period in areas with relatively strong access to finance, even in comparison with a control group. This result is statistically significant and robust to a variety of controls, alternative variables, and tests. The causal effect of access to finance on productivity that we find speaks to the larger role of finance in economic growth.

Our models show that internal constraints, measured by mark-ups, are more decisive for R&D than for capital investment. For external constraints, we find a monotonic relationship between the level of constriction and firm size for both types of investment. Thus, external constraints turn out to be more binding with decreasing firm size. On the contrary, we do not find such monotonic relationships for internal constraints.

Using a sample of 73 teams developing their business ideas, I found direct effects of diversity and conflict on member-rated team effectiveness. Here, I explain how the circumstances under which these teams operate can lead to these findings. For these teams, task conflict was found to relate negatively to member-rated team effectiveness. This finding contrasts with research on organizational teams, where task conflict usually relates positively to team effectiveness ratings. I also found that both diversity and average member experience influence member-rated effectiveness. These findings imply that diversity, conflict, and ratings of team effectiveness may differ for teams developing business ideas as compared to organizational teams. Thus, findings from organizational team research should be applied with caution to teams developing business ideas and possibly to new venture teams in general.","Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Foo, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",foom@colorado.edu,"Foo, Maw Der/B-3255-2009","Foo, Maw Der/0000-0002-4887-081X",,,,,51,31,40,3,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

It is a current, contemporary institutional exploration beyond the boundaries of individual disciplines - economics, sociology, history, political science and legal science. It is widely recognized that achievement of economic, social, environmental and inter-generational targets of sustainable development requires effective governance and coordinated actions at various levels individual, regional, national and transnational levels. It is also known that effective forms of governing sustainable development are universal, and there is a wide variation among different countries, regions, etc. Experience shows that different societies achieve to a different extent the economic, social, environmental and other targets of sustainable development. The aim of the article is to propose a comprehensive framework for analyzing the mechanism of governing sustainable development. The agrarian sector will be used for a practical application of theoretical knowledge. The first part is focused on sustainable development and its economic aspects. The next section will analyze and propose improvements of the governance of sustainable development. This approach takes into account specific institutional environments and the behavioral characteristics of individual agents, as well as transaction costs that are associated with different forms of governance. Theoretical knowledge will be put into practice using the example of Bulgarian agriculture. Bulgarian agriculture has seen fundamental changes since 1989, with the abandonment of centralized planning of farming and the liberalization of agricultural markets. Bulgarian agriculture is very specific and differs from other European countries. Agrarian development is linked to specific environmental problems such as contamination of farmland, pollution of groundwater, loss of biodiversity, etc. This is a result of the specific institutional and governing structure that has been evolving in the sector during recent years.","[Frydlova, Monika; Kaderabek, Marek; Cermak, Jiri; Slaboch, Josef] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Frydlová, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",frydlovam@pef.czu.cz; kaderabek@pef.czu.cz; jcermak@pef.czu.cz; slaboch@pef.czu.cz,"Slaboch, josef/H-3023-2018","Slaboch, josef/0000-0002-7396-835X",,,,,21,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,31,38,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100004,0

Not surprisingly, a number of support tools were developed to reinforce the position of territories and their actors in innovation processes. Clusters and regional innovation systems belong to the most important of them. However, both are rather underdeveloped in the CEE countries, including Czech Republic. Facing this situation, a number of Czech regional authorities (Regions) took measures to stimulate process of cluster and regional innovation system (RISs) creation. Strategic planning in the form of regional innovation strategies has become an overarching concept in this way. Eleven Czech Regions have elaborated RISs so far and analysis of these documents became the main goal of this article.

The reverse is true for a downgrade. In addition, the degree of change in stock information asymmetry is positively associated with the magnitude of the bond rating changes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Korinek, A",,,,"Korinek, Anton",,,Hot Money and Serial Financial Crises,IMF ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"When one region of the world economy experiences a financial crisis, the world-wide availability of investment opportunities declines. As global investors search for new destinations for their capital, other regions will experience inflows of hot money. However, large capital inflows make the recipient countries more vulnerable to future adverse shocks, creating the risk of serial financial crises. This paper develops a formal model of such flows of hot money and the vulnerability to serial financial crises. It analyzes the role for macro-prudential policies to lean against the wind of such capital flows so as to offset the externalities that occur during financial crises. Summarizing the results of our model in a simple policy rule, the paper finds that a I percentage point increase in a country's capital inflows/GDP ratio warrants a 0.87 percentage point increase in the optimal level of capital inflow taxation.

One strand of values involves the realization of a food chain in which no capitalist enterprise can extract profit from their labours: this, together with various conceptions of personal and local autonomy, shapes much of their practice of organic farming. Nevertheless, their labour has to generate an acceptable livelihood through selling food in an environment dominated by large-scale commercial agriculture in both the 'conventional' and 'organic' sectors. The article explains how they achieve this by building ties with consumers around a variety of shared values. This focus on the particularities of a radical food movement sheds light on many larger issues, both the nature of markets and competition in the dominant economy, and the debates about organic certification and 'conventionalization'.","[Luetchford, Peter; Pratt, Jeff] Univ Sussex, Dept Anthropol, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Luetchford, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Anthropol, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",P.G.Luetchford@sussex.ac.uk; J.C.Pratt@sussex.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/F033567/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F033567/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,40,14,16,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The paper also defines theoretical assumptions of an ideal financial system. Based on those assumptions, the authors formulate and describe problems of real working financial (banking) system, and these problems create necessary condition, but not sufficient condition for imposing regulation.

Changing consumption habits was examined taking into account attendees' personal profile, motivations, the main features of the farmers' markets, as well as the local social context. Attendees reported an increased consumption of organic products, and fresh vegetables. Motivation seems to play an important role as a driver of change. Results also indicate that consumers sensitive to environmental issues related to their consumption choices, are more likely to change food habits in favor of high-quality foods as well as consumers who are looking for fresh products.

On the basis of the results it can be stated that in the years before the application and after the recession the concentration of the stock was instable, while at the beginning of the support period until the crisis the appearance of large-scale firms became equal but basically according to every index the concentration in the examined years was approximately average.","[Pocsai, Krisztina; Balogh, Peter] Univ Debrecen, Fac Appl Econ & Rural Dev, Boszormenyi Str 138, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Szabo, Peter] Univ Debrecen, Fac Agr & Food Sci & Environm Management H Debrec, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen; University of Debrecen,"Pocsai, K (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Fac Appl Econ & Rural Dev, Boszormenyi Str 138, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",pocsaik@agr.unideb.hu,"Balogh, Peter/J-9183-2019; Szabó, Péter/M-8954-2016","Balogh, Peter/0000-0002-8611-0221;",,,,,21,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,107,115,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100011,0

A large proportion of the transport services between OD pairs, however, cannot be substituted since there is only one alternative available. The paper investigates the magnitude of this structural inelasticity of modal substitution in freight transport due to a sparser layout of rail and ship-based freight networks compared to road. In the analysis we use a recent Scandinavian freight demand model covering more than 800 zones. We find that the structural inelasticity is very significant - in particular for transportation over less than 500 km. Moreover, the inelasticity varies greatly with commodity groups and between OD pairs, and it depends strongly on the port and rail infrastructure. The results suggest that pure charging instruments (road pricing for trucks) in many regions will have limited mode substitution impacts. However, if combined with structural changes in terms of improved infrastructure for rail and ship, impacts may be greater. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Why was it established with its current electoral system and responsibilities? The design of the DPD had to fit within a compromise made between the two then dominant parties and their leaders. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle wished to preserve the revered People's Consultative Assembly structure, but without losing the power it then wielded by virtue of being the biggest party in the parliament. The other major party, Golkar, obtained the provincial chamber it sought, but was denied control of it when membership was closed to political parties. The public's demand for greater electoral power was appeased through the method of election chosen for the DPD. Institutionally, the design has not made the workings of the legislature more complicated for the established political actors, because the new chamber has little influence.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Rich, R (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,15,4,4,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

The LEITAP General Equilibrium Model simulates the interaction of agricultural and energy markets in response to the envisaged expansion of the biofuel industry. First generation biofuels are integrated in the production structure of the petroleum sector. Second generation biofuels are modelled indirectly via estimated bottom-up reductions in land available for agriculture. Biofuel targets are set exogenously according to the current policy goals. The model recursively responds to increments in the biofuel mandates over three time intervals. Each country or region is required the meet its respective target and is allowed to subsidize biofuel consumption through a budget-neutral mechanism. Thanks to a nested land specification, changes in land use take into account variable elasticities of substitution among different cultivations. The results indicate that German production of biofuel crops substantially increases. In particular, oilseed output experiences a remarkable growth. Land allocation and land prices also change significantly. However, higher production does not suffice to satisfy the demand for biofuels feedstock, and imports of oilseeds and sugar rise considerably. Moreover, the model suggests that the growth in biofuel crop production among the remaining EU-26 countries is driven by the new Member States of the EU, and that the supply of EU biofuel crops also has to be enhanced by imports from abroad. Biofuel policies outside Europe show only little additional impact on German agriculture. The projected changes in food commodity prices are in line with the results of other CGE analyses, although prices rise to a lesser extent than projected in studies based on Partial Equilibrium Models.","[Sorda, Giovanni] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Banse, Martin] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Braunschweig, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Sorda, G (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav, E ON Energy Res Ctr, Mathieustr 6, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",GSorda@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,,,,,58,3,4,0,8,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Whether farm households are taxed on a lump-sum basis or as a proportion of output is an important issue. This paper develops a theoretical model to understand better the effects of the lump-sum and proportional taxation on agricultural output. It then empirically investigates the predictions using tax and output data on Chinese agriculture. The theoretical model predicts that lump-sum taxation affects only consumption, while proportional taxation simultaneously affects consumption, capital inputs and final output. Although the main tax policy targeted output, our results suggest that taxation had only a modest impact on output since it was effectively applied as lump sum taxation brought about by localized levies and taxes.","[Zhong, Chunping; Zhang, Juan; Xu, Changsheng] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Turvey, Calum] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Cornell University,"Zhong, CP (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Wuruo Rd 1037, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",springzenith@gmail.com,"zhong, chun/JEZ-8722-2023; xu, cj/HJZ-3488-2023; WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023","Turvey, Calum/0000-0001-5812-2957",,,,,34,7,8,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The results confirm the importance of allowing simultaneously for heterogeneity and inefficiency and emphasize the need for specific time-invariant heterogeneity information, such as geographical data, on regulated companies in different regions.","[Bagdadioglu, Necmiddin] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Beytepe, Turkey; [Weyman-Jones, Thomas] Univ Loughborough, Dept Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England",Hacettepe University; Loughborough University,"Bagdadioglu, N (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, IIBF Maliye Bolumu, Beytepe Kampusu, Beytepe, Turkey.",necbag@hacettepe.edu.tr; t.g.weyman-jones@lboro.ac.uk,"BAGDADIOGLU, NECMIDDIN/J-1255-2013",,,,,,32,2,2,0,5,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Recent empirical evidence and theoretical work provide support for a resource-curse hypothesis based on ethnic fractionalization. There is also increasing empirical evidence suggesting that ethnic heterogeneity based on polarization is a strong deterrent of economic growth. In this paper, we explore the interlinkages between natural resource abundance and both measures of ethnic heterogeneity. In a two-simultaneous equation system, we assess the effects of fractionalization and polarization on property-rights protection, and thereby on growth, both directly as well as in interaction with our resource-abundance proxy. We find that ethnic polarization is more likely to have a direct negative impact on the effectiveness of property rights in a resource-rich context, which as we explain may suggest that different ethnic groups treat the contestable resource base as a semi-public good.","[Baggio, Jacopo A.; Papyrakis, Elissaios] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Baggio, JA (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,"Baggio, Jacopo/AAE-8674-2019; Papyrakis, Elissaios/M-9120-2013","Baggio, Jacopo/0000-0002-9616-4143;",,,,,54,25,28,1,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

In contrast to most other trade measures, TBT have both trade promotion and trade restriction effects. Due to their theoretical complexity and data scarcity. TBT have been considered as one of the most difficult non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to quantify. In this paper, we construct a TBT database from 1998-2006 to examine the influence of TBT imposed by China on the country's imports. When using the frequency index, we find that TBT are trade restrictive: a one unit increase in TBT will decrease import value by about 0.8%. However, when the coverage ratio is used, we find that the negative effects of TBT are not statistically significant based on the entire period. However, if the focus is shifted to data from 1998-2001, we find that TBT have trade promotion effects. A one unit increase in TBT will increase import value by about 0.2%. Finally, China's TBT (measured by both frequency index and coverage ratio) are trade restricting for agriculture goods but trade promoting for manufacturing goods.","[Qiu, Larry D.] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Bao, Xiaohua] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Qiu, LD (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",larryqiu@hku.hk,,,,,,,26,42,45,17,94,"CITY UNIV HONG KONG, DEPT ECONOMICS & FINANCE",HONG KONG,"83 TAT CHEE AVE, KOWLOON, HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",1608-1625,,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that takeovers of portfolio companies destroy significant value for shareholders of acquisitive CVC investors, even though these same investors are good acquirers of other entrepreneurial firms.

The marginal impact of each individual macroeconomic announcement on volatility is isolated whilst controlling for the distinct intraday volatility pattern, calendar effects, and a latent, longer run volatility factor simultaneously. Macroeconomic news announcements from the US are found to cause the vast majority of the statistically significant responses in volatility, with US monetary policy. and real activity announcements causing the largest reactions of volatility across the three rates. ECB interest rate decisions are also important for all three rates, whilst UK Industrial Production and Japanese GDP cause large responses for the Euro-Sterling and Euro-Yen rates, respectively. Additionally, forward looking indicators and regional economic surveys, the release timing of which is such that they are the first indicators of macroeconomic performance that traders observe for a particular month, are also found to play a significant role.

A significant part of this appears to be within observable groups (such as experience-gender-skill cells). A generally untested implication of many theories rationalizing the growth of within-group inequality is that firm-level productivity dispersion should also have increased. We utilize a UK firm-level panel dataset covering the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors since the early 1980s. We find evidence that productivity inequality has increased. Existing studies have typically underestimated this phenomenon because they focus only on the manufacturing sector where inequality has risen much less and which has shrunk rapidly. Most of the increase in individual wage inequality can be accounted for by an increase in inequality between firms (and within industries). Increased productivity dispersion appears to be linked with new technologies as suggested by models such as Caselli (1999, Am. Econ. Rev., 89, 78-102) and is not primarily due to an increase in transitory shocks, greater sorting or entry/exit dynamics.","[Faggio, Giulia] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Salvanes, Kjell G.] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, N-5035 Bergen, Norway; [Van Reenen, John] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Van Reenen, John] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Faggio, G (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",g.faggio1@lse.ac.uk; kjell.salvanes@nhh.no; j.vanreenen@lse.ac.uk,"Faggio, Giulia/AAT-4010-2020; Van Reenen, John/AAG-9587-2019","Faggio, Giulia/0000-0001-9766-859X;","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1, ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1, ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,85,89,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

By extending CAPM to incorporate the option-risk factor of stocks, we show that stockholders' limited liability can explain Fama and French's size and value effects. We use bonds' excess credit spread as a proxy for stocks' default risk to control for the changing non-diversifiable option-risk characteristic of stocks. Because sensitivity to the excess credit spread becomes smaller as size increases and as value decreases, excess credit spread explains the CAPM anomalies in a fashion similar to the Fama-French factors. While the excess credit spread is significant in explaining Fama and French's size and value effects, adding the Fama-French factors does not improve the performance of our model. Our revised model resembles conditional CAPM, but it offers a more intuitive explanation for the size and value effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The magnitude of the shift is unprecedented in recent history, even relative to what happened following 1973 after alternative shocks with worldwide consequences. The shift does not arise because volatilities changed with the crisis. Both goods and assets trade have contributed to this synchronization.

To fit the observed forced turnover rate, the model needs the average board of directors to behave as if replacing the CEO costs shareholders at least $200 million. This cost mainly reflects CEO entrenchment rather than a real cost to shareholders. The model predicts that shareholder value would rise 3% if we eliminated this perceived turnover cost, all else equal.

The paper is the first to provide analytical results for an executive with general concave utility. Wealthier or less risk-averse executives exercise later and create greater option cost. However, option cost can decline with volatility. We show when there exists a single exercise boundary, yet demonstrate the possibility of a split continuation region. We also show that, for constant relative risk averse utility, the option value does not converge to the Black and Scholes value as the correlation between the stock and the market portfolio converges to one. We compare our model's option cost with the modified Black and Scholes approximation typically used in practice and show that the approximation error can be large or small, positive or negative, depending on firm characteristics.

It identifies two relevant channels: a financial risk effect that reduces demand, and a hedging effect that increases demand since current homes may hedge future housing costs. The latter dominates when hedging incentives are strong, namely when the likelihood of moving up the housing ladder is high and the tendency to move across markets is low. For households with weak hedging incentives, the article finds negative effects of price risk on the timing and size of home purchases, but positive effects for households with strong hedging incentives.

We derive a necessary and sufficient condition under which a positive shock to the informal sector results in an emphcontraction in both the size of the urban formal sector and the informal sector.

In light of petitions filed by various U.S. states to maintain the status of IRAs as roadless lands, spatial hedonic price models are estimated and used to calculate the implicit value of IRAs in New Mexico. Findings show that a two-stage least squares (2-SLS), robust spatial-lag model is the most appropriate econometric representation of the hedonic price function, and that IRA lands are a significant and positive determinant of house value. After controlling for the presence of Wilderness Areas (WAs) and other characteristics, results indicate that, on average, there is a 5.6% gain in the property value of a house from being located in, or adjacent to, a Census tract with IRAs. In the aggregate, this gain represents 3.5% of the value of all owner-occupied units in New Mexico ($1.9 billion in capitalized value, or an annualized value in perpetuity of $95 million, assuming a 5% interest rate).

A theoretic model benchmarks the performance of disintegration and integration for different degrees of product modularity by measuring both product quality and differentiation. In line with conventional wisdom, (nearly) modular products befit disintegration insofar as disintegration increases quality. However, disintegration only leads to greater product differentiation than integration if there is substantial entry and exit. These findings-albeit developed with stylised models of disintegration and integration-provide a possible explanation for empirical results showing a decrease in product variety when modular products were produced by independent manufacturers (disintegration). Moreover, the model results predict that industries with limited entry and exit as well as strong winner-take-all dynamics tend to incur a loss in variety if modular products are produced in a disintegrated setting.","[Press, Kerstin] Univ Zurich, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland; [Geipel, Markus M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Press, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Kunstlergasse 15, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",kerstin.press@vd.uzh.ch; mgeipel@ethz.ch,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The econometric evidence strongly suggests that the sector contributes to growth more than its share of GDP, certainly in Latin America but also elsewhere. Cross-country studies show that, on average in the developing world, agriculture tends to have an impact on both national growth and poverty reduction that is greater than its simple share of national GDP. The results reinforce the argument against taxing agriculture relative to other sectors and that in assigning government expenditures to public goods one should take into account the historical relationship between agricultural growth and the subsequent non-agricultural growth.

The intensification of bank involvement with SMEs in various emerging markets is neither led by small or niche banks nor highly dependent on relationship lending. Moreover, it has not been derailed by the 2007-2009 crisis. Rather, all types of banks are catering to SMEs and large, multiple-service banks have a comparative advantage in offering a wide range of products and services on a large scale, through the use of new technologies, business models, and risk management systems.

The classification of firms in size and age groups, however, yields more interesting results: Gibrat's law is rejected for micro, small, and young firms, since an inverse relationship between firm growth and initial firm size is found along with a persistence of growth rates in subsequent periods. In contrast, Gibrat's law is accepted for medium, large, and old firms, implying that the growth patterns of these categories follow a random walk and do not tend to persist in subsequent periods.","[Fotopoulos, Georgios; Giotopoulos, Ioannis] Univ Patras, Patras, Greece",University of Patras,"Fotopoulos, G (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Patras, Greece.",gfotop@upatras.gr; giotopj@upatras.gr,"Giotopoulos, Ioannis/AAM-5607-2021; Fotopoulos, Georgios/GWM-9051-2022","Giotopoulos, Ioannis/0000-0002-9491-5505",,,,,44,42,43,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This solution works well in both simulations and applications, as opposed to dummy variables which can lead to multimodality in the ARCH likelihood and invalid inference. We demonstrate the accuracy of our procedure for parameter estimation and forecasting. The empirical examples include U.S. interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and stock index data.

In this paper, we put forward hypotheses for this borrowing pattern based on incomplete contract theories and test them using a sample of small U.S. firms. We find that firms with more valuable and more homogeneous assets differentiate borrowing more sharply across concentrated creditors. Moreover, borrowing differentiation is inversely related to restructuring costs and positively related to firms' informational transparency. The results suggest that the structure of credit relationships is used to discipline creditors and entrepreneurs, especially during corporate reorganizations.","[Guiso, Luigi] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Minetti, Raoul] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",European University Institute; Michigan State University,"Guiso, L (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy.",luigi.guiso@eui.eu; minetti@msu.edu,,,,,,,49,46,50,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

To study this impact, this paper discusses the major results of a bottom-up modelling analysis of the implications of emissions trading for the performance of the wholesale power market in 20 European countries. The analyses show that a significant part of the costs of (freely allocated) CO(2) emission allowances is passed through to power prices, resulting in higher electricity prices for consumers and additional ('windfall') profits for power producers, even in cases of full auctioning. In addition, they show that the ETS-induced increases in power prices depend not only on the level of CO(2) prices but also on the structure of the power market, i.e., the incidence of market power, and the price responsiveness of power demand. Finally, the analyses show that the internalization and pass-through of carbon costs are crucial elements in a policy regime to reduce CO(2) emissions by both changing the mix of power generation technologies and lowering total electricity demand.","[Lise, Wietze] ECORYS Res & Consulting Ltd Turkey, TR-06680 Ankara, Turkey; [Lise, Wietze] IBS Res & Consultancy, Istanbul, Turkey; [Sijm, Jos] Energy Res Ctr Netherlands ECN, Int Energy & Climate Policy Grp, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hobbs, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",IBS Research & Consultancy; Johns Hopkins University,"Lise, W (通讯作者)，ECORYS Res & Consulting Ltd Turkey, Buklum Sokak 63-73, TR-06680 Ankara, Turkey.",wietze.lise@ecorys.com.tr,"Hobbs, Benjamin F/A-3291-2010",,,,,,30,74,80,5,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

A simple time-series regression analysis indicates that marginal income tax rates, corporate performance, female labor force participation, and labor disputes are important determinants of top wage income shares in post-WWII Japan. Although not conclusive, our results suggest that much of the recent gains in wage income shares at the top can be explained by the changes in these four factors, placing a less emphasis on a story of structural changej Japanese It Economies 24 (3) (2010) 301-333 Institute of Economic Research.

However, Klemperer [1995] argues that this may not be true if an increase in the size of a firm's customer base induces fierce price competition, making the firm worse off. This paper shows that such an outcome can be obtained under standard assumptions, such as homogeneous goods and uniformly distributed switching costs. In the model, firms have very limited incentives to fight for market shares, and the notion that switching costs make markets less competitive is stronger than previously shown.","Humboldt Univ, Dept Econ, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Schmidt, RC (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Dept Econ, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",robert.schmidt.1@staff.hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,6,4,4,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-1821,,,J IND ECON,J.

The equity premium estimate that emerges from most of this work matches one moment of the data alone: the mean difference between an estimate of the return to holding equity and a risk-free rate. We instead match multiple moments of U.S. market data, exploiting the joint distribution of the dividend yield, return volatility, and realized excess returns, and find that the equity premium lies within 50 basis points of 3.5%, a range much narrower than was achieved in previous studies. Additionally, statistical tests based on the joint distribution of these moments reveal that only those models of the conditional equity premium that embed time variation, breaks, and/or trends are supported by the data. In order to develop the joint distribution of the dividend yield, return volatility, and excess returns, we need a model of price and return fundamentals. We document that even recently developed analytically tractable models that permit autocorrelated dividend growth rates and discount rates impose restrictions that are rejected by the data. We therefore turn to a wider range of models, requiring numerical solution methods and parameter estimation by the simulated method of moments.","[Donaldson, R.

The problem is of great importance because the coal takes a 70% share in China's energy mix, and China is the world's second largest carbon emitter. An accurate forecast in coal price is crucial in predicting China's future energy consumption mix as well as the private sector's energy-type-related investment decisions. In estimation and forecasting, the shifting trend time-series model suggested by Robert Pindyck is used to capture the technological progress that is unobservable to the econometrician. It is found that the shifting trend model with continuous and random changes in price level and trend outperforms plain vanilla ARIMA models. It is argued that the model postulated by Pindyck is robust even in a transition economy where energy prices are subject to relatively rigid regulatory control.

Our findings suggest that the type-specific frontier corresponding to cooperative banking firms lies, to its largest part, away from the European metafrontier. Furthermore, within the cooperative bank type a dichotomy seems to arise.

Our data is consistent with a model based on the assumption that people feel badly if they expect to be disapproved by others. Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence in line with the following assumptions: (i) people become more aware about the other's opinion if feedback is available, and (ii) even if the feedback is ex post and has no effect on their ex ante expectations about disapproval, people prefer not to receive negative feedback.

Within the next decade, however, China's labor force will begin to contract. This will set its economy apart from other developing Asian countries where relative labor abundance will increase, as will relative capital returns. Unless there is a substantial change in population policy, the retention of China's large share of global FDI will require further improvements in its investment environment. These linkages are explored using a global economic model that incorporates full demographic behavior. Financial reform is measured by the effect of declining intermediation costs on the wedge between home and foreign borrowing rates, or the investment premium. The influence of this wedge on China's projected economic growth performance is investigated under alternative assumptions about fertility decline and labor force growth. China's share of global investment is found to depend sensitively on both its demography and its interest premium, though the results suggest that a feasible continuation of financial reforms will be sufficient to compensate for a slowdown and decline in its labor force.","[Tyers, Rod] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Golley, Jane] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Western Australia; Australian National University,"Tyers, R (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",rod.tyers@uwa.edu.au; jane.golley@anu.edu.au,,"Tyers, Rodney/0000-0003-3080-0415",,,,,34,7,7,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

A survey was developed to investigate the outsourcing by Belgian SMEs both of routine (entry of invoices, interim reporting) and non-routine (period-end accounting, preparation of financial statements) accounting tasks. For the routine accounting tasks, frequency was significantly associated with outsourcing. Meanwhile, for non-routine accounting tasks, asset specificity and frequency were significantly associated. High-frequency tasks were associated with lower levels of outsourcing. Similarly, higher asset specificity was associated with lower levels of outsourcing. Furthermore, the educational background of the CEO, as well as the CEO's level of trust in the external accountant, was significantly associated with outsourcing, confirming the upper echelon theory. Having a more educated CEO was associated with lower levels of outsourcing, both for routine and non-routine accounting tasks.","[Everaert, Patricia] Univ Ghent, Dept Accounting, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Sarens, Gerrit] Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Finance, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Sarens, Gerrit] Univ Antwerp, Dept Finance, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Rommel, Jan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Publ Management Inst, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",Ghent University; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Antwerp; KU Leuven,"Everaert, P (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Accounting, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Kuiperskaai 55-E, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Patricia.Everaert@UGent.be; Gerrit.Sarens@uclouvain.be; Jan.Rommel@soc.kuleuven.be,"Everaert, Patricia C./E-2230-2017","Everaert, Patricia C./0000-0003-1976-3836",,,,,67,40,54,1,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The coupling of shipping modes has enabled shippers to more fully realize the respective time and costs advantages of respective modes. The opportunity to take advantage of intermodalism when shipping manufactured goods overseas may provide an essential competitive edge to a company or to an entire region engaged in world commerce. The change in the freight accessibility map of the United States to foreign markets that can be ascribed to intermodal infrastructures and operations has so far not been studied. With the help of a geographic information system, this paper analyzes this transformation in the United States by mapping integral place accessibility measures of five-digit zip code areas with respect to gateways for export of manufactured goods, especially containerized freight. The performance of the intermodal freight network is evaluated by comparing accessibility measures based on the highway network and on the intermodal network, respectively, for all North American container ports, as well as for subgroups of container ports on the Eastern Seaboard, the Western Seaboard, and the Gulf Coast of North America. The paper discusses regional winners and losers in the new national freight transportation system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyzes the propensity of policy makers to relax fixed exchange rate regimes by performing regular realignments. The argument is that when information is scarce as in transition countries in the 1990s, adherence to visible exchange rate commitments gives left wing politicians, the former communists, a useful mechanism to improve their reputation. Empirically, the paper uses a duration model to analyze monthly realignment data from former communist countries from 1990 to 1999 and assesses how a broad range of political and economic factors influence the duration of government fixed rate commitments. In particular, one of the robust findings is that left wing governments are associated with a lower risk of fixed rate realignment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the inflation illusion hypothesis can explain the post-war negative stock return-inflation relation, but it is not compatible with the pre-war positive relation. Using a structural VAR identification method, we show that there are two regimes with positive and negative stock return-inflation relations not only in each period of the US but also in every developed country we consider. This seems inconsistent with the inflation illusion hypothesis that predicts only a negative relation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, the rapid growth of the program and the decentralized way in which it has been implemented have contributed to some challenges. This ten-year analysis of the MPNP finds that many places in Manitoba are experiencing settlement service gaps, and that immigrants and communities are taking on much of the burden for MPNP application and settlement. In addition, the analysis demonstrates that the fragmented way in which the MPNP has been marketed and implemented (i.e., by relying on particular employers, consultants, and ethnocultural organizations) has resulted in a sort of ethnocultural inequality where certain groups are ushered into the province often to perform particular occupations while others are bypassed.","Queens Univ, Dept Geog, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Lewis, NM (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Geog, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",,,,,,,,103,27,29,0,5,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

It is well known that Romania, although source country, on our continent (Spain, Italy, Belgium, France etc.), as well as on the American (Canada, U. S. A) or the Australian one, with a negative migratory balance rate, after joining the European Union, it will become in the near future a destination country, especially for economic immigrants. The natural population deficit with which Romania is currently confronted, the labour market imbalances (the low level of participation of the current population in the productive process and the high number of Romanians working abroad) and the experience of older European Union members support the idea. As such, the analysis of social and economical risks that rising immigration will bring on the Romanian society is rather interesting and the applicative uses reside in identifying risk management solutions, in the context of formulating specific policies for immigration management.","[Negut, Silviu; Neacsu, Marius-Cristian] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [di Comite, Luigi] Univ Bari, I-70121 Bari, Italy",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Neacsu, MC (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",marius.neacsu@biblioteca.ase.ro,"Neacsu, Marius-Cristian M./W-8301-2018; Neacsu, Marius-Cristian M/M-7151-2018",,,,,,23,3,3,0,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,12.0,28,,,,,576,593,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279314000023,0

The aims of our paper are to present the role of the consumer information and education in society, and to analyze and highlight the results of a national project regarding the information and education of Romanian young consumers, run by the Association for Consumers Protection (APC) Romania. By using primary data obtained from a survey based on a questionnaire, a set of three hypotheses was tested during our research. The results of our research shows that a relatively small number of Romanian pupils from the 5(th) grade to 8(th) grade were aware of the negative effects of unhealthy food consumption and of the fact that the unhealthy food consumption may give rise to obesity and ADHD (agitation with attention deficit).","[Toma, Sorin-George] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; [Stanciu, Costel] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Irimia, Eugen] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Toma, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",tomagsorin62@yahoo.com,"Toma, Sorin-George/AFC-5952-2022","Toma, Sorin-George/0000-0001-9116-7751",,,,,40,2,2,0,8,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,12.0,28,,,,,420,435,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279314000011,0

Features of the MA framework include an MA structure of portfolios, a definition of risk as the probability of failing to reach the threshold level in each mental account, and attitudes toward risk that vary by account. We demonstrate a mathematical equivalence between MVT. MA, and risk management using value at risk (VaR). The aggregate allocation across MA subportfolios is mean-variance efficient with short selling. Short-selling constraints on mental accounts impose very minor reductions in certainty equivalents, only if binding for the aggregate portfolio, offsetting utility losses from errors in specifying risk-aversion coefficients in MVT applications.

J,"Pisano, GP",,,,"Pisano, Gary P.",,,The evolution of science-based business: innovating how we innovate,INDUSTRIAL AND CORPORATE CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Science has long been connected to innovation and to business. As early as the late 19th century, chemical companies, realizing the commercial potential of science, created the first industrial research laboratories. During much of the 20th century, large-scale business enterprises like DuPont, GE, Westinghouse, IBM, Kodak, Xerox (PARC), and AT&T (Bell Laboratories) created in-house labs capable of first-rate basic scientific research. In recent decades, however, the connection between science and business has begun to change in important ways. While the corporate lab declined, new science-based businesses in sectors like biotech, nanotech, and energy emerged. Universities also became active players in the commercialization of science. In short, science has become a business. This essay examines the institutional and organizational challenges created by this convergence of science and business through a Chandlerian lens. It highlights three fundamental challenges of science-based businesses: (i) managing and rewarding long-term risk, (ii) integrating across technical disciplines, and (iii) learning. Whereas these challenges were once managed inside the boundaries of corporate R&D labs-under the auspices of Chandler's visible hand-today the invisible hand of markets increasingly governs them. An assessment of this form of governance against the requirements of science-based businesses suggests a gap and a need for organizational innovation.","Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Pisano, GP (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Business Adm, Morgan Hall 417, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",gpisano@hbs.edu,,,,,,,22,84,95,4,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Since adequate housing market data are generally not available and usually of low frequency we apply a panel cointegration analysis consisting of 15 countries over a period of 30 years. Pooling the observations allows us to overcome the data restrictions which researchers face when testing long-term relationships among single real estate time series. This study does not only confirm results from previous studies, but also allows for a comparison of single country estimations in an integrated equilibrium framework. The empirical results indicate house prices to increase in the long-run by 0.6% in response to a 1% increase in economic activity while construction costs and the long-term interest rate show average long-term effects of approximately 0.6% and -0.3%. respectively. Contrary to current literature our estimates suggest only about 16% adjustment per year. Thus the time to full recovery may be much slower than previously stated. so that deviations from the long-term equilibrium result in a dynamic adjustment process that may take up to 14 years.

We also find that renegotiation is more likely when governance arrangements, including the firm's choice of corporate law, give common shareholders more power to impede the sale.

Because the terms of trade are related to monopoly markups, a greater degree of openness may lead the policymaker to exploit the short-run Phillips curve more aggressively, even if it involves a smaller short-run benefit.

In so doing, this study evaluates the role of the public long-term care insurance scheme implemented in Japan in April 2000. The results indicate that when households include a disabled family member, household consumption net of long-term care costs do not decrease as much as before the introduction of long-term care insurance. Further, when compared with the surveys conducted in 1998, the adverse effects on consumption net of long-term care costs have become much weaker. These findings suggest that the introduction of social insurance in 2000 helped Japanese households to reduce the welfare losses associated with a disabled family member. J. Japanese Int.

This paper summarizes simulations that measure the potential cost of such an arrangement to the United States were it to guarantee the solvency of the account. The simulations show that those costs would be small relative to the size of US external assets and of the US economy. The paper also shows how the costs could be shared with the depositors. Creation of a substitution account could make the SDRs the principal reserve asset in the international monetary system, achieving a major reform of the reserve regime and enhancing the role of the International Monetary Fund.","Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Kenen, PB (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",pbkenen@princeton.edu,,,,,,,16,8,8,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1367-0271,,,INT FINANC,Int.

Price fairness derives from equity theory and it is focused on assuring in a transaction a reasonable report between the customer's sacrifice and the value offered by the seller. In three marketing experiments we have evaluated customers' fairness perceptions of differential prices, this tactic being frequently used by sellers. One important finding was that the motive for setting differential prices is important in fairness evaluation. Price differences based on social motives are perceived fairer than those motivated by company's interest. The differential prices on customer category are perceived fairer than zone prices. In all three marketing experiments it was demonstrated that price fairness has a significant influence on value perception and on buying intentions. Fair prices setting is one of the principles sustainable marketing is based on, reflecting a long term orientation for a company. By following this decisional direction, the commercial firm increases the value offered to its customers and it becomes more socially responsible.","[Catoiu, Iacob; Vranceanu, Diana Maria; Filip, Alina] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Vrânceanu, DM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",dvranceanu@yahoo.com,"Diana, Vranceanu/E-1737-2013; Vranceanu, Diana/L-3115-2019; Filip, Alina/AAR-8642-2021","Vranceanu, Diana/0000-0002-5547-7493; Filip, Alina/0000-0002-4753-9244",,,,,32,30,34,1,30,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2010,12.0,27,,,,,115,128,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,558MP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274747700008,0

However, these travels with religious motivation or pilgrimages, which might be considered as the first form of tourism (Rinschede, 1992), were carried out without the possibility to measure the economic, social and environmental impact. Religion-motivated tourism is extremely important in many parts of the world (Timothy and Olsen, 2006). In Romania, religious ceremonies to celebrate Saints' days as well as all the related places and relics represent places for prayer and meeting with God for millions of people. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the contributions which an increased number of visitors might have on religious settlements and the pertaining communities of Romania in the light of compliance with sustainable development principles and to identify the role that commercial activity plays within religious settlements and the way it affects the environment where it operates, from the point of view of people representing the religious tourist supply. In this respect, we carried out a questionnaire-based survey among the main monastic complexes indicating religious tourism potential and its commercial side to bring about benefits for the monastery and the community, the preservation and the accomplishment of the religious settlement's spiritual mission.","[Stanciulescu, Gabriela Cecilia] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Tirca, Alexandra-Maria] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Stanciulescu, GC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",gabriela_stanciulescu@yahoo.com,"Drule, Alexandra Maria/GXF-5035-2022; STĂNCIULESCU, GABRIELA CECILIA/AAI-2108-2021","STĂNCIULESCU, GABRIELA CECILIA/0000-0003-4791-1111",,,,,29,13,13,0,24,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2010,12.0,27,,,,,129,144,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,558MP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274747700009,0

That is, will risky behavior in one arena translate into risky behavior in another arena? The specific area of interest concerns lifestyle risk taking and financial risk-taking behavior. We utilize several psychological tests to test the respondents for the following biases: familiarity, optimism, unique invulnerability, sensation-seeking and impulsivity. The methodology utilizes tests that have not been employed in other studies. The respondents were given these tests plus a portfolio preference survey to test for effects on investing decisions. Two cohorts of student-managed investment fund managers were surveyed. These were predominantly twenty-something males who were college seniors. These subjects were chosen for two reasons: they represented a risk-taking population in general and they were sophisticated investors. We found no discernible biases present in their survey results. We also tested the mean responses to the portfolio management survey across the two cohorts, which occurred around the subprime market crash. Interestingly, the mean responses of the portfolio choice variables were not statistically different.","Stetson Univ, George Investments Inst, Sch Business Adm, Unit 8398, Deland, FL 32723 USA",Stetson University,"Belcher, LJ (通讯作者)，Stetson Univ, George Investments Inst, Sch Business Adm, Unit 8398, Deland, FL 32723 USA.",lbelcher@stetson.edu,,,,,,,19,14,16,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Using turning points defined by the Harding-Pagan algorithm, we identify and compare the timing, duration, amplitude and co-movement of cycles in money, credit and output.

This paper uses data on their characteristics early in the growth process to create benchmarks with which to evaluate potential constraints on sustained growth for sub-Saharan Africa. This analysis suggests that what are usually regarded as first-order problems broad institutions, macroeconomic stability, trade openness, education, and inequality may not now be binding constraints, although the extent of ill-health, internal conflict, and societal fractionalization do stand out as problems in contemporary Africa. A key question is to what extent Africa can rely on manufactured exports as a mode of escape from underdevelopment, a strategy successfully deployed by almost all the benchmark countries. The benchmarking comparison specifically raises two key concerns as far as a development strategy based on expanding exports of manufactures is concerned: micro-level institutions that affect the costs of exporting, and the level of the real exchange rate especially the need to avoid overvaluation.

The legitimacy of local political institutions can be perceived as one of the conditions of their stability and efficiency in relation to the rural development. The approaches and concepts of legitimacy of Max Weber, Luhmann, Tyler and Zimmerman and Zeitz are compared in the first part of article. To apply these classifications to local political institutions entails some theoretical and methodological problems, e. g. to distinguish legitimacy relating to communal politician from personal trust, ill-defined indicators of legitimacy, etc. Attempts to describe the single classification of the legitimacy of local institutions appear to be highly unproductive. On the contrary analysing various examples of legitimizing local magistrates and councils indicates that the communal legitimacy can be highly confused and can be based upon various sources of legitimation. One of the possible local legitimacy assesment is concept of the systemic and sectoral legitimacy. This approach also offers the identification of government's instruments for enhancing legitimacy. Another concept of legitimacy can be derived from case studies of Czech local political process. This pattern of legitimacy can be mainly detected in a some kind of self-legitimizing narration of communal politicians. Using theoretical approaches to the issue of political narratives (e.g. [12] et al.) it's possible to denominate it narrative legitimacy.","Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Kubálek, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",kubalek@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,299,306,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600034,0

Having performed the panel unit root and panel co integration tests, the pooled mean group techniques reveal that while no general conclusions are derived for the homogenous goods, the reverse home market effect is found for the differentiated goods. The reason of this reverse home market effect can be explained by first firms with foreign capital in Turkey largely import rather than export in the period investigated.

Liberalizing procurements reduces wasteful domestic lobbying but also increases the likelihood that a foreign firm will capture the rent. A main result is that the domestic welfare change is not monotonic in the foreign firms' abilities.

They were estimated with Jensen and Treynor and Mazuy indexes and were calculated upon weekly returns of 70 equity funds within a two-year period Lojistic regression analysis revealed that an increase in conscientiousness and openness to experience scores are associated with an increase in the odds of exhibiting successful market timing performance.

In this paper we show the opposite, based on an analysis of primary data collected to measure the impact of supermarkets on small contract farmers in Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world. Almost 10,000 farmers in the Highlands of Madagascar produce vegetables for supermarkets in Europe. In this global supply chain, small farmers' micro-contracts are combined with intensive farm assistance and supervision programs to fulfill complex quality requirements and phyto-sanitary standards of supermarkets. Small farmers that participate in these contracts have higher welfare, more income stability and shorter lean periods. We also find significant effects on improved technology adoption, better resource management and spillovers on the productivity of the staple crop rice.

If this logic were true, then controlling the scale of FDI could be a solution to reduce regional inequality. However, it is difficult to reconcile the positive effect of FDI on economic growth with its potential negative effect on regional inequality. Using the largest panel dataset covering all the Chinese regions over the entire period 1979-2003 and employing an augmented Cobb-Douglas production function, this paper proves that FDI has been an important factor responsible for regional growth differences in China. However, it suggests that FDI cannot be blamed for rising regional inequality. It is the uneven distribution of FDI instead of FDI itself that has caused regional growth differences. The research results have important policy implications on regional development in China relating to FDI.","[Wei, Kailei] Hainan Univ, Sch Management, Haikou 570228, Hainan Province, Peoples R China; [Yao, Shujie] Univ Nottingham, Sch Contemporary Chinese Studies, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Liu, Aying] Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London NW4 4BT, England",Hainan University; University of Nottingham; Middlesex University,"Wei, KL (通讯作者)，Hainan Univ, Sch Management, Haikou 570228, Hainan Province, Peoples R China.",kailei_wei@hotmail.com; shujie.yao@nottingham.ac.uk; a.liu@mdx.ac.uk,,,,,,,23,50,58,2,33,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

External shocks and flexibility in responding to the shocks are functions of, for example, the firm's technology, the complexity of the organization, and the ability to access external credit, which depend on firm size. When peers are composed of similar industry-size firms, evidence is consistent with the use of RPE in CEO compensation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed method utilizes the separate implications of the new empirical industrial organization and the stochastic frontier literatures and suggests identification using the local maximum likelihood (LML) technique. Through LML, estimation of market power of individual banks becomes feasible, while a number of restrictive theoretical and empirical assumptions are relaxed. The empirical analysis is carried out on the basis of EMU bank data. Market power estimates indicate fairly competitive conduct in general; however, heterogeneity in market power estimates is substantial across banks. The latter result suggests that the practice of some banks deviates from the average fairly competitive behavior, a finding that has important policy implications. Finally, efficiency and market power present a negative relationship, which is in line with the so-called quiet life hypothesis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using a unique and comprehensive dataset from California, it analyzes determinants of local initiatives and effects of these measures on municipal finances. Results indicate that initiatives occur more frequently in large and diverse jurisdictions with more recent movers, voters unaffiliated with a major political party, and public employees. Effects of city size are partly offset by district- or ward-level elections. Contrary to previous research on statewide initiatives, this study detects a positive and weakly significant relationship between local initiative use and own-source revenues per capita and no association between initiatives and the proportion of funds raised from fees. These divergent findings may reflect distinctive features of the local context, including greater latitude for political bargaining and the centrality of land use, as well as potential constraining effects of statewide initiatives in California.","Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Gordon, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",tgordon@umd.edu,,,,,,,39,13,14,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2009,141.0,1-2,,,,,31,48,,10.1007/s11127-009-9434-y,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,485VG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269152300005,0

Second, we investigate the demand revealing performance of real and hypothetical payments and find no evidence that real payment performs better than hypothetical payment in our experiments. Third, we examine whether payments, real and hypothetical, are positively related to induced-values. Our results suggest there is statistical evidence that payments are positively related to true values. Finally, we examine the effect of gender on real and hypothetical payments in our experiment. The results show that gender matters for contributions through both real and hypothetical payments, after controlling for true values as well as socio-economic variables.

We argue that as long as firms use both inputs in production and there is some substitutability between them, the two decisions need to be jointly analysed.

We use a definition of acquisition that we consider preferable to that used in much of the previous literature, and we employ a competing-risk hazard model that reveals important differences that depend on the type of acquirer. Since interstate acquisitions became more numerous during this period, we also investigate differences in the determinants of acquisition between in-state and out-of-state acquirers. We also employ a subsample of publicly traded banking organizations to investigate the role of managerial ownership in explaining the likelihood of acquisition. The hypothesis that acquisitions serve to transfer resources from less efficient to more efficient uses receives substantial support from our results, as do a number of other relevant hypotheses.","[Pilloff, Steven J.] George Mason Univ, Sch Management, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,,hannan.timothy@gmail.com; pilloff@hotmail.com,,,,,,,11,36,42,3,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

In the four years following split announcements, splitting firms do not experience improved operating performance relative to non-splitting firms. Furthermore, stock split signals are not related to future profitability. The positive announcement effect can be explained by lower share prices and improved market liquidity following stock splits but not by split signals and post-split operating performance. Our results show very little evidence that stock splits signal improvement in long-run operating performance and are more consistent with the trading range/liquidity hypothesis.

This paper empirically examines the effect of this exogenous, institutional change in tax policy on stock trading volume in the Japanese market. To do so, we use panel data of stocks traded in both the Japanese and United States markets and compare changes in their trading volumes at the times of the tax changes. We use a well-established V-shape relationship between turnover and price change, with three different assumptions as regards how the price change relates to turnover across stocks and markets. Although a model allowing for both slope and intercept shifts does not offer any indications one way or the other, a more restricted model allowing only for an intercept shift clearly suggests a statistically significant increase in trading volume in the Japanese market but not in the United States markets for April 1999. However, such a result was not obtained for April 1996. These results indicate that the abolition of turnover tax in 1999, but not the rate reduction in 1996, contributed to the trading volume increase. J. Japanese Int. Economies 23 (3) (2009) 241-163.

The paper finds that the gains from commitment are increasing in the openness of the economy while the optimal rate of inflation is decreasing in the openness of the economy. These results imply that the main findings of Adam and Billi (2007) for a closed-economy model are also true for an open-economy model. Finally, the paper finds that the effectiveness of the exchange-rate channel as a stabilization tool in the low interest rate environment depends on whether the central bank can make a credible commitment. If the central bank cannot commit and makes monetary-policy decisions on a discretionary basis, the optimal path of the nominal exchange rate will exhibit an appreciation, rather than depreciation as suggested in the literature.

Using survey data from nearly 900 Australian firms we examine this issue, paying particular attention to whether knowledge capture impedes knowledge creation. We find that firms which favor closed-larning practices tend to rely more upon patents and secrecy, and eschew lead-ime and brands as ways to capture profits.

Most existing option pricing practices take the yield curve as given, thus having little to say about the fair valuation of the underlying interest rates. This paper proposes an m + n model structure that bridges the gap in the literature by successfully pricing both interest rates and interest rate options. The first m factors capture the yield curve variation, whereas the latter n factors capture the interest rate options movements that cannot be effectively identified from the yield curve. We propose a sequential estimation procedure that identifies the m yield curve factors from the LIBOR and swap rates in the first step and the n options factors from interest rate caps in the second step. The three yield curve factors explain over 99% of the variation in the yield curve but account for less than 50% of the implied volatility variation for the caps.

We assume central banks set policy optimally, such that we can reverse engineer policy objectives from observed time series data. Joint tests of the posterior distributions of these policy preference parameters suggest that the central banks are very similar in their overall objective. None of the central banks show a concern for stabilizing the real exchange rate. All three central banks share a concern for minimizing the volatility in the change in the nominal interest rate. We also show that the resulting optimal policy rule responds to exchange rate movements, even in the case where the central banks do not explicitly care about exchange rate stabilization. This result is also corroborated by results from an alternative simple-rule characterization and estimation of central bank behavior. These last two findings point to the pitfalls of making inferences, from the level of ad hoc simple rules, about what central banks may care about.","[Kam, Timothy] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Kam, Timothy; Liu, Philip] Australian Natl Univ, CAMA, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Lees, Kirdan] Reserve Bank New Zealand, Dept Econ, Wellington 6011, New Zealand",Australian National University; Australian National University; Reserve Bank of New Zealand,"Kam, T (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Sch Econ, Arndt Bldg 25A, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",timothy.kam@anu.edu.au; kirdan.lees@rbnz.govt.nz; philip.liu@anu.edu.au,,"Kam, Timothy/0000-0002-3938-609X",,,,,33,24,26,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Our main hypothesis is that poor accounting information quality raises uncertainty about a firm's financial condition for outside investors, though not necessarily for insiders. This accounting effect lowers demand for a firm's new equity, thereby raising underwriting costs and risk. Using a large sample of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), we show that poor accounting information quality is associated with higher flotation costs in terms of larger underwriting fees, larger negative SEO announcement effects, and a higher probability of SEO withdrawals.

Corroborated with the advance of the Internet recorded in the last decade, these changes form the perfect recipe for the emergence (ever since the '90s), functioning and development of flexible forms of labour at distance, using the technology of information and communication. Among the first domains where the impact of technology is very strong may be named education, marketing, advertising and commerce; the forms of manifestation are materialized in e-learning, cyber-marketing, online advertising and electronic commerce. But the simple use of technology does not automatically assure the success of the new forms of activity. These transformations of the traditional into digital, of the classic into virtual must be accompanied by the adequate support with respect to the quality of services, standards, platforms and the hardware and software technologies. If we are referring to the educational domain, we have to analyze the e-learning phenomenon or tele-education in its spectacular evolution in such a recent history. Quality represents a landmark of major importance in all the fields of modern society based on knowledge. From the perspective of tele-education, quality assurance must be focalized on three main directions: the quality of the actual educational process (class/course support, platform, technology, etc.); the quality of the instructor (professional training, qualification, specialization, pedagogic ability, teaching method, etc.); the quality of the person undergoing the course/class (training, knowledge thesaurus, involvement, accumulation wish, etc.). Also, like in any activity, quality standard reporting means an economic approach by quality costs. Theat means that the good product or quality services in e-learning are very strongly linked with educational multimedia production and good costs.","[Stoica, Marian; Ghilic-Micu, Bogdan] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Stoica, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",marians@ase.ro; ghilic@ase.ro,"Ghilic-Micu, Bogdan/AAE-1257-2020; Stoica, Marian/H-9490-2019","Ghilic-Micu, Bogdan/0000-0003-3038-1302; Stoica, Marian/0000-0003-2852-9224",,,,,6,7,10,1,21,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2009,11.0,26,,,,,355,363,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,462KQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267351800014,0

Further simulations demonstrate that a simple extension of the traditional structural shift model derived explicitly from our Bayesian framework can correct for much of the WTP bias, with an empirical application confirming the simulation outcomes.

The ethnographic study of one village in each of the two countries contextualizes women's lives in the kinship and marriage system in which power and gender relations are embedded. Current land policies, when implemented in the existing kinship and marriage system, make women's entitlement to land more vulnerable than men's, limit women's choices and weaken their power position. Variations in kinship rules in the two countries lead to different outcomes. In the Chinese village the dominance of patrilocal marriage and exogamous marriages limits women's access to land, whereas in the Vietnamese village the rigid concentration of inheritance to males puts women in a difficult position.

Overconfident investors overreact to the signal and introduce an additional risk factor causing stock prices to be excessively volatile. Consequently, rational investors choose a conservative portfolio; moreover, this portfolio depends not just on the current price divergence but also on their prediction about future sentiment and the speed of price convergence.","[Dumas, Bernard] Univ Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, NBER, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Kurshev, Alexander; Uppal, Raman] London Business Sch, London, England",University of Lausanne; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); University of London; London Business School,"Dumas, B (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, NBER, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",,"Dumas, Bernard/B-4306-2010","Uppal, Raman/0000-0001-9428-147X",,,,,72,161,179,7,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

The paper starts by reviewing the characterization of the sustainable rate of return of an earnings-related pension system with pay-as-you-go financing. We show that current proxies for the sustainable rate, including the Swedish 'gyroscope', are not stable and propose an alternative measure that depends on the growth of the buffer-stock and the payas-you-go asset. Using a simple one-sector macroeconomic model that embeds a notional account pension system we then show how GDP-indexed government bonds, if combined with the right measure for the sustainable rate of return on contributions, could be used to generate a Sustainable and secure earnings-related pension system, without becoming a fiscal burden. The proposal is particularly attractive for Countries considering reforms to earnings-related systems that have accumulated a large implicit pension debt. In this case, the government bonds allow the financing of this debt in a transparent way. The proposed mechanism can also facilitate the transition to a fully funded pension system when the government bonds are allowed to be traded.","[Bodor, Andras] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,,drobalino@worldbank.org; abodor@worldbank.org,,,,,,,22,17,18,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Also, despite the large number of firms in the market, prices remain above marginal cost and may even rise as more firms enter. in a non-cooperative oligopoly pricing model, I show that these anomalies arise when firms add complexity to their price structures. Complexity increases the market power of the firms because it prevents some consumers from becoming knowledgeable about prices in the market. In the model, as competition increases, firms tend to add more complexity to their prices as a best response, rather than make their disclosures more transparent. Because this may substantially decrease consumer surplus in these markets, such practices have important welfare implications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We find the price elasticity of housing demand to be -0.3, lower than previous studies for developed countries and within the range for developing countries. Permanent income is a major component of housing demand. with an elasticity of 0.8. In contrast, temporary income has a very low elasticity of 0.04.

For this purpose, the author compares the magnitude of productivity and wage spillovers derived from foreign presence to local firms in different locations. Using plant-level panel data for Indonesian manufacturing in 1990-95, the study finds supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the effects of foreign presence on the level and growth of productivity and wages in locally owned plants are greater in regions where multinational corporation affiliates tend to have a higher concentration as compared to other regions in the same province. The findings indicate that spillovers occur locally and diffuse to neighboring regions in part, and thus that the concentration of foreign direct investment in a certain region imparts a greater positive externality on one hand, and negatively affects regional disparities on the other.","Int Ctr Study E Asian Dev, Kokurakita Ku, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan",,"Takii, S (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Study E Asian Dev, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Otemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan.",takii@icsead.or.jp,,,,,,,25,6,6,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We used a OLS model with panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE) and panel data from six transition countries for the period 1999-2006. We measure the qualitative development in the banking sector with the margin between deposit and lending interest rates (INT). Quantitative aspects of the banking sector were measured using variables: Domestic credit to private sector as share of GDP and variable Domestic credit provided by banking sector as share of GDP. Quantitative development of the banking sector affects the economic growth in the observed period, since variable Domestic credit provided by banking sector proved statistically significant. However, the second variable, Domestic credit to private sector, did not prove to be significant in the observed period.

We argue that these distinct types of owners have different objectives and motivations and this will affect how they exercise their control rights over the firms they invest in. In particular, we contend that private ownership of listed firms in China is not necessarily superior to certain types of state ownership. To test our arguments we investigate the relative efficiency of state versus private ownership of listed firms and the efficiency of various forms of state ownership. The empirical results indicate that the operating efficiency of Chinese listed companies varies across the type of controlling shareholder. SOECG controlled firms perform best and SAMB and Private controlled firms perform worst. SOELG controlled firms are in the middle. The results are consistent with our predictions.

Motivated by a theoretical model of entry, results of fixed-effects logit regressions suggest that there has been a change in the geographical diversification strategies of Turkish banks. It appears that the dominance of strategic concerns, such as competing with banks of similar size, has diminished, while economic concerns, such as incumbent characteristics and cost considerations, have become more important.

We find that for firms likely to engage in FDI, their rates of FDI are affected by the financial health of their main banks. However, only the rate of M&A FDI is affected by relative wealth. The rate of non-M&A FDI is affected by profitability and firm size. our findings show the importance of distinguishing M&A FDI from non-M&A FDI and of considering the two types of FDI jointly.

This article focuses on a detailed analysis of non-contributory periods in the Czech pension system and their impact on pension system balance and micro and macro economic connections. The extent of non-contributory periods considered in the pension system represents one of the theoretical possibilities of parametric changes to the pension insurance system. The amount of non-contributory periods or the proportion between non-contributory periods and years worked, or the proportion between paid insurance and non-contributory periods (potential loss of insurance contributions) has, to date, merely been estimated in the Czech Republic. The study presents the first accurate figures, based on unique individual data on insured persons. The analysis reveals that non-contributory periods are a significant element of the Czech pension system amounting to 22.4% of the total insurance period. The average duration of non-contributory periods for current pensioners is 8.7 years.","Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs, CZ-12801 Prague 2, Czech Republic",Research Institute for Labour & Social Affairs,"Holub, M (通讯作者)，Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs, Palackeho Nam 4, CZ-12801 Prague 2, Czech Republic.",martin.holub@vupsv.cz,,,,,,,36,1,1,2,8,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Instead, the article argues that even 30 years after the conception of the entitlement approach, it remains a potent framework for famine analysis, as illustrated by the recent 2005 famine in Niger. However, as contemporary famines are increasingly linked to factors that have hitherto received limited attention in entitlement analysis-conflicts, legal collapses and political struggles-the article calls for supplementary famine analysis on the meso and macro levels.","Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Rubin, O (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",or@ifs.ku.dk,"Rubin, Olivier/AAW-2780-2021","Rubin, Olivier/0000-0002-2364-6782",,,,,43,10,12,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The transitory nature of valuation gains holds for both average US listings and average first-time firm listings. We find little evidence of a permanent effect on returns for firms that list abroad, even for firms' listings in markets that are more liquid, provide better legal protection, or have a larger shareholder base.","[Schill, Michael J.] Univ Virginia, Darden Grad Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA; [Sarkissian, Sergei] McGill Univ, Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada",University of Virginia; McGill University,"Sarkissian, S (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Darden Grad Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA.",sergei.sarkissian@mcgill.ca,"Schill, Michael J/H-6580-2013",,,,,,67,108,127,1,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

A model of moral hazard is developed in which financial constraints arise endogenously. The model predicts that higher private assets relax financial constraints and have a positive effect on the firm's probability of survival. The empirical analysis confirms that the entrepreneur has a higher propensity to stay in business when she inherits capital.

In this paper we take a new look at the issue, by contrasting the use of options with that of stock. We do this by integrating the repricing or resetting aspect of options with that of industrial structure. We show that industry competition may play an important role in dictating which form of compensation is optimal. When aggressive competition for key professional staff is an issue, the flexibility of options may actually become a disadvantage and therefore pure stock compensation may survive as an equilibrium. Thus compensation trends may be partly explained by trends in the nature of the competitive environment.","[Stoughton, Neal M.] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Wong, Kit Pong] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Calgary; University of Hong Kong,"Stoughton, NM (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",,"Wong, Kit Pong/A-4405-2010",,Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [W 1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),,,19,5,5,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,,,REV FINANC,Rev.

In this work, both the minimum capital requirement for the banks, and the price of the loans are calculated with different credit risk measurement approaches depending on the development of the ratings of two hypothetical companies,one Retail SME and the other Institutional SME.

A Clustering method is applied. It is shown that in a highly urbanised Country, the Situation is far from being spatially equitable in terms of accessibility, and some areas are more favoured than others. Congestion increases spatial inequalities, differently according to absolute or relative measures of change. By means of examples. this paper shows that even simple accessibility indicators Could be useful to Support decisions taken by planners and politicians (e.g. as regards the development of residential, industrial and business park areas). Maps indicate the spatial inequalities in terms of accessibility to urban centres and transport nodes, and the impact of congestion on these inequalities. The absolute and relative time losses due to congestion affect different areas in different ways. The location of new developments further increases the congestion problem and the spatial disparities. This paper also insists on the caution that should be adopted when measuring and interpreting accessibility, its measurements, its inputs, its temporal changes in absolute and relative terms as well as the need for spatially disaggregated data.

FDI has a significantly positive, though quantitatively modest impact on manufacturing employment in Mexico. This applies to both white collar and blue collar employment.

The position that a general manager holds in directorate has positive linear relation with discount rate. The numbers of substantial shareholders, index Z, the proportion of shares possessed by institutional investors within the top ten fund holders and proportion of shares possessed by the fund company itself and its shareholders have negative linear relation with discount rate.

There had been no specification on the position of board secretary before the Company Law was amended, which is the immediate reason why it had been vacant on the secretary position in listed companies. The amended Company Law approved the position of the board secretary legally for the first time, which will probably improve the quality of information disclosure of listed companies. This paper adopts the measurement method proposed by Kim and Verrecchia (2001) to measure the quality of information disclosure. Through empirically investigating the constituent companies of Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 index, we find the following results. After the enforcement of the amended Company Law, the quality of information disclosure of the listed companies has been improved largely. Besides, the secretary's shareholding reduces the quality of information disclosure. However, other characteristics of secretary, including age, tenure, education level, dual positions, and related work experience, have no significant impact on the quality of information disclosure.","[Zhou Kaiguo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,,zhoukg@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,8,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,1552,1566,,,,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000195,0

We find that a post-earnings-announcement drift (PEAD) anomaly exists in China. When earnings surprise is defined relative to analyst forecasts, a hedge strategy of going long the top quintile of earnings surprise stocks and short the bottom quintile of earnings surprise stocks can generate around 9.5% excess return in 1 year following the earnings announcements. When earnings surprise is defined relative to time-series model forecasts, a hedge strategy of going long the top quintile of earnings surprise stocks and short the bottom quintile of earnings surprise stocks can generate around 9% excess return in 1 year following the earnings announcements. The return from trading on earnings surprise is robust to the inclusion of beta, firm size, book-to-market ratio, momentum, liquidity and transaction cost measures, state ownership, cross-listing and accounting standards. There is evidence that the magnitude of PEAD increases in the level of arbitrage risk and decreases in the level of foreign ownership. We also find that PEAD is strongly related to firms' future financial performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

Using the Fama-French 49 US industry portfolios this paper empirically shows that the loading on market coskewness and market cokurtosis components of higher co-moment asset pricing models are not robust across the outcome of the conditional return distribution. However, for most of the 49 industry portfolios it seems like the loadings on market covariance are very robust, almost constant, across the conditional return distribution. The loadings on market coskewness, on the other hand, are not robust but show a very distinct profile, increasing from negative in the left tail to positive in the right tail, and this profile is surprisingly similar across all the 49 industry portfolios. Finally, the results for the loading on market cokurtosis remain puzzling. The findings imply that separation of bull and bear markets and/or applying discrete regime switching approaches may not be sufficient to fully account for the asymmetric higher market co-moment effects. Furthermore, improvement in adjusted R-squares using higher market co-moments stems from market coskewness and appears only in the tails of the conditional return distribution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.

Although relationships suggest that the world portfolio could potentially accommodate financing requirements over the intermediate horizon, substantial uncertainty surrounds the likelihood of that accommodation and the associated effects on interest rates and adjustments in international portfolios.

During a recession, reporting quality is increased, potentially causing a crisis-like adjustment of economic activity to the cycle.

Also, this quality randomly varies from one model and hedging problem to the other. We show that accounting for the variance of modeling errors substantially reduces both hedging errors and transaction costs for all considered models. Additionally, it leads to much more stable weights in the hedging portfolios and - as a result - to more homogeneous hedging quality.

Several approaches measure equity in transit supply however none produce a simple system-wide measure of equity performance. A new approach is presented using Lorenz curves to measure the relative supply of transit to the population. Gini coefficients provide a single measure of overall equity using this method. A system-wide assessment of overall transit supply to the population in Melbourne. Australia shows that 70% of the population shares only 19% of the supply (Gini coefficient = .68). When employment is also taken into account, the situation is not much different; 70% of jobs and population share 23% of service (G = .62). In order to gain some understanding of vertical equity, the transit supply was compared between different age, income and vehicle ownership groups. There is some evidence of higher supply for youth and low-income groups in inner Melbourne, and in all parts of Melbourne no-vehicle households lived in areas of higher transit supply. Overall it is unclear how fair these distributions are compared to equity in other cities since this is the first time this method has been undertaken. Projects using similar approaches should provide a good basis for establishing comparative equity between cities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The current paper is a sequel to the earlier one, and outlines significant policy themes emerging from a research project on a holistic approach to road safety. Two overarching themes include the importance of leadership for policy change and implementation, and addressing the more transformative aspects of intervening in a system. A distinction can be drawn between deep sustainable change, which usually requires fundamental redesign of the systems involved, and shallow adaptive change. Examples of deep change discussed include the much wider application of mobility management, a strong shift to active travel and public transport, and a reconsideration of how time is structured in society, as with the adoption of Slow Cities principles. Transformational leadership can draw on a variety of knowledge cultures, which can all share in collective decision-making and possible actions for the future. We discuss especially leadership at the worldview, organisational, and community levels. Vision Zero approaches are valuable, but need to be integrated with a common vision for a sustainable transport system developed in conjunction with energy, transport, health, environment, and education agencies. In addition, Vision Zero approaches can be assisted by greater attention to and questioning of embedded cultural practices and behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite this, relatively little is known about Arab foreign aid. The OECD development database offers a paucity of information, aggregating data for Arab countries and Arab agencies, without identifying the constituent units of either. A further complication is that Arab donors are not uniformly transparent about their aid efforts, publicizing some of them while keeping other donations secret. In this paper, we advance the state of knowledge of Arab foreign aid in a number of ways. We use AidData to document the trends in reported donations from specific bilateral donors (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) and multilateral agencies (Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, OPEC's Fund for International Development, and the Islamic Development Bank). Notably, Arab bilateral donors have given less generously over time with aid levels remaining relatively stable despite skyrocketing national wealth. We explore reasons for this decline, including that Arab donors have: shifted their giving from bilateral to multilateral channels, given less as DAC donors have given more, and increased domestic spending at the expense of foreign aid with a view to safeguarding regime security. In addition, we look at the sectoral allocations of Arab bilateral and multilateral organizations, and compare the aid practices of Arab donors to their DAC counterparts. Finally, we suggest why an exclusive focus on aid commitments is problematic where Arab aid is concerned. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The main result of the cointegration analysis is that one of the long run determinants of unemployment in Turkey is the sectoral employment demand shifts. Therefore, sectoral employment shifts may explain some part of the increase in unemployment. Our analysis also shows that there is cyclical component of unemployment in the long-run for the Turkish economy.","[Wigley, Arzu Akkoyunlu] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Cankaya, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Wigley, AA (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, Beytepe Campus, TR-06800 Cankaya, Turkey.",arzus@hacettepe.edu.tr; sevinc@hacettepe.edu.tr,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,7,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

A simple model formalizes this intuition and gives an explicit structural form on the rigged incentive portion of CEO wage function. Using U.S. data, we find support for the model's predictions: rigging accounts for at least 10% of the compensation to performance sensitivity and it increases with CEO human capital and firm volatility. Moreover, a firm with rigged incentive pay that is one standard deviation above the mean faces a subsequent decrease of 4.8% in firm value and 7.5% in operating return on assets.","[Morse, Adair; Seru, Amit] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Nanda, Vikram] Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Management, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University of Chicago; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Morse, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,"nanda, vikram/P-8953-2019","nanda, vikram/0000-0003-2463-4940",,,,,56,185,221,6,100,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

We focus on the effects of employer size on the prospective entrepreneur, and argue that employer size has a negative effect on both entrepreneurial competence and commitment. This implies that entrepreneurs from small firms should have superior economic performance and, for a given level of performance, be less likely to exit entrepreneurship.

I model durable consumption growth as containing a persistent expected component and driven by counter-cyclical volatility, nondurable consumption as a random walk, and dividend growth as exposed to the expected component of durable consumption growth. Together with nonseparable Epstein-Zin preferences, the model demonstrates that long-run risk in durable consumption can explain major asset market phenomena.

While prior studies have examined this issue within the context of derivatives' trading, little is known regarding the linkage between corporate governance and alternative corporate risk management activities such as insurance. Using a detailed firm survey conducted by the World Bank (2004), we examine the impacts of various governance monitoring mechanisms and chief executive officer (CEO) characteristics on the corporate insurance decision. Overall, our results suggest that both monitoring mechanisms and managerial incentives induce the corporate purchase of property insurance. However, the purchase of property insurance for managerial self-interest is only prevalent in firms subject to lax monitoring, and the determinants of insurance purchases are more in line with the prediction of the economic theory in firms with strong monitoring.

Optimism below (above) the interior optimum leads the CEO to underinvest (over-invest). Hence, if boards of directors act in the interests of shareholders, CEOs with relatively low or high optimism face a higher probability of forced turnover than moderately optimistic CEOs face. Using a large sample of turnovers, we find strong empirical support for this prediction.

Spatially-referenced simulated individuals from a spatial microsimulation model for Ireland (SMILE) who reside within the geographic extent of the market for recreation at the forest are identified using GIS techniques. A travel cost model, adjusted for truncation and endogenous stratification, is estimated for a sample of visitors to the site and transferred across each individual in the simulated population. The SMILE model and GIS-based network analysis are used to derive the appropriate values for the explanatory variables in the transfer. Each simulated individual's latent demand for visits to the site is predicted and summed, in order to derive aggregate visits and amenity value estimates. The paper makes two principal contributions. First, it sets out a new approach for modelling the geographic extent of the market for recreation using survey data on reported travel distances and GIS techniques. Second, it develops a new simulation-based modelling approach for predicting total site visits at non-priced open-access recreation sites.","Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Cullinan, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Cairnes Bldg, Galway, Ireland.",john.cullinan@nuigalway.ie,,,,,,,35,13,15,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We argue that, as a consequence, the preferences of the opposition concerning fiscal outcomes should be reflected in the yearly budget balances. We present a theoretical argument in which the opposition faces a trade-off. It has a short-term interest in deficits since they can signal a weak government, but a long-term aversion to them because, if they reach office, they will have to deal with the burden of increased debt. Empirically, we find that opposition parties affect deficit outcomes depending on their probability of governing in the next term and the weakness of the incumbent government. When the opposition is mainly concentrated in one party, it is likely that it will take over the government and this will make the opposition deficit-averse in the current period.

A panel of 24 parliamentary democracies for the years 1960-2004 is used to examine the relationship between electoral institutions and health. The authors find that greater electoral proportionality is positively associated with overall population health (as indicated by life expectancy) and with the health of the poorest (as indicated by a reduction in infant mortality). A panel of 17 countries for the years 1970-2004 is then used to show to that electoral permissiveness modifies the impact of health spending on infant mortality.","[Wigley, Simon] Bilkent Univ, Dept Philosophy, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Akkoyunlu-Wigley, Arzu] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06532 Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Hacettepe University,"Wigley, S (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Philosophy, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",wigley@bilkent.edu.tr; arzus@hacettepe.edu.tr,"Wigley, Simon D/A-6664-2013","Wigley, Simon D/0000-0001-9181-0129",,,,,71,29,30,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2011,148.0,3-4,,,,,595,610,,10.1007/s11127-010-9686-6,0.0,,,16,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,817QE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294688100019,0

The difference in performance may be especially important in estimating quantities that depend on tail features, including risk measures such as the expected shortfall. Here, using recent generalizations of the asymmetric Student-t and exponential power distributions to allow separate parameters to control skewness and the thickness of each tail, we fit daily financial return volatility and forecast expected shortfall for the S&P 500 index and a number of individual company stocks: the generalized distributions are used for the standardized innovations in a nonlinear, asymmetric GARCH-type model. The results provide evidence for the usefulness of the general distributions in improving fit and prediction of downside market risk of financial assets. Constrained versions, corresponding with distributions used in the previous literature, are also estimated in order to provide a comparison of the performance of different conditional distributions.

We prove that the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the AEP parameters are consistent on the whole parameter space, and when sufficiently large values of the shape parameters are considered, they are also asymptotically efficient and normal. We derive the Fisher information matrix for the AEP and we show that it can be continuously extended also to the region of small shape parameters. Through numerical simulations, we find that this extension can be used to obtain a reliable value for the errors associated to ML estimates also for samples of relatively small size (100 observations). Moreover, we show that around this sample size, the bias associated with ML estimates, although present, becomes negligible. Finally, we present a few empirical investigations, using diverse data from economics and finance, to compare the performance of AEP with respect to other, commonly used, families of distributions.","[Bottazzi, Giulio] Scuola Super Sant Anna, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Secchi, Angelo] Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Secchi, Angelo] Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; University of Pisa,"Bottazzi, G (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Pza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",bottazzi@sssup.it; angelo.secchi@univ-paris1.fr,,"Bottazzi, Giulio/0000-0003-2565-4732",,,,,29,44,48,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

However, governments often do not have sufficient support to privatize SOEs. We provide evidence that threatening privatization and market competition (entry of new firms) can increase the productivity of SOEs, even though privatization and entry of new firms does not occur. We study productivity at Brazil's state-owned oil company Petrobras. Petrobras's total factor productivity increased sharply after it lost its legal monopoly, doubling in 6 years. These large gains occurred despite the fact that Petrobras faced no immediate de facto competition. The threat of competition and privatization was sufficient to generate large productivity gains. These findings suggest that changing the competitive environment can be a powerful force for improving productivity at state-owned firms.

This paper provides a formal assessment of the direct and indirect impacts of higher prices of agricultural goods on global poverty using a representative sample of 63-93% of the developing world's population. To assess the direct effects, the paper uses domestic food price data between January 2005 and December 2007-when the relative price of food staples rose by an average of 5.6%-to find that the number of individuals living under the extreme poverty line increased by 155 million, with almost three-quarters of this increase taking place in East Asia. To take the second-order effects into account, the paper links household survey data with a global general equilibrium model, finding that the same increase in consumer prices of agricultural goods (modeled by increasing demand for first-generation biofuels) would raise the number of individuals living under extreme poverty by 32 million, with nearly the entire increase occurring in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.","[Medvedev, Denis] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [de Hoyos, Rafael E.] ITESM, Inst Innovat Educ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",The World Bank; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Medvedev, D (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, I4-216,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dmedvedev@worldbank.org,,,,,,,16,49,57,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Since the need for policy incentives for the reduction of emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) was officially recognized in 2007, the focus of this debate has shifted to issues of implementation. Concerns about the effects that the availability of low-cost REDD credits might have on energy investments, and the development of clean technology constitute the main motivation of this paper. We analyze the production side of the problem with the help of a real options model with an option to invest in less carbon-intensive energy technology and an option to purchase credits on REDD, which will (or will not) be exercised in the future. Unresolved questions can thus still be addressed later, while producers and investors hold REDD options to maintain flexibility for later decisions.","[Fuss, Sabine; Szolgayova, Jana; Obersteiner, Michael] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Szolgayova, Jana] Comenius Univ, Fac Math Phys & Informat, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Golub, Alexander] Environm Def Fund, Washington, DC 20009 USA",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Comenius University Bratislava; Environmental Defense Fund,"Fuss, S (通讯作者)，Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",fuss@iiasa.ac.at; szolgay@iiasa.ac.at; agolub@edf.org; oberstei@iiasa.ac.at,"Szolgayová, Jana/AAK-3547-2020; Golub, Alexander/E-8224-2019; Golub, Alexander/ABC-8470-2020","Golub, Alexander/0000-0002-3586-1447",,,,,19,13,13,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Debt holders are likely to charge higher interest to price-protect themselves because of the under-investment and asset substitution problems. All-equity firms, however, could reduce interest charge by employing Big 4 auditors to increase the reliability of audited financial statements or using short-term debt to allow more frequent monitoring of their financial condition by lenders and re-pricing of debt. The results show that interest charge is positively related to investment opportunities of all-equity firms. This relationship is weaker when the firms have Big 4 auditors or a higher proportion of debt due in the next year over total debt. In addition, the above results do not hold for highly levered firms since the lenders are constantly monitoring the financial condition of their borrowers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We use an individual-specific measure of debtor protection that has its maximum value when the borrower's home equity is lower than the state homestead exemption (the debtor's home equity is fully protected), and is decreasing in the difference between the home equity and the homestead exemption (the amount that the creditor can seize). We find that unlimited liability small businesses have lower access to credit in states with more debtor-friendly bankruptcy laws. In addition, these businesses face tighter loan terms - they are more likely to pledge business collateral, have shorter maturities, and borrow smaller amounts. For limited liability small businesses, we also find a reduction in credit availability, but of smaller magnitude, together with an increase in the loan rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Under a passive nominal interest rate peg, the direct effects of a negative productivity shock combine with deflation to produce strong incentives for corporate default.

This article aims at presenting and discussing the results for France, by replacing them in a chronological perspective and adding some relevant international comparisons, enabling to assess convergence of financial systems in Europe and in the world. Beyond a quite sizeable decrease of the financial intermediation rate in France over the covered period, these results indeed stress the growing part of the Rest of the world, while financing of the national economy by resident financial intermediaries (FI) diminishes. Conversely, resident FI have developed their operations with the Rest of the world, diversifying thus their customers. A broader view of the intermediation concept is then proposed in order to put in perspective the so-called decline of financial intermediation. A complementary view of intermediation revenues enables to measure the evolution of remunerations gained by resident Fl and to understand the changes that made it possible to maintain (or increase) their revenues through the key part played by FI on capital markets. These structural trends confirm that their commitments inside economies have evolved rather than diminished. Financial intermediation thus remains strongly rooted at the heart of the modern economy.","[Boutillier, Michel] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def & Banque France, Paris, France; [Bricongne, Jean-Charles] Banque France, Direct Etud & Stat Monetaires, Serv Etud & Stat Operat Financieres, Banque, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Boutillier, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def & Banque France, Paris, France.",,"Bricongne, Jean-Charles/ABH-2218-2021",,,,,,31,1,1,1,19,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Using Monte Carlo simulation, expected utility is computed for three different specifications of utility : power utility, mean-shortfall, and mean-downside deviation. Depending on risk aversion and the level of sophistication assumed for the DC scheme, minimum acceptable funding ratios are between 0.87 and 1.20 in nominal terms. For relative risk aversion of 5 and a DC scheme with a fixed-contribution setup, the minimum nominal funding ratio is between 0.87 and 0.98. The attractiveness of the DB plan increases with the expected equity premium and the fraction invested in stocks. We conclude that the expected value of intergenerational solidarity, providing time-diversification to its participants, can be large. Minimum funding ratios in real (inflation-adjusted) terms lie between 0.56 and 0.79. Given a DB pension fund with a funding ratio of 1.30, a participant in a DC plan has to pay a 2.7 to 6.1% point higher contribution on average to achieve equal expected utility.","Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Siegmann, A (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",asiegmann@feweb.vu.nl,,"Siegmann, Arjen/0000-0002-0285-745X",,,,,21,6,6,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

The two types of load units are obviously used in quite different logistics settings. The two transport segments are compared in terms of the transport markets they serve, the competition they face and the operational and technological principles upon which they operate. The empirical setting is the transport of general cargo in load units between Scandinavia, Continental Europe and the UK, although the container segment is analysed as an element of deep-sea liner shipping. Empirical findings are drawn from the case of the Port of Gothenburg and its Scandinavian hinterland. Sustained double-digit annual growth has led to a situation where most of the potential marker for the hinterland transport of maritime containers has already been realised. The challenge for further growth is now to capture the semi-trailer segment. Not surprisingly, this analysis shows that rail is more competitive for the hinterland transport of containers than of semi-trailers, but there are still significant opportunities for reaping the benefits of rail transport of semi-trailer transport in the hinterlands of European ports. An increased integration of rail transport and Roll-on/Roll-off shipping will not only require, but also encourage, changes in the overall system design as well as its competitiveness compared to all-road and all-rail services.

How do changes in market competition, organizational changes, and technological innovation affect workers' participation in workplace training in Canada? We find that firms' training provision significantly affects workers' participation in Canada. We also find that increased international competition, organizational changes, and technological innovation are significantly correlated with workers' training participation at workplaces. We note that workers in some sectors and in smaller firms have lower workplace training incidence and older, part-time, production and marketing/sales workers and workers with preschool children participate less in workplace training.","[Xu, Kuan] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; [Lin, Zhengxi] Human Resources & Skills Dev Canada, Gatineau, PQ K1A 0J9, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Xu, K (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada.",kuan.xu@dal.ca; zhengxi.lin@hrsdc-rhdsc.gc.ca,,"Xu, Kuan/0000-0003-0414-0644",,,,,43,11,13,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

In the fall of 1993, the provincial government exited liquor retailing, all government stores were shut down, and entrepreneurs were allowed to open private liquor stores. In this article, we take advantage of this abrupt regulatory change in the Alberta liquor-retailing industry to address two related issues that have received little empirical attention. First, we investigate how an ancestral population affects processes of legitimation and competition. While density-dependence theory predicts that legitimation effects outweigh competitive effects at low levels of density, will this be the case when a new population replaces a similar, ancestral one? Second, beyond density dependence, we investigate how ancestral populations affect the locations of new entrepreneurial ventures. Will entrepreneurs follow ancestral location patterns, and will these ancestral locations confer survival advantages? To answer these questions, we map all private liquor stores on the street map of Calgary, Alberta's largest city, from 1994 to 2003 and analyze store founding and failure. We use our results to draw implications for theories of density dependence, entrepreneurial behavior, and industry spatial structure.","[Dowell, Glen] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [David, Robert J.] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada",Cornell University; McGill University,"Dowell, G (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",gwd39@cornell.edu; robert.david@mcgill.ca,"David, Robert J/B-6216-2015","Dowell, Glen/0000-0003-3829-7404",,,,,52,6,8,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Meanwhile, the economy first lingered in a deep recession and then recovered with a period of strong growth. This paper focuses on how the distributional impact of Employment Insurance (El) evolved during this period. We find that El was strongly redistributive throughout the whole period with respect to the earnings of individuals, and somewhat less so for family income. But we also show that the distribution of benefits and contributions changed substantially over time, becoming less redistributive. Somewhat counter-intuitively, both the benefit and contribution sides of the program are shown to be redistributive, even though the contribution structure is regressive. These findings are relevant in the current context, as the economy struggles with a combination of high unemployment and fiscal pressures on government spending.","[Finnie, Ross] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Irvine, Ian] Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Irvine, Ian] Univ Coll Dublin, Geary Inst, Dublin, Ireland",University of Ottawa; Concordia University - Canada; University College Dublin,"Finnie, R (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",,,,,,,,24,5,5,0,13,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

This GIS-based toolkit generates a suite of over 40 variables describing route characteristics such as distance, travel time, speed statistics, number of intersections, number of turns, number of stop signs/stop lights, and a measure of route circuity, to name a few. The input to the toolkit is one or more routes, which can be obtained from global positioning system (GPS) data or some other means (e.g., shortest path). While the toolkit is designed to support route choice modeling by generating variables that have been tested in previous modeling efforts, we demonstrate its utility by testing the hypothesis that workers choose routes to minimize either travel time or distance between home and work. A GPS-enhanced data set of 237 observed routes for home-to-work trips collected for auto drivers in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada is used in our analysis. We find that the null hypothesis is refuted - that is, a comparison of observed routes to their shortest-path alternatives based on time and distance via inferential statistics indicates that observed routes are significantly longer compared to their alternatives. This finding suggests that workers may choose routes based on other route attributes. The attributes generated by the RCA toolkit for observed, shortest time, and shortest distance routes are compared and significant differences are noted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
