Then it researched consumers' self-confidence, perceived risk, WOM actively sought and discussed the relationships between these factors and influence of WOM. The results show that consumers' self-confidence has a direct and positive effect on WOM actively sought. And perceived risk has a direct and positive effect on actively sought. Lastly, WOM actively sought has a direct and positive effect on influence of WOM.

But Central China, affected by its own economic fundamentals, the wealth effect is not that stable. West China, due to the limited financing channels, is easily affected by the macroeconomic policies on the real estate market. In this paper, we suggest that state department should analyze different conditions and real estate markets in the three regions, and then take different but efficient measures to promote the development of real estate market in different regions, and stimulate local consumption.

Changes in the structure of the social labor force or the social consumption or the rate of exogenous technical progress affect the profit gap between the two technologies. The basic conclusions are that, when the proportion of skills increases, the firm prefers the skill-biased technology; when the consumption structure is similar between different social classes, the firm prefers the skill-biased technology; when the rate of technical change increases, the firm prefers the unskill-biased technology satisfying some conditions.

Sometimes, it is hard to determine input-output nature, evaluation results overemphasize the impacts of subsidiary indicators, most units are efficient in analysis results, and improvement of one index efficiency requires that all indexes be improved at the same time. However, by indicator integration, the improvement information of original indicators can not be found. To solve these problems, we propose sample DEA (Com-DEA) used for evaluation of complex system, then we also discuss the model meaning, model nature and model solution approach of Com-DEA based on the system analysis theory.

Descriptive analysis shows that generally speaking there exists no housing affordability issue in most cities in China. The empirical result of 35 large and medium cities in China from 1996 to 2007 indicates that housing price has played a more dominant role in housing affordability issue than income. In addition, house size also affects significantly housing affordability. Therefore the development of more affordable houses is an effective measurement to solve housing affordability for residents. It is also concluded from empirical result that housing affordability issue is decreased in the years of housing reform, the increasing ratio of population hasn't led to the difference of housing affordability in cities, housing affordability doesn't have significant different in different geographic location.","[Kuang Weida] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,weidakuang@hotmail.com,,,,,,,29,0,0,1,13,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-08-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,239,251,,,,,,13,"Economics; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science; Regional & Urban Planning; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science; Public Administration,BVE86,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291328400042,0

The theoretical model illustrates that the higher is the rational expected housing price, the rampant is the speculation and the greater is the housing price volatility. However, the relation between adaptive expectation and the housing price volatility is complicated. The increase of the lagged housing price will give rise to the depreciation of current housing price, should the consumption demand dominates the aggregate demand. The increase of the lagged housing price, however, will lead to the escalation of current housing price provided that speculative demand dominates the aggregate demand. Using the data of 35 major cities in China from 1996 through 2007, the paper shows that expectation and its speculation are testified to have a greater influence on the housing price volatility. The other findings include: the role of the economic fundamentals is more important than that of the expectation, but it does not imply that the housing price volatilities in some cities will not derived from the expectation and speculation; the impact of the lagged housing price is greater than that of the forward housing price, which means the role of adaptive expectation is greater than that of rational expectation; the actual interest rate has the greatest impact on housing price volatility, which indicates that interest policies exacerbate housing price volatility; the role of household income is more significant than that of developing cost; the fast is the population growth, the greater is the housing price volatility, but the housing price volatility does not display a remarkable disparity across geographic locations.","[Kuang Weida] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,weidakuang@hotmail.com,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,11,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-08-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,148,160,,,,,,13,"Economics; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science; Regional & Urban Planning; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science; Public Administration,BVE86,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291328400028,0

By coupling the continuum theory with molecular dynamic theory, it results a new method based on a deformation solitonic mechanism model. This model explains the high strength of nanotubes in bending. When the external bending moment increases, the axial compression in the tube increases too, and when the compressive stress reaches a critical value, the tube will locally buckle with the bending angle at 25.58 degrees. Above of this value, a solitonic deformation mechanism is starting and a portion of the nanotube becomes to rotate about a central hinge line. For large distances, the van der Waals force is attractive, but when the separation between the atoms is below the equilibrium distance of 3.42 angstrom, it becomes strongly repulsive. Upon complete unloading from angles below 110 degrees the nanotube completely recovers. At a very large bending angle of 120 degrees, atomic bonds break and the deformation of the nanotube becomes irreversible. This research is useful to explore the creation of new nano-composites that utilize carbon nanotubes, from the point of view of construction optimization.","[Munteanu, Ligia] Romanian Acad, Inst Solid Mech, Bucharest 010141, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,,ligia_munteanu@hotmail.com,"Chiroiu, Veturia/A-7174-2008; Munteanu, Ligia/A-7563-2008","Munteanu, Ligia/0000-0002-1086-8634",,,,,17,0,0,0,6,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",1790-5109,,978-960-474-063-5,REC ADV COMPUT ENG,,,2009,,,,,,,30,35,,,,,,6,"Business; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJF13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000265381900004,0

The result has showed that analyst following can effectively alleviate the situation of the company's financing constraint, and reduce the phenomenon of under-investment.

In the long run, there is a stable equilibrium relationship between macroeconomic factors and house prices. The elasticity of GDP, income and investment to house prices are greater than one. In the short run, the error correction mechanism can correct the deviation of house prices from the long run equilibrium level through a slow and gradual process.

The analysis is based on the cross-section data on art auction results of several auction sessions in Poland. The empirical studies have shown that name of artist, year of creation and technique determine the auction prices of works of art. The influence of technique and signature is not important statistically.","[Bialynicka-Birula, Joanna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Market Anal & Mkt Res, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Bialynicka-Birula, J (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Market Anal & Mkt Res, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",babiarzj@ae.krakow.pl,,,,,,,28,4,4,0,2,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",1790-5109,,978-960-474-063-5,REC ADV COMPUT ENG,,,2009,,,,,,,36,+,,,,,,2,"Business; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJF13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000265381900005,0

How to control customers' habits of livelihood, dining, and activities is the key to provide high quality services. Therefore, data collection of customers is indispensable for promoting customer relationship. Establishing a good customer relationship is a focus in enterprise management, however, this principle has altered its manner along with the coming of E-Commerce. In the past, the customer relationship was built based on long term and direct business interactions. The relationship between hotels and customers now connects through the internet, which changes traditional business patterns as interactions between hotel and customer become increasingly frequent and leads to difficulties integrating information. For example, the system of room reservations cannot progress synchronously with the system of habitations. The first line attendants are unable to know customers' information and this drawback decreases the quality of service. We will supply hotels a new system in order to deal with this trend, and its new challenges. The new platform will combine exterior website and interior hotel management systems to provide complete and effective information and service. In terms of customers' benefits, our new system will offer abundant, relevant hotel information, such as facility introductions, but also integrate with reservations for rooms, restaurants, and conference centers. In other words, it helps customers to access services much easier. Concerning hotel preferences, RFID room cards transfer customers' consumption habits to our system, which will statistically analyze the data, predict customers' needs, and simultaneously provide first line attendants this reference. In this way, the attendants can know the customers' preferences and offer satisfactory service. The hotel's administrators will also instantly obtain hotel's operational conditions, such as the frequency of facility employments or reports of restaurant revenues. The purpose of this system intends to narrow the distance between the customer and hotel operators. By utilizing this system to statistically analyze information and design individual services, customers will experience thoughtful considerations from the hotel.

How to achieve transparency of chemical logistics process by using advanced technology, researchers and logistics operators are hoping to solve the problem. In this paper, the monitoring system based on Internet of things for chemical materials logistics is researched. Base on the monitoring system, the paper discussed not only the chemical logistics storage static environment during the real-time monitoring, but also the transport process of chemical products during the real-time monitoring. Application of the monitoring system, ensuring the safe operation of chemical logistics, has some positive significance.","[Li, Hehua] Shanghai Second Polytech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 201209, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yahui] Tongji Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai 222009, Peoples R China",Shanghai Polytechnic University; Tongji University,"Li, HH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Second Polytech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 201209, Peoples R China.",hhli@ems.sspu.cn; liuyahui@21cn.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,6,"SCI RES PUBL, INC-SRP",IRVIN,"5005 PASEO SEGOVIA, IRVIN, CA 92603-3334 USA",,,978-1-935068-18-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,337,+,,,,,,2,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BUL01,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000289700200079,0

Thus, from related works, this paper presented knowledge transfer processes (KTP) within the context of ITO environments composed of two related component: knowledge delivering and knowledge receiving or acquiring. Seventeen attributes are proposed based upon the predetermined key factors. The key factors are Knowledge provider (vendor), Knowledge to be transfer, Knowledge Receiver (client) and the Knowledge Infrastructure. The proposed framework yielded seventeen hypotheses representing seventeen attributes. In order to validate the framework, data are collected using survey and later statistically analyzed. The refined framework incorporating best practices yielded four key factors with two influencing attributes specified for the first factor, three influencing attribute for the second factor, two attributes for the third factor and six attributes for the fourth factor. This framework can be seen as an integration of several important elements involved in KTP, which need to be considered as an important aspect in facilitating KTP in an ITO environment.

This challenge comes somehow later than in other countries since a lot of Romanian firms do not have implemented yet an ERP system that could offer a better data repository for the new technology. It is important to mention that Business Intelligence (BI) is not a single application. It consists of a series of components that interact behind the scenes to extract electronic data, assemble it, analyze it and display it in a form that is easy to work with and understand.

Safety float is considered separate from total float, and the objective is to minimize total completion time. In order to give out the method of compressing total duration of large and mega time-cost network to equivalent sub-networks, we take advantage of property of safety float in the network. Firstly, we provide the algorithm of the parameter of nodes and activities in the network. Secondly, based on the algorithm of the parameters of nodes and activities, we address basic concepts and signals including Path, Safety Float, Safety Float of the Path etc. Thirdly, the correlation between safety float of activity and its length of path is studied to deduce Path Length Theory and Back-Main Chain Theory. Furthermore, other theories about safety float are deduced. At last, these theories are then applied to work out a simple method to find equivalent sub-network of large type network.","[Li Xing-mei] N China Elect Power Univ, Sch Business Adm, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,,xingmeil@163.com,"wu, jun/ISB-8607-2023",,,,,,14,1,1,0,2,LONDON SCIENCE PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"OFFICE 11, 10 GREAT RUSSELL STREET, LONDON, WC1B 3BQ, ENGLAND",,,978-1-907801-04-4,,,,2010,,,,,,,136,140,,,,,,5,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BVA88,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000290917800030,0

We conduct an exploratory analysis of the influence of remuneration committee on the PPS using proxy disclosures by a diverse sample of 9,616 firm-year observations. The PPS was compared before and after introduction of the remuneration committees. and statistical difference was observed. Listed companies with remuneration committees are associated with stronger incentives. When considering the factors that explain duration differences in the selection of remuneration committees, we find that companies with more ownership held by the largest shareholder or less sale revenues are more likely to form remuneration committees earlier. And the duration is shorter when the companies are State-owned enterprises (SOE). All of the coefficients are statistically significant even with industry and year controls.","[Liu, Xiyou] Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,jhgslxy@163.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,LONDON SCIENCE PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"OFFICE 11, 10 GREAT RUSSELL STREET, LONDON, WC1B 3BQ, ENGLAND",,,978-1-907801-04-4,,,,2010,,,,,,,78,83,,,,,,6,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BVA88,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000290917800017,0

This paper uses quantitative model which shows that the decision is not quantified evaluation of china's performance score, but the other two kinds of evaluation indexes. Performance evaluation of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and local government is system engineering. The paper uses the econometrics in accordance with evaluation practice, and tackles the original data of related investigation and study, finally makes quantitative analysis. The paper shows how to use econometrics to solve evaluation problems in government performance of China.","[He Jian-long; Shi Zhong-Ke] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Automat, Xian, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University,,Emba@mail.nwpu.edu.cn; zkshi@mail.nwpu.edu.cn,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,2,LONDON SCIENCE PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"OFFICE 11, 10 GREAT RUSSELL STREET, LONDON, WC1B 3BQ, ENGLAND",,,978-1-907801-04-4,,,,2010,,,,,,,105,110,,,,,,6,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BVA88,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000290917800023,0

In view of the above conditions, Firstly, we address the problem on simplification of large type time-cost network. Secondly, we give out the method of compressing total duration of large and mega time-cost network to equivalent sub-networks, taking advantage of property of free float in the network. Thirdly, the correlation between free float of activity and its length of path is studied to deduce Path Length The my and Fore-Main Chain Theory. Furthermore, other theories about free float are deduced. Based on the above theories, in this paper, we provided the correctness and complexity analysis to simplify large type network.

It reveals that the CFPR is an easy and practical way to provide rankings of more risk factors in making decision and yields consistent requirement from only n - 1 pairwise comparisons.,"[Lu, Shih-Tong; Lin, Cheng-Wei; Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung] Kainan Univ, Tao Yuan, Taiwan",Nan Kai University Technology,"Lu, ST (通讯作者)，Kainan Univ, Tao Yuan, Taiwan.",stonelu@mail.knu.edu.tw,"Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung/B-2775-2009","Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung/0000-0003-1856-7497; Lu, Shih-Tong/0000-0002-4793-2986",,,,,12,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-642-02297-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2009,35.0,,,,,,833,+,,10.1007/978-3-642-02298-2_120,0.0,,,2,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLA40,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751700120,0

The typical network namely small-world network is used for modeling, on which agents with knowledge are viewed as the nodes of the network and the edges are viewed as the social relationships for knowledge transmission. Such agents are permitted to interact with their neighbors repeatedly who have direct connections with them and accordingly change their strategies by choosing the most beneficial neighbors to diffuse knowledge. Two kinds of knowledge transmission strategies are proposed for the theoretical model based on the game theory and thereafter used in different simulations to examine the effect of the network structure on the knowledge diffusion effect. By analyses, two main observations can be found: One is that the simulation results are contrary to Our intuition which agents would like to only accept but not share, thus they will maximize their benefit; another one is that the number of the agents acquired knowledge and the corresponding knowledge stock turn out to be independent of the percentage of those agents who choose to contribute their knowledge.","[Sun, Shu; Wu, Jiangning; Xuan, Zhaoguo] Dalian Univ Technol, Inst Syst Engn, Dalian 116042, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,,jnwu@dlut.edu.cn,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-642-02297-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2009,35.0,,,,,,282,289,,10.1007/978-3-642-02298-2_43,0.0,,,8,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLA40,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751700043,0

Although they are all based on linear algebraic method for tem-document matrix computation, which is SVD, the basic motivations behind them concerning LSI are different from each other. In this paper, a series of experiments are conducted to examine their effectiveness of LSI for the practical application of text mining, including information retrieval, text categorization and similarity measure. The experimental results demonstrate that SVD and SVR have better performances than other proposed LSI methods in the above mentioned applications. Meanwhile, ADE and IRR, because of the too much difference between their approximation matrix and original term-document matrix in Frobenius norm, can not derive pod performances for text mining applications using LSI.","[Zhang, Wen; Yoshida, Taketoshi] Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Knowledge Sci, 1-1 Ashahidai, Tatsunokuchi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan; [Tang, Xijin] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Inst Syst Sci, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China","Japan Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (JAIST); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS","Zhang, W (通讯作者)，Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Knowledge Sci, 1-1 Ashahidai, Tatsunokuchi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan.",zhangwen@jaist.ac.jp; xjtang@amss.ac.cn; yoshida@jaist.ac.jp,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [70571078, 70221001]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan under the Kanazawa Region, Ishikawa High-Tech Sensing Cluster of Knowledge-Based Cluster Creation Project","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan under the Kanazawa Region, Ishikawa High-Tech Sensing Cluster of Knowledge-Based Cluster Creation Project","This work is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.70571078 and 70221001 and by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan under the Kanazawa Region, Ishikawa High-Tech Sensing Cluster of Knowledge-Based Cluster Creation Project.",,9,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-642-02297-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2009,35.0,,,,,,266,+,,10.1007/978-3-642-02298-2_41,0.0,,,2,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLA40,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751700041,0

In the present investigation, agricultural production data for two crops (corn, rice) in five counties in Jiangxi Province and Hunan province for design of a pilot crop insurance program in China. A crop insurance program was designed which (1) provides 75% coverage, (2) a 55% premium rate reduction for the farmer compared to catastrophic coverage most recently offered, and uses the currently approved governmental premium subsidy level.

Actionable knowledge discovery is a complex task, due to it is strongly depend on domain knowledge, such as background knowledge expert experience, user interesting, environment context, business logic, even including law, regulation, habit, culture etc. The main challenge is moving data-driven into domain-driven data mining (DDDM), its goal is to discover actionable knowledge rather than general pattern.

The study of its ecological risk assessment (ERA) could help us to prevent and reduce the invasion risk more effectively. Based on the theory of ERA and methods of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), and through the analyses of the characteristics and processes of alien plant invasion, this paper discusses the methodologies of ERA of alien plant invasion. The assessment procedure consisted of risk source analysis, receptor analysis, exposure and hazard assessment, integral assessment, and countermeasure of risk management. The indicator system of risk source assessment as well as the indices and formulas applied to measure the ecological loss and risk were established, and the method for comprehensively assessing the ecological risk of alien plant invasion was worked out. The result of ecological risk analysis to 9 representative invasive alien plants in China shows that the ecological risk of Erigeron annuus, Ageratum conyzoides, Alternanthera philoxeroides and Mikania midrantha is high (grade 1-2), that of Oxalis corymbosa and Wedelia chinensis comes next (grade3), while Mirabilis jalapa, Pilea microphylla and Calendula officinalis of the last (grade 4).

Thus constructing a new membership degree conversion method that can not be effected by redundant data and it is used for fuzzy decision for multi-indexes.","[Liu Kai-di; Wang Jin; Pang Yan-jun; Hao Ji-mei] Hebei Univ Engn, Inst Uncertainty Math, Handan 056038, Hebei, Peoples R China",Hebei University of Engineering,"Liu, KD (通讯作者)，Hebei Univ Engn, Inst Uncertainty Math, Handan 056038, Hebei, Peoples R China.",,"lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023",,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-642-02297-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2009,35.0,,,,,,374,+,,10.1007/978-3-642-02298-2_57,0.0,,,2,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLA40,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751700057,0

The DEMATEL method is a methodology which can be used for researching and solving complicated and intertwined problem groups. The end product of the DEMATEL process is a visual representation-the impact-relations map-by which respondents organize their own actions in the world. The applicability of the DEMATEL method is widespread, ranging from analyzing world problematique decision making to industrial planning. The most important property of the DEMATEL method used in the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) field is to construct interrelations between criteria. In order to obtain a suitable impact-relations map, an appropriate threshold value is needed to obtain adequate information for further analysis and decision-making. In this paper, we propose a method based on the entropy approach, the maximum mean de-entropy algorithm, to achieve this purpose. Using real cases to find the interrelationships between the criteria for evaluating effects in E-learning programs as an examples, we will compare the results obtained from the respondents and from our method, and discuss that the different impact-relations maps from these two methods.","[Chung-Wei, Li; Gwo-Hshiung, Tzeng] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Management Technol, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,,samli0707@gamil.com; ghtzeng@mail.knu.edu.tw,,,,,,,13,16,16,1,10,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-642-02297-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2009,35.0,,,,,,789,796,,10.1007/978-3-642-02298-2_115,0.0,,,8,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLA40,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751700115,0

While Data Mining technology helps to find reasons why those criteria and goals were been selected, Extenics helps to find win-win Solutions by implication analysis and transform the criteria or goals.

The existing NDs were sampled to benchmark the gap between the consumer's aspired/desired utilities with respect to the utilities of existing/developing NDs. The VIKOR method was applied to rank the sampled NDs. This paper will propose the key driving criteria of purchasing new ND and compare the consumer behavior of various characters. Those conclusions can be served as a reference for ND producers for improving existing functions or planning further utilities in the next e-era ND generation.","[Lin, Chia-Li; Hsieh, Meng-Shu; Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Management Technol, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,,linchiali0704@yahoo.com.tw; ghtzeng@mail.knu.edu.tw,"Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung/B-2775-2009; Lin, Chia Li/D-1704-2010","Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung/0000-0003-1856-7497; Lin, Chia Li/0000-0003-3757-1862",,,,,23,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,,978-3-642-02297-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2009,35.0,,,,,,769,779,,10.1007/978-3-642-02298-2_113,0.0,,,11,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLA40,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751700113,0

From the research conducted, we found that the context-based physiological signal analysis for multiple users' regular data showed reliable results and reduced errors.","[Choi, Ahyoung; Woo, Woontack] GIST U VR Lab, Kwangju 500712, South Korea",Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST),,achoi@gist.ac.kr; wwoo@gist.ac.kr,"CHOI, AHYOUNG/T-5490-2019; Woo, Woontack/C-3696-2012","Woo, Woontack/0000-0002-5501-4421",,,,,9,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,,978-3-642-02297-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2009,35.0,,,,,,325,332,,10.1007/978-3-642-02298-2_49,0.0,,,8,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLA40,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751700049,0

The C-VLSSVC model can be constructed by a simple modification of the regularization parameter in LSSVC, whereby more weights are given to the lease squares classification errors with important classes than the lease squares classification errors with unimportant classes while keeping the regularized terms in its original form.

Firstly, the distributions of three statistical quantities, the two bipartite graph degrees and a projected unipartite graph degree, which describes the network cooperation-competition configuration, are introduced. The common function forms of the distributions are deduced by the analytic and numerical analyses of a network evolution model, and then verified by the empirical investigations on 23 real world cooperation-competition systems. Secondly, for a description on the competition results, a node weight is proposed which represents a kind of its competition gain. A common node weight distribution function is empirically observed in the 23 real world systems. Thirdly, the relationships between the properties describing the cooperation-competition configuration and the competition properties are discussed. The only example reported in this article is the correlation between the node weight and a bipartite graph degree.

However, continued usage is a matter of continuous decision making in the competitive alternative systems. Furthermore, control factors such as habit, self efficacy, and self identity have been suggested to extend TRA. This study introduced self-identity, self-efficacy and perceived switching cost as a new driver for IS use continuance. 395 samples were collected from the users of a Korean internet search engine portal site. Data analysis using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) shows that while the effect of habit overwhelms the effect of intention oil continuance, it is also mediated by self identity and self efficacy.

And the overall effects of oil-spill risk in Tianjin Port were determined by two-dimensional risk matrix.","[Shao, Chaofeng; Zhang, Yufen; Ju, Meiting; Zhang, Shengguang] Nankai Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Nankai University,,shaochaofeng@163.com; zhafox@126.com; jumeit@nankai.edu.cn; zhangshengguang@mail.nankai.edu.cn,,,,,,,6,2,4,1,11,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-642-02297-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2009,35.0,,,,,,681,688,,10.1007/978-3-642-02298-2_101,0.0,,,8,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLA40,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751700101,0

This paper presents a novel check recognition system based on multi-cue information fusion theory. For Chinese bank check, the amount can be independently determined by legal amount, Courtesy amount, or E13B code. The check recognition algorithm consists of four steps: preprocessing, check layout analysis, segmentation and recognition, and information fusion. For layout analysis, an adaptive template matching algorithm is presented to locate the target recognition regions on the check. The hidden markov model is used to segment and recognize legal amount. Courtesy and E13B code are recognized by artificial neural network method, respectively. Finally, D-S evidence theory is then introduced to fuse above three recognition results for better recognition performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the system can robustly recognize checks and the information fusion based algorithm improves the recognition rate by 5 similar to 10 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,,978-3-642-02297-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2009,35.0,,,,,,384,391,,10.1007/978-3-642-02298-2_58,0.0,,,8,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLA40,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751700058,0
