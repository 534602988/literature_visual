Design/methodology/approach - The study makes use of secondary data and empirical materials from the literature to establish and explain the trends in four countries: the UK, the USA, Australia, and New Zealand. Additionally, interview data are used to develop issues. Findings - The results indicate the existence of long-term equilibrium points between the shares of manufacturer brands and retailer brands in grocery product categories in the USA, New Zealand and Australia. Only the UK shows strong growth of retailer brands in line with retailer consolidation and power, but this trend is arrested, reversed and brought to equilibrium in 2001. Research limitations/implications - The data presented are restricted to four major English-speaking economies between 1992 and 2005. The data are also consolidated national data. Equilibria within individual categories will vary due to variations in category structure and pace of innovation. Practical implications - This research indicates that major retailers deploy manufacturer brands to drive the categories via innovation and retailer brands to generate additional profit for the retailers. Therefore manufacturer brands do have a long-term future. Individual manufacturer brands are likely to be assessed by the retailer primarily on this driving capability, and on the manufacturers' ongoing investment in the capacity to innovate that supports it. Originality/value - The paper provides a fresh perspective of looking at retailer and manufacturer strategy via brand share trends.","[Chimhundu, Ranga] Univ So Queensland, Sch Management & Mkt, Fac Business, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Hamlin, Robert P.] Univ Otago, Sch Business, Dept Mkt, Dunedin, New Zealand; [McNeill, Lisa] Univ Otago, Sch Business, Dept Int Business, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Southern Queensland; University of Otago; University of Otago,"Chimhundu, R (通讯作者)，Univ So Queensland, Sch Management & Mkt, Fac Business, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",ranga.chimhundu@usq.edu.au,,"Chimhundu, Ranga/0000-0001-9399-8604; McNeill, Lisa/0000-0001-9639-9965",,,,,43,2,3,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The authors investigate differences in the trial rate for free samples across different products and consumer types, as well as the impact of sampling on product and category purchase incidence. The results of this study are relevant for retailers and manufacturers who invest in in-store free sample promotions. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use data from a field study, which leveraged an actual free-sample program implemented by a US grocery store chain. Data was collected on six different products promoted by in-store free samples over six different weekends. The data collected included consumers' trial and purchasing behavior with respect to the free sample, as well as their attitudes towards the free sample that day and free sample promotions in general. Findings - Free sampling is very effective in inducing trial, especially among lower educated consumers. For consumers who are planning to buy the product in the promoted category, free sampling can encourage switching from the planned to the promoted brand. For consumers who do not have such previous plans, free sampling can draw them into the category and encourage category purchase. Samplers' interactions with the person distributing the sample or with other samplers at the scene also seem to boost post-sample purchase incidence. Originality/value - Despite the importance of free samples as a promotional tool, few studies have examined consumer trial and purchasing behavior with respect to in-store free samples. This paper presents one of the first known field studies that examines this topic.","[Heilman, Carrie] Univ Virginia, McIntire Sch Commerce, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Lakishyk, Kyryl] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Radas, Sonja] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Virginia; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb,"Heilman, C (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, McIntire Sch Commerce, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",heilman@virginia.edu,,"Lakishyk, Kyryl/0000-0002-6863-040X",,,,,25,29,31,0,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The aim was devoted into the tasks: 1. to summarise the dynamics and tendencies of agricultural land market in Poland in the period 1992-2011; 2. to characterize legal regulations on the agricultural land properties, which have influence to the land market in Poland; 3. to forecast the real changes and tendencies in the agricultural land market in Poland in nearest future. Changes in the agricultural land to income coefficient showed that enlargement of the farm area in subsequent years required investing more funds obtained from the agricultural production. The demand in the agricultural land market may also be influenced by the planned amendments to the Act on managing the agricultural property of the State Treasury concerning, e. g. the possibility of larger (30 proc.) than so far (20 proc.) exclusions of land from live lease contracts and termination of lease contracts. Tenants possessing funds, creditworthy and able to exercise the pre-emption rights in purchase of land and converting the fee for the land that they intend to buy from the APA into instalments, in case of which there are no legal obstacles to purchase land, aim at acquiring the largest possible area of land and invest in the land. The Polish agricultural land market is at the development stage that can be supported by the increase in prices and lease rents for agricultural land. It is expected that the accepted policy of the state concerning the management of available space will develop and implement a comprehensive system for both using the agricultural land and allocation of agricultural land for non-agricultural uses.","[Marks-Bielska, Renata] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Econ & Reg Policy, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland; [Zukovskis, Jan] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Adm & Rural Dev, LT-4324 Akademija, Lithuania",University of Warmia & Mazury; Vytautas Magnus University,"Marks-Bielska, R (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Econ & Reg Policy, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland.",renatam@uwm.edu.pl; Jan.Zukovskis@asu.lt,"Zukovskis, Jan/X-6528-2019",,,,,,27,2,2,0,12,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,49.0,56,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000007,0

The research aim is to identify a correlation between the average amount of old-age pensions and economic development in Latvia. In the research period 2004-2010, there was a positive trend regarding the average amount of old-age pensions in the entire Latvia and its regions - the average amount of old-age pensions increased, yet the amount of pensions is too small to provide effective government support to pensioners. According to the results of cluster analysis and ranking, a monocentric economic development trend is specific to Latvia, as a result of which there are significant differences between Latvia's capital city of Riga and the other municipalities and cities of Latvia. A high level of economic development, except the country's capital city, is also observed in three cities - Ventspils (Cluster 2), Valmiera (Cluster 3), Liepaja (Cluster 4) as well as the municipalities closely located to the country's capital city (Carnikava, Ikskile, Stopini, Cesis, etc.). A lower level of economic development is observed in municipalities in Latgale and Zemgale regions and in small, in terms of territory, municipalities in Kurzeme and Vidzeme regions. The average amount of old-age pensions in the clusters of higher level of economic development and in the municipalities located next to the capital city is greater than in the clusters of lower level of economic development; therefore, a synergy exists between a territory's economic development and the average amount of old-age pensions.","[Mistre, Baiba; Muska, Aina] Latvia Univ Agr, Riga, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,baiba.mistre@llu.lv; aina.muska@llu.lv,"Muska, Aina/AAG-5994-2019; Mistre, Baiba/AAA-7481-2020","Muska, Aina/0000-0001-9646-6806; Mistre, Baiba/0000-0002-0615-5199",,,,,11,1,1,0,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,150.0,157,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000023,0

We know that some meteorological processes operate over slightly restricted areas and may bring some risks to people due to their activity, like floods, fog and frost (Monteiro, 2003). This is what happens, for example in viticulture where the quality of the wine, the selection of the grapevines or even the characteristics of the farming soil, also depending from local soil features like topography, proximity of a river or water body, will act locally on the weather. Spring frosts are of significant concern to growers of many cultures crops such as winegrapes. Because of their high latitude and some altitude, the vineyards of the Demarcated Douro Region (DDR) are subjected to frost days, which cause serious damages. But the hazards of vineyard don't confine to the incidents of the fortuitous and/or meteorological character. The illnesses and plagues affect frequently the vineyards of DDR due, namely to the weather, to the high power of the regional stocks, to the dense vegetation badly drained and favourable to the setting of numberless fungi, viruses and/or poisonous insects. The gravepine is hostess to several enemies responsible for the appearance plagues or illnesses. These show disturbances which interfere with the normal structure, the physiological functions or the economic value of a plant visible through modified symptoms. At the level of developing factors concerning plagues or illnesses we have to notice the biotic causes (presence of insects, fungi or viruses) meteorological and cultural causes (used techniques). In the case of DDR it is worth noticing the meteorological conditions due to the weather characteristics. Although there are several illnesses and plagues the most important enemies for the vine in the DDR are the mildew, oidium, grey rottenness, grape moth,..., if the climatic conditions favour their appearance and development. The knowledge of frost and plagues occurrence allows one to decrease its risks not only by selecting the cultural species and varieties but also the places of growth and the planting and sowing dates.","[Rodrigues, Monica; Rocha, Alfredo] Univ Aveiro, Dept Phys, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Monteiro, Ana] Univ Porto, Fac Letras, Dept Phys, FLUP, P-4150564 Porto, Portugal; [Quenol, Herve] Univ Rennes 2, UMR6554 LETG, Lab COSTEL, F-35043 Rennes, France; [de Freitas, Jose R.] Gen Direct Agr & Fishing North DRAPN, Dept Advices Douro, P-5050071 Peso Regua, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade do Porto; Universite de Rennes; Universite Rennes 2,"Rodrigues, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, Dept Phys, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",monica.a.rodrigues@ua.pt,"Dutra, Mônica Cristina/GXF-0769-2022; Rocha, Alfredo/E-1201-2011; Quénol, Hervé HQ/O-7939-2014","Dutra, Mônica Cristina/0000-0002-1784-968X; Rocha, Alfredo/0000-0003-4940-6522;",,,,,10,0,0,0,12,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,216.0,220,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500039,0

It is important to analyse the problems of landed property and its usage because they are constantly changing and data record is necessary for the evaluation of the condition of landed property.

The analysis of the development of suburban territories has been fulfilled and farmland decline by reason of upbuilt territory has been ascertained. The article also presents the analysis on data of agricultural census, land fund, land properties and crop declaration. After carrying out the research it is established that the largest part of Lithuanian countryside structure is composed of farmland (51%), though a part of land property of the territory lies waste (2%). After analyzing the data of 2003 and 2010 agricultural declaration it is established that the number of farms has lessened about 17%, and used agricultural land property in the investigated territory increased about 4%. It is established that most often farmland is not used for the reason of irrigation system defects, on the outskirts and absence of land users.

With the rapid improvement of the construction sector chemical materials are being used in concrete more and more often in order that structures should withstand various internal and external factors. The usage of polymer modified concrete as building material is rare due to relatively expensive polymer admixtures. Therefore, sometimes cheaper nontraditional materials (concrete primers), which are made on acrylic base, are used in local building as well. During the research three different polymer admixtures were used to modify C12/15 class concrete. The first admixture (A) was the traditional admixture designed for concrete to improve the strength and longevity. The second (B) and the third (C) admixtures were used as nontraditional. The test results confirmed that better properties had polymer modified concrete which was cured in air. Using professional polymer admixture we can reach C16/20 concrete class. To use the non-professional polymers for concrete modification is not recommended, because one from the two admixtures, used in tests, strongly disimprove the properties of concrete.

It has been determined that when the feedrate of the winter wheat has been increased from 3.4 to 27.2 kg s(-1) combine-harvesters A and B have not exceeded the permissible 1% grain damage limit. The least grain damage (0.2%) has occurred when the feedrate of 20 kg s(-1) has been supplied into the threshing-separation apparatus. Then the grain separation losses of both combines have been approximately 0.4%. Hourly fuel consumption of the combine B when idling with switched on technological gears equals to about 4 liters, when driving through the field stubble it is about 3 liters, and while harvesting the winter wheat it is about 8 liters greater than the hourly fuel consumption of the combine A. It has been destined by the peculiarities of combine design and because the maximum rotational speed of the combine B engine during its operation has been greater by 200 min(-1). When the stubble height of the wheat has been increased from 80 to 150 mm, the wheat feedrate supplied into the combine A moving at the same speed has been 3.1 kg s(-1) less. Thus hourly fuel consumption of the engine has been reduced by approximately 11 liters or by 0.3 liters to thresh a ton of grain. The hourly efficiency of the combine-harvester A in technological time while harvesting winter wheat Ada equals to 35.9 +/- 1.8 t, and while harvesting winter wheat Ebi it is by 1.1 t greater. Combine A has threshed about 2.4 t more grain and harvested by 0.25 ha greater crop area if compared with combine B, because its cutting bar is by 1.5 m wider.","[Spokas, Liudvikas; Steponavicius, Dainius] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Agr Machinery, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,Liudas.Spokas@asu.lt; Dainius.Steponavicius@asu.lt,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,2,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,448.0,456,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000073,0

According to published research, alkaline materials can be used for arsenic stabilization. Meanwhile, information on the immobilization of thallium in the soil is very limited. Immobilisation experiment was carried out using cement kiln dust from cement industries and lime mud obtained from sugar refinery as stabilising agents. The 20% addition of these alkaline industrial by-products to contaminated soil and sewage sludge was assessed as a possible way to reduce trace element mobility. Total amount (as aqua regia digestible) and mobile fraction (as (NH4)(2)EDTA extractable) of 10 trace elements (Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cd, Hg, As, Se, Tl) were evaluated in four stabilised mixtures and their initial components. The highest total concentrations of trace elements was found in sewage sludge (Cu, Cd, Zn exceeding maximum permissible concentrations (MPC) up to 5.5 times), while the lowest total concentrations of trace elements was in lime mud. Results show that the addition of alkaline waste in most cases decreased available metal fractions. Immobilising effect on contaminated soil was moderate, while both alkaline by-products effectively reduced mobility of Zn, Ni, Cr, Pb and Cd in the sludge. Mobility of Cu was reduced using lime mud, but additive of cement kiln dust even increased Cu concentration in mobile fraction. Total arsenic (28 mg/kg) exceeded the MPC by 2.8 times in contaminated soil, while the highest As mobility was found to be in the sewage sludge (31% of total). Lime mud effectively decreased As mobility in the sewage sludge (by 15%), but alkaline treatment even slightly increased the share of mobile As fraction in contaminated soil. Thallium initially had rather low mobility (14-17% of total) and addition of alkaline by-products did not have any strong stabilising effect. The highest total concentration of thallium was found in contaminated soil (17 mg/kg). In general, alkaline treatment was able to produce more stable compounds of the majority of the investigated trace elements and reduce their potential negative impact on the environment. The best stabilising results were obtained in sludge-lime mud mixture, where mobility of all the investigated trace elements was reduced.","[Vaicikauskaite, Alfreda; Paulauskas, Valdas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Chem, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Kumpiene, Jurate] Lulea Univ Technol, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden",Vytautas Magnus University; Lulea University of Technology,"Vaicikauskaite, A (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Chem, Kaunas, Lithuania.",alfreda.vaicikauskaite@gmail.com; valdas.paulauskas@asu.lt; jurate.kumpiene@ltu.se,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,14,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,462.0,468,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000075,0

This decision provides the basis for our preference estimation approach. A potential problem arises if the site users strategically shade their true preferences. We provide a simple test and a bias correction method for strategic behavior. The main findings are (i) There is no evidence for strategic behavior. (ii) Men and women have a strong preference for similarity along many (but not all) attributes. (iii) In particular, the site users display strong same-race preferences. Race preferences do not differ across users with different age, income, or education levels in the case of women, and differ only slightly in the case of men. For men, but not for women, the revealed same-race preferences correspond to the same-race preference stated in the users' profile.

The total in-use aluminum stock in 2007 is estimated as 93 million metric tons, which represents approximately 34% of the cumulative apparent consumption since 1900. Alternately, since 1900 nearly 40% of the cumulative discarded aluminum has not been recycled for domestic use in the U.S. or for export to foreign consumers. Statistical time series analysis is used to explore the relationship between model results of in-use stocks and gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike most previous studies of material consumption and economic activity, which ignore the statistical properties of time series data to the detriment of model estimation and inference, data stationarity is explicitly evaluated through unit root testing and model specification is adjusted accordingly. The annual percentage change in GDP is found to have a large and significant association with the annual percentage change in net additions to in-use stocks. Model sensitivity and uncertainty are quantified through the application of the Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test and alternate specifications of product lifetime probability density functions.

The article discusses how growth of settlements polluted waters and created pressure to adopt local institutional responses and networked water supply and sewerage technologies in the mid-19th century. However, the new urban technologies undermined local institutional responses and expanded the scale of water pollution problems they were expected to resolve. Water companies, households and local governments litigated their water pollution conflicts in the courts in the absence of other alternatives. In the end of the 19th century, many states adopted water pollution policies. At first, public health authorities enforced the new policies to protect public water supplies from sewage contamination. However, when the effectiveness of filtration and chlorination of drinking water was demonstrated in the early 20th century, public health authorities ceased to enforce discharge prohibitions and instead pressured water companies to adopt the new technological measures to protect public health.

The linkage between the tourism sector and NAFTA is done through the analysis of foreign direct investment and cross-border trade in services. The quantitative section of the paper focuses on analyzing commercial presence in the form of hotels and restaurants, as well as the use of services abroad. The paper concludes that NAFTA represented greater certainty to investors but was not the main driver behind the investments in tourism services. The analysis of visitors from US and Canada in Mexico recognizes that NAFTA did not have significant impact on the tourism flow. NAAEC, on the other hand, serves in this research as a qualitative connection between tourism sector and the environment for attending to citizen submissions on failures in environmental law enforcement in Mexico regarding tourism projects. It is included with an economic-environmental balance in Cancun-which shows that the greatest environmental impact is of global importance: CO(2) released into the air by air transportation, followed by the local impact of water consumption, waste generation, and electricity usage, in that order.","Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Ecol Econ, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont,"Meléndez, LAM (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Ecol Econ, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 617 Main St, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",luz.martinez@uvm.edu,,,,,,,44,8,9,0,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The metaphor of nature as a stock that provides a flow of services is insufficient for the difficulties we are in or the task ahead. Indeed, combined with the mistaken presumption that we can analyze a global problem within a partial equilibrium economic framework and reach a new economy project-by-project without major institutional change, the simplicity of the stock-flow framework blinds us to the complexity of the human predicament. The ecosystem services approach can be a part of a larger solution, but its dominance in our characterization of our situation and the solution is blinding us to the ecological, economic, and political complexities of the challenges we actually face.

It presents both a conceptual and practical case that Buddhism can help shape and move towards an alternative and effective paradigmatic basis for sustainable economies - one capable of bringing about and maintaining genuine, high welfare levels across the world's societies The first paper outlined a comprehensive analytical framework to identify the fundamental nature of anthropogenic climate change. Based on the integration of two of the most influential environmental analysis tools of recent decades (the DPSIR model and IPAT equation), the framework was then broadened to facilitate ideas from the Buddhist world view by injecting two key missing aspects - the interrelated role of (1) beliefs and values (on goals and behavior) and (2) the nature of well-being or human happiness Finally, the principal linkages between this climate change analysis framework and Buddhism were explored. In this concluding paper, the systems framework is used to demonstrate how Buddhist and related world views can feed into appropriate and effective responses to the impending challenges of climate change This is undertaken by systematically presenting a specific, if indicative, list of relevant strategies informed by the understanding of Interconnectedness and other basic principles about the nature of reality and human wellbeing as proposed in Buddhism (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.","Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Daniels, PL (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",,,,,,,,55,21,25,2,39,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

First, residential and economic activity takes place in particular locations, and particular neighborhoods. Many attributes of those neighborhood environments matter for this activity, from the physical amenities, to the quality of the public and private services received. Second, those neighborhoods vary in their placement in the larger region and this broader arrangement of neighborhoods is particularly important for location choices, commuting behavior and travel patterns. Third, sorting across these neighborhoods by race and income may well matter for educational and labor market outcomes, important components of a region's overall economic activity. For each of these areas we suggest a series of unanswered questions that would benefit from more attention. Focused on neighborhood characteristics themselves, there are important gaps in our understanding of how neighborhoods change - the causes and the consequences. In terms of the overall pattern of neighborhoods and resulting commuting patterns, this connects directly to current concerns about environmental sustainability and there is much need for research relevant to policy makers. And in terms of segregation and sorting across neighborhoods, work is needed on better spatial measures. In addition, housing market causes and consequences for local economic activity are under researched. We expand on each of these, finishing with some suggestions on how newly available data, with improved spatial identifiers, may enable regional scientists to answer some of these research questions.","[Ellen, Ingrid Gould; O'Regan, Katherine] NYU, Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, Furman Ctr Real Estate & Urban Policy, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Ellen, IG (通讯作者)，NYU, Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, Furman Ctr Real Estate & Urban Policy, New York, NY 10003 USA.",katherine.oregan@nyu.edu,,,,,,,68,13,17,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

More people - academics, politicians, bureaucrats and laymen alike - need to recognize SSD as an alternative to WSD. A joint discourse of WSD and SSD is suggested, called reflexive sustainable development. Here, advocates of WSD and SSD must argue for each specific case why their solution is better. This will expose, amongst other things, the ethical foundations which form part of resulting policy advice. Reflexive sustainable development is to be framed in discourse ethics, thereby remedying the power imbalance and allowing for substantial discussion. Reflexive sustainable development builds on a common theoretical base but will not lead to consensus in all matters. A family metaphor is introduced to inspire a discourse of both consensus and compromise. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper aims to test this in a consumer setting. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 21 healthy, free-living adults, who were not usually mycoprotein consumers, were asked to eat mycoprotein, as Quorn (TM). products, daily for six weeks. Ten control group participants followed their habitual diets. Fasting lipids, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight, body mass index and waist circumference were measured at baseline and after six weeks. Findings - A significant reducing effect of the intervention on total cholesterol levels was found among those participants with higher baseline blood cholesterol level. No significant differences were seen between the intervention and control groups for the sample as a whole, although there were compliance issues in the control group that may have reduced its validity. Good compliance with the mycoprotein-rich diet also appeared to have a significant lowering effect on total blood cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. The findings confirm that mycoprotein may be a useful food ingredient for helping to manage blood cholesterol levels. Research limitations/implications - There was no randomisation or blinding, which may have influenced compliance with a habitual diet in the control group. The sample size was small and so further work in a larger population is warranted, particularly to determine optimal mycoprotein intakes and likely mechanisms of action. Originality/value - The paper focuses on a trial that used commercially available products in a free-living sample.","[Ruxton, Carrie H.

N., this issue. How Not to Measure Sustainable Value (and How One Might). Ecological Economics.] aim to criticise the measurement of Sustainable Value as proposed in our previous research. By adopting a production perspective and based on a productive efficiency analysis, they claim that the proposed way of measuring Sustainable Value represents an invalid simplification that rests on restrictive and unrealistic assumptions. Our response is to show that their argument rests on a fundamental misspecification of the Sustainable Value approach. We identify three conceptual misfits: a mismatch in the perspective of the analysis, a misspecification of opportunity costs and the irrelevance of production functions. Ultimately, Kuosmanen and Kuosmanen's train of thought rests entirely within the realm of productive efficiency analysis, whereas Sustainable Value builds on the foundations of financial economics and consequently adopts a macro rather than a firm perspective. It is thus not surprising that the findings of Kuosmanen and Kuosmanen appear to contradict the Sustainable Value approach. However, this is due to their fundamental misspecification of the Sustainable Value approach. As a result, rather than providing novel insights into how Sustainable Value might be measured in a better way, they do not measure Sustainable Value at all. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In fact, micro-level studies find that time to death, rather than ageing, is possibly the main driver of the escalating health care costs in developed countries. Unfortunately, the evidence at the macro level is less clear and often depends on the specification of the empirical model used. We use an aggregate demand framework to assess whether health expenditure is more likely to be driven by ageing per se or proximity to death. Using panel data from 22 OECD countries from the first half of the 1990s, we find population ageing to be negatively correlated with health expenditure once proximity to death is accounted for. This suggests that the effects of ageing on health expenditure growth might be overstated while the effects of the high costs of medical care at the end of life are potentially underestimated. With respect to the latter, our finding highlights the importance of long-term and hospice care management. An expanded long-term care program may not only improve patient welfare, but also reduce costs of care by reducing the duration of hospital care for terminally ill patients. If expensive medical treatment for patients near the end of life can be controlled for, health expenditure growth resulting from population ageing is unlikely to present a most serious problem.","[Palangkaraya, Alfons; Yong, Jongsay] Univ Melbourne, Fac Econ & Commerce, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Palangkaraya, A (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Fac Econ & Commerce, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Level 7,161 Barry St, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",alfonsp@unimelb.edu; jongsay@unimelb.edu,"; Palangkaraya, Alfons/H-8741-2015","Yong, Jongsay/0000-0001-6866-1954; Palangkaraya, Alfons/0000-0002-4167-5050",,,,,31,33,40,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

We take advantage of the recent integration of non-economic elements in the microeconomic analysis of consumers' behavior in order to highlight the factors leading to their demand for green products. Thanks to an original European survey on seafood product carried out on more than 5000 consumers, we test the influence of intrinsic motivation, information, localization and socioeconomic factors on the demand for an eco-label for fish. Our results show a significant connection between the desire for eco-labeling and seafood features, especially the freshness of the fish, the geographical origin of the fish and the wild vs farmed origin of the fish. Moreover, we prove the major role played by the fish price. We also demonstrate that the ecological issue regarding fisheries is highly connected to consumer information, intrinsic motivation and socioeconomic status: the typical green fish consumer is a young woman, well educated, well informed on the state of marine resources and not very trusting of the regulation of the fisheries. Consumers who are aware of the importance of marine resource preservation have the same profile. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The paper focuses on driving forces and pressures, clarifying the different levels at which drivers operate and promote invasion processes. Identifying driving forces is necessary not only to understand the processes behind biological invasions but also to generate policy initiatives that address threats to biodiversity at different levels of governance. Thus driving forces and pressures on biological invasions are identified taking into account the multi-level character of such processes.

The MARKET model was developed as a scenario-testing tool to provide insights on the ecological and economic interactions, which is a critical issue for sustainable aquaculture management. As a case study, the model was applied to simulate shellfish production in an embayment located in the East China Sea. A set of scenarios was used to compare the model outputs with expected trends and to test its capability to simulate relevant management scenarios. The comparison of simulated scenarios indicates that the MARKET model outputs followed the expected trends regarding both standard economic theory for consumption and production, and ecological economic theory. In all the scenarios we tested the area available for aquaculture was found to impose a limitation on production before it became less profitable to expand production. As such, in this case study, the production in the long run does not meet increasing demand. Reduction of the maximum cultivation area was simulated in one of the scenarios as an example of a conservation measure. As expected there was a reduction of the net profit of the farmers compared with the standard simulation. On the other hand, this scenario combined with an increase in price growth rate simulates a compensatory measure that led to a net profit in the same range as observed in the standard simulation. Overall the MARKET model provides insights and raises questions useful for the implementation of an ecosystem approach to aquaculture. Further developments include the simulation of waste generated by cultivated species in order to better support sustainable management objectives. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A matter of climate policy recently discussed by the Swedish Government, however. is to adopt a carbon emissions target, which excludes traded CO2 allowances. Although, this redefined carbon emissions target could be attained at the least costs through emissions trading, it will obstruct the ancillary benefits of reduced SO2 and NOx emissions arising from the current climate policy. The findings, here, suggest that additional policy instruments would have to decrease the SO2/GDP and NOx/GDP ratios by 48 and 72%, respectively for the 2020 carbon emissions target, in order to counteract the obstruction of ancillary benefits. Here, the emission multipliers of carbon emissions trading sectors distinguish from those of non-trading sectors when introduced into the interindustry model and applied to official emissions projections in examining the nitrogen and sulphur outcomes of Sweden's climate policy for 2020.

The skewness of TFP distribution is related to different growth theories. While negative skewness is consistent with the neo-Schumpeterian idea of catching up with leaders, zero skewness supports the neoclassical view that deviations from the frontier reflect only idiosyncratic productivity shocks. We argue that positive skewness is consistent with an economy where exogenous technology is combined with non-transferable knowledge accumulated in specific sectors and regions. This argument provides the framework for an empirical model based on stochastic frontier analysis. The model is used to analyse regional and sectoral inequalities in Denmark.","[Bhattacharjee, Arnab; de Castro, Eduardo] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland; [de Castro, Eduardo] Univ Aveiro, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal",University of St Andrews; Universidade de Aveiro,"Bhattacharjee, A (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",ab102@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Bhattacharjee, Arnab/0000-0003-1300-0838; Castro, Eduardo/0000-0001-9017-5098",,,,,61,9,11,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

How could he have made the right choice and which would he have taken on board given the constraints he had to face? Those trying to save threatened livestock breeds within a tight conservation budget face similar questions. In this paper we assess how different types of Borana cattle, a culturally significant breed in East Africa, might be prioritized for conservation. By applying a cost-effectiveness analysis on the basis of Weitzman's approach we conclude that the highest priority should be given to the Ethiopian Borana type (EB) in Ethiopia. Noah, however, would also have been concerned about the problems of inbreeding and effective population size. To overcome this problem we suggest that, rather than loading just two animals, he should have loaded on board 1000 female and 100 male animals as a safe minimum. The minimum cost of conserving 1100 animals of the EB type with the participation of Ethiopian communities is calculated to be 7700 per year, mostly in the form of compensation payments to meet the opportunity costs of livestock-keepers that arise when maintaining the EB.

This is done by the estimation of the Structural Equation Model with two factors describing the structure of economic activity and air pollution intensity. It is further assumed that there is causal link between these two factors and that they are influenced by per capita income, international trade intensity and the Freedom House Index. The estimation results suggest that in the developing countries analyzed both international trade and per capita income lead to changes in the structure of economic activity and - as a consequence - to the increase in air pollution. In addition, the estimation results suggest that the impact of economic growth on air pollution intensity varies between the developing and developed countries. In the developing countries, this impact occurs through the change of the structure of economic activity, while in the developed countries, this impact is mainly direct and occurs through the sum of the scale effect and income effect. The positive sign of this impact suggests the dominance of the scale effect over the income effect. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

During the period 1960-2002, this difference was found to grow faster in the USA than the mean for six West European countries. Possible reasons for this difference between the two regions are analysed. To reduce the anthropogenic flows of energy and material, and the consequent deleterious effects on the biosphere, it will become necessary to adapt consumption to degree of efficiency in the use of natural resources.

The project champion mentored and fostered joint enterprises between and across actors engaged in the production, processing, distribution, retailing and exporting of lamb meat and cheese derived from sheep milk. The article aims to analyse and compare the experiences and knowledge from this project with that of knowledge in extant studies on demand chain integration and inter-firm alliances. Design/methodology/approach - A case study was crafted from information accessed from the project champion, key informants and information about the project presented in the web sites of the United States Agency for International Development and the project champion, The experiences presented in the case study were critically examined and evaluated with the findings in extant studies on inter-firm alliances. Findings - Demand chain strategy based on customer orientation and seamless integration of all actors in the value chain through a joint enterprise fosters relationship bonding, structural cohesion and transaction efficiencies. The role of a third party project champion in facilitating and mentoring the value chain actors contributed to the success of the joint-enterprise. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on a single case study, the unique characteristics of the study context limits the scope of generalising the findings. Practical implications - Knowledge from this study is transferable to other industry sectors and can also be adapted in other environments in which individual small-to-medium-scale enterprises experience competency and capacity constraints in developing their business. Originality/value - Adopts a whole-of-chain capacity building approach. The dynamics of the study context (small-to-medium scale enterprises in all segments of the chain, niche high value products, transitional economy which recently adopted a free enterprise business model) are unique and this influenced project initiatives and outcomes. The study provides valuable insights into developing small-to-medium-scale food enterprise capacity building projects.","[Bhaskaran, Suku] Victoria Univ, Food Mkt Res Unit, Fac Hlth Engn & Sci, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Gligorovska, Emilija] CSIRO, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia",Victoria University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Bhaskaran, S (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Food Mkt Res Unit, Fac Hlth Engn & Sci, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",Suku.Bhaskaran@vu.edu.au,"Bhaskaran, Suku/HTP-6838-2023",,,,,,69,3,4,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

It is not easy to point out unambiguously whether or not current production systems meet this sustainability demand. A priori thinking would suggest that organic crops are environmentally favourable, but, may ignore the effect of reduced productivity, which shifts the potential impact to other parts of the food provision system. The purpose of this paper is to assess the ecological sustainability of conventional and organic leek production by means of life cycle assessment (LCA). Design/methodology/approach - A cradle-to-farm gate LCA is applied, based on real farm data from two research centres. For a consistent comparison, two functional units (FU) were defined: 1ha and I kg of leek production. Findings - Assessed on an area basis, organic farming shows a more favourable environmental profile. These overall benefits are strongly reduced when the lower yields are taken into account. Related to organic farming it is therefore important that solutions are found to substantially increase the yields without increasing the environmental burden. Related to conventional fanning, important potential for environmental improvements are in optimising the farm nutrient flows, reducing pesticide use and increasing its self-supporting capacity. Research lilmitations/implications - The research is a cradle-to-farm gate LCA, future research can be expanded to comprise all phases from cradle-to-grave to get an idea of the total sustainability of our present food consumption patterns. The research is also limited to the case of leek production. Future research can apply the methodology to other crops. Originality/value - To date, there is still lack of clear evidence of the added value of organic farming compared to conventional farming on environmental basis. Few studies have compared organic and conventional food production by means of LCA. This paper addresses these issues.","[de Backer, Eline; Aertsens, Joris; Vergucht, Sofie; Steurbaut, Walter] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"de Backer, E (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",elinedebacker@gmail.com,,,"Flemish Government, Department of Sustainable Agricultural Development","Flemish Government, Department of Sustainable Agricultural Development","This research was funded by the Flemish Government, Department of Sustainable Agricultural Development.

Design/methodology/approach - A few models of the data envelopment analysis (DEA), three-factor production function and other tools of competitive and international benchmarking are used to analyse the efficiency of meatpacking companies. A two-criteria analysis tool named the efficiency-profitability matrix is used to determine the factors that influence efficiency. The results are based on the samples of 29 Ukrainian and 53 foreign meatpacking companies. Findings - Significant reserves of inputs reduction by the domestic meatpacking companies are revealed. The offered ways of using the potential of efficiency growth for the Ukrainian meatpacking producers are connected with the use of both their internal ability (modernization of equipment, motivation of personnel) and successful experience and resources of domestic and foreign companies through the tools of co-operation, exchange of experience, merger or friendly acquisition. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to a single industry that is explained by requirement of technology (product) homogeneity while using DEA tools. Practical implications - The results contain the data and recommendations that can be practicable for meatpacking companies' management, present and potential investors and proprietors. Originality/value - This is the first study that adopts various analysis and benchmarking tools for the versatile research of efficiency in the meatpacking industry and finding ways for its improvement.","Odessa Natl Polytech Univ, Odessa, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odessa National Polytechnic University,"Goncharuk, AG (通讯作者)，Odessa Natl Polytech Univ, Odessa, Ukraine.",agg@ua.fm,"Goncharuk, Anatoliy/M-8580-2015","Goncharuk, Anatoliy/0000-0001-9870-4679",,,,,25,17,18,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of a qualitative focus group study involving a series of key adult consumer groups, including those deemed more likely and those less likely to take up healthy snack options. Findings - Despite increased health factor awareness across key adult snacking groups, there remains a perception of food snacks as a worthwhile, if basically unhealthy, treat within their overall food consumption. Many adults did show some concerns about specific diet and health-related aspects of many snack products and would like to be tempted by healthier versions. Amongst the drivers for healthy snack uptake, local source attributes were generally rated highly by all; these and other natural and healthy snack claims, including fairtrade and organic labels, were positively received provided that the key, hedonic treat experience attributes could still be delivered. When considering the provision of snacks for children, the customers' choice processes appeared to be much more health-based, showing apparent nest snack choice behaviours - or stronger nesting behaviours in mothers of young children. Research limitations/implications - The study was restricted to a relatively small sample in an area limited to the county of Dorset in the South of England, potentially more focused Oil Countryside local foods. Practical implications - Areas of marketing focus are Suggested that could promote healthy snack choices in adult consumers. Originality/value - The paper examines snacks within the desired snack experience dimensions of key consumer groups and suggests key attributes, associations and thinking-processes behind healthy snack choice behaviours.","[McIntyre, Charles; Baid, Amit] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Serv Management, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England",Bournemouth University,"McIntyre, C (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Sch Serv Management, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.",cmcintyr@bournemouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,16,19,1,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

These five criteria are: (1) effective policies, laws, and regulations based on desired objectives (the legal base-line aspect); (2) an embedded desire to pursue environmental objectives, which are most likely based on incentives (the environmental culture aspect); (3) strong national institutions that can pursue objectives and enforce measures when necessary (the institutional aspect); (4) national capacity, which to a large extent depends on effective technology transfer (the capacity building aspect); and (5) given the international impact of environmental issues, regional cooperation, as well as, support from international institutions (the regional and international cooperation aspect). The countries in the SEE region have made significant progress in developing renewable energy and energy efficiency policies, programmes, and projects, but there remain regulatory, economic, and institutional barriers to effective energy adaptation.

Using a nationally representative survey conducted in the summer of 2010 of 430 individuals living in Ireland, this paper derived dependent variables (based on a factor analysis of respondents mean ratings of 47 landscape images) representing 5 different landscape categories. These variables were then utilised in separate OLS regression models to examine the effect of personal characteristics, residential location and environmental value orientations on landscape preferences. First in terms of visual amenity the results suggest that the general public have the strongest preference for landscapes with water related features as its dominant attribute which was followed by cultural landscapes. Second the results also demonstrate how there is significant heterogeneity in landscape preferences as both personal characteristics and environmental value orientations were found to strongly influence preferences for all the landscape types examined. Moreover the effect of these variables often differed significantly across the various landscape groupings. In terms of land use policy, given the diversity of preferences a one size fits all approach will not meet the general publics' needs and desires. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It gained significant popularity as evidenced by diverse applications at the corporate level. However, its introduction as a measure adhering to the strong sustainability paradigm sparked an ardent debate. This study explores its validity as a macroeconomic strong sustainability measure by applying the Sustainable Value approach to the EU-15 countries. Concretely, we assessed environmental, social and economic resources in combination with the GDP for all EU-15 countries from 1995 to 2006 for three benchmark alternatives. The results show that several countries manage to adequately delink resource use from GDP growth. Furthermore, the remarkable difference in outcome between the national and EU-15 benchmark indicates a possible inefficiency of the current allocation of national resource ceilings imposed by the European institutions. Additionally, by using an effects model we argue that the service degree of the economy and governmental expenditures on social protection and research and development are important determinants of overall resource efficiency. Finally, we sketch out three necessary conditions to link the Sustainable Value approach to the strong sustainability paradigm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Three tools were used: 1) focus group discussion 2) formal surveys and 3) Monitoring for Quality Improvement (MONQI). Farming systems in wetlands and on hillsides differ. Level of education, resource availability, land ownership and location have an important impact on the location and type of farming systems practiced by households. The dependency of households on wetlands varies between sites. Field size, status of soil fertility and input use are also key factors determining the level of contribution that wetland agriculture makes to farmers' livelihood. In Cyabayaga, the per household per year contribution of wetland cultivation to gross margin (GM) was 74% ($1901) compared to 24% ($84) in Rugeramigozi. The rice in Cyabayaga was the largest contributor to household income providing on average $1045 per household per season. Vegetables cultivated in the dry season in Rugeramigozi have high potential as cash crops. Poor maintenance of drainage and irrigation channels as well as inappropriate cropping systems in wetlands can undermine sustainability and have repercussions for the livelihoods of farmers dependent on agricultural wetlands.

Yet biodiversity is often reported to be declining worldwide. Biodiversity measures can help evaluating it and conserving it, but need to be clearly defined and assessed. In this paper, I review several biodiversity measures and develop a new one, all based on a matrix of species-level dissimilarity data. The data can be used in its raw form, regardless of its origin (e.g. studies of morphological traits, DNA hybridization experiments...) or of any graphical representation. Then, I propose a two-step assessment of the measures. First, I assess them in terms of their deviation from a strict additive law determining the contribution of each species to the diversity of the set in an ideal setting. This setting refers to a case where the data exactly determines the hierarchical ordering of the species. Second, I assess the measures based on their compliance with a list of axioms. These axioms reflect basic mathematical properties regarded as desirable for diversity measures, such as their monotonicity in species and dissimilarities. Finally. I show the importance of applying the new quantitative assessment and the axiomatic approach together when selecting a dissimilarity-based diversity measure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast with theoretical predictions and previous studies, this research finds evidence that foreign nursing education commands a higher return than U.S. education, even after controlling for a rich set of covariates. Consistent with the literature, the estimates illustrate foreign experience earns a lower return than domestic experience in nursing. Analysis across subsamples reveals the counter-intuitive foreign education premium is driven by foreign nurses educated in English-speaking countries and those working in hospitals. These estimates suggest future research should take into account the heterogeneity in the returns on foreign education across occupations.","Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Huang, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, 415 Snow Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",serena.h.huang@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,3,6,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Elasticities calculated from the estimated coefficients indicate that land availability has a larger proportional impact on economic growth than domestic and foreign investment, labor supply, and government spending.

However, the economic consequences of potential order effects stemming from other questions in a survey, prior to the valuation tasks, have received surprisingly little attention. Using an online climate change survey, we identify order effects created by prior attitude-elicitation questions, and we assess the potential impact of these distal order effects on willingness to pay (WTP) estimates for stylized climate change policies. We find that the order used in prior questions may change people's opinions toward various attributes of the good to be valued, and thereby change WTP by a substantial amount. This paper emphasizes the significance of order effects stemming from preliminary survey questions, and supports a call for diligence in the random ordering of all potentially influential preliminary information in stated preference surveys to minimize inadvertent effects from any single arbitrary ordering.

In this paper, we trace the Spanish cooperative's legal roots in business law and its connections to broader questions of the freedom of association, the formation of joint-stock enterprises and the liability of investors in business and cooperative entities.

The key point is the naturalization of the notion of 'subjectivity' in both the Georgescu-Roegen framework and Jaynes's subjectivistic interpretation of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. I introduce the concept of 'observer relativity' with reference to the evolution of 'physical inference devices'. Then, the MaxEnt formalism can be understood as a principle underlying natural selection. Further, given natural selection, maximum entropy production (MEP) results from the confluence of maximum power (Lotka) and the maximization of information capacity, driven by energy dispersal. In these processes, hierarchical structures of gradients of energy dissipation reflect alternative positions of system boundaries, and hence different perspectives of observer-relativity. Thus, I can distinguish between observer relative Entropy(OR) and observer independent Entropy(OI). This allows to reconstruct conceptually the two notions of time proposed by Georgescu-Roegen, with subjectivistic time seen as time relative to the evolutionary process involving incommensurable qualitative change. I claim that this philosophical view offers a powerful conceptual framework for recent empirical research into the energetics of economic growth. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These set out to bridge the gap between the natural and the social sphere, between scientific analysis and societal action. This paper aims at re-assessing the contribution of established inter-disciplines to sustainable development. journal articles of ecological economics, technology assessment and science and technology studies are evaluated and compared along several proposed features of sustainability science. The results converge in two crucial aspects.

We develop a general economic-ecological modelling framework for integrated analysis of biofuel policies. An economic model of farmers' decision making is combined with a biophysical model predicting the effects of farming practices on crop yields and relevant environmental impacts. They include GHG emissions over the life cycle, nitrogen and phosphorus runoff, and the quality of wildlife habitats. We apply our model to crop production in Finland. We find that under current biofuel production technology the case for promotion of biofuels is not as evident as has been generally thought. Only reed canary grass for biodiesel is unambiguously desirable, whereas biodiesel from rape seed and ethanol production from wheat and barley cause in most cases negative net impacts on the environment. Suggested policies in the US and the EU tend to improve slightly the environmental performance of biofuel production. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental ADR empirically. However, the majority of empirical literature of environmental ADR provides merely descriptive case studies. Using a large micro-level database from Japan, this paper identifies the characteristics of pollution disputes addressed by ADR and correlates those characteristics to the duration of disputes. Using the strike analysis for reference, we estimate the standard duration models of environmental ADR. The analyses demonstrate that pollution disputes involving health damage are resolved promptly. Air pollution problems affecting multiple households are also expeditiously resolved. Moreover, we find that representative actions prolong the settlement of environmental disputes.

Although eighteenth-century English canal companies offered low-risk securitized capital approved by Parliament and were important to the development of financial capitalism, little is known about the economic state of the canal industry, beyond observed dividend levels. This article estimates rates of return on equity for a set of major English canals, but shows that their financial reporting under-represented equity inputs so that dividend rates did not reliably signal operating returns or equity-based rates of return.","[Arnold, A.

So far, tax system evaluations mostly focused on specific tax system criteria, without considering their impact on the tax system as a whole. As a rule, the classical principles of taxation and Tanzi and Gill indicators are applied. However, those criteria often overlap each other resulting in calculation of similar indicators, which are commonly used to evaluate the same aspects of the tax system. Therefore, it is essential to refine those criteria, i.e. to pick out non-recurrent indicators in each of the tax system evaluation criterion in order to achieve the most comprehensive evaluation of the tax system. Furthermore, due to the limited availability of information, it is not possible to calculate all the indicators. The latter reason often plays a deciding role in selecting an evaluation method. Consequently, the obtained results are somewhat distorted and the suggested improvement directions are not always justified. The paper presents a multicriteria tax system evaluation model, which combines the tax system evaluation criteria into one whole and allows describing it based on one single value. That leads to an objective and comprehensive evaluation of the tax system, since the evaluation can take into account not only a common final estimate but also partially integrated indicators. Such indicators reflect the quantitative estimate of a certain tax system evaluation criterion. Subject to the availability of several years' information, the changes in a certain criterion estimate over time (dynamics) and its impact on the whole tax system can be analyzed. The multicriteria evaluation model of the tax system facilitates reasoned and objective tax system improvement solutions.","[Ciuleviciene, Vida; Slavickiene, Astrida] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Econ & Management Fac, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Vaicikauskaite, Ausra] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Econ & Management Fac, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Ciuleviciene, V (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Econ & Management Fac, Kaunas, Lithuania.",cvida@asu.lt; astrida.slavickiene@asu.lt,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,92.0,99,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000014,0

So far, relatively little substantive analysis has been conducted which would allow a better understanding of the complexity of the land reform process and also a better understanding of the factors affecting the speed of implementation of land reform. The aim of this study is to investigate why some municipalities are quicker than others in terms of implementing land reforms. The 30 quickest and 30 slowest municipalities have been chosen to determine whether there are characteristic differences. Three types of data have been used to analyse these differences: firstly, the geographical location of the municipalities; secondly, the groups of municipalities characterised by the land reform procedure data (land remaining under state ownership, privatised land, land returned to the former owners, average size of plot); and thirdly, the comparison of groups of municipalities defined as land stock characteristics (arable land, forest land, grassland, protected areas, land under the roads, water bodies, wetlands, yards and other type of land). The results of the research indicate that fast and slow municipalities are not distributed evenly throughout Estonia. The proportion of land that belongs to the state and which is privatised is higher in quicker municipalities, and the average sizes of plots have been bigger over the years in such municipalities. The results of land reforms have not only been affected by the activities of local governments, but also by state institutions and those who have been the driving forces behind the reforms. The main influencing factors on land reform resulting from land stock characteristics are arable land, natural grassland and protected areas (based on the percentage of the municipal area).","[Juergenson, Evelin; Hass, Helena] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Maasikamaee, Siim] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Dept Geomat, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia",Estonian University of Life Sciences; Estonian University of Life Sciences,"Jürgenson, E (通讯作者)，Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",evelin.jyrgenson@emu.ee; helena.hass@emu.ee; siim.maasikamae@emu.ee,"Jürgenson, Evelin/B-7047-2011; Jürgenson, Evelin/N-8095-2019; Maasikamae, Siim/H-7951-2016","Jürgenson, Evelin/0000-0003-2103-4333; Jürgenson, Evelin/0000-0003-2103-4333; Maasikamae, Siim/0000-0003-4721-2329",,,,,12,3,3,0,6,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,440.0,445,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500076,0

The purpose of this paper is to investigate tubers from yellow, white and red-flowered cultivars of the common garden Dahlia (D. pinnata) for their chemical composition. Design/methodology/approach - The composition of minerals was determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), whereas vitamins were analyzed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Findings - Carbohydrates represented the major constituent in Dahlia tubers, followed by fibre and protein. Tubers of the yellow-flowered cultivar HGH contained the highest amount of carbohydrates, while tubers of the white-flowered cultivar BJ and those of the red-flowered cultivar XM abounded in fibre and protein, respectively. In addition, Dahlia tubers exhibited varying concentrations of minerals, among which potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc and chromium were predominant. Tubers of the white-flowered cultivar LB contained the highest amounts of magnesium and phosphorus. Moreover, tubers of the red-flowered cultivar MLH showed the highest contents of potassium and chromium, whereas those of the red-flowered cultivar XM were rich in calcium and zinc. Furthermore, Dahlia tubers were found to contain water and fat soluble vitamins, among which vitamins B2, B6, B7 and E were the most abundant. Tubers of the white-flowered cultivar BJ exhibited the highest contents of water soluble vitamins, whereas those of the white-flowered cultivar LB abounded in fat soluble vitamins. Originality/value - Despite the considerable variability observed among cultivars, Dahlia might be utilized as an alternative food resource for human nutrition.","[Nsabimana, Consolate; Jiang, Bo] Jiangnan Univ, State Key Lab Food Sci & Technol, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University,"Nsabimana, C (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, State Key Lab Food Sci & Technol, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",consolaten@hotmail.com,,,Jiangnan University,Jiangnan University,The authors would like to thank Lanzhou Peony Horticulture Development Company for supplying the raw materials and Jiangnan University for providing the financial support needed to carry out such a pioneering research project.,,35,6,7,5,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Weak extraction solution approaching the average concentration of many soil solutions - 0.01 M CaCl2 was used as universal extraction solvent suitable for evaluation of soil fertility as well as soil pollution. Electrical conductivity and pH was measured in centrifugates. Phosphogypsum additive reduced electrical conductivity in 0.01 M CaCl2 extracts of sewage sludge and its mixture with soil, while the conductivity of strongly alkaline soil extracts was not affected. Acidifying effect of phosphogypsum on the studied mixtures was negligible due to their high buffering capacity. Phosphate, originating from phosphogypsum, immobilising effect on Zn and Cu was different. Zn treatment efficiency increased together with the increasing pH condition of the system. Meanwhile, Cu leaching from soil-sludge mixtures with 5-40% phosphogypsum additive was reduced by a factor ranging from 37 to 1105. Copper immobilization process was substantially assisted by Cu ion adsorption on soil colloids. Phosphogypsum additive reduced the amount of N-NO3- in sewage sludge from 4 (5% additive) up to 8 times (40% additive). Phosphogypsum also reduced concentration of 0.01 M CaCl2 extractable K+ in almost all the studied mixtures, but the main reason of such a decrease was low initial concentration of potassium in the additive applied. Meanwhile, addition of phosphogypsum significantly increased concentration of P-PO43- in all the studied mixtures with neutral pH. Furthermore, waste phosphogypsum is suitable for soil amendment not only as a source of calcium and mobile sulphur, but also as soil additive, other than lime, containing magnesium.","[Paulauskas, Valdas; Zaleckas, Ernestas; Puodziunas, Marius] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Chem, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Paulauskas, V (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Chem, Kaunas, Lithuania.",valdas.paulauskas@asu.lt; ernestas.zaleckas@gmail.com; marius.puodziunas@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,416.0,421,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000068,0

Design/methodology/approach - Data for the consumer side were obtained by a structured questionnaire. A total of 741 consumers were asked online with respect to their knowledge and expectations towards geographical indications in general and Hessian apple wine in particular. The collected data were analysed by an explorative factor analysis and a binary logit model. Additionally, data for the producer side were collected via an in-depth interview with one major producer of Hessian apple wine. Findings - The consumer side results indicate that Hessian consumers' awareness and knowledge about GIs is very limited. Moreover, it is found that the quality warranty dimension is not as important as the economic support dimension and perceived authenticity of the product. A hypothetical willingness to pay for protection is mainly driven by consumer perceptions and expectations towards the positive impacts of geographical indications on the local economy. The producer side results highlight that the most important motivation to apply for a protected G1 (PGI) is to secure the established reputation against misuse by competing producers in order to ensure the quality level of Hessian apple wine. Practical implications - The findings indicate that a PGI is by no means a self-runner. The positive impacts of this certification scheme have to be communicated to consumers in order to be successful. Originality/value - Empirical evidence regarding consumers' knowledge and expectations towards geographical indications in a non-Mediterranean context is limited. The present paper contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence for a German case study.","Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Teuber, R (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Giessen, Germany.",ramona.teuber@agrar.uni-giessen.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Teuber, Ramona/AAE-1925-2019; Teuber, Ramona/P-6565-2014","Teuber, Ramona/0000-0001-6283-0438",,,,,30,76,78,10,78,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A simulation model based on the system dynamics principles of Forrester is developed and applied to the French chicken meat supply chain suffering an Avian Influenza crisis. Findings - This model first enables one us to study the regulation mechanisms of the chain that will improve understanding of the supply chain behaviour under environmental perturbations. A what-if analysis is then implemented to examine the supply chain stability and the influence of flexibility adjustment times, inventory coverage time, slaughtered chicken buffer size and smoothing policies on the supply chain performance in different crisis fluctuation rate scenarios in order to propose necessary logistic policy enhancements. Research limitations/implications - This work will improve one's knowledge about the buffer inventory problem and the global stability of this multi-echelon push-pull supply chain. Practical implications - The model can be used as a decision system support which aims to minimise the additional costs due to stock level increases as demand decreases as well as exceptional external purchasing sparked by the lack of available products when there is a sudden hike in demand. The research can help decision-makers of fresh food push-pull supply chains when they are facing such crises by using both cybernetic representation and computer simulation. Originality/value - This study deals with a specific food supply chain within the context of a sanitary crisis. A system dynamics model is presented for studying the behaviour of the entire food supply chain threatened by high uncertainties in the supply capacity as well as in customer demand.","[Thi Le Hoa Vo] LEMNA Univ Nantes, ENITIAA, EMN, Nantes, France; [Thi Le Hoa Vo] Univ Rennes 1, CREM UMR CNRS 6211, Rennes, France; [Thiel, Daniel] Univ Paris 13, UFR Sci Econ & Gest CEPN, UMR CNRS 7115, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France","Ecole Nationale Veterinaire, Agroalimentaire et de l'Alimentation Nantes-Atlantique; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Atlantique; Universite de Rennes; Universite Paris 13","Thi, LHV (通讯作者)，LEMNA Univ Nantes, ENITIAA, EMN, Nantes, France.",hoamoc@yahoo.com,"Vo, Hoa/HJA-0989-2022","Thiel, Daniel/0000-0001-5478-390X",French Ministry of Research; Ministry of Agriculture; French Embassy in Vietnam,"French Ministry of Research(Ministry of Research, France); Ministry of Agriculture(Gida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi); French Embassy in Vietnam","This work was supported by the French Ministry of Research, the Ministry of Agriculture and the French Embassy in Vietnam.",,29,18,18,1,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The methods used are based on previous studies on energy cost of living. Total energy requirement is calculated as a function of individual energy intensities of goods and services derived from economic input-output analysis and expenditures for those goods and services. We use multivariate regression analysis to estimate patterns in household energy intensities. We define sprawl in terms of location in rural areas or in areas with low population size. We find that even though sprawl-related factors account for about 83% of the average household energy consumption, sprawl is only 17-19% more energy intensive than compact living based on how people actually lived. We observe that some of the advantages of reduced direct energy use by people living in high density urban centers are offset by their consumption of other non-energy products. A more detailed analysis reveals that lifestyle choices (household type, number of vehicles, and family size) that could be independent of location play a significant role in determining household energy intensity. We develop two models that offer opportunities for further analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Shammin, Md.

Using a multi-regional input-output model, we show that the trade emission balance and the responsibility emission balance yield the same result. In practical work, however, a lack of data availability implies that the same technology assumption has been commonly adopted. In that case, also a third alternative exists, which simply evaluates the emissions embodied in the trade balance of the country. This third alternative yields the same results as the other two approaches at the aggregate level. At the level of individual products, however, the results are clearly different and it turns out that the third alternative answers a different question. That is, it is appropriate for measuring the emission content of the products that cross the border. In our empirical application, we consider Spain in 1995 and 2000, distinguishing nine different gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs, PFCs, SO2, NOx. and NH3. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our model assumes (1) a representative opinion leader is responsible for updating the prior belief about the quality of drugs via consumption experiences and clinical trial outcomes, and (2) manufacturers use detailing as a means to build/maintain the measure of physicians who are informed of the current information sets. Unlike previous learning models with informative detailing, our model directly links the effectiveness of detailing to the current information sets and the measures of well-informed physicians. To illustrate the empirical implications of the new model, we estimate our model using a product level panel data on sales volume, prices, detailing minutes, and clinical trial outcomes for ACE-inhibitors with diuretics in Canada. Using our estimates, we demonstrate how the effectiveness of detailing depends on the information sets and the measures of well-informed physicians. Furthermore, we conduct a policy experiment to examine how a public awareness campaign, which encourages physicians/patients to report their drug experiences, would affect managerial incentives to detail. The results demonstrate that the empirical and managerial implications of our model can be very different from those of previous models. We argue that our results point out the importance of developing a structural model that captures the mechanism of how detailing/advertising conveys information in the market under study.","[Ching, Andrew; Ishihara, Masakazu] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada",University of Toronto,"Ching, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, 105 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",andrew.ching@rotman.utoronto.ca; mishihara@rotman.utoronto.ca,"Ishihara, Masakazu/GOG-9830-2022; Ishihara, Masakazu/ABH-7873-2020",,,,,,33,55,73,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

This paper departs from the term commodity fetishism, broadly understood as the masking of the social relationships underlying the process of production, to illuminate three invisibilities in the commodification of ecosystem services. Firstly, we argue that narrowing down the complexity of ecosystems to a single service has serious technical difficulties and ethical implications on the way we relate to and perceive nature. Secondly, the commodification of ecosystem services denies the multiplicity of values which can be attributed to these services, since it requires that a single exchange-value is adopted for trading. Finally, we suggest that the process of production, exchange and consumption of ecosystem services is characterised by power asymmetries which may contribute to reproducing rather than addressing existing inequalities in the access to natural resources and services.

However, in many real world situations this is not the case, so to overcome this problem, this paper reports on a new strategy by inventing a Culturally Adjusted DEA model to benchmark business units that operate under different cultural (business) environments. This is especially useful when these environmental factors are partial causes of inefficiency and can not be simply incorporated into a DEA model as inputs or outputs. A simulation analysis is conducted to examine the effectiveness of the CA-DEA model for controlling these environmental effects. This model is applied to a real life efficiency study of two major financial firms in Canada in 2000, when the two entities started to consolidate and merge their branch networks. Two cultural indices are identified to represent a firm's unique operating environment, one to capture the nature of a firm's corporate strategies (Corporate Index), and the other to estimate the effectiveness of a firm's operational systems (Service Index). The results show that a firm's corporate culture has a significant influence on its branches' efficiency and this, we found, is often neglected in such studies.

Environmental, economic, ethical and cosmological dimensions of Buddhism are presented as a logical and practical basis for reducing the climate change pressures deriving from prevailing global modes of production and consumption This first paper presents an analytical framework and philosophical base for understanding the causes and refining the goals behind human and societal endeavor. This frames the relevant adaptive responses outlined in the concluding paper. The paper begins by developing an innovative systems framework for analyzing major environmental problems such as climate change Building on this framework, we then examine Buddhist insights Into the fundamental nature of the behavior and driving forces that generate climate change. The model not only provides an improved basis for human-environmental analysis in general, but is applied to demonstrate and specify how the Buddhist world view could be operationalized to tackle anthropogenic climate change the task is undertaken in second paper Buddhist notions of interconnectedness, dependent origination, and mindful consumption and production can help explain and reshape human motives and actions for climate and other forms of environmental sustainability (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserved","Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Daniels, PL (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",,"Quinn, Patrick/B-5489-2010",,,,,,43,34,36,1,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

In competition, however, price discrimination may also be costly to the firm because restrictive incentive compatibility conditions may allow the competing firm to gain market share at the discriminating firm's expense. Therefore, with asymmetric competition, it may be the case that one firm would let the other firm assume the burden of price discrimination. We investigate optimal segmentation in a market with two asymmetric firms and two heterogeneous consumer segments that differ in the importance of price and product attributes. In particular, we investigate second-degree price discrimination under competition with explicit incentive compatibility constraints thus extending prior work in marketing and economics. Focusing on the managerial implications, we explore whether it would be profitable for either or both firms to pursue a segmentation strategy using rebates as a mechanism. We identify conditions under which one or both firms would want to pursue such segmentation. We find that segmentation lessens competition for the less price-sensitive consumer segment and that this results in higher profits to both firms. A key to understanding this result is that segmentation leads to consumer remixing. We establish the key result that if firms are asymmetric in their attractiveness to consumers, the disadvantaged firm in our model is more likely to pursue a segmentation strategy than its rival in equilibrium. We then ask whether this result prevails in practice. To this end, we explore competitive segmentation empirically and are able to verify that disadvantaged firms indeed pursue segmentation through rebates with greater likelihood.","[Haruvy, Ernan; Rao, Ram C.] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Dogan, Kutsal] Ozyegin Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-34662 Istanbul, Turkey",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; Ozyegin University,"Haruvy, E (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Management, Box 830688, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",kutsaldogan@yahoo.com; eharuvy@utdallas.edu; rrao@utdallas.edu,"Haruvy, Ernan/AFM-0896-2022; Rao, Ram/JOZ-9835-2023; Haruvy, Ernan/AAH-3467-2022; Dogan, Kutsal/F-2579-2010","Haruvy, Ernan/0000-0001-8077-1363",,,,,44,14,17,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

We compare the cost of the program maintained over time at 90% with three alternative strategies, each involving a decrease in vaccination coverage. Data from England and Wales, 1966-2005, is used to formalize a delay in occurrence of pertussis cases as a result of a fall in coverage. We first apply the criterion of minimization of the total social cost of pertussis to identify the best cost saving immunization strategy. The results are also discussed in form of the discounted present value of the total social net benefits. We find that the discounted present value of the total social net benefit is maximized when a stable vaccination program at 90% is compared to a gradual decrease in vaccination coverage leading to the lowest vaccination rate. The benefits to society of providing sustained immunization strategy, vaccinating the highest proportion of children and adolescents, are systematically proved on the basis of the second optimisation criterion, independently of the level of estimators applied during economic evaluation for the cost variables.","Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Inst Econ & Management Nantes IAE, F-44000 Nantes, France",Nantes Universite,"Girard, DZ (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Inst Econ & Management Nantes IAE, BP 52241, F-44000 Nantes, France.",dorota.girard@univ-nantes.fr,,,,,,,45,6,6,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

While content issues, such as the standard of liability, the scope of the instrument, the nature of the damage and the burden of proof have dominated discussions, the question relating to the nature of the instrument has lurked quietly, but ominously, in the background. This issue came to a head at COP/MOP4 in Bonn - where the instrument was due to be adopted. This paper traces the development of the discussions on the nature of the instrument to be adopted. In particular it considers the slow rise to prominence of the administrative approach to liability at the expense of the civil liability system. This slow rise to prominence of the administrative approach leads to the adoption of a dual approach, meaning a binding instrument on the administrative approach and a nonbinding instrument on civil liability. The paper argues that the positions adopted by the various delegations on the nature of instrument illuminate the complexities of modern international environmental law making and may dispell some closely held beliefs about environmental law making, particularly as it relates to the role of the South.","[Tladi, Dire] S African Permanent Mission UN, New York, NY USA; [Tladi, Dire] Univ Stellenbosch, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Tladi, D (通讯作者)，S African Permanent Mission UN, New York, NY USA.",tladid@foreign.gov.za,,"Tladi, Dire/0000-0003-3378-2873",,,,,24,2,4,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The economic approach to sustainability and welfare assessment has frequently relied on alternatives, or adjustments, to GDP, widely used as an indicator of macroeconomic performance. Several authors have proposed alternative indicators, such as the ISEW, which intend to measure sustainability and economic welfare in a way that avoids the limitations of GDP: namely accounting for the value of externalities, the distribution of income and natural resources depiction. Since Daly and Cobb (1989) there have been proposed improvements to the ISEW, however, its aptitude to represent a sound alternative to GDP is still the subject of scientific debate. This paper presents a new approach to the ISEW (named Modified ISEW), including new components and methodological changes for the estimation of the index. These have the purpose of avoiding some of the index shortcomings and allow for a direct comparison with the GDP, which are advantages over previous studies. An application is developed for the US case, taking advantage of wide data availability and the possibility of comparing the results with previous works. The results obtained provide a clearer picture of the success or failure of environmental and social policies. namely by avoiding the tampering effect resulting from the cumulative accounting of environmental externalities. This work also emphasizes the inadequacy of GDP as a welfare indicator, as well as the need to develop and adopt alternative indicators. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This framework is of significance for ecological economics because it addresses the evolution and coevolution of biological systems and sets of human institutions. This paper outlines this framework and charts its historical origins since the time of Darwin. It is suggested that this over-arching framework is useful for ecological economics as a common meta-narrative within which more detailed examinations of both institutional and ecological mechanisms may be placed. Applying Darwinism in this manner does not mean that institutions or organizations are explained in purely biological terms: it means that Darwinian principles are not confined to biology.

Then, a detailed demonstration of the mechanism and possible applying fields of SLM is given by discussing N-state grammar and its application in part-of-speech tagging. It discusses the recursion property of linguistic structure and the structure-dependent property of linguistic knowledge, and points out that recursive nested structures would upset the statistic regularity and the structure-dependency of linguistic knowledge would make the independence assumption, by which SLM can be realized, lose its effectiveness. Finally, it is suggested that the right track of NLP may be the combination of rule-based approach and statistically-based approach, because natural language is a miscellaneous system.","[Gong Zhiqi] Univ Jinan, Sch Foreign Languages, Jinan 250022, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Yin Xiaojing] Shandong Econ Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China",University of Jinan; Shandong University of Finance & Economics,"Gong, ZQ (通讯作者)，Univ Jinan, Sch Foreign Languages, Jinan 250022, Shandong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-15-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,252.0,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298265500044,0

Design/methodology/approach - Reference point approach originally developed by psychologists and later translated into reference price approach by business scholars is used to demonstrate this point. Empirically, a model of consumption of broilers in the USA is estimated using regression analysis and its results and implications are discussed. Findings - The same empirical model can be used to represent more than one underlying model of consumer behavior. Research limitations/implications - This paper raises the question of which underlying behavioral theory is valid, and under what circumstances might that validity change. The importance of accounting for reference prices appears to be validated, but the fact that both theories lead to the same or similar empirical formulation does little to secure either theory as right or wrong. Originality/value - Research in consumer behavior and demand generally assumes the existence of one superior theoretical behavioral model. This paper suggests that such claims are unfounded since standard current empirical modeling of consumer behavior accommodates more than one underlying theory.","[Miljkovic, Dragan] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Effertz, Cary] Univ Minnesota, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Miljkovic, D (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",Dragan.Miljkovic@ndsu.edu,,,,,,,43,7,7,2,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Prior to the commencement of the Franco dictatorship, Fierro had managed to form a diversified family business and had bought a bank to finance his industrial activity.

An apparently deterministic 'causal' description of environmental issues inevitably downplays the uncertainty and multiple dimensions of causality inherent in complex environmental and socio-economic systems. Consequently, the paper complements and reframes 'DPSIR' using a complex system methodology based on the distinction between four 'spheres' of sustainability (environmental, economic, social and political) and the analysis of their functioning and relationships. The pair-wise interface aspects are characterised through investigation of the 'demands' and 'supply' of each sphere relative to the others.

As globalization continues, isolated human communities in these regions are increasingly connected to global market, migration. and technology networks. We review the diffuse literature on the household effects of changing market access. migration, and technology adoption in remote regions and implications for native biodiversity. Market access affects biodiversity in remote communities through changes in household economics and social networks. Migration, either to or from remote settlements, affects biodiversity through changes in population, remittances, human capital, and social networks. Finally, we consider effects due to production, public infrastructure, and information and communication technologies. There is much ambiguity surrounding these causal pathways, and thus we also examine the roles of various ecological, household, community, and institutional mediating factors in determining the impacts of global connection. Finally, we explore the limitations of our current knowledge and research practices and propose directions for future work to address key uncertainties in theory and evidence as well as weaknesses in methodological approaches.

We find substantial effects, accounting for roughly half of the explained variation in the labor productivity differences within the Netherlands in the 1990s. Diversification, urbanization, and localization effects are significant and positive for productivity levels. These levels appear cointegrated. The error correction specification of productivity growth surprisingly reflects negative agglomeration effects. From the theoretical model it follows that congestion effects must have taken precedence over agglomeration effects during this period. Both agglomeration and congestion effects are dampened by job density in neighboring regions. Finally, policy simulations with the estimated model show that spatial concentration is more harmful to national productivity growth than spatial dispersion.","[Broersma, Lourens; Oosterhaven, Jan] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Fac Spatial Sci, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Broersma, Lourens] Univ Groningen, Groningen Growth & Dev Ctr, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Broersma, L (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Fac Spatial Sci, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",l.broersma@rug.nl,"Oosterhaven, Jan/ABA-1136-2021",,,,,,54,49,55,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

J,"Shammin, MR; Bullard, CW",,,,"Shammin, Md Rumi; Bullard, Clark W.",,,Impact of cap-and-trade policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions on US households,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cap-and-trade; Regressive impact of climate change policy; Carbon tax and rebate; GHG emission reduction; Equity and fairness of climate legislation,CARBON; TAX,"Proposals being considered by the U.S. Congress would establish a cap-and-trade system to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions approximately 2% annually through 2050. Past cap-and-trade policies for other pollutants have distributed allowances free to the regulated companies, leaving consumers uncompensated for passed-through costs needed to achieve the required reductions. Social equity concerns were not a major issue because the total costs were relatively small. However, Americans currently spend about $1 trillion/year on energy, directly and indirectly via the goods and services they consume. If a cap on carbon emissions results in significant increases in energy prices, social equity concerns could quickly dominate the debate over climate policy. This paper confirms earlier studies that a traditional cap-and-trade policy is regressive and would cause the cost of reducing GHG emissions to fall disproportionately on low income households. This paper explores ways to ameliorate those effects, using highly disaggregated data available on consumer expenditures and energy-input-output analyses of the U.S. economy. Emissions are estimated based on direct and embodied energy use at the household level. Social equity concerns are taken into account and the consequences of cap-and-trade policies are assessed by quantifying the extent to which the expenditure patterns of the poor are significantly more energy intensive than those of the rich.

This model underlines the trade-off between information rents and allocative efficiency. The impact of spatial targeting is then addressed. Disaggregated information structures increase the optimal efforts asked of the farmers. It may also involve higher information rents and may reduce the net contributions of some farmers. Finally, the consequences of delegating authority within the principal-agent relationship are investigated. The results illustrate that spatial targeting and delegation, when combined, have asymmetric impacts on farmers' payoffs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Consumers are heterogeneous - they may be guided by intrinsic motivation or extrinsic motivation. While information provision policies (such as the energy label for cars) may be effective in encouraging certain consumers to adopt green cars, financial incentive schemes (such as subsidies or fines) may be more persuasive for extrinsically-motivated consumers. We develop a dynamic theory of adoption of environmental innovations, in which information-provision policies are followed by financial incentives (first 'carrot', then 'stick' incentives). Analysis of a survey dataset of Swiss households observes considerable heterogeneity in terms of support of information-provision or financial incentive policies, in line with our conjectures.

Whereas the ecological footprint (EF) denotes the bioproductive area (hectares) needed to sustain a population, the water footprint (WF) represents the freshwater volume (cubic metres per year) required. In elaborating the WF concept into a well-defined quantifiable indicator, a number of methodological issues have been addressed, with many similarities to the methodological concerns in EF analysis. The methodology followed in WF studies is in most cases analogous to the methodology taken in EF studies, but deviates at some points. Well-reasoned it has been chosen for instance to specifically take into account the source and production circumstances of products and assess the actual water use involved, thus not taking global averages. As a result one can exactly localise the spatial distribution of a water footprint of a country. With respect to the outcome of the footprint estimates, one can see both similarities and striking differences. Food consumption for instance contributes significantly to both the EF and the WF, but mobility (and associated energy use) is very important only for the EF. From a sustainability perspective, the WF of a country tells another story and thus at times will put particular development strategies in a different perspective. The paper reviews and compares the methodologies in EF and WF studies, compares nation's footprint estimates and suggests how the two concepts can be interpreted in relation to one another. The key conclusion is that the two concepts are to be regarded as complementary in the sustainability debate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A stochastic frontier model with a latent spatial structure is proposed to account for possible unknown geographical variation of the outputs. The paper compares versions of the model that include the latent spatial effect in the mean of output or as a variable that conditions the distribution of inefficiency, include or not observed municipal variables, and specify independent normal or conditional autoregressive priors for the spatial effects. The Bayesian paradigm is used to estimate the proposed models. As the resultant posterior distributions do not have a closed form, stochastic simulation techniques are used to obtain samples from them. Two model comparison criteria provide support for including the latent spatial effects, even after considering covariates at the municipal level. Models that ignore the latent spatial effects produce significantly different rankings of inefficiencies across agents.","[Schmidt, Alexandra M.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Matemat, BR-21945970 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Moreira, Ajax R.

Although studies have begun to question the ecological sustainability of managed fishery systems, they often omit the corresponding effects on the economic sustainability of fishery industries, This is particularly important in rural coastal areas where the fishing industry is often a dominant employer. In this article, we analyze the interactions between economic and ecological dynamic systems using a multi-agent dynamic model of fishery management. Multiple agents (fishers) harvest multiple fish species and adapt the amount and allocation of their effort to their value functions, which are given as net profits of the fish harvest sold for a market price. This is largely unique in fishery models, since many econometric studies view fishers as represented by homogenous 'average' agents. We introduce and compare two different decision rules governing the behavior of fishers engaged in a competitive market. We demonstrate a situation where both behaviors lead to a decline of all fish stocks, as well as profits for most fishers. As an alternative, we introduce a cooperative approach in which fisheries jointly set sustainable Emits for total harvest and effort that are then distributed to the fishers according to distribution rules. The simulation reveals that fish stocks and profits can stabilize at significantly higher levels in the cooperative case, leading to a continuous accumulation of capital for all fishers. This model demonstrates key aspects of overfishing conflicts that can be overcome through planned fishing quotas and cooperative market mechanisms. It also demonstrates a novel approach for simulating the dynamic behavior of heterogeneous fishers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We find no empirical evidence of an EKC relationship between the EF and economic development, and only limited support for such a relationship among the components of the EF. in addition, we discover that energy is largely responsible for the lack of an EKC relationship, and that energy consumption levels would have to be cut by over 50% in order for a statistically significant EKC relationship to emerge from the data.

Using an overlapping generations model a la Blanchard [Blanchard, O. (1985). Debt, deficits and finite horizon. journal of Political Economy, 93:223-247], we demonstrate that finite lifetime introduces a generational turnover effect which modifies the influence of the EP on growth. Thus, when lifetime is finite and independent from pollution, we show that the generational turnover effect limits the detrimental impact of the EP on growth, if agents smooth their consumption over time. When pollution negatively influences life expectancy through health, we demonstrate that the generational turnover effect is magnified and that the EP and growth have an inverted U-shaped relationship in the steady-state. In this case, we show that the environmental policy is more likely to promote growth (i.e. it stimulates growth for a wider range of environmental taxes) when the impact of pollution on health is important and/or public expenditures in health are low. Finally, using numerical simulations, we find that for the value of parameters that we have chosen, the EP will be more likely to promote growth when agents smooth consumption over time.

This paper advances the proposition that public investment affects the returns to the distribution of factor endowments differentially. The rise in inequality then turns the attention of the state towards redistribution. When public expenditures are financed by borrowing, increased inequality that creates pressures for redistributive transfers crowds Out public investment. Future income generation gets adversely affected by a reversal of public investment which makes creditors impose borrowing constraints on the state. This can take the form of the enactment of fiscal responsibility legislation.","[D'Souza, Errol] Indian Inst Management, Econ Area, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,,errol@iimahd.ernet.in,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-283-941-1,STAT SCI INTERDISC R,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,429.0,443,,,,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Mathematics,BMY19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273874600018,0

Although they are a growing element in the promotional mix of food manufacturers worldwide, trade promotions often raise concerns about their impacts on performance and coordination in the food supply chain, which in turn affect retail food prices. This paper aims to measure the influence of market power on the outcomes of trade promotions negotiated between food manufacturers and supermarkets. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs Rangan's conceptual model to develop hypotheses about the links between three dimensions of market power (size, brand and institutional power) and trade promotion budgets and their allocation between discount- and performance-based types. The paper employs trade promotion data collected from 36 supermarkets in the USA to statistically test these links. Findings - The results suggest that brand, size, and institutional power of food manufacturers and retailers affect trade promotion budgets and their allocation among discount- and performance-based types. Food manufacturers have relatively more control over their trade promotion budgets whereas retailers may have more influence on the allocation decisions. Originality/value - The findings can help food manufacturers and retailers identify institutional, brand and size variables that may help them leverage trade promotion negotiations. The results are relevant to policymakers, in particular for the study of antitrust and performance issues in the food distribution system.","[Gomez, Miguel I.; Rao, Vithala R.] Cornell Univ, New York, NY 10021 USA",Cornell University,"Gómez, MI (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, New York, NY 10021 USA.",mig7@cornell.edu,"Gomez, Miguel I./AAD-3707-2019",,,,,,18,8,8,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

International retailers have been in China for more than ten years, during which period a series of profound changes has occurred in the Chinese retail sector. International retailers introduced advanced retail techniques and managerial approaches; domestic retailers grew more sophisticated in their supply chain management. Foreign-based retailers in China can compete in hypermarket and supercentre formats because they offer higher-quality products and achieve larger economies of scale. Domestic retailers compete by operating smaller formats and maintaining good relationships with governments and local communities. However, formerly state-owned domestic retailers appear less competitive because they lack funds and adopt poor management styles. This study aims to make recommendations about future developments by domestic and foreign grocery retailers. Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes the form of a qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with four retailers: Wal-Mart, Bonjour, Wu-Mart, and Jingkelong. Findings - The findings pertain to several different themes, including consumers, business relationships and distribution centres, product lines, store formats, quality systems, and competition. Research limitations/implications - The study's findings are based only on four retailers. Practical implications - The paper presents a series of recommendations for both foreign-based and domestic retailers. Originality/value - This research is among the first to investigate operator attitudes toward competition in the grocery retail market in China.","[Lindgreen, Adam] Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Hingley, Martin] Harper Adams Univ Coll, Dept Business Management & Mkt, Newport, Shrops, England",University of Hull; Harper Adams University,"Lindgreen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",A.Lindgreen@hull.ac.uk,"Lindgreen, Adam/D-4103-2019","Lindgreen, Adam/0000-0001-7881-7350; Hingley, Martin/0000-0003-0281-959X",,,,,31,23,24,1,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the possible application of Bai Salam contract (forward sale agreement) as an alternative financial instrument in the agriculture sector of Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted in four districts of the Punjab with a specifically designed questionnaire. A convenient sampling technique was used to gather farmers' concerns related to crops inputs, output and credit requirements. Findings - Empirical findings conclude that agriculture income represents only up to 60 percent of the income of an average farm household. About 70 percent of fanners participate in the credit market. They need money to purchase crops inputs, to pay the labour and to hire rental machinery. Farmers believe that they can save up to 25 percent in costs if they purchase inputs on cash. The survey also discloses that middlemen are the larger financers; and buyers of crops in the rural economy whereby only 10 percent of transactions are conducted on a purely cash basis. Farmers usually return the money after the sale of the crop. Research limitations/implications - The concept of the paper can be extended to areas where large landlords dominate the scene. Alternatively, it can be extended towards non-farm activities such as cattle raising and poultry. Originality/value - The paper is a first comprehensive effort to explore the possible application of an Islamic banking instrument in the agriculture sector of Pakistan. It also suggests three possible models for financing under a Bai Salam contract. Some policy recommendations are also given.","[Kaleem, Ahmad] Lahore Sch Econ, Dept Business Adm, Lahore, Pakistan; [Wajid, Rana Abdul] Lahore Sch Econ, Ctr Math & Stat, Lahore, Pakistan",Lahore School of Economics; Lahore School of Economics,"Kaleem, A (通讯作者)，Lahore Sch Econ, Dept Business Adm, Lahore, Pakistan.",drkaleem@lahoreschool.edu.pk,,,,,,,35,20,20,0,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 559 subjects recruited in supermarkets of different cities and villages in Switzerland were asked to write down their understanding of freshness in general, and for fruits and vegetables in particular. Direct elicitation by means of an open-ended questionnaire was used. Findings - Respondents mentioned a large variety of descriptors in relationship with fresh fruits and vegetables. Results suggest that freshness describes a level of closeness to the original product, in terms of distance, time and processing. Respondents having more contact with the place of fruit and vegetable production mentioned non-sensory attributes more frequently, whereas those having fewer contacts mentioned sensory attributes more frequently. It can be concluded that consumers have a collective concept of freshness but they use their different everyday experiences with fruits and vegetables to describe freshness. Research limitations/implications - Analysis of open-ended questionnaires is time-consuming and difficulties were encountered in the categorisation of phrases. Participants might have been influenced by the environment in supermarkets. Practical implications - The perception of freshness is influenced by the information consumers have on products. Therefore the importance of providing sufficient information on the products is emphasized. Originality/value - The study is the first to extensively investigate the consumer understanding of the term fresh in relationship with fruits and Vegetables.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is composed of a literature review, qualitative and quantitative expert interviews, and structural equation modelling. Findings - Effective communication, the existence of personal bonds and equal power distribution between buyers and suppliers are key determinants of sustainable vertical business relationships. The relevance and significance of the determinants differ across. the investigated chain stages (farmer-processor versus processor-retailer), the use of formal versus non-formal relationship types and the maturity of a relationship. Research limitations/implications - Further research needs to empirically apply the analysis to agri-food chains other than the investigated pig-meat and cereal ones. Practical implications - Agribusiness and farm managers can enhance the sustainability of their business relationships by effective communication by fostering personal bonds with their suppliers and/or buyers, and by employing - and retaining - key staff who fit culturally and/or socially with those with whom they transact. Finally, managers also need to be aware of the fact that a business relationship can be negatively affected by abusing a more powerful market position. Originality/value - A model for measuring the sustainability of vertical business relationships is presented and empirically tested. In addition, factors influencing the sustainability of these relationships are identified for the case of selected German agri-food chains.","[Reynolds, Nikolai; Hartmann, Monika] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Fischer, Christian] Massey Univ, Inst Food Nutr & Human Hlth, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Bonn; Massey University,"Reynolds, N (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, D-5300 Bonn, Germany.",,"Fischer, Christian/A-9435-2015; Hartmann, Monika/J-8224-2017","Fischer, Christian/0000-0002-5016-3962; Hartmann, Monika/0000-0002-3631-164X","European Commission [FOODCOMM, SSPE-CT-2005-006458]",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This publication derives from the research project on Key factors influencing economic relationships and communication in European food chains (FOODCOMM, SSPE-CT-2005-006458) which is funded by the European Commission as part of the Sixth Framework Programme.

In the large and growing literature on the crisis some common themes emerge: the role of systemic economic reforms since 1991, the opening of the Indian economy to external competition and investment after decades of insulation; the impact on India of implementing the Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations; the alleged neglect of agriculture in the planning process since the mid-eighties; the decline of public investment in agriculture in response to rising fiscal deficits at the Centre and the States and above all, the slowing of the growth of agricultural output (particularly food grains) as well as a stagnation in yields per hectare of land since the nineties. This paper argues that the fundamental factor that is at the root Of file Current state of agriculture is India's pursuit, until the 1991 reforms, of a state-directed, state-controlled and state-dominated development strategy of import substituting industrialization with emphasis on heavy industry and insulation from the world economy. This strategy completely ignored the lessons of economic history: successful development lies in the transformation of economic structure by shifting a substantial part of the large initial share of labour force in agriculture and other low productivity activities in the informal sector to more productive off-farm activities through rural and urban industrialization with emphasis on labour-intensive manufactures to supply growing domestic and world markets and raising agricultural productivity. Leap-frogging the labour-intensive manufacturing stage of development altogether and focusing on information technology intensive services sector to bring about the transformation is not simply not feasible. This paper elaborates this main point by looking at major policy interventions in agriculture since independence It argues that there was no coherence, and little coordination among the centre, states and other policy making institutions in the decisions on the myriad interventions and their effectiveness in achieving their intended objectives was limited.","[Srinivasan, T.

Other literature, however, speculates that the correlation was in fact positive from the early nineteenth century. This paper uses the cointegrated VAR model and recursive estimation techniques to document the changing relationship between nuptiality and the price of wheat from 1541 to 1965. The relationship is indeed positive from the early nineteenth century to the First World War. A simple theoretical model shows that this result is not in fact inconsistent with a stylised Malthusian mechanism, and can be understood within the context of an increasing dominance of shocks to aggregate demand rather than to aggregate supply.","[Weisdorf, Jacob; Sharp, Paul] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1455 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Weisdorf, J (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Studiestraede 6, DK-1455 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",jacob.weisdorf@econ.ku.dk,"Sharp, Paul/C-1027-2019","Sharp, Paul/0000-0003-0679-0106",,,,,25,7,7,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2009,3.0,1,,,,,55.0,70,,10.1007/s11698-008-0025-9,0.0,,,16,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,618KG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279351000003,0

By combining data on individuals' pro-environmental consumption from a unique data set with data on subjective well-being, we find that people could attain higher well-being (utility) by unilaterally consuming more environmentally friendly while at the same time reducing the quantity consumed. The distortions identified are smaller when people's reference persons consume more environmentally friendly and when the individual has a longer environmental friendly consumption history. We therefore conclude that learning from the behavior of others and from one's own past experience may help alleviate decision error in environment-friendly consumption. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Different inefficient situations have been described, like lack of additionality, where payments are given for practices that would have been adopted anyway. Trade-offs between efficiency and equity of PES have usually emerged as well. In this paper we assess the equity, additionality and stakeholders' perceptions of a PES scheme in a Mexican community inside a Biosphere Reserve. We applied structured interviews to all adults, a total of 66 people from 31 households. Our results show a dual response in equity and additionality, depending on land tenure.

Additionality is low for landowners and high for the landless people in the community, even though the former are the ones with full decision over the land. Although the scheme does not seem efficient under the classical PES paradigm, it is perceived as a reward, reinforcing conservation attitudes even though most of the interviewees claim it to be insufficient.

For many invasions the development of socially optimal control strategies requires more than is offered by the single-species, single-control models that have dominated this area of research. We develop a general stochastic optimal control framework that accommodates multiple interacting species while accounting for uncertainty in the temporal population dynamics. This extension to the current line of bioeconomic control models allows for the design of optimal integrated pest management strategies that utilize both chemical and biological controls in an environment of uncertainty and irreversibility. We demonstrate the benefits of combining chemical and biological controls in long term management strategies through a case study of the hemlock wooly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) infestation in the eastern United States. In this application we find that the introduction of natural predators is usually sufficient to manage the infestation, though chemical insecticides can play an important role when detection of the infestation is delayed or when the biological control agent does not sufficiently increase mortality of the invasive species.

This is largely attributed to lack of private out-of-pocket payment to finance healthcare services. A community-based prepayment health insurance scheme may be implemented to improve healthcare access in rural areas. This study examines the determinants of willingness-to-pay for a community-based prepayment healthcare system using a contingent valuation method conducted in rural Cameroon. To mitigate potential hypothetical bias, a consequential script is introduced in the questionnaire. The results indicate age, religion, profession, knowledge of community-based health insurance, awareness of usual practice in rural areas, involvement in association and disposable income are the key determinants of willingness to pay for a prepayment health scheme. On average, willingness to pay for the scheme by rural households is 1011 CFA francs/person/month (2.15 US dollars). The results underlie two important implications: first, there is substantial demand for a community healthcare prepayment scheme by rural poor households in Cameroon; second, rural households are averse to health shocks and hence they are willing to sacrifice monthly premium payments to protect themselves (and their households) from unforeseen health-related risks. If government could engage in social marketing strategies such as mass media campaigns and awareness, this could prove vital for encouraging participation by the rural poor in healthcare prepayment scheme in Cameroon.","[Donfouet, Hermann Pythagore Pierre] Univ Yaounde II, Dept Publ Econ, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Makaudze, Ephias] Univ Western Cape, Dept Econ, Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa; [Mahieu, Pierre-Alexandre] Univ Rouen, Dept Econ, Rouen, France; [Malin, Eric] Univ Rennes 1, CREM, UMR CNRS 6211, Rennes, France",University of the Western Cape; Universite de Rouen Normandie; Universite de Rennes,"Donfouet, HPP (通讯作者)，Univ Yaounde II, Dept Publ Econ, POB 1365, Yaounde, Cameroon.",donfouetz@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,37,40,46,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Insights from political philosophy and philosophy of language can help to clarify the reliability and scope of the current economic methods that can be used for the purpose of valuing it. The analogy with another abstract good, justice, indeed shows that thinking about abstract goods is a very specific exercise. If they do not take account of this specificity, applications of hedonic and contingent valuation methods can hardly claim to be relevant to value biodiversity. Rawls' theory of justice provides for the conceptual tools to overcome this problem. A reinterpretation, based on the theory of counterfactuals, allows generalizing this account of justice to outline a theory of thinking about abstract goods. This new framework emphasizes the importance of the institutional context in determining the reliability of thinking about abstract goods. It points toward substantial reforms of the methodology of economic valuation. Specifically, it suggests reinterpreting valuation as a dynamic expressive process, where initial steps aim at reinforcing the reliability of later steps through an institutional transformation and stabilization of preferences for abstract goods.

For the Habsburg Empire, a new dataset of foreign trade and social metabolism is presented. For the United Kingdom, the analysis relies on previously published data. Foreign trade volumes increased in both countries in the long run. Total trade volumes were much higher in the United Kingdom throughout the entire time period, on average by around a factor four. Physical factors explaining the disparities in structure and volume of foreign trade in the two countries are differences in (1) the temporal patterns of the socio-ecological transition and (2) domestic resource endowments. In both countries, energy carrying materials, i.e. fossil fuels and biomass, were the dominant resources in physical foreign trade. The analysis focuses on the physically most important material groups: coal, wood and cereals, and discusses the role of imports and exports in relation to domestic resource provision and environmental pressures. Physical foreign trade increased at a faster pace than domestic resource extraction and consumption. The socio-ecological transition was thus accompanied by rising international integration of resource supply. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It investigates economies of scale and cost inefficiencies in 43 water providers during the years from 1996 to 2005. Different water sources in different geographical regions directly affect the production technology of the sector, making a regional cost frontier model appropriate. In 2005, 48.7% of the population of Peru lived in poverty, and 43.87% of the water produced was lost. These large proportions support the assumption that water producers allow water to be lost as a way to satisfy the water demands of the poorest segment of the population. Findings indicate a cost rise of 0.10% for each 1% increase of joint production of both outputs: water lost and produced. This result may be suggestive of a price the utility pays for allowing unauthorized connections in the network. From the perspective of the board of directors, this cost increase is the political cost of gaining municipal votes from the poorest segment of the population. Economies of scale are larger for utilities operating in the forest than in other regions. This has important implications for any future consolidation process that may be undertaken when the sector is opened to private participation.","[Corton, Maria Luisa] Univ S Florida, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Corton, Maria Luisa] Univ Florida, Publ Util Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Corton, ML (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",mcorton@ufl.edu,"corton, maria l/H-5928-2013",,,,,,37,9,10,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

In seventeenth-century Holland the structure, size, and issuing rates of the debt were determined by investors' preferences, wealth accumulation, and changing private investment opportunities. The growth of savings enabled the creation of a huge debt largely with short-term bills. Issuing rates dropped because savings outstripped private investment alternatives.

This is novel because current models of consumer purchase behavior assume that only one of these types of dynamics is present, not both at the same time. My model estimates support the presence of both learning and switching costs in this product category. The estimates show that before consuming new products, consumers are unsure of their tastes for them, and subsequently learn their tastes by purchase and consumption of new products. Switching costs are large, comprising roughly 30 percent of the cost of a medium sized package of the product. Additionally, the model incorporates very rich individual level unobserved heterogeneity in price sensitivities, tastes, and switching costs, and the amount by which consumers learn. To show that my model produces different implications than a model with learning or switching costs only, I estimate two more specifications, one without each type of dynamics, and simulate counterfactuals that are of interest to managers and policymakers. I find that intertemporal elasticities are underestimated when either type of dynamics is left out, by as much as 90%. Informative advertising is also affected by the presence of switching costs, although the direction of the bias is not signed. Leaving out dynamics also has a large impact on long-term elasticities, which are used by antitrust policymakers to evaluate the impact of mergers. When learning is ignored, cross elasticities are underestimated by as much as 45%. When switching costs are ignored, both own and cross elasticities are underestimated.","US Dept Commerce, Bur Econ Anal, Washington, DC 20230 USA",,"Osborne, M (通讯作者)，US Dept Commerce, Bur Econ Anal, Washington, DC 20230 USA.",matthew.osborne@bea.gov,,,,,,,36,39,59,1,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

In this study, we employ linear regression analysis to determine the casual effect of climate change on wetlands in this region, with temperature, precipitation and the standardized precipitation index (SPI) used to predict the effect of potential climate change on wetlands. We then use a waterfowl-wetlands bioeconomic model to solve for socially optimal levels of duck harvests and wetlands retention under current climate conditions and various climate change scenarios. The model maximizes benefits to hunters plus the amenity values of ducks to non hunters and the non-market ecosystem benefits of wetlands. Results indicate that climate change could decrease wetlands by between 7 and 47%, and that the optimal number of wetlands to retain could decrease by as much as 38% from the baseline climate.

In the paper the experimental results are published. The briquettes quality evaluation was their aim. For the briquetting tests spruce sawdust, oak shavings, shavings mixture (about 90% spruce and 10% oak), aspen chips and birch chips were used. The basic physical-mechanical properties were the evaluation criteria. Following properties were determined: gross calorific value, ash amount, total moisture content, density, rupture force, length, diameter, density and mechanical durability. From the test results it is evident that the briquettes made from five different materials are of very different properties. All briquettes fulfilled the demands of relevant directives for gross calorific value and total moisture. From the viewpoint of ash amount four from five samples met the requirements, for aspen chips was about twice the prescribed value is exceeded. From the viewpoint of the mechanical durability the briquettes made from mixture of spruce and oak shavings were of above-average properties. The briquettes made from spruce sawdust and oak shavings were of average, briquettes made from birch and aspen chips of below-average mechanical durability. From the viewpoint of density four from five samples met the requirements. The briquettes made from oak shavings and from shaving mixture were of density higher than 1000 kg.m(-3), briquettes made from spruce sawdust and aspen chips were of density than 900 kg.m(-3). The briquettes from birch chips were of density only of 1 kg.m(-3) lower than it was demanded. It is possible to say that from this viewpoint the briquetting press was suitable. These tests were carried out although none of existing directives prescribes the demands on the briquettes rupture force. At that it was determined that this force intensity increases with the increasing briquettes density. In the following part of these tests the briquettes dimensions (diameter and length) and weight were measured. At that it was determined that the briquettes diameter depends slightly on the density. But their length and weight depend on the density more closely.","[Brozek, Milan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Sci & Mfg Technol, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,,brozek@tf.czu.cz,"Brožek, Milan/A-2456-2019",,,,,,20,4,5,0,7,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,308.0,313,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000049,0

Design/methodology/approach - Total carnitine, free carnitine and acylcarnitines were determined in meat samples from beef, pork and poultry (including ostrich) and in a liver sample from beef. The measurements were carried out before and after the specimens were subjected to different heat treatments. A radio-enzymatic assay was used for measurement of L-carnitine. Results are expressed per 100 gram dry matter and per 100 gram wet weight. Findings - Except for pan-frying, virtually no losses of carnitine occurred during the different procedures of heat treatment. During boiling and microwaving, however, a considerable portion of the tissue carnitine escaped into the water fraction. With pan-frying, carnitine losses from meat amounted to from 3 to 36 per cent. In all animal species, tissue losses of L-carnitine increased with increase of boiling time. When expressed as a percentage of total carnitine, the proportion of carnitine present as esters differed somewhat between different heating procedures but showed no typical pattern. Originality/value - The findings of this study show the important role that meat products play for providing an adequate amount of L-carnitine in humans who are suffering from carnitine deficiency and an exogenous supplementation. is needed.","[Knuettel-Gustavsen, Seline; Harmeyer, Johein] Sch Vet Med, Dept Physiol, Hannover, Germany",University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover,"Knüttel-Gustavsen, S (通讯作者)，Sch Vet Med, Dept Physiol, Hannover, Germany.",segust@gmx.net,,,,,,,36,9,9,1,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Non-fermented beans, fermented beans, roasted nibs and cocoa liquor were analyzed using spectrophotometry. Findings In general, the samples that contained a higher level of phenolics and flavonoids were the roasted nibs and the non-fermented samples in both cultivation systems. The fermented beans and the liquor contained a lower level. Practical implications - The relationship between the concentration of total phenols and the capacity to mop up free radicals from the cocoa extracts appears to be highly significant. The extracts with a higher concentration of phenols also show higher antioxidant activity (non-fermented beans extracts and organically and conventionally cultivated nibs). Originality/value - This work brings an important contribution in the field of agriculture at a time when organic systems of cultivation are an alternative to the conventional system and that pollutes the environment and produces food that contains quantities of chemical contaminants that can damage the health of the consumer. The comparison in phenolic compounds content, flavonoids and antioxidant activity in organic and conventional systems is original and of great importance, showing that the ecological cropping systems are less harmful to the environment and promote improvements to the chemical composition of foods.","[Oliveira, Cassiane da Silva; Maciel, Leonardo Fonseca; Miranda, Maria Spinola; Bispo, Eliete da Silva] Univ Fed Bahia, Fac Farm, Salvador, BA, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Bahia,"Oliveira, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Bahia, Fac Farm, Campus Univ Ondina, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",Cassiane_ufba@yahoo.com.br,"Maciel, Leonardo/E-9297-2013; Miranda, Maria/D-4471-2014","Maciel, Leonardo/0000-0002-6990-5102;",,,,,29,12,15,1,55,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In addition, researchers suggest using many definitions of financial distress which, economically approximate long term insolvency. This paper focused on specific cause's study of farm financial distress. The main causes could be mentioned, such as errors made by farmers (manager), errors made in the farm policy and the importance of external factors. Furthermore researchers suggest using various financial ratios to measure financial distress, which implicates that these financial ratios represent the possible causes of financial distress.","[Stulpiniene, Vaida] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Fac Econ & Management, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,v.stulpiniene@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,1,1,1,12,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,249.0,253,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000039,0

Subjects were graduate students and professionals from diverse disciplines, representing 41 countries of residence. The participants in this study stand in sharp contrast to most previous studies, which used undergraduates who self-select into experiments by volunteering to participate.

Specifically, we separate the influence of changes in population and air quality from that of newer health concentration-response relationships and changing economic values. The dynamic interaction of key variables, including health and economic, as well as changes in population and air quality, lead to significant changes in results over time. Results show dramatic reductions in exposures to ozone and particulate concentrations between the two time periods, a continually evolving health literature, and in contrast, fairly constant real economic unit values assigned to adverse health outcomes. Such research is important because highly technical analyses of the expected benefits of proposed air quality regulatory programs have become an increasingly important component of many decision-making processes.

The role of initial conditions,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Voluntary environmental contributions; Ecolabeling; Evolutionary game theory; Replicator dynamics; Sustainable management; Transitional dynamics,CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; VOLUNTARY; COMPETITION; AGREEMENTS; CONSUMERS; EVOLUTION; PROGRAMS; POLICY; MODEL,"This paper analyzes the interaction between three environmental strategies within a population of firms: brown, green, and certified green strategies. We first present a restricted version of an evolutionary game where only brown and green strategies are possible. Next, the model is extended to allow green firms to certify their environmental strategies by joining an ecolabel. Our analysis shows that when it survives, the ecolabel tends to fully replace other uncertified environmental initiatives and to increase the proportion of firms implementing voluntary abatement. Nevertheless, the long-run survival of the ecolabel is not a necessary outcome of the model, although it can be facilitated via policies that reduce abatement or certification costs, increase consumer's environmental concerns or improve the credibility of the certifier, whereas it may be reduced by green-wash news about the sector. An ecolabel's survival may also depend on how and when it is launched. In those common situations where the model has two stable equilibria, initial conditions play a key role in determining the ecolabel's survival. Specifically important determinants are the degree of adoption of voluntary abatement when the ecolabel is launched and the amount and composition of firms that participate in the creation of the ecolabel.

A broadly applicable economic model of poaching shows why CITES international bans have not always been successful, especially in situations where black markets exist and nonpoaching wages are low. In these situations, poachers may have nothing left to lose, since low nonpoaching wages impose a practical cap on the potential economic costs of fines and imprisonment. Thus, the model suggests shoot-on-sight policies as the only viable option. Trends in animal populations appear to support the efficacy of the shoot-on-sight policies, which also suggests an inherent value of life traditionally not captured in Value of a Statistical Life estimates.

Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal residents of tropical river catchment areas have complex values for these systems which are difficult for decision-makers to accommodate. Aboriginal Australians are a large and growing proportion of the population and are also significant landowners, yet there is little information about the impacts of potential development scenarios on the welfare of Aboriginal Australians that can be used in benefit-cost analyses. This paper reports the application of a choice experiment to assess the potential impact of development/management strategies for three tropical rivers in Australia, and explores the differences between the preferences of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians living in the catchment areas. Most respondents preferred healthy river systems that are managed under conservation schemes even if this comes at a private cost. The willingness-to-pay of Aboriginal Australians was significantly higher than that of non-Aboriginal Australians for some river attributes, particularly those related to cultural values. Aboriginal respondents were also indifferent towards the extraction of water for irrigated agriculture while non-Aboriginal respondents preferred moderate rather than large or small scale use.

DON; PINUS-RADIATA; ECONOMIC VALUE; WOOD PRODUCTS; WESTERN-CAPE; SEQUESTRATION; DECOMPOSITION; FORESTRY; VEGETATION,"Carbon sequestration by afforestation can help mitigate global climate change but may have adverse environmental and economic impacts in some regions. For example, economic incentives for carbon sequestration may encourage the expansion of Pinus radiata timber plantations in the Fynbos biome of South Africa, with negative consequences for water supply and biodiversity. I built a dynamic ecological-economic model to investigate whether afforestation of a Fynbos catchment with Pinus radiata is economically viable when the potential benefits of carbon sequestration and timber production are balanced against the losses to water supply. I found that afforestation appears viable to the forestry industry under current water tariffs and current carbon accounting legislation, but would appear unviable if the forestry industry were to pay the true cost of water used by the plantations. I also found that under various plausible future economic scenarios. afforestation can be associated with either large future economic gains or losses, suggesting a need for future analyses based on branches of decision theory that deal with severe uncertainty. I conclude with a general recommendation that climate legislation should be explicit about the conditions under which afforestation for carbon sequestration of native vegetation is a legitimate climate mitigation strategy.

Yet there is little attempt to restrain either material throughput or income growth. Nonetheless, in the face of the need to make 'deep' cuts in carbon emissions (for instance), consumption restraint may be a perfectly legitimate response. This paper explores the potential for a Reduced Consumption Scenario in the UK constructed by assuming that households achieve a specific 'minimum income standard' which is deemed to provide a decent life for each household type. The minimum income standards are taken from a recent study for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and include not only subsistence commodities such as food, warmth and shelter but also the means to participate effectively in society. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation study produced detailed household expenditure budgets for these income standards. The paper uses an environmentally extended Quasi-Multi-Regional Input-Output model to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions required in the production and distribution of all goods and services purchased according to these budgets. Our results show that average household GHG emissions in the UK would be around 37% lower in the Reduced Consumption Scenario than they are currently. We explore several implications of these findings including: the need to change social norms around consumption, the need for investment to improve the thermal performance of homes and the need to develop new transport infrastructures. We also address the potential to reduce emissions below the level achieved in this Scenario and discuss the implications for policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Previous research attributed this to the construction of railways. But tests examining price differences between districts provide surprisingly weak support for that hypothesis. Railways mattered, but seem capable of explaining only about 20 percent of the decline in price dispersion. One explanation may be that India was a partially integrated economy at the time of railroad expansion. Lines connecting districts on preexisting trade routes had very small price effects.

For technology capital we construct two indexes reflecting national capacities in agricultural research and education-extension for 87 developing countries. We then correlate technology capital levels with long-term growth rates in agricultural TFP. Our findings show that global agricultural TFP growth as a whole accelerated since 1980, although performance was very uneven across developing countries. TFP growth rates were significantly influenced by technology capital. Marginal improvements to research capacity, given a minimal level of extension and schooling existed, were associated with faster TFP growth. However, marginal increases in extension-schooling without commensurate improvements in research capacity did not improve productivity performance.","[Fuglie, Keith O.] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Evenson, Robert E.] Yale Univ, Econ Growth Ctr, New Haven, CT USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Yale University,"Fuglie, KO (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, 1800 M St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",kfuglie@ers.usda.gov,,"Fuglie, Keith/0000-0002-7601-0542",,,,,39,16,20,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The etiologic fraction and other mathematical models were applied to quantify the cost savings resulting from walking interventions to prevent CHD. The net direct healthcare cost savings in CHD prevention resulting from 30 min of normal walking a day for 5-7 days a week by the sufficient walking population were estimated at AU$126.73 million in 2004. The cost savings could increase to $419.90 million if all the inactive adult Australians engaged in 1 h of normal walking a day for 5-7 days a week.

For example, priorities in many lowland floodplains in England have changed in recent years from a focus on agricultural production towards environmental quality and the management of flood risk, in part linked to climate change. Recent concerns about food security, however, may reinstate the importance of agricultural production in these fertile areas. This paper explores changes in rural land use in floodplains by measuring the range of ecosystem services provided under different management scenarios. Generic land use scenarios consider management options that focus on single objectives, such as maximising agricultural production, maximising biodiversity and maximising flood storage capacity. Indicators are developed to value the ecosystem services provided by floodplains under each scenario, identifying potential synergy and conflict. This integrated ecosystems approach can help to inform future policy and practice for floodplain management, hopefully in ways that appeal to key stakeholders. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This evidence could have been used as an alternative model of reform; instead, the Poor Law Commissioners misrepresented the operation of the law and recommended the abolition of affiliation.

To find out how this form of livestock husbandry relates to the other main farming sub-systems, cattle-keeping was compared with cassava and black pepper production. Data was collected from 37 cattle-keeping. mixed smallholdings, during 15 visits, at monthly intervals. The three sub-systems were studied in terms of productive efficiency of resource use, socio-economic contribution, and ecosystem-friendliness, using cash flow, non-market output and non-parametric rankings. Their relative performances in each domain were ranked and put on an AMOEBA diagram, a general method of system description and assessment. The markings connected across functions produced an outline of a polygon, reminding the shape of an amoeba. It was found that productive efficiency was lowest in cattle, benefit:cost ratio was highest in cassava, while return to labour was especially strong in black pepper production. The highest status, lowest production risk, highest liquidity and ease of sale, related to cattle. Cattle and pastures ranked worst in terms of biodiversity, damage to and pollution of water courses. Nutrient losses were highest in cassava, due to the large amount harvested. The differences in function meant that the three polygons occupied different segments of the circular diagram. Nevertheless, together they formed a well-rounded shape. The amoeboid nature of these polygons can be used to predict the effect of a shift of activity on the farm, making the diagram a useful illustrative tool for planning and teaching.

Stakeholder dialogues aim to enhance mutual learning by generating and evaluating divergent knowledge claims and viewpoints. i.e. problem structuring. Problem structuring requires that the diversity of perspectives is represented in the dialogue. We argue therefore that stakeholder dialogues should involve procedures for stakeholder selection that allow for the identification of the diversity of perspectives as well as of stakeholders identifying with those perspectives. We explore the use of Q methodology as a tool for pursuing this goal. Q methodology can be used to uncover perspectives that exist within a particular (policy) field. We applied Q methodology to a stakeholder dialogue on energy options from biomass in the Netherlands to identify stakeholder perspectives on energy from biomass and to select stakeholders for the dialogue. In order to discuss the use of Q methodology for stakeholder selection, we compare this stakeholder selection with a hypothetical selection based on actor type (NGOs, knowledge institutes, industry, etcetera). Our analysis shows that, although often implicitly assumed, actor type is not a good proxy for perspective: the actor types appeared to be heterogeneous in terms of perspectives. This means that a stakeholder selection procedure based on perspectives will very likely result in a different group composition than a selection based on affiliation or actor type. The analysis however also shows that some actor types were more heterogeneous than others and that some perspectives are dominated by particular actor types. We conclude that Q methodology is a useful method for stakeholder selection in stakeholder dialogues and wrap up with a discussion of the results and the implications for the design and preparation of a dialogue process.

The conclusion demonstrates: Acceleration Model is persuasive in explaining investing action of enterprise; case flow and uncertainty have a significant effect on investment; a big size and a high percentage of state share holding can not always be favorable to investment; the higher percentage the state holds, the bigger size it is, the higher sensibility to uncertainty.

Design/methodology/approach Sausages from three manufacturers' scales (homemade, traditional, and industrial) and two breed origins (Bisaro and non Bisaro) were analysed for pH, moisture, fat, protein, ash, NaCl, hydroxyproline and fatty acid composition. A total of 11 samples from each type of manufacture and breed were randomly selected after the complete drying-ripening process, in a total of 55 samples. Findings Physicochemical analysis of meat sausages showed a medium protein content (28-33 per cent) correlated to manufacture type (p < 0.05), and a high fat level (29-41 per cent) related with manufacture type and breed. Homemade manufacture was characterized by lower moisture and higher salt contents, reinforcing consumer's safety and economical assurance. The industrial processed sausages presented significantly higher moisture content and higher PUFA contents than expected, indicating the use in the feeding of the pigs feedstuffs rich in oilseed components and an increased susceptibility to oxidation. Comparing with similar products from foreign origins, this sausage is characterized by similar salt contents and similar or lower fat contents, highly monounsaturated, with positive nutritional outcomes. Originality/value The improvement and control of Chourica de carne de Melgaco manufacturing and breed origin is clearly needed. PGI should be implemented to guarantee genuineness of this product. The preservation of traditional procedures must guarantee the high quality of the product, its safety and consumer's acceptability.","[Mendes, Eulalia; Casal, Susana; Olveira, M. B. P.

With the help of multiple logistic regression models, the article indicates that health status, education degree, and marital quality of elderly-parents have significant positive influence on marital satisfactory of Chinese middle-aged adults. But if the factors of education degree have been controlled, the economic factors, such as employment, income, and urban/rural residence, do not have significant influences on marital satisfactory. We did not find the obvious life-cycle effects of marriage on the samples of Chinese families, which means that marital satisfactory of adults will not be influenced by the time length of marriage and the events of oldest-children's leaving home. In addition, there are some significant differences for the factors of marital satisfactory between male and female adults. Males' marital satisfactory declines when they control the family economy power, or they married their wife not through long-term dating but through too short-term dating and immediate married. But such factors are not significant for those female adult interviewers.","[Dong Zhiyong; Xiao Caide] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,4,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-15-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,720.0,727,,,,,,8,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298265500125,0

This work analyses in detail the generation and management of the animal by-products in those different stages of the production chain of meat. The focus of the paper is on the transmission of the costs associated to the implementation of the regulation along the production chain. The results show an uneven distribution of the regulation costs, where the farmers face particularly high costs (which are, in general, subsidised by the Government). On the other hand, the transmission of costs to the final consumers depends on the type of animal we considered: for cattle and sheep, the lack of competitiveness in their markets also interferes in the costs transmission.","[Esturo, A.; Gonzalez, N.; Saez de Buruaga, M.] AZTI Tecnalia, Pasaia, Spain",AZTI,"Esturo, A (通讯作者)，AZTI Tecnalia, Pasaia, Spain.",,"Martinez-Granado, Maite/P-6173-2014","Martinez-Granado, Maite/0000-0003-0095-0893",,,,,12,0,0,0,9,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1743-3541,,978-1-84564-436-9,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,WIT Trans.

The mathematical relationship between the college enrollment scale and the per capita cultivation cost turns out to be a subsection nonlinear regression model. In addition, it is not true that higher the enrollment scale lower the average cost.

Using event study the results reveal that there are positive market reactions by both target and bidding shareholders towards M&A announcements. However, the target shareholders earn significantly higher CAARs than bidding shareholders. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that economic conditions surrounding merger announcements, methods of payment, amount of premium paid, deal attitude, industry effect and status of deal (successful or failure acquisition) affect the short-term wealth effects of target and bidding shareholders during M&A announcements.

Design/methodology/approach - A consumer survey in the form of a questionnaire conducted in the Greater London area in February/March 2005. Subject recruitment process took place in both a gym and university setting. Frequency tables and chi(2)-test are used to assess relationships between variables (p = 0.05). Findings - The resulting sample consisted of 187 subjects, with predominance of females and gym users. Of the subjects, 88 per cent reported to at least occasionally read nutrition labels, with higher reading rates amongst women, irrespective of gym user status. Total and saturated fats are the most often information viewed on labels, however the overall knowledge of the calorie content of fat is low, with 53 per cent of subjects responding saturated fat contains more calories per gram when compared with other types of fats. This paper does not find significant differences in the use and understanding of nutrition labels between gym and non-gym users, but highlights the publics' continued lack of understanding of nutrition labels. Originality/value - This paper is unique as it investigates whether there is any difference between gym/non-gym users' use and interpretation of use of nutrition labels. It finds gender impacted more on nutritional labels knowledge than gym user's status. This points to a gender issue and questions the quality of information available to the general public. This paper is valuable as it highlights and identifies an area that requires further research and assessment, and is therefore useful to key stakeholders responsible for public health nutrition.","[Kennedy, Orla B.] Univ Reading, Hugh Sinclair Human Nutr Unit, Dept Food Biosci, Reading, Berks, England; [Wade, Simona] Univ Westminster, Dept Human & Hlth Sci, Sch Biosci, London W1R 8AL, England",University of Reading; University of Westminster,"Kennedy, OB (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Hugh Sinclair Human Nutr Unit, Dept Food Biosci, Reading, Berks, England.",o.b.kennedy@reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,5,8,1,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The paper starts with the principle of historical specificity, and the various waves of climate change through successive cooler and warmer periods on planet Earth, including the most recent climate change escalation through the open circuit associated with the treadmill of production. Then we scrutinize the principle of contradiction associated with the disembedded economy, social costs, entropy and destructive creation. The principle of uneven development is then explored through core-periphery dynamics, ecologically unequal exchange, metabolic rift and asymmetric global (in)justice. The principles of circular and cumulative causation (CCC) and uncertainty are then related to climate change dynamics through non-linear transformations. complex interaction of dominant variables, and threshold effects. Climate change and ecological destruction are impacting on most areas, especially the periphery, earlier and more intensely than previously thought likely. A political economy approach to climate change is able to enrich the analysis of ecological economics and put many critical themes in a broad context. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Organizational economics provides an alternative framework for analyzing agri-environmental problems and points to alternative solutions. In this paper, the traditional approach of creating markets for environmental goods and services is critiqued and set aside to provide space for an organizational analysis. From an organizational perspective, the relationship between the state and agricultural agents is viewed as grounded in an over-arching exchange relationship including elements of cooperation and trust. Such a collaborative exchange relationship may prove useful in supporting exchange between agricultural agents and the state leading to the provision of ecological goods and services. Highlighting the potential of organizational economics, the analysis suggests that agri-environmental research and policy go further in accounting for. and investigating, the unique organizational modes of exchange governing the production of food, fiber, and ecological goods and services.

The indirect effect works through changes in health promotion information and the probability of illness that may be a byproduct of insurance-induced greater contact with medical professionals. We identify these two effects and in doing so identify the pure ex ante moral hazard effect. This study exploits the plausibly exogenous variation in health insurance as a result of obtaining Medicare coverage at age 65. We find evidence that obtaining health insurance reduces prevention and increases unhealthy behaviors among elderly men. We also find evidence that physician counseling is successful in changing health behaviors.","[Kaestner, Robert] Univ Illinois, Inst Govt & Publ Affairs, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Dave, Dhaval; Kaestner, Robert] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dave, Dhaval] Bentley Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02452 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; National Bureau of Economic Research; Bentley University,"Kaestner, R (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Inst Govt & Publ Affairs, 815 W Van Buren St,Suite 525, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",ddave@bentley.edu; kaestner@uic.edu,,,,,,,36,106,140,4,85,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

In public hospitals in Montevideo there is a fixed payment system, but in private hospitals this procedure has to be paid for separately. In the former, there is no effect on the doctor's income if he performs a Caesarian, but in the latter there is a positive effect. Empirical evidence shows the probability of a Caesarean section increases with the age of the woman, the presence of eclampsy, pre-eclampsy, previous hypertension, previous Caesarean sections, multiple pregnancies and fetopelvic disproportion, and decreases for multiparous women and women in a public hospital. In fact, the probability of having a Caesarean section in a private institution is almost two times higher than in a public hospital (20% as against 39%). Focusing on women without risk factors, we found that the probability a Caesarian in a public hospital was 11%, but the probability in a private hospital was 25%. We conclude that the remuneration system explains an important part of this difference.","[Triunfo, Patricia; Rossi, Maximo] Univ Republica, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Triunfo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay.",patricia@decon.edu.uy; mito@decon.edu.uy,"Rossi, Maximo/H-3692-2019","Rossi, Maximo/0000-0002-4116-922X",,,,,24,12,14,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

To this end, we develop an economic geography model with two types of individuals (workers and retirees) and two sectors (local services and manufacturing). Workers produce and consume; the elderly consume only. As a result, the mobility decision of workers is driven by both the wage gap and the cost-of-living gap, unlike the elderly who react to the differences in the cost of living only. We show that the return of pre-industrial urban system dominated by rentier cities does not seem to be on the agenda. Quite the opposite, the future of large working cities is still bright, the reason being that today's urban costs act as a strong force that prevents a large share of local services and manufacturing firms from following the rentiers in the elderly cities, while the supply of differentiated b2c services impede their complete separation.","[Gaigne, Carl] INRA, UMR1302, F-35011 Rennes, France; [Thisse, Jacques-Francois] CEPR, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Thisse, Jacques-Francois] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium; [Thisse, Jacques-Francois] PSE, Paris, France",Universite de Rennes; INRAE; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Gaigné, C (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR1302, 4 Allee Adolphe Bobierre,CS 61103, F-35011 Rennes, France.",carl.gaigne@rennes.inra.fr; jacques.thisse@uclouvain.be,,"Gaigne, Carl/0000-0002-1540-234X",,,,,21,17,18,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

The factory in the eco-industrial systems is taken as an agent, and the objects, attributes and behaviors are determined. Some important interaction mechanisms between agents are also designed. Besides, the sustainability evolution is also studied through emergy theory. More importantly, a new concept, the Internal-flow emergy, is used to indicate the evolution direction of an eco-industrial system. Finally, a hypothetical eco-industrial park utilizing natural gas and halite as the main raw material inputs is adopted as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of the agent-based modeling.

According to the LeChatelier Principle, regulations that effectively limit substitution possibilities among inputs will reduce firm and industry-wide efficiency. In imperfectly competitive markets, however, government constraints on a strategic variable can facilitate coordination. An advertising restriction, for example, would improve efficiency if it enables firms to produce the same level of sales with less advertising spending. We use data envelopment analysis to estimate the effect of marketing regulations on efficiency in the U.S. cigarette industry. Unlike previous studies, we do not assume that marketing and production technologies are separable. Our results demonstrate that coordination effects dominate LeChatelier effects.

A household survey was conducted with 311 farmers participating in three dairy goat projects (Dairy Goat Association of Kenya (DGAK), Higher Education Links-Egerton University Community Dairy Goats Project (HEL-EUCDGP) and Heifer Project International (HPI)) to assess farmers' willingness to pay for provision of these services. Ranking these services revealed that MS was the most important service in priority order for goat keepers. Farmers with and without experience were willing to pay significantly more for provision of VS. Variables such as satisfaction with project activities, system of production, social benefits, flock size, participation in the projects, farm visits, market linkage and information, and experiences on the services significantly influenced willingness to pay (WTP). The decision to pay or not was not necessarily affected by those not willing to pay because of the inter-linkage probabilities with the ability to pay. Projects should take a broader responsibility of providing these services or link farmers to agents to provide the services. The poor farmers should be supported in a cost-sharing manner to avoid undesirable practises or the services left to those who can afford to pay. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To explain the dynamics of medieval book production, we provide estimates for urbanization rates and for the numbers of universities and monasteries.

For power plant operators, the increasing possibility of water shortages is an important challenge that they have to face. Shortages of electricity due to water shortages could have an influence on industries as well as on private households. Climate change impact analyses must analyse the climate effects on power plants and possible adaptation strategies for the power generation sector. Power plants have lifetimes of several decades. Their water demand changes with climate parameters in the short- and medium-term. In the long-term, the water demand will change as old units are phased out and new generating units appear in their place. In this paper, we describe the integration of functions for the calculation of the water demand of power plants into a water resources management model. Also included are both short-term reactive and long-term planned adaptation. This integration allows us to simulate the interconnection between the water demand of power plants and water resources management, i.e. water availability. Economic evaluation functions for water shortages are also integrated into the water resources management model. This coupled model enables us to analyse scenarios of socio-economic and climate change, as well as the effects of water management actions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This contrasts strikingly with the case of a single pollutant. The results are illustrated by numerical simulations, first for instructive fictitious and second for more realistic parameters mimicking the greenhouse problem. The results add to the skepticism existing about whether the concept of global warming potential is a useful indicator for the optimal relative abatement of different GHGs over time.

These preferences are heterogeneous. Different physicians trade off the monetary and service motives differently, and therefore respond differently to incentive schemes. Our model is set up for the Norwegian health care system. First, each private practice physician has a patient list, which may have more or less patients than he desires. The physician is paid a fee-for-service reimbursement and a capitation per listed patient. Second, a municipality may obligate the physician to perform 7.5 h/week of community services. Our data are on an unbalanced panel of 435 physicians, with 412 physicians for the year 2002, and 400 for 2004. A physician's amount of gross wealth and gross debt in previous periods are used as proxy for preferences for community service. First, for the current period, accumulated wealth and debt are predetermined. Second, wealth and debt capture lifestyle preferences because they correlate with the planned future income and spending. The main results show that both gross debt and gross wealth have negative effects on physicians' supply of community health services. Gross debt and wealth have no effect on fee-for-service income per listed person in the physician's practice, and positive effects on the total income from fee-for-service. The higher income from fee-for-service is due to a longer patient list. Patient shortage has no significant effect on physicians' supply of community services, a positive effect on the fee-for-service income per listed person, and a negative effect on the total income from fee for service.

It is pertinent to consider and quantify the opportunity costs in terms of reduced water quality associated with crop production. This paper investigates the impacts of water quality on virtual water trading by creating a proxy for water quality impacts by calculating the amount of water required to dilute nonpoint-source agrochemical inputs to relevant water quality guideline values. The quantity of water required for dilution of five agrochemicals (two nutrients; nitrogen and phosphorus and three insecticides; azinphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos and endosulfan) was estimated for five crops in South Africa (maize, wheat, sugar cane, citrus and cotton) and compared to consumption of irrigation water (blue water) and rainfall (green water) for the same crops. Results indicate that the volume of water required for dilution is similar to the total sum of green and blue water required for crop production, but significantly greater than blue water use (irrigation use). For all crops phosphorus losses require greater amounts of water for dilution than for nitrogen, while pesticides result in the greatest water quality use. Estimates of water quality use are based on assumptions for a number of input variables (i.e. fertilizer application rates, percentage loss of agrochemicals from cropped areas). A Monte Carlo analysis (5000 iterations) was run to randomly select input variables from within defined ranges. Water quality use was calculated and expressed as a factor of blue water use. For all crops the average factor indicated that the volume of water required for dilution of all agrochemicals was greater than that required for irrigation. The results of this study clearly indicate that the impacts of agriculture on water quality need to be considered in virtual water trading scenarios. The incorporation of a method to predict impacts on water quality provides a comparative tool which generates a more holistic frame of reference for decision making with regard to impacts on the water resource and virtual water trading.

The results show that the Gini coefficient for total fossil resource consumption grew by 24% over the time period. By comparison the Gini coefficient for overall household expenditure rose by only 13%. The increase in resource inequality was prompted by the rising demand by high income quintiles for goods and services such as: fuel and light (heating and lighting the home),car use (private transportation), recreation, travel and other services. The analysis shows further that the Gini coefficient for direct fossil resources (fuel and light and car use) was lower and rose less steeply than the Gini coefficient for fossil resources embodied in other goods and services (indirect fossil resource requirements). Investigation into the drivers behind direct and indirect resource inequalities suggests a number of policy conclusions. Firstly, it is clear that policy initiatives to reduce fossil resource requirements (and the associated climate change impacts) must pay careful attention to distributional differences. Additionally, increased attention needs to be paid to the inequalities associated with indirect fossil resources consumption as well as the more visible direct resource inequalities.

The results show that standard socioeconomic explanatory variables are far inferior to those of social psychology and philosophy, and that these factors offer a better understanding of the motives behind responses to contingent valuation. The implication is that alternative means of measuring an individual's pluralistic values should be taken into account in order to assess the validity and meaning of willingness to pay.

We also develop an R(2)-type measure to summarize the overall explanatory power of the exogenous factors on firm inefficiency. The paper also applies a recently developed model selection procedure to choose among alternative stochastic frontier specifications using data from household maize production in Kenya. The magnitude of estimated partial effects of exogenous household characteristics on inefficiency turns out to be very sensitive to model specification, and the model selection procedure leads to an unambiguous choice of best model. We propose a bootstrapping procedure to evaluate the size and power of the model selection procedure. The empirical application also provides further evidence on how household characteristics influence technical inefficiency in maize production in developing countries.","[Liu, Yanyan] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Myers, Robert] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",The World Bank; Michigan State University,"Liu, YY (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW,MC3-452, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",yliu3@worldbank.org,,,,,,,32,32,41,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was developed and distributed via a convenience sample to consumers in shopping malls in Causeway Bay, Mong Kok and Tsuen Wan. Findings - The study finds that supermarkets outperformed wet markets across all aspects of quality as measured by SERVQUAL-P. Research limitations/implications - Implications suggest that wet market vendors are not providing the level of service quality demanded by their customers. In particular, findings suggest that wet market vendors need to improve the visual attractiveness of their stalls, work on making them took more professional and start using more modem equipment. Practical implications - Wet market vendors in conjunction with government representatives need to develop standards of service quality for wet markets across Hong Kong. This is imperative if the wet market model is to survive in what is a highly competitive food retailing industry. Without action, it appears that the supermarketization of the Hong Kong food retailing industry will continue unabated. Originality/value - This paper adds to a small but growing research stream examining service quality in the food retailing industry in Hong Kong.

We first comment on the relative magnitude Of the usual incidence measures and the harm adjusted measures put forth by us. We have considered structured light work as skill improving and hence beneficial for the children. This gives rise to the incidence of negative harm (or positive net benefit) to some children due to work. Secondly, we study the possible determinants or correlates of such activity and consequent harm among education, income and social status related variables. We find that the parents' level of education plays an important role in reducing harm due to activity by the child; thus establishing the linkage between social and human capital outcomes in the family. The child's own education is also seen as being important in determining this extent.","[Mukherjee, Diganta] ICFAI Business Sch, Kolkata, India; [Das, Saswati] Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata,"Mukherjee, D (通讯作者)，ICFAI Business Sch, Kolkata, India.",digantam@hotmail.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-283-941-1,STAT SCI INTERDISC R,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,241.0,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Mathematics,BMY19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273874600012,0

Configuration uses output of Requirements Engineering (RE) phase to select relevant tables, parameters and set relationship among tables of the ERP database. Here, we prove that a gap exists between the output of RE phase and input of configuration phase. The reason for this gap is that configuration looks at a process from data perspective (data elements, their interactions and interrelationships) whereas RE techniques view a process from an activity flow perspective. To minimize this gap, data perspective should be captured in RE phase. Here, a set of required information for configuration is identified/defined. We propose to use a data modeling technique along with process modeling technique in RE phase to support configuration specific information. Widely used existing data modeling techniques do not capture data specific configuration requirements.

Under these circumstances, the environmental degradation has a direct effect on the stability of populations and might trigger tensions and conflicts; this is the reason for which the concept of environmental security is becoming a subject of analysis and discussions. Such a concept goes beyond the competences of the traditional organisations and institutions which normally deal with environmental issues, and it is now taken into consideration by organisations which have their missions in other fields, like security, politics, economy and sociology.

But the combined effect of these two progressions is more controversial. A reduced heat demand (HD) due to higher energy efficiency in buildings might hamper co-production of electricity and DH. In Sweden, co-produced electricity is normally considered to displace electricity from less efficient European condensing power plants. In this study, a potential HD reduction due to energy efficiency measures in the existing building stock in the Swedish city Linkoping is calculated. The impact of HD reduction on heat and electricity production in the Linkoping DH system is investigated by using the energy system optimisation model MODEST. Energy efficiency measures in buildings reduce seasonal HD variations. Model results show that HD reductions primarily decrease heat-only production. The electricity-to-heat output ratio for the system is increased for HD reductions up to 30%. Local and global CO2 emissions are reduced. If co-produced electricity replaces electricity from coal-fired condensing power plants, a 20% HD reduction is optimal for decreasing global CO2 emissions in the analysed DH system.

This paper develops the modelling capacity for analysing and evaluating such legislation, with a focus on private car energy demand. We populate a baseline car stock and car activity model for Ireland to 2025 using historical car stock data. The model takes account of the lifetime survival profile of different car types, the trends in vehicle activity over the fleet and the fuel price and income elasticities of new car sales and total fleet activity. The impacts of many policy alternatives may only be simulated by such a bottom-up approach, which can aid policy development and evaluation. The level of detail achieved provides specific insights into the technological drivers of energy consumption, thus aiding planning for meeting climate targets. This paper focuses on the methodology and baseline scenario. Baseline results for Ireland forecast a decline in private car energy demand growth (0.2%, compared with 4% in the period 2000-2008), caused by the relative growth in fleet efficiency compared with activity.

In the 1990s the city of Haifa, with a population of approximately 220,000, absorbed about 45,000 immigrants. The case of Haifa offers a typical non-controlled experiment on how demographic shocks and associated changes in housing demand affect the housing market. The dynamic adjustment of house prices is estimated using an autoregressive, distributed lag ADL model, taking into account spatial spillover effects. The data analyzed cover housing transactions in Haifa between January 1989 and June 1999. The data come from a mortgage database. We used a house price index by tract and by year to investigate the impact of immigration on house price dynamics for a balanced panel of 34 tracts and 11 years. Tests showed that for some of the tracts house price series are not unit root. Most individual series though indicated that a unit root could not be rejected so that we considered house price series as being non-stationary. Also, the hypothesis of no co-integration could not be rejected by the data. Due to inertia we considered lagged spatial spillover effects for the dependent variable. We applied the corrected least squares dummy variable estimator to estimate the parameters of interest. The estimates of the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable suggest stability of the ADL structure. Furthermore, the results indicate a house price correction of almost 70% of the gap between house prices and its fundamental determinants each year. Our results suggest a substantially faster response after the demand shock in Haifa than obtained by others for other cities and regions in the literature. Yet our estimates seem not unreasonable given the large-scale land conversion and urban construction programs in Israel and underline the importance of a responsive supply to dampen house price rises after an unanticipated demographic shock.","[van der Vlist, Arno J.; Folmer, Henk] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Econ Geog, Groningen, Netherlands; [van der Vlist, Arno J.] Econ Inst Construct & Housing, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Czamanski, Daniel] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Haifa, Israel",University of Groningen; Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"van der Vlist, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Econ Geog, Groningen, Netherlands.",A.J.van.der.Vlist@rug.nl,"Czamanski, Danny/AAB-7207-2021","Czamanski, Danny/0000-0002-3309-4475; Van der Vlist, Arno/0000-0002-5049-3566",,,,,39,12,14,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

This paper discusses the driving forces influencing China's CO2 emissions based on Path-STIRPAT model-a method combining Path analysis with STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology) model. The analysis shows that GDP per capita (A), industrial structure (IS), population (P), urbanization level (R) and technology level (T) are the main factors influencing China's CO2 emissions, which exert an influence interactively and collaboratively. The sequence of the size of factors' direct influence on China's CO2 emission is A>T>P>R>IS, while that of factors' total influence is A>R>P>T>IS. One percent increase in A, IS, P, R and T leads to 0.44, 1.58, 1.31, 1.12 and -1.09 percentage change in CO2 emission totally, where their direct contribution is 0.45, 0.07, 0.63, 0.08, 0.92, respectively.

This paper focuses on energy intensity (El), which is one of the most important indicators of China. It firstly reviews China's GDP and energy statistics, showing that China has made great improvements in recent years. The means by which El data are released and adjusted are then explained. It shows that El data releases do not provide complete data for calculating El and constant GDP, which may reduce policy transparency and comprehensiveness. This paper then conducts an El calculation method that is based on official sources and that respects the data availability of different data release times. It finds that, in general, China's El statistics can be considered as reliable because most of the results generated by author's calculations match the figures in the official releases. However, two data biases were identified, which may necessitate supplementary information on related constant GDP values used in the official calculation of El data. The paper concludes by proposing short- and long-term measures for improving El statistics to provide a transparent and comprehensive El indicator. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The Kaya identity is used to identify the relationship between drivers and pressures, using annual time series data of National GHG emissions, population, energy consumption and gross domestic product. The analysis shows that over the period 2000-2008, GHG emissions show a slight variation, but they are almost stabilised, with a total increase of 1.6%. Despite the economic growth over that period, this stabilisation may be considered as a combination of reductions in the energy intensity of GDP and the carbon intensity of energy, which are affected by improvements in energy efficiency and introduction of cleaner fuels, such as natural gas and renewables in the energy mixture of the country.

The study is based on a cross-section of 708 commercial property assets. Incorporating a range of potential confounding factors such as unexpired lease term, vacancy rate and tenant credit risk, we use hedonic regression procedures to estimate the effect of EPC rating on rental and capital values. The study finds no evidence of a significant relationship between environmental and/or energy performance and rental and capital values. A small subset of 24 BREEAM-rated assets is also tested for significant price effects but a statistically significant effect is only confirmed for equivalent yields. Similarly, there was no evidence that the EPC rating had any effect on Market Rent or Market Value with only minor effects of EPC ratings on equivalent yields. The preliminary conclusion is that energy labelling is not yet having the effects on Market Values and Market Rents that would be expected if high EPC ratings were associated with substantial cost savings that are fully reflected in capital values and/or were readily available and taken into account by prospective tenants and buyers.

We find that the contrasting conclusions from levels and differenced vector autoregression specifications, documented in the literature, can be explained by a small low-frequency comovement between hours worked and productivity growth that gives rise to a discontinuity in the solution for the structural coefficients identified by long-run restrictions. Whereas the low-frequency comovement is allowed for in the levels specification, it is implicitly set to 0 in the differenced vector autoregression. Consequently, even when the root of hours is very close to 1 and the low-frequency comovement is quite small, removing it can give rise to biases of sufficient size to account for the empirical difference between the two specifications.","[Gospodinov, Nikolay] Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Maynard, Alex] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Pesavento, Elena] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Concordia University - Canada; University of Guelph; Emory University,"Gospodinov, N (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",nikolay.gospodinov@concordia.ca; maynarda@uoguelph.ca; epesave@emory.edu,"Maynard, Alex/T-8253-2019","Maynard, Alex/0000-0002-0596-527X; Pesavento, Elena/0000-0002-6975-2433",FQRSC; SSHRC,FQRSC; SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors thank the Editor (Jonathan Wright), an Associate Editor, two anonymous referees, Michelle Alexopolous, Efrem Castelnuovo, Yongsung Chang, Francesco Furlanetto, Leo Michelis, Barbara Rossi, Shinichi Sakata, seminar participants at University of Padova, University of Cyprus, University of British Columbia, Carleton University, Queens University and Louisiana State University and conference participants at the 2008 Far Eastern Meetings of the Econometric Society, the 2008 Meeting of the Canadian Econometric Study Group, ICEEE 2009, CIREQ Time Series Conference and the 2009 Joint Statistical Meetings for helpful comments and suggestions.

Because of certain limitations in the data, most, but not all, of the refutable implications of the theory are tested using a Bayesian approach. Other limitations in the data mean that the paper is better viewed as an illustration of how one would go about rigorously testing the extended Hotelling theory, rather than as one which presents convincing empirical evidence that supports or refutes it.

Constructing a political economy model in which voters face uncertainty due to the types of politicians and the risk of environmental damage, we show that there is an equilibrium in which a politician uses a weaker environmental policy rather than efficient direct transfers for redistribution. We also show that there is an equilibrium in which a stricter environmental policy can be implemented by a politician who has no incentive to make transfers. Then, we discuss which equilibrium should be more plausible.

This article examines a terrace of 6 similar, passive solar dwellings with sunspaces and the effects that occupants' behaviours have on their energy efficiency. It was found that average annual space heating demand was less than expected, indicating potential benefits from measuring passive solar gains as a form of renewable energy. Space heating demand per person varied by a factor of up to 14 between dwellings dependent on occupant behaviour. Further evidence showed a factor of 45 possible. Significant behaviours in this dwelling type were identified. A second study used 31 personal ecological footprint (PEF) accounts to assess the significance of dwelling energy efficiency in terms of environmental sustainability. A comparison was made between residents of contemporary eco-homes and practising permaculturists occupying a range of traditional house types. It was found that the PEF of the average eco-home dweller was 1.6 times higher than that of the permaculturists. It is argued that improved education for sustainability would be a more efficient way to reduce domestic energy demand than currently recognised. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study developed key indicators for useful-energy demand for end-use sectors such as industry, commerce, and residence. Key indicators for transport sector and non-energy use sectors were developed on transport mobility demand and end-use fuel demand. The main drivers of these key indicators are socio-economic parameters. This work was conducted in a linear programmed (LP) TIMES G5 model on TIMES modeling framework for model horizon of 1990-2100.

The study indicates that while second generation biofuels could significantly contribute to the future energy supply mix, cost is a major barrier to its commercial production in the near to medium term. Depending upon type of biofuels, feedstock prices and conversion costs, the cost of cellulosic ethanol is found to be two to three times higher than the current price of gasoline on an energy equivalent basis. The median cost (across the studies reviewed) of biodiesel produced from microalgae, a prospective feedstock, is seven times higher than the current price of diesel, although much higher cost estimates have been reported. As compared with the case of first generation biofuels, in which feedstock can account for over two-thirds of the total costs, the share of feedstock in the total costs is relatively lower (30-50%) in the case of second generation biofuels. While significant cost reductions are needed for both types of second generation biofuels, the critical barriers are at different steps of the production process. For cellulosic ethanol, the biomass conversion costs needs to be reduced. On the other hand, feedstock cost is the main issue for biodiesel. At present, policy instruments, such as fiscal incentives and consumption mandates have in general not differentiated between the first and second generation biofuels except in the cases of the US and EU. The policy regime should be revised to account for the relative merits of different types of biofuels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, no empirical study seems to have investigated the factors leading to malfunctions in co-operation projects in terms of a low likelihood of co-operation, low rate of success, and failed co-operation. Our paper attempts to fill this gap by investigating the possible presence of two problems in co-operation: the lack of intermediation and of reciprocity. Based on data gathered for firms in two German regions and one French region, we find that the success of co-operation projects depends on the perceived importance, rather than on the perceived quality, of intermediate actors. Hence, the major problem for intermediating suitable partners is more related to communication than it is a programmatic issue. Trust and reciprocity in co-operation between firms is found to be relevant ex-post in the sense of being a main determinant of failed co-operation projects.","[Cantner, Uwe; Wolf, Tina] Univ Jena, Dept Econ, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Cantner, Uwe] Univ So Denmark, Dept Mkt & Management, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Meder, Andreas] Thuringian Minist Econ Affairs & Technol, D-99105 Erfurt, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Southern Denmark,"Cantner, U (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Dept Econ, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",uwe.cantner@uni-jena.de; andreas.meder@tmwta.thueringen.de; tina.wolf@uni-jena.de,"Cantner, Uwe/A-9187-2015","Cantner, Uwe/0000-0002-2067-493X",,,,,31,12,12,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

As the consequence of technological improvements, the first electric vehicles are now being introduced and greater market penetration can be expected. But any wider implementation of battery-powered electrical propulsion systems in the future will give rise to new challenges for both the traditional automotive industry and other new players, e.g. battery manufacturers, the power supply industry and other service providers. Different application cases of electric vehicles are currently being discussed which means that numerous business models could emerge, leading to new shares in value creation and involving new players. Consequently, individual stakeholders are uncertain about which business models are really effective with regard to targeting a profitable overall concept. Therefore, this paper aims to define a holistic approach to developing business models for electric mobility, which analyzes the system as a whole on the one hand and provides decision support for affected enterprises on the other. To do so, the basic elements of electric mobility are considered and topical approaches to business models for various stakeholders are discussed.

While public support for such measures is high on an abstract level, the situation in the local context is often very different. Here, the impact of renewable energy might cause resistance. Empirical research shows that a community ownership model can have a positive effect on local acceptance. Our study explores whether such an effect can also be demonstrated in a community co-ownership model. The question is relevant since larger projects exceed the financial possibilities of most communities, leaving them with only co-ownership as an option. The research design is based on a comparative case study, utilizing a questionnaire-based survey. The results of the survey clearly show that a significant difference in local acceptance exists between the two cases. The residents of Zschadrass, where a community co-ownership model exists, are consistently more positive towards local renewable energy and also towards renewable energy in general. The results provide evidence that the co-ownership model is a means to reconcile local acceptance with an increased use of renewable energy in Germany. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Alternative fuels and technologies have been promoted as a means for reducing the carbon intensity of the transport sector. However, the overall transport policy framework in major world economies is geared towards the use of conventional fossil fuels. This paper evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of current climate policies for road transport that (1) target fuel producers and/or car manufacturers, and (2) influence use of alternative fuels and technologies. With diversifying fuel supply chains, carbon intensity of fuels and energy efficiency of vehicles cannot be regulated by a single instrument. We demonstrate that vehicles are best regulated across all fuels in terms of energy per distance. We conclude that price-based policies and a cap on total emissions are essential for alleviating rebound effects and perverse incentives of fuel efficiency standards and low carbon fuel standards. In tandem with existing policy tools, cap and price signal policies incentivize all emissions reduction options. Design and effects of cap and trade in the transport sector are investigated in the companion article (Flachsland et al., in this issue). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we examine whether RE can provide anywhere near the levels of primary energy forecast by various official organisations in a business-as-usual world. We find that the energy costs of energy will rise in a non-linear manner as total annual primary RE output increases. In addition, increasing levels of RE will lead to increasing levels of ecosystem maintenance energy costs per unit of primary energy output. The result is that there is an optimum level of primary energy output, in the sense that the sustainable level of energy available to the economy is maximised at that level. We further argue that this optimum occurs at levels well below the energy consumption forecasts for a few decades hence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis shows that the networks were strategically set up to support the creation of a variety of elements including public R&D programs, modules for vocational training, technical guidelines, standardized components, or a positive image of the technology. These elements have been reported to generate positive externalities in the field, e.g. as they help to establish user-supplier linkages in the emerging value chain. We conclude that, from a firm perspective such elements may represent strategically relevant resources made available at the innovation system level. This view opens up a link to the literature of strategic management, thus highlighting the importance of strategic action and cooperation in emerging technological fields. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

There are several possible drivers for this dash for coal, but it is widely accepted that windfall profits gained through free allocation of ETS certificates play an important role. Yet the quantification of allocation-related investment distortions has been limited to back-of-the envelope calculations and stylized models so far. We close this gap with a numerical model integrating both Germany's particular allocation rules and its specific power generation structure. We find that technology specific new entrant provisions have substantially increased incentives to invest in hard coal plants red to natural gas at the time of the ETS onset. More precisely, disproportionate windfall profits compared more than half the total capital costs of a hard coal plant. Moreover, shorter periods of free allocations would not have turned investors' favours towards the cleaner natural gas technology because of pre-existing economic advantages for coal. In contrast, full auctioning of permits or a single best available technology benchmark would have made natural gas the predominant technology of choice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results are used to determine the most proper model specification, to detect the important criteria affecting the efficiency levels, and to find the common characteristics of the most inefficient firms. We find that public firms compared to private firms, non-tender firms compared to tender firms, large firms compared to small firms and firms operating in more developed areas compared to firms operating in underdeveloped areas that utilize resources and manage costs more efficiently. However, we cannot reach a certain conclusion about the comparison of old firms versus the new firms. Lastly, we try to detect the common characteristics of the most inefficient firms and find that most of these firms are immature and low scale companies. Therefore, we think these firms can increase efficiency level either by increasing their delivery amounts through higher penetration rates or by merging or doing both together. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The test is based on the suggestion of Narayan and Narayan (2010). Various panel data unit root and co-integration tests are applied. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and GDP series are integrated of order one and co-integrated, especially after controlling for cross-sectional dependence. Additionally, the Blundell-Bond system generalised methods of moments (GMM) is employed to conduct a panel causality test in a vector error-correction mechanism (VECM) setting. Unidirectional causality running from real per capita GDP to per capita CO2 emissions is uncovered in both the short-run and the long-run. The empirical analysis based on individual countries provides evidence of an EKC for Greece, Malta, Oman, Portugal and the United Kingdom. However, it can be observed that for the whole panel, a 1% increase in GDP generates an increase of 0.68% in CO2 emissions in the short-run and 0.22% in the long-run. The lower long-run income elasticity does not provide evidence of an EKC, but does indicate that, over time, CO2 emissions are stabilising in the rich countries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Since consumer subsidy for the consumption of anthracites briquette in low-income households caused a distortion in domestic coal market, the so-called coupon program will be the first target in energy reform policy in order to induce fuel switching from anthracites to alternative clean energy. This paper tries to identify various factors that influence households' fuel switching decision. Disutility from briquette consumption is also considered as an important factor. Using the 2007 census data on briquette-consuming households, it is found that the coupon program provides an adverse effect to switching fuels to clean energy while the disutility of briquettes is positively associated with the probability of fuel switching. However, the empirical finding suggests that the policy alone attempting to remove coupon program may fail to switch fuels unless the cost of boiler changes is substantially reduced through the provision of accessible networks to alternative energy sources. It indicates that reform policy for consumer subsidy must be understood in line with more comprehensive regional energy plans to resolve energy poverty issue. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The variety of these scenarios is manifold, as they are generated by different institutions using different methodological approaches and different framework assumptions. However, these scenarios can roughly be classified into three main groups: moderate, climate protection and resource scarcity and high fossil fuel prices. Analysing the German energy market makes a fourth scenario group necessary, which considers the possible revision of the decided nuclear energy phase out. Most of the existing scenarios developed by different institutions can be allocated into one of these groups. A representative scenario for each group has been selected to illustrate the development of the energy sector until 2030. Contrary to the worldwide primary energy demand (PED), the German PED decreases in each scenario, even though the drop differs strongly throughout the scenarios. On the other hand the structure of the PED in 2030 varies strongly for each scenario, especially regarding the share of fossil energy sources. However, a common robust result can be observed throughout all scenarios, namely the high increase in the share of the renewable energy resources, although the scenario generation processes are not always robust.

However, meaningful development there, especially in solar-rich Arizona, has been slow. This article addresses why this is so by concentrating on one critical contributor to success-workforce development. To identify shortcomings and needed changes, we used a survey of the significant solar firms operating in Arizona to ask three questions: Does a gap exist between existing and desired levels of solar engineering education and training? What skills should new graduates possess when entering the solar energy workforce? What course of study is considered important in the education of solar energy employees? We found that a stronger solar economy in Arizona will not depend, at least initially, on advanced graduate training in engineering, but on a broad-based Bachelor's level degree program that complements engineering studies with a strong emphasis on verbal and written communication, as well as business and teaming abilities. Non-technical skills and project management are at least as valuable as solar training. Given the high public awareness of Arizona's solar resource, a stronger solar future there should help stimulate similar progress elsewhere, both in the U.S. and abroad. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a vertically integrated multi-input, multi-output market model with two channels of price transmission: a direct biofuel channel and an indirect input channel. We test the theoretical hypothesis by applying time-series analytical mechanisms to nine major traded agricultural commodity prices, including corn, wheat, rice, sugar, soybeans, cotton, banana, sorghum and tea, along with one weighted average world crude oil price. The data consists of 783 weekly observations extending from January 1994 to December 2008. The empirical findings confirm the theoretical hypothesis that the prices for crude oil and agricultural commodities are interdependent including also commodities not directly used in bioenergy production: an increase in oil price by 1$/barrel increases the agricultural commodity prices between 0.10$/tonne and 1.80$/tonne. Contrary to the theoretical predictions, the indirect input channel of price transmission is found to be small and statistically insignificant. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It can be chosen as the main source of power generation in some countries or complement the energy matrix in others. In this context, there is the need to develop new technologies for the management of radioactive waste generated by the production process. Final repositories for spent fuel are not yet in commercial operation, and techniques for fuel reprocessing have been developed, because after use, the fuel still has materials that produce energy. Some countries already use reprocessing, and develop research to make it more secure and more competitive, while others prefer to adopt policies to prevent developments in this area due to the problem of nuclear proliferation. In another line of research, new reactors are being developed in order to reduce the amount of waste in energy production and some will be designed to work in closed loop, recycling the materials generated.

Because woody biomass can produce alternative transportation fuels, low-carbon electricity, and numerous other green products in addition to traditional paper and lumber commodities, the future use of forest resources is highly uncertain. Using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), this paper assesses the future of the forest products industry under three possible U.S policy scenarios: (1) a national renewable electricity standard, (2) a national policy of carbon constraints, and (3) incentives for industrial energy efficiency. In addition, we discuss how these policy scenarios might interface with the recently strengthened U S renewable fuels standards. The principal focus is on how forest products including residues might be utilized under different policy scenarios, and what such market shifts might mean for electricity and biomass prices, as well as energy consumption and carbon emissions The results underscore the value of incentivizing energy efficiency in a portfolio of energy and climate policies in order to moderate electricity and biomass price escalation while strengthening energy security and reducing CO2 emissions.

A specified single set of MEPS (minimum energy performance standards) for refrigerators, freezers and freezer refrigerators was implemented without evaluating its impacts and estimation of potential electricity savings. This paper presents a methodology for assessing the impacts of the Brazilian MEPS for cold appliances. It uses a bottom-up approach to estimate residential end-use consumption and to evaluate the energy saving potential for refrigerators. The household electricity consumption is projected by modeling appliance ownership using an econometric approach based on the recent household survey data. A cost-benefit analysis for more stringent standards is presented from the perspective of the society and electricity customers. The results showed that even considering the current market conditions (high discount rate for financing new efficient equipment) some MEPS options are advantageous for customers. The analysis also demonstrates significant cost-effective saving potential from the society perspective that could reach 21 TWh throughout the period of 2010-2030-about 25% of current residential consumption.

To attract investment in the power generating industry. China introduced non-state-owned power plants to the original system of a highly vertically integrated power industry with annual power generation quota guarantees, which makes the traditional economic dispatch principle not applicable. The newly debuted energy saving power dispatch (ESPD) is an attempt to fully exploit the maximum energy savings and was implemented by an administrative code. Starting in August 2007, the pilot operation of the ESPD was implemented in five provinces, but after two years, it is still not widely applied all over the country. This paper details the transition of China's power dispatch principle with particular attention to its origin and content. Moreover, the factors that influence the ESPD's actual energy saving effect are discussed, as well as the sustainability of the policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The most recently developed panel unit root, a heterogeneous panel cointegration and panel-based error correction model, is applied within a multivariate framework. The empirical results confirm a positive, long-run cointegrated relationship between output and energy consumption when heterogeneous state effects are taken into account. We also found a long-run, bi-directional relationship between energy consumption and output growth in the Indian cement industry for the study period, implying that an increase in energy consumption directly affects the growth of this sector and that growth stimulates further energy consumption. These empirical findings imply that energy consumption and output are jointly determined and affect each other. The empirical evidence also suggests the implementation of energy conservation policies oriented toward improving energy-use efficiency to avoid any negative impacts of the conservation policies on the growth of this industry.

Four different PHEV integration strategies, with different impacts on the total electric load profile, have been investigated. The study shows that PHEVs can reduce the CO2-emissions from the power system if actively integrated, whereas a passive approach to PHEV integration (i.e. letting people charge the car at will) is likely to result in an increase in emissions compared to a power system without PHEV load. The reduction in emissions under active PHEV integration strategies is due to a reduction in emissions related to thermal plant start-ups and part load operation. Emissions of the power sector are reduced with up to 4.7% compared to a system without PHEVs, according to the simulations. Allocating this emission reduction to the PHEV electricity consumption only, and assuming that the vehicles in electric mode is about 3 times as energy efficient as standard gasoline operation, total emissions from PHEVs would be less than half the emissions of a standard car, when running in electric mode.

Secondly, the effect of distributing VLS-PV plants among 8 Negev locations, for which hourly metrological data exist, is studied. Thirdly, in addition to studying the effect of VLS-PV on grid penetration, the present paper studies its effect on grid ramping requirements. The principal results are as follows: (i) sun-tracking improves grid matching at high but not low levels of grid flexibility; (ii) geographical distribution has little effect on grid penetration; (iii) VLS-PV significantly increases grid ramping requirements, particularly for CPV systems, but not beyond existing ramping capabilities; (iv) geographical distribution considerably ameliorates this effect.

An emission factor approach is used in this paper to study the emission of uncontrolled air pollutants from all the existing and proposed thermal plants in the country. Calculations are performed to study the distribution of carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO(x)), particulate matters (PM), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The estimated emissions ranges are 978-24,607, 1635-41,148, 37-924, 19-472, and 11-286 ton/annum for CO, NO(X), PM, SO(2), and VOCs, respectively. The present locations of these plants across the country are characterized by skewed emission distribution both per capita and across the land. Given the potential environmental and health impacts of these emissions, several measures are suggested to reduce future impacts and assist the country in achieving sustainable development.

Financial viability is scrutinised investigating optimal logistic pre-conditions such as catchment area or plant size. Given that a breakthrough in deployment does not only depend on technical aspects, the relative importance and magnitude of the necessary incentives is discussed. The influence of policy instruments is studied by devising different incentive scenarios for the United Kingdom.

Increasing the efficiency of energy usage and/or developing lower carbon or non-carbon energies to replace high carbon fuels may bring the result of the reduction of the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. The other alternative to reduce CO2 concentrations in atmosphere include gaseous storage in various deep geological formations, liquid storage in the ocean, and solid storage by reaction of CO2 with metal oxides to produce stable carbonates.

The purpose of this paper is to highlight some sector management concerns to a sustainable energy future in the country. The paper follows a deductive approach and reviews the present status and possible future energy outlooks from the existing literature. This is followed by a strategy outline to achieve long-term energy sustainability. Management challenges on the way to such a sustainable future are finally presented. The paper finds that the aspiration of becoming an economic powerhouse and the need to eradicate poverty will necessarily mean an increase in energy consumption unless a decoupling of energy and GDP growth is achieved. Consequently, the energy future of the country is eminently unsustainable. A strategy focussing on demand reduction, enhanced access, use of local resources and better management practices is proposed here. However, a sustainable path faces a number of challenges from the management and policy perspectives. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrating this allowance price into the price of electricity earns a rent for companies who have received these allowances for free. During Phase I. 2005-2007, rents corresponding to the aggregate value of allocated allowances amounted to roughly E 13 billion per year. However, due to the specific price-setting mechanism in electricity markets true rents were considerably higher. This is due to the fact that companies also that have not received any allowances gain additional infra-marginal rents to the extent that their variable costs are below the new market price after inclusion of the allowance price. Producers with low carbon emissions and low marginal costs thus also benefit substantially from carbon pricing. This paper develops a methodology to determine the specific interaction of the imposition of such a CO2 constraint and the price-setting mechanism in the electricity sector under the assumption of marginal cost pricing in a liberalized European electricity market.. The article thus provides an empirical estimate of the true total rents of power producers during Phase I of the EU-ETS (2005-2007). The EU ETS generated in Phase I additional rents in excess of E 19 billion per year for electricity producers. These transfers are distributed very unevenly between different electricity producers. In a second step, the paper assesses the impact of switching from free allocation to an auctioning of allowances in 2013. We show that such a switch to auctioning will continue to create additional infra-marginal rents for certain producers and will leave the electricity sector as a whole better off than before the introduction of the EU ETS.

The current tariff regulation in the Dutch electricity industry, with its ex post evaluation of the efficiency of investments, average benchmarking and a frontier shift in the x-factor, delays these investments. In the unbundled electricity industry, the investments in the network need to be coordinated with those in the distributed generation of electricity to enable the system operators to build enough network capacity. The current Dutch regulations do not provide for a sufficient information exchange between the generators and the system operators to coordinate the investments. This paper analyses these two effects of the Dutch regulations, and suggests improvements to the regulation of the network connection and transportation tariffs to allow for sufficient network capacity and coordination between the investments in the network and in the generation of electricity. These improvements include locally differentiated tariffs that increase with an increasing concentration of distributed generation. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Two types of talent are examined: human capital in terms of the educational attainment and the creative class in terms of the occupational skill. Explanatory variables of the talent distribution cover both market factors (jobs and wage levels) and non-market factors (amenities, openness and the university). The results of correlation analysis and multivariate analysis show that the university is the single most important factor that affects the talent distribution in China. Wage levels, service amenities and openness also contribute to talent attraction but to different extents. Furthermore, human capital outweighing the creative class exhibits positive effects on innovation, entrepreneurship and regional economic performance. Openness presents a direct influence not only on talent stock, but on innovation and regional economic performance as well.

The study is based on results from a 1.72 kWp PV system installed on a flat rooftop in Dublin, Ireland. During its first year of operation a total of 885.1 kWh/kWp of electricity was generated with a performance ratio of 81.5%. The scenarios employed in this study consider: a range of capital costs; cost dynamics based on a PV module learning rate of 20 +/- 5%; projections for global annual installed PV capacity under an advanced and moderate market growth conditions; domestic electricity cost growth of 4.5% based on historic data; and a reduction of 25% or 50% in the CO2 intensity of national electricity production by 2055. These scenarios are used to predict when system life cycle production costs fall to grid prices (grid parity). Average NPV and electricity generation costs ranged from -(sic)14,330 and 0.58 (sic)/kWh and were close to zero and 0.18 (sic)/kWh for a system installed in 2009 and 2030, respectively. However, under optimistic conditions NPVs are positive for systems installed after 2021 and grid parity occurs in 2016. Findings are compared with similar international studies.

Subjects from 34 in-depth focus groups in central Indiana were fairly knowledgeable about biofuels technologies, but uninformed about biofuels policies despite being from a state where biofuels are a salient political issue. A narrow majority was supportive of biofuels in general, but expressed greater enthusiasm about second generation biofuels. Subject beliefs about biofuels' economic and environmental impacts were most important in shaping these opinions, rather than concerns about energy independence or other issues. In terms of policy options, subjects were most supportive of an alternative fuels standard and least supportive of a fixed subsidy and a cap and trade policy. In contrast to arguments about technologies, participants primarily framed their attitudes toward policies in terms of fairness. Although discussion did not substantially change aggregate preferences for most policies, it did increase support significantly for at least one policy proposal-a variable subsidy for ethanol. It is particularly noteworthy that subjects generally did not support the most common biofuel technology-corn-based ethanol or the most prominent biofuels policy option-the fixed subsidy-despite residing in a state hosting a strong corn industry and staunch political advocates for both positions.

It has been argued that such load-based regulation would solve emissions leakage, cost consumers less, and provide more incentive for energy efficiency than traditional source-based cap-and-trade programs. Because pure load-based trading complicates spot power markets, variants (GEAC and CO2RC) that separate emissions attributes from energy have been proposed. When all generators and consumers come under such a system, these load-based programs are equivalent to source-based trading in which emissions allowances are allocated by various rules, and have no necessary cost advantage. The GEAC and CO2RC systems are equivalent to giving allowances free to generators, and requiring consumers either to subsidize generation or buy back excess allowances, respectively. As avoided energy costs under source-based and pure load-based trading are equal, the latter provides no additional incentive for energy efficiency. The speculative benefits of load-based systems are unjustified in light of their additional administrative complexity and cost, the threat that they pose to the competitiveness and efficiency of electricity spot markets, and the complications that would arise when transition to a federal cap-and-trade system occurs.

We match refinery units to wholesale city-terminal gasoline markets, and then estimate pooled cross-section time-series regressions to quantify the impact of petroleum industry consolidation on wholesale gasoline prices at city-specific terminals. The results of the empirical analysis of mergers are mixed, showing that some petroleum industry mergers resulted in statistically significant increases in refined product prices; others resulted in statistically significant declines and still others had no statistical impact at all.

As such, the government has introduced ambitious targets for increasing renewable generating capacity within the country. Wind turbines are expected to play a significant role in meeting these targets; however, despite high levels of support for the technology in principle, specific projects are often delayed or rejected on account of local opposition. This study aimed to establish how attitudes towards development might vary with respect to increasing distance from the identified sites. Participants were required to register their opinion towards development at a number of on- and off-shore locations in the UK. The results indicated that participants were most favourable to offshore development and least favourable to development at the identified sites. Attitudes to onshore development indicated that so long as a proposed location was anticipated to be 'out of sight' it was considered in relatively general terms. The results are discussed with reference to site visibility and landscape concerns and clearly support calls for a shift towards community-focussed development strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of this study reveal current average external costs for the production of 1 I of ethanol ranged from $0.07 for forest residue to $0.57 for ethanol production from corn. Among the various feedstocks, the external costs of PM10, NOx, and PM2.5 are among the greatest contributors to these costs. The combustion of fossil fuels in upstream fertilizer and energy production processes is the primary source of these emissions and their costs, especially for corn ethanol. The combined costs of emissions associated with the production and use of nitrogen fertilizer also contribute substantially to the net external costs. For cellulosic ethanol production, the combustion of waste lignin to generate heat and power helps to keep the external costs lower than corn ethanol. Credits both for the biogenic carbon combustion and displacement of grid electricity by exporting excess electricity substantially negate many of the emissions and external costs. External costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions were not significant. However, adding estimates of indirect GHG emissions from land use changes would nearly double corn ethanol cost estimates. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The plan includes specific goals to (a) create an enabling policy framework for the deployment of 20,000 MW of solar power by 2022: (b) create favourable conditions for solar manufacturing capability, particularly solar thermal for indigenous production and market leadership; (c) promote programmes for off grid applications, reaching 1000 MW by 2017 and 2000 MW by 2022, (d) achieve 15 million m(2) solar thermal collector area by 2017 and 20 million by 2022, and (e) deploy 20 million solar lighting systems for rural areas by 2022. The installed capacity of grid interactive solar power projects were 6 MW until October 2009 that is far below from their respective potential. In this study, a preliminary attempt towards the technical and economic assessment of concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies in India has been made. To analyze the techno-economic feasibility of CSP technologies in Indian conditions two projects namely PS-10 (based on power tower technology) and ANDASOL-1 (based on parabolic trough collector technology) have been taken as reference cases for this study. These two systems have been simulated at several Indian locations. The preliminary results indicate that the use of CSP technologies in India make financial sense for the north-western part of the country (particularly in Rajasthan and Gujarat states). Moreover, internalization of secondary benefits of carbon trading under clean development mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol further improves the financial feasibility of CSP systems at other locations considered in this study. It may be noted that the locations blessed with annual direct solar radiation more than 1800 kWh/m(2) are best recommended for installation of CSP systems. The results obtained can be used as preliminary indicators for identifying niche areas for immediate/short-term utilization of solar energy for concentrating solar power generation in India.

However, one critical issue in promoting coal utilization is controlling environmental pollution. Clean coal technologies are needed to utilize coal in an environmentally acceptable way and to improve coal utilization efficiency. This paper describes coal's role in China's energy system and the environmental issues related to coal use. Coal is responsible for 90% of the SO(2) emissions, 70% of the dust emissions, 67% of the NO(x) emissions, and 70% of the CO(2) emissions. But as the most abundant energy resource, it will continue to be the dominant energy supply for a long time. Therefore, the development and deployment of clean coal technologies are crucial to promote sustainable development in China. Clean coal technologies currently being developed in China are described including high efficiency combustion and advanced power generation technologies, coal transformation technologies, IGCC (integrated gasification combined cycle) and carbon capture and storage (CCS). Although China only recently began developing clean coal technologies, there have been many successes. Most recent orders of coal-fired power plants are units larger than 600 MW and new orders for supercritical and ultra supercritical systems are increasing rapidly. Many national research programs, industrial research programs and international collaboration projects have been launched to develop on IGCC and CCS systems in China. Finally, suggestions are given on how to further promote clean coal technologies in China. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

There is evidence, however, that human willingness to pay (WTP) for conservation declines with distance a phenomenon we call spatial value decay. This paper begins a new strand of the conservation planning literature that takes demand-side factors - location of people in the landscape, the degree to which WTP for conservation depends on proximity - into account. We use theoretical models of linear abstract landscapes to explore the impact of demand-side factors on two facets of conservation choices: siting of a single reserve when conservation potential is greatest near a critical site, and siting of multiple reserves when fragmentation reduces physical conservation services produced. Our results show how planners should sometimes employ increased fragmentation to capture value when people's preferences are not very highly localized, and how optimal policy balances proximity to the ecologically critical site with proximity to people. In some scenarios, the payoff to using a reserve design approach that considers demand-side factors is large, but we find that spatial value decay reduces the benefits that can be gained from any conservation-planning approach.

It evaluates the main mitigation measures, the quantities of this gas avoided and the respective abatement costs. In relation to a benchmark scenario projected for 2030, the reduction of CO2 emissions estimated here can reach 43%, by adopting energy-efficiency measures, materials recycling and cogeneration, shifting from fossil fuels to renewables or less polluting energy sources and eliminating the use of biomass from deforestation. The set of measures studied here would bring emissions reductions of nearly 1.5 billion tCO(2) over a period of 20 years (2010-2030). This would require huge investments, but the majority of them would have significant economic return and negative abatement costs. However, in many cases there would be low economic attractiveness and higher abatement costs, thus requiring more effective incentives. Brazil is already carrying out various actions toward the mitigation measures proposed here, but there are still substantial barriers to realize this potential. Therefore, a collective effort from both the public and private sectors is needed for the country to achieve this low-carbon scenario. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Diversion of the river resulted in loss of water sports (for high-income groups both local and remote), loss of historical monuments (for remote high-income groups) and recreation losses (for local poor). Removal of forest cover leads to loss of non-timber products (for local poor) and carbon storage (for remote high- and low-income groups). Loss of home garden productivity was borne by local poor groups. Benefit of the project, generation of 145 GWh annually, was a gain for the grid connected groups. The impacts were valued using various valuation methods. The base case of the cost benefit analysis resulted in NPV of US$ 11,335,730. When distributional weights are applied for different income groups, both the sign and magnitude of net benefits change. In order to be viable, the project needs diversion of at least 9% of generated electricity to the poorest households in the country.

To what extent does such expansion of government expenditure influence energy intensity? This question has not been well answered by the previous research. Using provincial panel data, this paper provides some evidence of a link between government expenditure and energy intensity in China. The empirical results demonstrate that the expansion of government expenditure since Asian financial crisis has exerted a significant influence on energy intensity. An increase in government expenditure in China leads to an increase in energy intensity. Further analysis compares such relationships in different economic situations. The comparison shows that such positive effect of government expenditure remains significant after the alteration in economic situation. Therefore, the results suggest introducing some measures to consolidate China's existing gains in energy efficiency. The analysis also explains why the downward trend in energy intensity is reversed in China since 2002. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It highlights the transmission channels through which the rise in oil prices affects the domestic economy. The simulation results suggest that the shock would have positive aggregate impacts, but would also spur the reallocation of resources and would therefore induce disparities in sectoral adjustments. The suggested contraction in some industries could not however be attributed to a pure Dutch disease phenomenon because of, among other factors, the cost-push effect induced by the increase in oil prices.

In order to limit public expenditures, payment recipients are required to choose low-cost dwellings, with the consequence that they probably occupy flats with a poor thermal performance. Recipients might therefore exhibit a lower per-square meter rent but in turn are likely to have a higher energy consumption and energy expenditures. Using a large data set of German households, this paper demonstrates that this financially counteracting effect is of negligible magnitude. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The juice can be pressed from the stalks, and the sugars either directly fermented or evaporated to make syrup, which can be fermented after storage. The plant residue remaining can be burned to run the factory or cogenerate electricity, or used as feedstock for cellulosic ethanol. It can also be used as animal feed. Sweet sorghum has wide environmental adaptation, rapid growth, high productivity, relative tolerance to marginal growing conditions, and high concentrations of the easily fermentable sugars sucrose, glucose, and fructose. The sugars in sweet sorghum start to deteriorate once the stalk is harvested. Leaves and leaf sheaths are difficult to remove from the stalk. They add microorganisms, organic acids, and starch to the juice. Microorganisms deteriorate the sugars, organic acids react with the sugars when the juice is heated, and starch thickens or gels when the syrup cools after boiling.

A 2006 USDA study calculated the yield of ethanol from the sucrose in a sugar beet was 103.5 L per tonne of root (wet weight). Life cycle analysis (LCA) indicates that bioethanol from sugar beet reduces green house gases as well or better than maize. Both nitrogen and water use efficiency may be superior to maize on average. However, sugar beet with an area of 465,000 ha in 2009, compared with about 32 million ha of maize, likely will not displace maize as the primary feedstock for bioethanol in the U.S. More likely, co-products like pulp and molasses will find use as bioenergy feedstocks, probably for high value specialty fuels or as feedstocks for a whole generation of petroleum plastic substitutes.","[Panella, Lee] USDA ARS, Sugarbeet Res Unit, Crops Res Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Panella, L (通讯作者)，USDA ARS, Sugarbeet Res Unit, Crops Res Lab, 1701 Ctr Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",Lee.panella@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,,53,16,22,0,12,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0097-6156,1947-5918,978-0-8412-2598-5,ACS SYM SER,ACS Symp.

For nuclear energy, GHG emissions result from different process stages of the whole fuel cycle. A life-cycle assessment offers the possibility to properly calculate these emissions. In the past, both indirect energy use and GHG emissions were studied by many researchers. Most of the studies result in low indirect emissions comparable to wind turbines. However, some of the studies in the literature obtain high results adding up to a significant fraction of the direct emissions from a CCGT. In this paper, the GHG emissions resulting from the overall nuclear fuel cycle are analyzed by making a detailed comparison of the results from three different life-cycle assessments. Hereby, the studies are chosen in order to reflect the range of results available in open literature. The studies under consideration result in indirect emissions of around 8 and 58g CO2/kWh(e) and more than 110g CO2/kWh(e). An explanation is given for these strongly varying results by analyzing the input data, assumptions and estimations made for different process steps. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

One major element of the EU's external energy policy is the export of EU energy norms and regulations to neighbourhood countries and beyond. A core legal instrument the EU uses in this context is the Energy Community Treaty (ECT). The ECT goes both geographically and regarding its depth significantly beyond neighbourhood or association policies, addressing potentially also countries in the 'far neighbourhood' and aiming at the creation of a Single Market for energy with these countries. While, however, EU candidate countries are obliged to adopt the acquis before accessing the EU and therefore comply to EU rules already before they enter the Club, I argue that countries with no or only a vague membership perspective - i.e. countries where the EU cannot apply the conditionality approach (e.g., ENP countries)-aim at deeper integration with the EU because they are either eager to demonstrate their capability and potential to become part of the Club, they seek greater independence from a regional hegemon or they envisage significant economic gains as common norms, rules and standards are likely to increase economic exchange with the EU.

In 2006, Norway had a 21% share of EU gas imports. The Norwegian government has communicated that Norwegian gas production will increase by 25-40% from today's level of about 99 billion cubic meters (bcm)/year. This article shows that only a 20-25% growth of Norwegian gas production is possible due to production from currently existing recoverable reserves and contingent resources. A high and a low production forecast for Norwegian gas production is presented. Norwegian gas production exported by pipeline peaks between 2015 and 2016, with minimum peak production in 2015 at 118 bcm/year and maximum peak production at 127 bcm/year in 2016. By 2030 the pipeline export levels are 94-78 bcm. Total Norwegian gas production peaks between 2015 and 2020, with peak production at 124-135bcm/year. By 2030 the production is 96-115bcm/year. The results show that there is a limited potential for increased gas exports from Norway to the EU and that Norwegian gas production is declining by 2030 in all scenarios.

It uses a dynamic setting, where the regulator observes the arrival and initial use of the technology and determines the optimal ex post amount of emissions before firms start to adopt the technology. In the model here, the adoption benefits and costs depend on the number of firms that are already using the technology. Thus, each firm decides the optimal date to adopt the technology, considering its benefits and costs, as well as the advantage they will gain over their rivals, producing a sequence of adoption that is diffused into the industry over time. With this framework. the study shows that when the output demand is elastic, auctioned permits induce an earlier diffusion than taxes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, a better understanding of urban energy uses is necessary for Chinese decision-makers at various levels to address energy security, climate change mitigation, and local pollution abatement. Therefore, this paper addresses three key questions: What is the urban contribution to China's energy usage and CO2 emissions? What is the contribution of large cities, and what alternate energy-economy pathways are they following? How have energy uses and CO2 emissions transformed in the last two decades in key Chinese cities? This three-tier analysis illustrates the changes in urban energy uses and CO2 emissions in China. The results show that the urban contributions make up 84% of China's commercial energy usage. The 35 largest cities in China, which contain 18% of the population. contribute 40% of China's energy uses and CO2 emissions. In four provincial cities, the per capita energy usage and CO2 emissions have increased several-fold. Rapid progress was made in reducing the carbon intensity of economic activities in cities throughout the 1990s, but alarmingly, such progress has either slowed down or been reversed in the last few years. These results have important policy implications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper points towards this relevance, using the example of a longitudinal study of public objections to a 21.5 MWe bioenergy gasifier proposed for Winkleigh in Devon, England. Local opinion surveys in 2004 and 2007 showed that public opposition to the proposed gasifier remained strong but also revealed some statistically significant change and correlations of wider interest. In the context of the environmental psychology literature, the dominant model of contextualised values, intention and behaviour, as well as other psychological approaches, are found to be helpful, both for making sense of the results and for informing a psychological research agenda on public objection to new energy infrastructure.

However, pressure is mounting globally for international aviation to be included in post-Kyoto arrangements. In the absence of international collective action, a number of so-called carbon offsetting schemes have emerged that allow individual travellers and companies to compensate for their international air travel emissions. These schemes offer technological solutions, such as planting sink forests to sequester emissions. To consider the implications of future collective action, this paper presents a case study assessment of the physical feasibility of five schemes for all short duration journeys to and from New Zealand. This is the first comprehensive national-level case study assessment of competing offsetting options for international aviation emissions in the peer-reviewed literature. The CO(2)-e emissions produced by the air travel of international visitors to New Zealand, and for New Zealand residents travelling overseas, is calculated in this paper to be 7893 and 3948 Gg, respectively, in 2005. It is then shown that no single offsetting scheme targeted inside the country appears physically and/or politically realistic. This indicates the sheer size of these emissions, and the challenge that the international community faces for collective action on this matter. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have generally used input-output DEA models for benchmarking and evaluation of electricity distribution units. However, this study proposes an integrated flexible approach to measure the rank and choose the best version of the DEA method for optimization and policy making purposes. It covers both static and dynamic aspects of information environment due to involvement of SFA which is finally compared with the best DEA model through the Spearman correlation technique. The integrated approach would yield in improved ranking and optimization of electricity distribution systems. To illustrate the usability and reliability of the proposed algorithm, 38 electricity distribution units in Iran have been considered, ranked and optimized by the proposed algorithm of this study.

This is achieved by introducing geographical mobility into a labour market matching model. Jobseekers and vacancies are unevenly distributed across space. Therefore, both the probability that a jobseeker will find a job and the probability that a vacancy is filled during a period vary across locations. Moreover, these differences are followed by spatial differences in both the duration of unemployment and vacancy times. It is shown that the potential of geographical mobility to increase the number of matches is limited in a labour market with few or many vacancies per jobseeker. In these labour markets, mobility mostly affects which jobseekers find a job during a period. In a relatively better balanced labour market, the number of matches could be increased by additional mobility.","Univ Skovde, S-54128 Skovde, Sweden",University of Skovde,"Olsson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Skovde, POB 408, S-54128 Skovde, Sweden.",michael.olsson@his.se,"Olsson, Michael/ABE-3316-2021","Olsson, Michael/0000-0003-2814-0876; olsson, michael/0000-0003-0407-7024",,,,,11,2,2,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

It is important therefore in assessing bioenergy systems to take account of not only technical, but also environmental, economic and social parameters on a common basis. This work addresses the challenge of analysing, quantifying and comparing these factors for bioenergy power generation systems. A life-cycle approach is used to analyse the technical, environmental, economic and social impacts of entire bioelectricity systems, with a number of life-cycle indicators as outputs to facilitate cross-comparison. The results show that similar greenhouse gas savings are achieved with the wide variety of technologies and scales studied, but land-use efficiency of greenhouse gas savings and specific airborne emissions varied substantially. Also, while specific investment costs and electricity costs vary substantially from one system to another the number of jobs created per unit of electricity delivered remains roughly constant. Recorded views of stakeholders illustrate that diverging priorities exist for different stakeholder groups and this will influence appropriate choice of bioenergy systems for different applications.

There have been some research efforts in the marketing literature that investigate whether and how individuals form attachments to possessions, goods and brands. However, the role of attachment in marketing relationships developed via Internet remains an unexplored area. In the web site context, there has been evidence that the different type of relationships between a web site and its visitors are analogous to the relationships between two individuals or consumer and a brand. In this study, we synthesize the existing psychological and marketing theories on attachment and c-loyalty research, propose to investigate the effects of consumers' attachment on web site loyalty, the antecedents of web site attachment and the moderating role of attachment anxiety i.e. personality traits in the attachment-loyalty link.

It is obvious that artificial compensation must be done to make it back to the original or desired state, for that, eliminating medium or long range influences on ecosystem which are brought about by those sudden environmental pollution incidents. However, because of the current compensation policy for our country, as well as relevant laws, regulations, etc., still exist in a number of issues such as the absence of the main complaints, being devoid of objective and scientific ecological damage assessment and the lack of compensation, public environmental damage often fail to receive deserved compensation objectively, which led to many social conflicts.

This study considers the influence of these institutional systems on business strategy and firm-level responses to competitive challenges. The paper examines case of Toronto's life science complex and the growing prevalence of a business strategy of hybridization. Toronto's hybrid firms combine core strengths in biotechnology and biomedical technologies with service activities like contract research and manufacturing, blood bank and data management, and device repair and distribution.

However, this explanation overlooks an equally compelling rationale stemming from the larger institutional context that shapes and constrains their strategic choices.

The 21st-century metropolis: new geographies of theory, Regional Studies. This paper calls for 'new geographies' of imagination and epistemology in the production of urban and regional theory. It argues that the dominant theorizations of global city-regions are rooted in the EuroAmerican experience and are thus unable to analyse multiple forms of metropolitan modernities. By drawing on the urban experience of the global South, the paper presents new conceptual vectors for understanding the worlding of cities, the production of space, and the dynamics of exurbanity. It makes the case that such area-based knowledge deepens recent theoretical attempts to articulate a relational study of space and place.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept City & Reg Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Roy, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept City & Reg Planning, 228 Wurster Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ananya@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,84,768,907,3,182,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Secondly, we analysed the role of civil society in the energy sector, addressing the question whether Finns feel that they can influence energy policy-making as citizens through general elections (civic participation) or as consumers via their own consumption choices (political consumerism). Methodologically, the study was based on postal survey conducted in 2007 among a random sample representing 18-75-year-old Finns (N = 4000). According to the views expressed, the innermost core of the influence structure of Finland's energy policy-making today comprises only the Cabinet and Parliament, while the second circle is composed of energy-producer firms and big firms. The European Union, the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Trade and Industry belong to the third circle of influence. The power relations in Finland's energy sector have continued particularly stable since the late 1980s despite the liberalization and globalization of the energy markets. In order to influence energy policy-making, citizens consider their own consumption choices more useful than voting in elections or contacts with MPs, authorities and energy-producing companies. The least useful devices are radical environmental activism and participation in mass demonstrations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This technology reduces fuel consumption and addresses health impacts of indoor air pollution caused by the widespread use of traditional biomass fuels in open fires in developing countries. Different demographic and socio-economic factors have been analyzed to explain the low success rates implementation projects have faced worldwide, but there are almost no studies that examine the problem from the perspective of implementers. The aim of this study was to understand how the different visions of the individuals involved in an implementation program affect its outcome. Findings showed that the NGO work was constrained by the need to meet the commitment with sponsors. The adoption rates did not change between the first and the second stage of the project, even though the approach towards users was very different. A lack of a shared vision among the work team towards the project was found and the existence of two main perspectives among program workers-broadly described as people-centered and technology-centered-, gave place to differences in attitudes towards the program.

As a policy instrument, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) encourage investments in wind, solar and other generation sources with the goal of reducing air emissions from electricity production. Increased electricity production from wind turbines is expected to displace electricity production from fossil-fired plants, thus reducing overall system emissions. We analyze the emissions impacts of incremental investments in utility-scale wind power, on the order of 1 GW beyond RPS goals, in the Western United States using a utility-scale generation dispatch model that incorporates the impacts of transmission constraints. We find that wind investment in some locations leads to slight increases in overall emissions of CO2, SO2 and NOx. The location of wind farms influences the environmental impact by changing the utilization of transmission assets, which affects the overall utilization of power generation sources and thus system-level emissions. Our results suggest that renewable energy policy beyond RPS targets should be carefully crafted to ensure consistency with environmental goals.

A carbon tax was introduced on fuels, and purchase (vehicle registration) and ownership (motor) taxes were switched from engine size to potential emissions. We use a demographic model of the car stock (by age, size, and fuel) and a car purchase model that reflects the heterogeneous distribution of mileage and usage costs across various engine sizes. The model shows a dramatic shift from petrol to diesel cars, particularly for large engines. The same pattern is observed in the latest data on car sales. This has a substantial impact on tax revenue as car owners shift to the lower tax rates. The tax burden has shifted from car ownership to car use, and that the overall tax burden on private car transport falls. As diesel engines are more fuel efficient than petrol engines, carbon dioxide emissions fall modestly or, if we consider the rebound effect of travel costs on mileage, minimally. From the perspective of the revenue, the costs per tonne of carbon dioxide avoided are (very) high. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Hennessy, Hugh; Tol, Richard S.

Effects of material efficiency improvements, technology development, consumption structure changes and consumption volume growth in Jiangsu Province on its CO2 emissions during 1997-2007 are investigated using structural decomposition analysis based on environmental input-output table. In order to reduce CO2 emissions, Jiangsu Province should not only rely on material efficiency improvements and technology development, but also rely on consumption structure changes. For consumption structure changes in detail, Jiangsu Province should not only focus on fixed capital formation and urban residential consumption, but also focus on international and intranational imports and exports. For the implementation of material efficiency improvements and technology development, Jiangsu Province should focus on technology innovation and international technology transfer. For the implementation of consumption structure changes, Jiangsu Province should mainly focus on identified sectors for each separate final demand category: five sectors for urban residential consumption, three sectors for fixed capital formation, four sectors for international exports, five sectors for intranational exports, three sectors for international imports and four sectors for intranational imports.

Where there is a successful track record of cooperation between public authorities and the private sector, VAs can offer advantages to public authorities in comparison to legislation, most importantly better flexibility when introduced or updated, greater acceptance by industry, possibility for tailor-made solutions e.g. at the level of industrial sectors and opportunity to overcome the information asymmetry between public authorities and private actors. Nevertheless, VAs have been criticized for lack of specific obligations and lenient targets, as well as for deficiencies in compliance monitoring and self-reporting and difficulty in establishing the policy additionality of VA activity. This paper analyses the design of existing VAs in terms of general framework, targets and sectors, obligations and commitments, motivation to join, reporting and monitoring provisions, and results of existing VAs as reported by national authorities.

Negative community reactions and lack of understanding have affected geothermal developments, as demonstrated by the fearful community reactions and negative media experienced in response to seismic disturbances caused by hot rock geothermal energy generation in Switzerland and Germany. Focusing on geothermal energy, this paper presents the results of using a participatory action research methodology to engage diverse groups within the Australian public. A key finding is that the majority of the Australian public report limited the knowledge or understanding of geothermal technology and have various concerns including water usage and seismic activity instigated by geothermal drilling. However, geothermal energy receives general support due to a common trend to champion renewable energy sources in preference to traditional forms of energy generation and controversial technologies. This paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of using an engagement process to explore public understanding of energy technologies in the context of climate change, and suggests a way forward for governments and industry to allocate resources for greatest impact when communicating about geothermal technology.

It is expected that in the next decade this technology will progressively penetrate the market. The integration of plug-in electric vehicles in electric power systems poses new challenges in terms of regulation and business models. This paper proposes a conceptual regulatory framework for charging EVs. Two new electricity market agents, the EV charging manager and the EV aggregator, in charge of developing charging infrastructure and providing charging services are introduced. According to that, several charging modes such as EV home charging, public charging on streets, and dedicated charging stations are formulated. Involved market agents and their commercial relationships are analysed in detail. The paper elaborates the opportunities to formulate more sophisticated business models for vehicle-to-grid applications under which the storage capability of EV batteries is used for providing peak power or frequency regulation to support the power system operation.

However, the public perception of nuclear energy has historically been, and continues to be, a key issue, particularly in light of the Fukushima nuclear incident. This paper discusses the disparity between perceived and calculated risks based on the last four decades of research into risk perception. The leading psychological and sociological theories, Psychometric Paradigm and Cultural Theory, respectively, are critically reviewed. The authors then argue that a new nuclear-build policy that promotes a broader approach to design incorporating a wider range of stakeholder inputs, including that of the lay public, may provide a means for reducing the perceived risk of a nuclear plant. Further research towards such a new approach to design is proposed, based on integrating expert and lay stakeholder inputs and taking into account broader socio-cultural factors whilst maintaining the necessary emphasis on safety, technological development, economics and environmental sustainability.

Then, by assuming that each power generator is required to reduce CO2 emissions by one ton, we compute the potential cost savings from internal trading among generators within the same plant and from external trading across plants at prevailing market prices. The results indicate that, on average, the generators paid $14.63 to abate one ton of CO2 emissions in 2007. Plants realized additional gains through external trading.

This paper examines the value of the bill savings that customers receive under net metering, and the associated role of retail rate design, based on a sample of approximately two hundred residential customers of California's two largest electric utilities. We find that the bill savings per kWh of PV electricity generated varies by more than a factor of four across the customers in the sample, which is largely attributable to the inclining block structure of the utilities' residential retail rates. We also compare the bill savings under net metering to that received under three potential alternative compensation mechanisms, based on California's Market Price Referent (MPR). We find that net metering provides significantly greater bill savings than a full MPR-based feed-in tariff, but only modestly greater savings than alternative mechanisms under which hourly or monthly net excess generation is compensated at the MPR rate.

Coupled with the possibility of future regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, firms and institutions have begun to critically evaluate their own carbon footprint. This paper examines the preferences of stakeholders within a large academic institution for attributes of alternative greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction strategies. The attributes considered by constituents include: the fuel portfolio mix, effort for conserving energy use, carbon emissions reduction, timeframe for emissions reduction to be achieved and cost. We use a choice experiment technique that enables the examination of greenhouse gas reduction program attribute preferences across three constituent groups. The results show that each of the constituent groups have a positive WTP for carbon emissions reductions and prefer investments in reductions in the shorter- rather than longer-term. The results also suggest differences between the constituent groups in their WTP for types of fuels in the fuel portfolio. Finally, we use the results to examine the welfare implications of different combinations of the policy attributes that coincide with alternative GHG program strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, existing literature focuses on strategic management of internal resources as the constraints in this choice process. In the energy sector, external factors may be at least as influential in shaping these business models. This paper examines the roles of politico-institutional and socio-institutional dynamics in the choice of business models for microgeneration ventures. Business models have traditionally been viewed as constructions of the internal values, strategies, and resources of organizations. But, this perspective overlooks the role that external forces have on these models, particularly in more highly institutionalized contexts like microgeneration. When these factors are introduced into the existing framework for business model choice, the business model based less on firm decision-making and more about variables that exist within national innovation systems and political structure, local socio-technological conditions, and cognitive abilities of the entrepreneur and corresponding stakeholders.

The purpose of this paper is to estimate the domestic ancillary pollution benefits of climate policy in Sweden, and investigate how these are affected by different climate policy designs. The latter differ primarily in terms of how the country chooses to meet a specific target and where the necessary emission reductions take place. The analysis relies on simulations within the energy system optimisation model TIMES-Sweden, and focuses on four non-GHG pollutants: Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Non Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC), inhalable particles (PM2.5), and Sulphur dioxide (SO2). The simulations permit detailed assessments of the respective technology and fuel choices that underlie any net changes in the estimated ancillary effects. The results indicate that the ancillary benefits constitute a far from insignificant share of total system costs, and this share appears to be highest in the scenarios that entail the largest emission reductions domestically. This result reflects the fact that carbon dioxide emission reductions abroad also implies a lost opportunity of achieving substantial domestic welfare gain from the reductions of regional and local environmental pollutants.

Studies of the availability of marginal lands for dedicated bioenergy crops have focused on biophysical land traits, ignoring the human role in decisions to convert marginal land to bioenergy crops. Recent history offers insights about farmer willingness to put non-crop land into crop production. The 2006-09 leap in field crop prices and the attendant 64% gain in typical profitability led to only a 2% increase in crop planted area, mostly in the prairie states. At this rate, a doubling of expected profitability from biomass crops would expand cropland supply by only 3.2%. Yet targets for cellulosic ethanol production in the US Energy Independence and Security Act imply boosting US planted area by 10% or more with perennial biomass crops. Given landowner reluctance to expand crop area with familiar crops in the short run, large scale expansion of the area in dedicated bioenergy crops will likely be difficult and costly to achieve.

Norway's relative success in managing its hydrocarbons has prompted development institutions to consider whether this Norwegian Model of separated government functions should be recommended to other oil-producing countries. By studying ten countries that have used widely different approaches in administering their hydrocarbon sectors, we conclude that separation of functions is not a prerequisite to successful oil sector development. Countries where separation of functions has worked are characterized by the combination of high institutional capacity and robust political competition. Unchallenged leaders often appear able to adequately discharge commercial and policy/regulatory functions using the same entity, although this approach may not be robust against political changes. Where institutional capacity is lacking, better outcomes may result from consolidating commercial, policy, and regulatory functions until such capacity has further developed. Countries with vibrant political competition but limited institutional capacity pose the most significant challenge for oil sector reform: Unitary control over the sector is impossible but separation of functions is often difficult to implement.

In this paper, the relationship between the capacity characteristic of the GEHP and the heating and cooling loads of buildings has been analyzed. Meanwhile the reasons of the imbalance of the urban electricity and natural gas consumptions between summer and winter have been studied. The running characteristic of a water-to-water GEHP has been investigated experimentally and the PER was measured. Based on the analysis and experimental results, it could be concluded that if both the gas-fired boilers and electric air conditioners are replaced by GEHPs in some percentage, we can narrow the gaps between the requirement and provision of electricity and natural gas and balance the seasonal consumption differences of electricity and natural gas between summer and winter simultaneously. In order to improve energy efficiency, environmental quality and energy consumption structure effectively, the governmental incentive policies for promoting use of GEHPs should be formulated in China and some other developing countries.

Some model-based insights,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Security of supply; Natural gas; Market models,NATURAL-GAS,"In this paper, we analyze the impact of uncertain disruptions in gas supply upon gas retailer contracting behavior and consequent price and welfare implications in a gas market characterized by long-term gas contracts using a static Cournot model. In order to most realistically describe the economical situation, our representation divides the market into two stages: the upstream market that links, by means of long-term contracts, producers in exporting countries (Russia. Algeria, etc.) to local retailers who bring gas to the consuming countries to satisfy local demands in the downstream market. Disruption costs are modeled using short-run demand functions. First we mathematically develop a general model and write the associated KKT conditions, then we propose some case studies, under iso-elasticity assumptions, for the long-short-run inverse-demand curves in order to predict qualitatively and quantitatively the impacts of supply disruptions on Western European gas trade. In the second part, we study in detail the German gas market a the 1980s to explain the supply choices of the German retailer, and we derive interesting conclusions and insights concerning the amounts and prices of natural gas brought to the market. The last part of the paper is dedicated to a study of the Bulgarian gas market, which is greatly dependent on the Russian gas supplies and hence very sensitive to interruption risks. Some interesting conclusions are derived concerning the necessity to economically regulate the market, by means of gas amounts control, if the disruption probability is high enough.

Each of these policies would have different consequences, and combinations of these policies could induce interactions yielding a whole that is not the sum of its parts. This paper utilizes the Haiku electricity market model to evaluate the economic and technology outcomes, climate benefits, and cost-effectiveness of three such policies and all possible combinations of the policies. A central finding is that the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions reductions from CTP can be significantly greater than those from the other policies, even for similar levels of renewable electricity production, since of the three policies, CTP is the only one that distinguishes electricity generated by coal and natural gas. It follows that CTP is the most cost-effective among these approaches at reducing CO(2) emissions. An alternative compliance payment mechanism in an RPS program could substantially affect renewables penetration, and the electricity price effects of the policies hinge partly on the regulatory structure of electricity markets, which varies across the country.

Exploring rebound and backfire effects in UK households,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rebound effect; Sustainable consumption; Household savings,ENERGY EFFICIENCY; CONSUMPTION; MODELS,"Households are expected to play a pivotal role in reducing the UK's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the UK Government is encouraging specific household actions to help meet its targets. However, due to the rebound effect, only a portion of the GHG emission reductions estimated by simple engineering calculations are generally achieved in practice. For example, replacing short car journeys by walking or cycling reduces consumption of motor fuels. But this frees up money that may be spent on, for example, purchasing extra clothes or flying on vacation. Alternatively, the money may be put into savings. Since all of these options lead to GHG emissions, total GHG savings may be less than anticipated. Indeed, in some instances, emissions may increase a phenomenon known as 'backfire'. We estimate that the rebound effect for a combination of three abatement actions by UK households is approximately 34%. Targeting re-spending on goods and services with a low GHG intensity reduces this to a minimum of around 12%, while re-spending on goods and services with a high GHG intensity leads to backfire. Our study highlights the importance of shifting consumption to lower GHG intensive categories and investing in low carbon investments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A mean energy consumption rate of 2.7 kW/TEU was assumed in this study, but was found to have potential variations of around +/- 60%. New Zealand's maritime trade was considered as a case study for the year 2007 to place the effect of refrigerated transport in context. For individual refrigerated containers, approximately 19% of the energy use related to its journey is used for refrigeration purposes. In 2007, approximately 18% and 61% of New Zealand's imported and exported food products by mass, respectively, required some form of refrigeration during transportation. Maintaining the refrigerated state of imports and exports to and from New Zealand during maritime transportation consumed approximately 280 GWh of electricity. Assuming all this electricity was generated onboard vessels using auxiliary engines, approximately 61 kt of fuel was consumed and 190 kt of CO2 produced.

With this expectation identifying the impacts of carbon tax on energy demand and GHG emission reductions is an interesting issue. One of the basic methods of estimating these impacts is using the price elasticity. There are, however, some unanswered questions regarding the use of price elasticity. First, which elasticity estimates are appropriate to measure the impacts of carbon tax on energy demand? The existing estimates are estimated in the presence of a substitute. To assess the impact of carbon tax could we use these estimates? Second, how can we compromise the differences among the existing estimates depending on estimation methods and specifications? For example, how can we accommodate the difference in the estimates from the regional panel specification and the aggregate specification? This paper tries to answer these questions with the price elasticity of gasoline demand. With an appropriate price elasticity, we show how much gasoline consumption and GHG emissions are reduced by carbon tax for different scenarios of carbon tax rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyses whether different types of policy measures should be applied in different stages of the cluster life cycle. Two approaches are used to obtain answers to this question. First, insights are gathered from the existing literature on policy measures and evaluated. Second, a mathematical model is set up in order to examine the effects of various policy measures in the different life cycle phases. It is found that the adequate kind of policy measures depends on the cluster's current stage in its life cycle.","[Brenner, Thomas; Schlump, Charlotte] Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, D-35032 Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg,"Brenner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, Deutschhausstr 10, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",thomas.brenner@staff.uni-marburg; schlump@staff.uni-marburg.de,,,,,,,60,60,66,3,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The results indicate that the robust growth determinants differ across quantiles. The set of robust variables includes physical investment when taking country fixed-effects into account, and skill endowment and initial gross domestic product per capita when not.

Brazilian bioethanol from sugarcane is the most successful case at the world level because of its low cost and low level of greenhouse gas emissions. Brazil's success with sugarcane cannot be understood as based solely on a natural comparative advantage, but as a result of efforts that culminated in a positive trajectory of technological learning, relying mostly on incremental innovations. The purpose of this article is to analyze the key aspects of the innovation system built around the Brazilian sugarcane industry. It is based on the national innovation systems approach according to which innovation results from the interaction of different institutional actors. Institutional arrangements are analyzed as the basis for the innovative process, in particular R&D and the innovation policies and strategies of the main players in the sugarcane sector, including sugar and ethanol mills, industrial goods suppliers, public and private research institutions, and governmental agencies.

Contrary to arguments for a demand shock, I hypothesize that prices rise sharply in 2007-2008 because ongoing growth in Chinese oil demand runs into a sudden and unexpected halt to a decade long increase in non-OPEC production. This caused a loss of OPEC spare capacity because increased demand for OPEC production runs ahead of increases in OPEC capacity. These changes are reinforced by speculative expectations. Although difficult to measure directly, I argue for the role of speculation based on the following: (1) a significant increase in private US crude oil inventories since 2004; (2) repeated and extended break-downs (starting in 2004) in the cointegrating relationship between spot and far month future prices that are inconsistent with the law of one price and arbitrage opportunities; and (3) statistical and predictive failures by an econometric model of oil prices that is based on market fundamentals. These changes are related to the behavior and impact of noise traders on asset prices to sketch mechanisms by which speculative expectations can affect crude oil prices. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed model introduces two variables stochastic process in continuous time and explores the impact of the occurrence of unexpected events on the project value, so that, it can more authentically response to the project value. The studied issue deals with the firms that have not established energy-saving equipment yet. It attempts to figure out the optimal timing to adopt an energy-saving investment project when it is beneficial and the optimal timing to terminate it when the continuous operation of that business is unprofitable.

An illustrative example on Spanish and selected Mediterranean regions is used. The sensitivity analysis shows that excluding an indicator from a twenty-nine-indicator data set (which represents, in principle, a small structural change) has a much lower impact on the regional ranking if that is based on a non-compensatory multicriteria approach than on the classical linear aggregation, for example the weighted arithmetic average. An alternative approach that employs endogenous weighting (region-specific weights) and is based on data envelopment analysis is discussed.","[Munda, Giuseppe] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, E-08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain; [Munda, Giuseppe] Inst Environm Sci & Technol, E-08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain; [Saisana, Michaela] Commiss European Communities, Econometr & Appl Stat Unit G09, Inst Protect & Secur Citizen, Joint Res Ctr, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy",Autonomous University of Barcelona; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Munda, G (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Edifici B, E-08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain.",giuseppe.munda@uab.es; michaela.saisana@jrc.it,,"munda, giuseppe/0000-0003-3398-2971; Saisana, Michaela/0000-0001-5361-0222",,,,,45,47,49,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A full-scale simulation based on the Colombian system was conducted to illustrate model capabilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

When direct management is limited, another option is indirect management via bio-controls. Here management is directed at the bio-control species population (e.g., supplementing this population through stocking) with the aim that, through ecological interactions, the bio-control species will control the invader. We focus on stocking salmon to control invasive alewives in Lake Michigan. Salmon are valuable to recreational anglers, and alewives are their primary food source in Lake Michigan. We illustrate how stocking salmon can be used to control alewife, while at the same time alewife can be turned from a net economic bad (having a negative shadow value) into a net economic good (having a positive shadow value) by providing valuable ecosystem services that support the recreational fishery. Using optimal control theory, we solve for a stocking program that maximizes social welfare. Optimal stocking results in cyclical dynamics. We link concepts of natural capital and indirect management, population dynamics, non-convexities, and multiple-use species and demonstrate that species interactions are critical to the values that humans derive from ecosystems. This research also provides insight into the management of salmon fisheries in the Great lakes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Results suggest that states that experience an increase in supply capacity are, in most cases, also those with better export expansion. However, results suggest that in most cases, export growth is due mainly to an increase in US demand rather than to an improvement in the states' competitiveness to supply this demand.

Over the full life cycle, although to a smaller degree than traditional energy sources, PV also creates solid waste. This paper examines the potential need for PV recycling policies by analyzing existing recycling protocols for the five major types of commercialized PV materials. The amount of recoverable semiconductor material and glass in a 1 m(2) area solar module for the five types of cells is quantified both physically and the profit potential of recycling is determined. The cost of landfill disposal of the whole solar module, including the glass and semiconductor was also determined for each type of solar module. It was found that the economic motivation to recycle most PV modules is unfavorable without appropriate policies. Results are discussed on the need to regulate for appropriate energy and environmental policy in the PV manufacturing industry particularly for PV containing hazardous materials. The results demonstrate the need to encourage producer responsibility not only in the PV manufacturing sector but also in the entire energy industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Different strategies are proposed here in order to explore the best operational strategy for the wind and storage system in terms of its effect on the net load. Furthermore, the economic viability of combining wind and large scale storage is studied. The empirical application, using data for the Irish power system, shows that combined wind and storage reduces the participation of mid-merit plants and increases the participation of base-load plants. Moreover, storage negates some of the CO(2) emissions reduction of the wind generation. It was also found that the wind and storage output can significantly reduce the variability of the net load under certain operational strategies and the optimal strategy depends on the installed wind capacity. However, in the absence of any supporting mechanism none of the storage devices were economically viable when they were combined with the wind generation on the Irish power system.

Turkey, a developing country where most of the electricity is produced from fossil fuels and which has energy security problems, has adopted a new legislation giving financial incentives for nuclear power plant construction, along with a tender in 2008. However, the tender ended in a stalemate after the Council of State's decision in November 2009. An evaluation of Turkey's nuclear policy in light of South Korea's nuclear experience gives us an explanation as to why Turkey failed in the last tender. Basically it was due to lack of a long term nuclear energy policy that comprehends social, economical, technical and political aspects of nuclear energy. Thus, it is argued that Turkey can benefit from nuclear energy if it formulates a comprehensive nuclear energy plan clearly interwoven with its economic development plans, establishes a proper legal framework and has domestic industry participation in nuclear technology development.

In spite of having over 300 remote communities with extremely high electricity costs, Canada has had little success in developing remote wind energy projects. Most of Canada's large-scale wind power has been developed as a direct result of a Federal production incentive implemented in 2002. Using this incentive structure as a successful model, this paper explores how an incentive tailored to remote wind power could be deployed. Micro-power simulations were done to demonstrate that the production incentive designed by the Canadian Wind Energy Association would cost on average $4.7 $Cdn million and could be expected to result in 14.5 MW of wind energy projects in remote villages in Canada over a 10 year period, saving 11.5 $Cdn million dollars in diesel costs annually, displacing 7600 tonnes of CO2 emissions and 9.6 million litres of diesel fuel every year.

However, in an increasingly carbon constrained world and already now facing climate change impacts South Africa has to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity soon and decidedly. The South African electricity sector is a vital part of the economy and at the same time contributes most to the emissions problem. First steps have been taken by the South African government to enhance energy efficiency and promote renewable energy, however, they fail to show large-scale effects. This paper seeks to identify the relevant barriers to renewable energy investments and, based on experience from other countries, provide policy recommendations. The major barrier identified in the paper is based on the economics of renewable energy technologies, i.e. their cost and risk structures, two main factors in investment planning.

The theoretical framework, based on a dynamic adjustment cost model with forward-looking behaviour, is enhanced to include the intertemporal interactions between the two goods. The analysis of the within-period preferences completes the intertemporal model, allowing to evaluate the static substitutability/complementarity relationships. The empirical strategy consists in a two-step estimation procedure. In a first stage, we obtain the parameters of the demand system, while in a second stage Euler equations are estimated. Results, based on a cohort data set constructed from a series of cross-sections of the Italian Household Budget Survey, reveal a significant complementarity relationship between alcohol and tobacco. Estimation of the Euler equations does not lead to rejection of the hypothesis of intertemporal dependence, providing evidence for a forward-looking behaviour in alcohol and tobacco consumption. Moreover, we find significant intertemporal interactions that support the adjustment cost setting in a multivariate model with rational expectations.","[Aristei, David; Pieroni, Luca] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, I-06123 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Aristei, D (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",daristei@stat.unipg.it; Lpieroni@unipg.it,,"Pieroni, Luca/0000-0003-1841-4351; ARISTEI, DAVID/0000-0002-6328-1407",,,,,87,8,8,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

Its benefits increase when electricity prices increase to finance the subsidy. With high prices, subsidies are counterproductive unless consumers fail to make efficiency investments when private benefits exceed costs. If the gain from adopting efficiency is only reduced electricity spending, capping revenues from energy sales may induce a utility to substitute efficiency for generation when the former is less costly. This goes beyond standard decoupling of distribution revenues from sales, requiring complex energy price regulation. The models' results are used to evaluate tests in the 2002 California Standard Practice Manual for assessing demand-side management programs. Its Ratepayer Impact Measure test best conforms to the condition that electricity price is too low. Its Total Resource Cost and Societal Cost tests resemble the condition for expanded decoupling. No test incorporates optimality conditions apart from consumer choice failure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We extend the Ciccone and Hall (Am Econ Rev 86(1):54-70, 1996) production density model by distinguishing between the size of the industrial sector and the density of the urban economy in order to examine the effects of industry agglomeration and congestion on urban productivity. We also account for the endogeneity of industrial agglomeration and propose a simultaneous equation model to estimate the determinants of urban productivity and agglomeration. A spatial econometric analysis across 617 Chinese cities in year 2005 shows that the spatial concentration of industrial production is an important cause of higher productivity in large industrial cities and cities in neighboring regions, where higher productivity resulting from concentrated industrial production then leads to further agglomeration in these cities. Controlling for the size of the industrial sector, employment density has a negative effect on urban productivity. We conclude by briefly discussing potential policy implications of the empirical findings.","Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Ke, SZ (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Hunan Univ N Campus, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China.",shanzike@hotmail.com,,,,,,,47,60,72,5,59,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The country has been experiencing a gradual shift towards exploring renewable energy resources as a driving force for rural development. A few public sector and non-government organizations have started to develop renewable energy technology (RET) projects in rural areas. The lessons learnt from different demonstrations of RET projects reveal that with careful forward planning renewable energy can provide far-reaching economic, environmental, and social benefits to people living in remote rural areas in Bangladesh. This paper identifies some of the barriers that need to be overcome for the successful development of renewable energy technology sector and betterment of rural livelihoods. It does so through a critical review of policy and institutional settings, as well as present status and lessons learnt from pilot demonstration of a number of RET projects undertaken by different organizations. The study highlights policy implications of the review with the aim of supporting decision makers in formulating renewable energy policies and future plans for Bangladesh. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In the 1990s, the country also favored the sales of compact cars to middle and low-income classes. However, in the last years, the profile of vehicles sold in Brazil has converged towards larger and less-efficient vehicles. In 2008, Brazil launched the vehicle labeling program. Based on the outcomes of the historical programs oriented towards the development of automotive innovations, and on a survey conducted with the country's main auto makers, this article evaluates whether the vehicle labeling program will both improve the energy efficiency of light vehicles, and introduce new technologies. Our results indicate that, despite its virtuous intentions, the program will not control the tendency of rising fuel consumption of passenger cars sold in Brazil.

The paper uses historical wind production data from five European countries (Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, and Spain) and applies the Mean-Variance Portfolio theory to identify cross-country portfolios that minimise the total variance of wind production for a given level of production. Theoretical unconstrained portfolios show that countries (Spain and Denmark) with the best wind resource or whose size contributes to smoothing out the country output variability dominate optimal portfolios. The methodology is then elaborated to derive optimal constrained portfolios taking into account national wind resource potential and transmission constraints and compare them with the projected portfolios for 2020. Such constraints limit the theoretical potential efficiency gains from geographical diversification, but there is still considerable room to improve performance from actual or projected portfolios. These results highlight the need for more cross-border interconnection capacity, for greater coordination of European renewable support policies, and for renewable support mechanisms and electricity market designs providing locational incentives. Under these conditions, a mechanism for renewables credits trading could help aligning wind power portfolios with the theoretically efficient geographic dispersion. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It failed in this endeavour, producing a political agreement in the form of the Copenhagen Accord. The Accord sets an ambitious goal of holding the increase in the global average surface temperature to below 2 degrees C. This paper describes 45 COP-only mitigation scenarios that provide an indication of what would need to be done to stay within the 2 degrees C limit if the international climate negotiations stay on their current path. The results suggest that if developed countries adopt a combined target for 2020 of <= 20% below 1990 levels, global CO2 emissions would probably have to be reduced by >= 5%/yr, and possibly >= 10%/yr. post-2030 (after a decade transitional period) in order to keep warming to 2 degrees C. If aggressive abatement commitments for 2020 are not forthcoming from all the major emitting countries, the likelihood of warming being kept within the 2 degrees C limit is diminutive.

The paper identifies different types of conflicts of interest related to wind power - in addition to the conflict between wind power as a national public interest and various local private interests - and analyses the impact of the national planning instruments on the handling of these conflicts in the land-use planning process in the County of Ostergotland. The analysis shows that the planning target actually made local planning officials even more inclined to treat wind power as a private rather than a public interest and that the method used to identify areas of national interest of wind power forced wind power to compete with the combined strengths of all other public interest. The planning instruments thus left wind power to fight an uphill battle rather than to meet other interests face-to-face on a level playing field. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The emerging concept of energisation seems to capture this idea, and if implemented in its full complexity it should have multiple beneficial effects. To demonstrate this, an economic model is developed for an urban developmental context, drawing on the theory of urban ecosystems and illustrating energy and waste production and consumption issues with current South African data sets. This new understanding of the concept of energisation is then integrated into a local government energy planning process, by means of a checklist for energy planners, covering 18 aspects that between them affect all 7 identifiable tiers of the energy service supply network. A 6-step structured approach is proposed for integrating sustainable energisation into the first four phases of the advanced local energy planning (ALEP) tool. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the existing environment DEA technology, this paper presents several DEA models for estimating the aggregated efficiency of resource and environment. These models can evaluate DMUs' energy efficiencies and environment efficiencies simultaneously. However, efficiency ranking results obtained from these models are not the same, and each model can provide some valuable information of DMUs' efficiencies, which we could not ignore. Under this situation, it may be hard for us to choose a specific model in practice. To address this kind of performance evaluation problem, the current paper extends Shannon-DEA procedure to establish a comprehensive efficiency measure for appraising DMUs' resource and environment efficiencies. In the proposed approach, the measure for evaluating a model's importance degree is provided, and the targets setting approach of inputs/outputs for DMU managers to improve DMUs' energy and environmental efficiencies is also discussed. We illustrate the proposed approach using real data set of 30 provinces in China. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We believe that an explanation lies in the way that the hydrogen economy fulfills psychological and cultural needs related to a future world where energy is abundant, cheap, and pollution-free, a fantasy that manifests itself with the idea that society can continue to operate without limits imposed by population growth and the destruction of the environment. The article begins by explaining its research methodology consisting of two literature reviews, research interviews of energy experts, and the application of symbolic convergence theory, a general communications theory about the construction of rhetorical fantasies. We then identify a host of socio-technical challenges to explain why the creation of a hydrogen economy would present immense (and possibly intractable) obstacles, an argument supplemented by our research interviews. Next, we employ symbolic convergence theory to identify five prevalent fantasy themes and rhetorical visions independence, patriotism, progress, democratization, and inevitability-in academic and public discussions in favor of the hydrogen economy. We conclude by offering implications for scholarship relating to energy policy more broadly. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the first case, the economy experiences a permanent income inequality in the steady state and income divergence in the transitional dynamics. In the second case, we observe an enlargement of the industrial core of the economy with a strong catching up by the periphery.

Following in line with global trend, India declared its biofuel policy in which biodiesel, primarily from jatropha, would meet 20% of the diesel demand beginning with 2011-2012. In spite of the efforts made by the state, production of biodiesel, however, has not picked up at all. Doubt arises as to whether the country will be able to meet the target.

One of the reasons for this attention is based on the rapid innovation of nuclear technology which solves many of its technological constraints and safety issues. However, regardless of these rapid innovations, social acceptance for nuclear energy has been relatively low and unchanged. Consequently, the social perception has often been an obstacle to the development and execution of nuclear policy requiring enormous subsidies which are not based on the social value of nuclear energy. Therefore, in this study, we estimate the social value of nuclear energy-consumers' willingness-to-pay for nuclear energy-using the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) and suggest that the social value of nuclear energy increases approximately 68.5% with the provision of adequate information about nuclear energy to the public. Consequently, we suggest that the social acceptance management in nuclear policy development is important along with nuclear technology innovation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The main aspect of the energy planning at decentralized level would be to prepare an area-based DEP to meet energy needs and development of alternate energy sources at least-cost to the economy and environment. Present work uses goal-programming method in order to analyze the DEP through bottom-up approach. This approach includes planning from the lowest scale of Tumkur district in India. The scale of analysis included village level-Ungra, panchayat level (local council)-Yedavani, block level-Kunigal and district level-Tumkur. The approach adopted was bottom-up (village to district) to allow a detailed description of energy services and the resulting demand for energy forms and supply technologies. Different scenarios are considered at four decentralized scales for the year 2005 and are developed and analyzed for the year 2020. Decentralized bioenergy system for producing biogas and electricity, using local biomass resources, are shown to promote development compared to other renewables. This is because, apart from meeting energy needs, multiple goals could be achieved such as self-reliance, local employment, and land reclamation apart from CO2 emissions reduction.

The development of the natural gas market in many developing countries has demonstrated that the success of the whole project hinges upon the success of gas-fired power generation. However, under the current energy pricing system in China, the advantages of gas-fired power plants, such as low investment costs and high efficiency, have not been able to offset the low price of coal. The gas-fired power plants, both at downstream of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) industry and upstream of the power sector, are faced with a dilemma. In order to solve the problems facing gas-fired power projects while providing policy guidance for the future development of gas-fired power projects, the policy of gas-fired power generation using imported LNG on the southeastern coast of China was examined. This study aims to identify the position of the national energy strategy that China should import some LNG from the other countries, to guide the development of energy policy in this region, and to formulate some clear policy measures.

The paper evaluates whether government intervention through the subsidization of business angel networks (BANs) enhances regional economic growth in Flanders, Belgium. It shows that, firstly, BANs reduce the information and financing problems entrepreneurial companies face. Secondly, that these companies contribute to economic development and growth. Thirdly, that there are positive indicators of future potential, such as an upward evolution in value creation and the ability to raise follow-on financing. Finally, the programme has many positive indirect effects. This leads to a tentative conclusion that public BAN support is warranted.

The empirical results show evidence of the inverted U-shaped EKC relationships' existence in America and Europe, but not in Africa and Asia and Oceania. Thus, the regional difference of EKC for water pollution is supported. Furthermore, the estimated turning points are, approximately, US$13,956 and USS38,221 for America and Europe, respectively.

In the new market context, these effects are likely to be worsened and thus even harder to assess. Since liberalization and especially since the release of the Energy Sector Inquiry in early 2007, the portfolio of long-term supply contracts of the former incumbents have become a priority for review by the European Commission and the national competition authorities. It is widely believed that European Competition authorities take a dogmatic view on these contracts and systemically emphasize the risk of foreclosure over their positive effects on investment and operation. This paper depicts the methodology that has emerged in the recent line of cases and argues that this interpretation is largely misguided. It shows that a multiple-step approach is used to reduce regulation costs and balance anti-competitive effects with potential efficiency gains. However, if an economic approach is now clearly implemented, competition policy is constrained by the procedural aspect of the legal process and the remedies imposed remain open for discussion.

It then examines some of the existing institutions in place to establish and carry out rules and norms governing global energy problems and describes the range of institutional design options available to policymakers. It briefly traces the role of a selection of these institutions, from inter-governmental organizations to summit processes to multilateral development banks to global action networks, in responding to energy issues, and points out their strengths and weaknesses.

However, there is a trade-off between modelling approaches suitable for calculating those impacts on the economy. For the former most of the studies have been conducted with general equilibrium models, whereas partial equilibrium models represent the main approach for distributional analysis. This paper proposes a methodology to simultaneously carry out an analysis of the distributional and efficiency consequences of changes in energy taxation. In order to do so, we have integrated a microeconomic household demand model and a computable general equilibrium model for the Spanish economy. We illustrate the advantages of this approach by simulating a revenue-neutral reform in Spanish indirect taxation, with a large increase of energy taxes that serve an environmental purpose. The results show that the reforms bring about significant efficiency and distributional effects, in some cases counterintuitive, and demonstrate the academic and social utility of this approximation.

It combines measures of energy import diversification, political risks of the supplying country, risk associated with energy transit, and the economic impact of a supply disruption. We construct separate indexes for three primary energy types, oil, gas and coal, and demonstrate that Member States' levels of supply risk exposure differ across energies. Most other studies of this kind provide aggregate indexes combining different types of energy. our results suggest that an aggregate approach could be misleading, at least for discussions of the short-term response to risks.

It arrives to the conclusion that within the context of the end of cheap oil, the current development model of the Catalan economy, based on the growth of low-productivity sectors such as services and construction, must be changed. The change is needed not only because of the increasing scarcity of affordable energy and the increasing environmental impact of present development, but also because of the aging population. Moreover, the situation experienced by Catalonia is similar to that of other European countries and many other developed countries. This implies that we can expect a wave of major structural changes in the economy of developed countries worldwide. To make things more challenging, according to current trends, the energy intensity and exosomatic energy metabolism of Catalonia will keep increasing in the near future. To avoid a reduction in the standard of living of Catalans due to a reduction in the available energy it is important that the Government of Catalonia implement major adjustments and conservation efforts in both the household and paid-work sectors.

This affects both the energy consumption and the health of households. The traditional New Zealand household pattern of only heating one room of the house has been unchanged for decades, although there has been substantial market penetration of unflued gas heaters and more recently heat pumps. This paper describes the residential sector and the results of two community-based trials of housing and heating interventions that have been designed to measure the impact of (I) retrofitting insulation and (2) replacing unflued gas heaters and electric resistance heaters with heat pumps, wood pellet burners and flued gas heaters. The paper describes findings on the rebound effect or 'take-back'-the extent to which households take the gains from insulation and heating improvements as comfort (higher temperatures) rather than energy savings, and compares energy-saving patterns with those suggested by an earlier study. Findings on these aspects of household space heating are discussed in the context of the New Zealand government's policy drive for a more sustainable energy system, and the implications for climate change policy.

Policies in the United States like the renewable fuel standard (RFS) have led to an expansion of ethanol production, while the New Zealand government has mandated a minimum level of biofuel sales. The research used a partial equilibrium model of international trade to quantify the price and farmgate income effects of the US RFS policy. The goal was to examine the competition between food and biofuel production and to quantify the impact of the policy on the agricultural sector in New Zealand. The RFS policy has a significant impact on corn prices, but a small effect on livestock prices and production. There thus appears to be little conflict between food and fuel uses for corn at the level of the RFS mandate. New Zealand's pasture-based livestock sector benefits from the use of corn for ethanol production: it receives better prices for its products, but does not face the same input cost increases as competitors. The results suggest that New Zealand faces an interesting decision: it could support investment in biofuels research, or benefit from the biofuels boom through the indirect impacts on demand and prices for meat and milk.

After discussing key issues of comparing' State Oil' and 'Private Oil', I summarise important trends emerging from the dataset, which covers 1001 firm observation years over the period 1987-2006. Using panel-data regression analysis it is shown that NOCs significantly underperform the private sector in terms of output efficiency and profitability. They also produce a significantly lower annual percentage of upstream reserves, although this may not be an indication of firm efficiency. Overall, this paper suggests that a political preference for State Oil usually comes at an economic cost. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The drivers of fuel-dependence-related vulnerability are determined using Laspeyres index decomposition. A what-if' analysis is carried out to analyse the changes in the vulnerability index due to changes in the drivers and a scenario analysis is finally used to investigate the future vulnerability in the medium term. The paper finds that the British and the Dutch electricity systems are less diversified compared to three other countries analysed. The gas dependence of the Dutch and Italian systems made them vulnerable but the vulnerability increased in all countries in recent years. Gas price and the level of dependence on gas for power generation mainly influenced the gas vulnerability. The United Kingdom saw a substantial decline in its coal vulnerability due to a fall in coal price and coal dependence in electricity generation. The scenario analysis indicates that UK is likely to face greater gas vulnerability in the future due to increased gas dependence in electricity generation and higher import dependence.

The power generation sector, as a key source of GHG emissions, will also have significant potential for GHG mitigation. One of the key options is to use new energy technologies with higher energy efficiencies and lower carbon emissions. In this article, we use an energy technology model, MESSAGE-China, to analyze the trend of key new power generation technologies and their contributions to GHG mitigation in China. We expect that the traditional renewable technologies, high-efficiency coal power generation and nuclear power will contribute substantially to GHG mitigation in the short term, and that solar power, biomass energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) will become more important in the middle and long term. In the meantime, in order to fully bring the role of technology progress into play, China needs to enhance the transfer and absorption of international advanced technologies and independently strengthen her ability in research, demonstration and application of new power generation technologies.

It is therefore crucial to identify 6 cost-effective way to achieve this objective. In this paper, we use WITCH, a hybrid climate-energy-economy model, to obtain a quantitative assessment of equilibrium strategies that stabilize CO2 concentrations at 550 or 450 ppm. Since technological change is endogenous and multifaceted in WITCH, and the energy sector is modeled in detail, we can provide a description of the ideal combination of technical progress and alternative energy investment paths in achieving the sought stabilization targets. Given that the model accounts for interdependencies and spillovers across 12 regions of the world, equilibrium strategies are the outcome of a dynamic game through which inefficiency costs induced by global strategic interactions can be assessed. Our results emphasize the drastic change in the energy mix that will be necessary to control climate change. the huge investments in existing and new technologies implied, and the crucial role of breakthrough technological innovation.

The model abstracts from many features of such investments to focus on their irreversibility, the uncertainty of their future payoff streams, and the investor's anticipation of future technological advance. in this setting, the decision to invest in energy-saving technology can be delayed, providing option value. In addition, delay allows the potential investor to cash in on future experience-curve effects: With the passage of time, firms gain practical knowledge in producing and installing the energy-saving technology, enabling them to reduce the technology's up-front cost per unit of energy saved. We incorporate these fundamentals into a stochastic model where the investment's discounted benefits follow geometric Brownian motion. To demonstrate the model's capabilities, we generate simulation results for photovoltaic systems that highlight the experience-curve effect as a fundamental reason why households and firms delay making energy-saving investments until internal rates of return exceed values of 50% and higher, consistent with observations in the economics literature. We also explore altruistic motivations for energy conservation and the model's implications for both additionality and the design of energy-conservation policy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Facilities, demand and/or the region of interest are often abstracted using aggregated points. However, substantial errors can be introduced, and obtained solutions could be dependent on the degree of aggregation. To address this, geographic representation of space is undergoing renewed research interest in spatial analysis and modelling. In this article the maximal coverage problem is studied, with a particular focus on demand coverage representation. Due to the limitations of existing modelling approaches for examining the coverage of space, there exist significant discrepancies between what is modelled and actual geographic coverage. In order to accurately reflect the mechanism of maximal coverage for spatial objects (points, lines or polygons), we introduce a new model explicitly accounting for joint service provided by multiple facilities. The new model can be viewed as an extension of existing approaches, but also a generalisation. An application to warning siren siting is carried out to demonstrate the merits of this new approach.","[Tong, Daoqin] Univ Arizona, Dept Geog & Reg Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Murray, Alan T.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Geog Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University of Arizona; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Tong, D (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Dept Geog & Reg Dev, 408 Harvill Bldg,Box 2,1103 E 2nd St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",daoqin@email.arizona.edu; murray.308@osu.edu,"Murray, Alan T/B-2993-2012","Murray, Alan T/0000-0003-2674-6110",,,,,34,62,70,0,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1056-8190,,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

About 67 million of them use kerosene for lighting. Government of India is promoting the use of solar home systems (SHS) as one of the options for meeting lighting requirements in households in remote and less inhabited villages. About 363,399 SHS were reportedly disseminated across the country by December 2007. Apart from meeting the basic lighting need of the households, SHS also help in abating the emissions of green house gases (GHGs) by directly displacing the use of kerosene in households that currently use it for lighting. This study has attempted at estimating the CO2 mitigation potential of SHS in India by studying the potential for their diffusion and the appropriate baseline. Subsequently, the scope for cost reduction to the user due to carbon finance, if received, is also studied. It is found that carbon finance could reduce the effective burden of SHS to the user by 19% if carbon prices were $10/tCO(2)(2) and no transaction costs were involved in getting the carbon revenues. These benefits are also estimated for scenarios where transaction costs are incurred by the project proponent in getting the carbon benefits. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper concludes by considering the policy implications for rural policy, urban policy, and cohesion policy.","[Shucksmith, Mark; Cameron, Stuart; Merridew, Tanya] Newcastle Univ, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Pichler, Florian] Univ Aberdeen, Dept Sociol, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland",Newcastle University - UK; University of Aberdeen,"Shucksmith, M (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Claremont Tower, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",m.shucksmith@ncl.ac.uk; s.j.cameron@ncl.ac.uk; tanyamerridew@hotmail.co.uk; florian.pichler@abdn.ac.uk,"Roman, Urszula/G-2225-2011",,,,,,33,136,141,2,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We use a structural VAR (SVAR) model based on monthly data over the period 1986-2009. The EGARCH model estimates show an important asymmetric effect of oil price shocks on the conditional oil price volatility. Dynamic impulse response functions obtained from the SVAR model show a prolonged dampening effect of oil price volatility shock on Malaysian industrial production. We also find that levels of Consumer Price Index (CPI) decline with a positive shock to oil price uncertainty. This is the result of negative demand shock due to the postponement of consumption of big ticket items by individuals, households and other sectors of the economy. We also found that the Malaysian central bank adopts an expansionary monetary policy in response to oil price uncertainty. Variance decomposition analysis reconfirms that volatility in the oil price is the second most important factor to explain the variance of industrial production after its own shocks.

In this article we develop a conceptual framework of consumer environmental behaviour and its antecedents, and test hypotheses within the framework by means of a survey of green consumers. The results show that general environmental beliefs do influence norms on environmental actions and prices, but only norms on price are correlated with environmental attitudes; both intrinsic and extrinsic environmental drivers together with social norms and community influence are associated with environmental attitudes, but cost barriers may have a negative influence. It was also found that there was a strong association between environmental attitudes and energy saving behaviours but the latter was not in any way influenced by government policies or subsidies.

Much as a political economy perspective has aided the understanding of why Chinese economic reforms were partial and unique, the said contextualization might help explain why China's policies and institutions for renewables diverge from best practice. Further, given that China proved successful in promoting its economic growth with partial and unique reforms, the partiality and uniqueness of its renewables policies and institutions need not impede the rapid development of renewable electricity.

Solar technologies convert light and heat from the sun into useful energy. The use of the sun's energy can not only reduce the consumption of conventional fuels, thus reducing the emission of detrimental greenhouse gases, but it can also enable a gain in enhanced fuel and energy security along with lessening costs. In addition, green technologies and industries can promote economic growth and international competitiveness, and can offer new business and employment opportunities. It becomes, therefore, extremely important to deeply explore the dynamics of the solar photovoltaic sector. Specifically, the present work analyses the main global trends of this sector and sketches the key players on the world market, including producers, installers, and top traders. Based on an analysis of trade flows at the 6-digit level, the international specialisation patterns are investigated, and the role of various market and trade drivers, including subsidies in the uptake of solar technologies, is identified and examined.

Our specification captures the intuition that lies behind the growing body of empirical evidence that places interpersonal comparisons as a key determinant of wellbeing. We consider the effect of consumption externalities under two alternative property-rights regimes: perfect property rights and open access. We identify two dimensions along which consumption externalities distort the efficient exploitation of resources, or, in the case of open access, aggravate the over-exploitation of resources: (i) the static trade-off between consumption and leisure, and (ii) the dynamic trade-off between current and future consumption. In general, envious agents over-exploit the natural resource stock, resulting in a steady-state stock lower than the efficient level chosen by a central planner.

We investigate whether such policies benefit from determining fuel carbon intensities (FCIs) locally to account for variations in fuel production and to stimulate improvements in FCI. In this study, we examine the FCI of transportation fuels on a lifecycle basis within a specific state, Minnesota, and compare the results to FCIs using national averages. Using data compiled from 18 refineries over an 11-year period, we find that ethanol production is highly variable, resulting in a 42% difference between carbon intensities. Historical data suggests that lower FCIs are possible through incremental improvements in refining efficiency and the use of biomass for processing heat. Stochastic modeling of the corn ethanol FCI shows that gains in certainty due to knowledge of specific refinery inputs are overwhelmed by uncertainty in parameters external to the refiner, including impacts of fertilization and land use change. The LCA results are incorporated into multiple policy scenarios to demonstrate the effect of policy configurations on the use of alternative fuels. These results provide a contrast between volumetric mandates and LCFSs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The central question we address is: can we identify a potential destabilizing effect of the introduction of options on the underlying market (EUA futures)? Indeed, the literature on commodities futures suggest that the introduction of derivatives may either decrease (due to more market depth) or increase (due to more speculation) volatility. As the identification of these effects ultimately remains an empirical question, we use daily data from April 2005 to April 2008 to document volatility behavior in the EU E. By instrumenting various GARCH models, endogenous break tests, and rolling window estimations, our results overall suggest that the introduction of the option market had the effect of decreasing the level of volatility in the EU ETS while impacting its dynamics. These findings are fairly robust to other likely influences linked to energy and commodity markets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The creation of a new Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) at the EU level, which has decision-making powers on MTI, therefore presents a unique opportunity to question and re-design the current European policy. This paper shows that the recent decisions concerning MTI may suffer a strong bias against dominant electricity generators while incumbent Transmission System Operators (TSOs) or new entrant TSOs are generally favored by national regulators and the European Commission (EC). This strategy is misguided as it fails to recognize both the new incentives of generators to develop MTI and the conflict of interest between the regulated and non-regulated activities of incumbent TSOs. Letting dominant generators undertake MTI is indeed generally beneficial as long as potential abuses of dominance are mitigated. To deter possible anti-competitive effects, we propose a new and feasible allocation of regulatory powers based on a clear demarcation between the market monitoring powers of ACER and the antitrust powers of the EC (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

By then there is a political aim to double the national production of bioenergy from the level in 2008. The competitiveness of woody biomass in central and district heating is analyzed in a model selecting the least-cost heating technology and scale in municipalities given a set of constraints and under different fuels price scenarios. The supply of forest biomass from roundwood is estimated based on data of forest inventories combined with elasticities regarding price and standing volumes. The supply of biomass from harvesting residues is estimated in an engineering approach based on data from the national forest inventories and roundwood harvest. The results show how the production of bioenergy is affected by changes in energy prices and support schemes for bioenergy. One conclusion from the analyses is that the government target of 14 TWh more bioenergy by 2020 is not likely to be met by current technologies and policy incentives. The contribution of the analysis is the detailed presentation of the heat market potentials and technology choices combined with supply functions for both roundwood and harvesting residues.

This paper examines the impact of urban growth on workers' commutes using the case of Beijing, which is undergoing rapid economic and spatial restructuring. The results of an analysis of household survey data show that clustered and compact urban development in planned sub-centres is likely to reduce suburban workers' need for a long-distance commute to the city centre when the workers' socio-economic characteristics, the level of transport accessibility and household preferences for residential location are taken into account. Workers employed in the manufacturing sector tend to have shorter commutes and travel within the planned suburban sub-centres. This reveals that the decentralization of employment in the manufacturing sector provides more opportunities to enhance the spatial matches between household residential and job location choices. Household preferences for residential location have an effect on commuting patterns, and high-income workers are likely to accept longer commutes in order to fulfil their residential preferences. Dramatic urban restructuring, in conjunction with changes in lifestyle, is creating new commuting patterns in the rapidly growing cities of China.","[Zhao, Pengjun; Lu, Bin] Peking Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [de Roo, Gert] Univ Groningen, Dept Urban & Environm Planning, NL-9742 AD Groningen, Netherlands",Peking University; University of Groningen,"Zhao, PJ (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",pengjun.zhao@pku.edu.cn; binlu@pku.edu.cn; g.de.roo@rug.nl,"Zhao, Peng/HDO-7507-2022",,,,,,103,69,76,3,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

The Bayesian solution to the general quantile regression problem, via the Skewed-Laplace distribution, is adapted and designed for parameter estimation in this model family via an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme. A simulation study illustrates favorable precision in estimation, compared to the standard numerical optimization method. The proposed model family is clearly favored in an empirical study of 10 major stock markets. The results that show the proposed model is more accurate at Value-at-Risk forecasting over a two-year period, when compared to a range of existing alternative models and methods.","[Gerlach, Richard H.] Univ Sydney, Discipline Operat Management & Econometr, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Chen, Cathy W.

The energy available in the exit stream of many energy conversion devices goes as waste. The major technical constraint that prevents successful implementation of waste heat recovery is due to intermittent and time mismatched demand for and availability of energy. The present work deals with the use of exergy as an efficient tool to measure the quantity and quality of energy extracted from a diesel engine and stored in a combined sensible and latent heat storage system. This analysis is utilized to identify the sources of losses in useful energy within the components of the system considered, and provides a more realistic and meaningful assessment than the conventional energy analysis. The energy and exergy balance for the overall system is quantified and illustrated using energy and exergy flow diagrams. In order to study the discharge process in a thermal storage system, an illustrative example with two different cases is considered and analyzed, to quantify the destruction of exergy associated with the discharging process. The need for promoting exergy analysis through policy decision in the context of energy and environment crisis is also emphasized. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The assessment of six countries with good contemporary potential for expanding sugarcane cultivation described in this paper was part of their analysis. Its principal objective was to identify land where such production will not have detrimental environmental and/or socio-economic impacts. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was used to interrogate 1 km(2) resolution protected area, land cover, climate, elevation and soil data sets. To avoid detrimental impacts on biodiversity, all categories of protected areas, closed canopy forests and wetlands were excluded. To safeguard food security, all areas under food and/or cash crop production were excluded. Areas unsuitable because of climate, terrain and soil constraints were also excluded. The assessment found that almost 6 million hectares of suitable land is available in these countries, clearly suggesting that 'land' is unlikely to be a limiting factor in harnessing sugarcane's bioenergy potential in the region. However, land identified as such in this study needs to be verified using better resolution, preferably ground, information. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Technically rigorous projections are important as developing countries define their commitment to act on mitigation relative to business-as-usual (BAU). The key drivers for the GWC scenario include GDP (both growth rate and composition), population, discount rate and technological change. GDP emerged as an important driver in the research for LTMS and further analysis. If South Africa's economy grows without constraints over the next few decades. GHG emissions will continue to escalate, multiplying more than four-fold by mid-century. There is little gain in energy efficiency, and emissions continue to be dominated by energy use and supply, the latter remaining coal-based in GWC. We analyse the projections (not predictions) in relation to various measures. The LTMS GWC scenario is compared to other projections, nationally and internationally. A broadly comparable projection is being used at national level, for electricity planning. When compared to projections from international models, we find that the assumptions about GDP growth rates are a key factor, and suggest that comparisons of global data-sets against national analyses is important.

Evidence from the pricing behavior of Norwegian and Swiss exporters,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Pricing-to-market; European integration; Electricity market,EXCHANGE-RATES; TO-MARKET; CONVERGENCE; PRICES; POWER,"This paper examines the electricity market integration process in two European areas based on the pricing behavior of Norwegian and Swiss exporters. The aim is to gain evidence for the period after the adoption of the Second Legislative Package (2003). The pricing behavior of Norwegian exporters indicates that the wholesale markets for Denmark and Sweden are highly integrated. Moreover, results are fully compatible with the existence of a very competitive marketplace for electricity. This clearly contrasts with the evidence provided by Swiss exporters. In this last case, analysis revealed differences in pricing-to-market behavior between Italy, France and Germany, which indicates that exporters take advantage of international market segmentation and divergences between market structures. This outcome provides a reasonable explanation as to why price differences between countries cannot be fully attributed to transmission costs, as has been claimed in previous research. We also found cross-country convergence in levels of markups and in pricing-to-market behavior of the Swiss exporters for the first part of the period that was analyzed. The evidence is fully consistent with an initial impulse toward market integration originated by reforms implemented at the beginning of the last decade. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This research offers insights into how states approach the problem of choosing emissions-abatement options that maximize benefits and minimize costs, given their unique circumstances and the constellation of interest groups with power to influence state policy. The state CAPs recommended ten popular GHG reduction strategies to accomplish approximately 90% of emissions reductions, but they recommended these popular strategies in different proportions: a strategy that is heavily relied on in one state's overall portfolio may play a negligible role in another state. This suggests that any national policy to limit GHG emissions should encompass these key strategies, but with flexibility to allow states to balance their implementation for the state's unique geographic, economic, and political circumstances. Survey results strongly support the conclusion that decisions regarding GHG reductions are influenced by the mix of actors at the table. Risk perception is associated with job type for all strategies, and physical and/or geographic factors may underlie the varying reliance on certain GHG reduction strategies across states.

The aim of the analysis was to identify which survey-items were predictors of respondents' estimates of the number of wind turbines they believed the region could reasonably support (i.e. capacity estimates). The results revealed that the majority of respondents would endorse some local development; however, there was substantial variability in the upper level that was considered acceptable. Prominent predictors included general attitude, perceived knowledge of wind power, community attachment, environmental values, visual attractiveness of wind turbines, and issues relating to perceived fairness and equity.

Apparently, the cost-effective disposition of funds in terms of induced capacity deployment has to be regarded a key criterion for the success of renewable energy policy. Grid connection costs are a major cost component in the utilization of offshore wind energy for electricity generation. In this paper, the effect of different attribution mechanisms of these costs on overall cost-effectiveness from consumers' perspective is analyzed. The major result of this investigation is that an attribution of grid connection costs to grid operators - as against to generators - leads to a smaller producer surplus and, hence, to lower transfer costs for electricity consumers. Applying this approach to the deployment of UK Rounds II and III offshore wind farms could lead to annual savings of social transfers of 1.2b pound and an equal reduction of producer surplus. This amount would be sufficient to finance the deployment of additional 10% of the capacity under consideration. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we use price-gap approach to estimate the fossil energy subsidies of China, then establish CGE model that contains pollutant emissions accounts and CO2 emissions account to stimulate the fossil energy subsidies reform under different scenarios, and the environmental economic analysis concept is introduced to monetize the pollutant reduction benefits. Furthermore, we analyze the possibility and scope of improving the energy consumption structure from the perspective of technical and economic analysis. Analytical results show that the energy consumption structure could be improved by different extent by removing coal or oil subsidies, while the economic and social indexes will be influenced distinctively. Meanwhile, the effects of cutting coal subsidies are more feasible than that of cutting oil subsidies overall. It is recommended to implement fossil energy subsidies gradually, cut the coal first and then cut oil subsidies successively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of China's fuel cycle program and its reprocessing policy, and to suggest strategies for managing its future fuel cycle program. The study is broken into four sections. The first reviews China's current nuclear fuel cycle program and facilities. The second discusses China's current spent fuel management methods and the storage capability of China's 13 operational nuclear power plants. The third estimates China's total accumulated spent fuel, its required spent fuel storage from present day until 2035, when China expects its first commercialized fast neutron reactors to be operational, and its likely demand for uranium resources. The fourth examines several spent fuel management scenarios for the present period up until 2035: the financial cost and proliferation risk of each scenario is evaluated. The study concludes that China can and should maintain a reprocessing operation to meet its R&D activities before its fast reactor program is further developed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As of September 2012, only energy-efficient lighting sources will be allowed for sale. Among these are halogen light bulbs, light-emitting diodes (LED), or compact fluorescent light bulbs-often referred to as energy-saving light bulbs. The Commission's justification for the phase-out of conventional light bulbs maintains that a reduction in the electricity consumed will not only lead to lower energy cost for private households and industrial consumers, but at the same time lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This article discusses possible reasons for the slow market diffusion of energy-saving light bulbs and shows that the investment in energy-efficient light bulbs does not necessarily lead to significant cost reductions. Drawing on some illustrative examples, we demonstrate that the use of cheaper incandescent bulbs instead of energy-saving light bulbs can be economically rational in cases of rather low usage times, in which the higher initial purchasing price might only pay off after very long time spans. Furthermore, due to the coexistence with the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), this regulation attains no additional emission reductions beyond those achieved by the ETS alone. We thus conclude that the general ban of incandescent light bulbs is inappropriate and should be abolished by the Commission. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Within a framework of human capital and self-selection theory we try to identify the individual characteristics and motivations linked to the migration pattern. The overall results of this procedure suggest that there is a key difference between NE double right arrow SE movers and SE double right arrow NE movers. (1) SE double right arrow NE movers were adverse self-selected in terms of observable education characteristics. (2) No self-selection could be observed among migrants in the NE double right arrow SE direction. In general the North-East seems less attractive to highly skilled people. (3) Labor market segmentation with respect to sector occupation is likely. (4) There are clear differences in income determinants between movers and non movers. The majority of migrants except for migrants with higher education cannot expect to realize a return to education comparable to the average in the region of departure or destination. However, in the context of the Borjas selection model the returns to education analysis would predict a different pattern of migrant selectivity than the one observed in Brazil. Apart from soft characteristics connected to the regions we believe, that the large share of the non formal labor market is likely to indicate a surplus labor leading to a migration pattern different than expected from selection theory.","[Gries, Thomas; Kraft, Manfred; Pieck, Christina] Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Ctr Int Econ, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany",University of Paderborn,"Gries, T (通讯作者)，Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Ctr Int Econ, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",thomas.gries@notes.upb.de,"Napierala, Joanna/AAU-1256-2020",,,,,,23,12,13,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

A number of estimates have suggested that tidal power may become a sizeable fraction of overall electricity generation, however these estimates have been largely based on a resource assessment methodology that dramatically oversimplifies the physical phenomenon at play. This paper develops a model that considers the effect of energy extraction on the bulk flow, showing that tidal energy inventories that assess solely kinetic energy flux may represent both an order-of-magnitude overestimation of the resource and a significant oversimplification of regulatory impacts. The interplay between the characteristics of a flow and the regulatory and economic issues will likely limit tidal power generation to levels significantly below the physical maximums. Permitted flow reduction, turbine design and staging of development all have significant and predictable impacts on the extractible resource. Energy planners must therefore understand these relationships in order to appropriately assess the magnitude of generation that can be realistically be produced from tidal energy.

By employing the Johansen method of cointegration, the study finds that there is a quadratic long-run relationship between carbon emissions and income, confirming the existence of Environmental Kuznets Curve for Pakistan. Moreover, both energy consumption and foreign trade are found to have positive effects on emissions. The short-run results have, however, denied the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve. The short-run results are unique to the existing literature in the sense that none of the long-run determinants of emissions is significant. The contradictory results of short- and long-run give policy makers the opportunity to formulate different types of growth policies for the two terms taking environmental issues into consideration. In addition, the uni-directional causality from growth to energy consumption suggests that the policy makers should not only focus on forecasting future demand for energy with different growth scenarios but also on obtaining the least cost energy. Furthermore, the absence of causality from emissions to growth suggests that Pakistan can curb its carbon emissions without disturbing its economic growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It also has not undertaken measures to reduce the volume of additional waste produced by both existing and newly planned reactors. The DOE has instead opted to undertake research to develop new cycles that burn the radioactive waste. This policy appears subordinated to obvious political pressures. It is short sighted in terms of a practical program to serve the interests of the clean and safe energy requirements of the country. The essay also describes technical initiatives and processes that are recommended for a better solution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To effectively address these questions to improve performance, the power generation and pollution control efficiencies are evaluated using TODEA (two-objective data envelopment analysis), as well as the overall efficiency evaluated using Tone's NS-overall model (slacks-based measure with non-separable desirable and undesirable outputs for evaluating overall efficiency). A MSWI case study in Taiwan with the panel data covering the period of 2004-2008 reveals that the power generation and overall efficiencies of build-operate-transfer are more efficient, on average, than those of public-own-operate and build-own-operate. However, the three building and operation types do not significantly differ in pollution control efficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the relative importance of asymmetric shocks, being around 20% in the long run, cannot be ignored. Moreover, when we estimate the model for the UK and US, the degree of business cycle synchronization seems to be higher.

On the basis of a sociological study, which consisted of a survey and artists' comments, the author concludes that in Latvia the number of artists who can live from their artistic earnings is comparatively small. Besides, there is a complicated legal framework in the area of single-entry bookkeeping in Latvia, and, as revealed by a number of surveys, artists' knowledge of the system of regulatory enactments as a rule is insufficient. These circumstances should be regarded as significant obstacles for undertaking business activity. In the author's opinion, these factors have a major impact on the Latvian economy. Factors hindering artists' economic activity include increasing of the personal income tax rate from 15% to 26% and increasing of the value added tax rate from 18% to 21%. To facilitate the development of artists' economic activity, Latvia should review the relevant requirements of regulatory enactments and to determine a reduced personal income tax rate of 15% and VAT rate of 5% on the sale of works of art since the time period for selling works of art cannot be projected.","[Abolina, Ilze; Kaire, Laimota] Univ Latvia, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,ilze.abolina@lu.lv,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,360.0,363,,,,,,4,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100048,0

R. and PARTRIDGE M. D. Urban footprints in rural Canada: employment spillovers by city size, Regional Studies. Growing rural-to-urban commuting epitomizes a de facto regionalization process that is unique for each urban area and its spatial setting. In evaluating these relationships, commuting patterns for 115 Canadian urban areas are estimated empirically. A novel weighted-averaging process reveals a rich spatial pattern that illustrates significant heterogeneity attributable to differences in urban size and to geographical diversity. Strong distance attenuation effects exhibit non-trivial variations in their intensity and geographic reach across the country. The general patterns are consistent with urban hierarchy notions of functional regions that both compete with and overlap one another. Governance and infrastructure planning would benefit from understanding these interdependencies.","[Ali, Kamar; Olfert, M.

In principle, the sampling design can be modified in later stages or replications to allow for more efficient estimation of causal effects. We consider the design of a two-stage experiment for estimating an average treatment effect when covariate information is available for experimental subjects. We use data from the first stage to choose a conditional treatment assignment rule for units in the second stage of the experiment. This amounts to choosing the propensity score, the conditional probability of treatment given covariates. We propose to select the propensity score to minimize the asymptotic variance bound for estimating the average treatment effect.

Metropolitan specialization and variety at different aggregation levels of a US patent classification system are assessed using Theil's relative entropy index. The results show that specialization and variety are not competing features of urban technological structure; cities can have both. The invention rate positively associates with specialization in diverse technologies. The cross-fertilization of ideas among skilled professionals with different expertise and the interaction between specialists of narrow fields of knowledge are both important in technological advance.

We look at the impact of TOA on environmental cooperation in a framework of coalition stability. Using a numerical model, we analyze the differences of several TOA and how they interact. We find that participation in and environmental effectiveness of the IEA are raised less effectively when the TOA focuses on research cooperation in mitigation technology rather than cooperation on augmenting productivity in the private good sector. This is due to the former having an effect on all actors via emissions, whereas effects of the latter are exclusive to research partners. For the same reason, we find that restricting research cooperation to the coalition is only credible when it focuses on productivity. Technology standards that reduce the emission intensity of production are unlikely to raise participation by themselves and may suffer from inefficiencies. However, these disadvantages do not apply when standards are implemented as a complementary instrument. Separately negotiated technology standards may hence facilitate participation in an IEA without adding to its complexity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We show how to derive upper and lower bounds for the population poverty rate using the sample evidence, an upper bound on the probability of misclassifying people into poor and nonpoor, and instrumental or monotone instrumental variable assumptions. By using the European Community Household Panel, we compute bounds for the poverty rate in 10 European countries and study the sensitivity of poverty comparisons across countries to missing data and measurement error problems.

First of all, the sharp upsurge of socio-economic dissimilarities between the major centers of administrative-territorial entities and other areas inside the state transpires. The sharp decrease of GDP and the unjusttified budget deficit, critical growth of unemployment in the depressive regions, aggravation of environmental and, especially, economic problems require scientifically founded approaches to the issues of the regional aligning and management. An effort to hold in check the growth of regional disproportions undermining the social and economic foundations of the territorial integrity of the country constitutes one of the protective functions of the state. In the Latvian Republic in the late 90-ties of the 20th century an attempt was made to implement the administrative-territorial and regional reforms. However, due to aggravation of the crisis situation the reforms acquired crisp outlines only in 2010. The reforms in the area of the regional development should be linked the strengthening of the regulatory function of the state and the amplification of the weight of the local governments, which, in turn, requires the approaches to the formation of the budgetary policy and the inter-budgetary relations at the regional level to be changed. In this connection, the deficiency of the finance resources for the budget and substantial endowments to the municipal entities constitute the central problem, for, as the research has demonstrated, there have been no improvements in the living standard of the Latvian people, while, with the economic backwardness and high poverty level there are no real prerequisites and potential to promote the regional territorial development. In formation of the state budget income and self-government budgets, the budget planning in proportion with the taxation capacity (financial potential) across the sectors in the regions would be justified, while implementing the state protection for the policy selected for the post-crisis recovery and subsequent development. The authors of the article substantiate the necessity and the possibility of altering the approaches to formation of the inter-budgetary policy at the regional level making use of the result-based technologies. The methods of purposeful program planning made use of will ensure that the interrelations between the expenditure of the self-governments and the expected results are reflected accurately and clearly.","[Reshina, Galina; Vocish, Arkadij] Balt Int Acad, LV-1019 Riga, Latvia",,,reshinaganna@inbox.lv; vocish@bsa.edu.lv,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,247.0,255,,,,,,9,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100033,0

Similar to cheese and fluid milk, dairy processing of these products can be energy intensive. In this paper, we analyzed production and energy data compiled through extensive literature reviews on butter, concentrated milk, milk and whey powder processing across various countries and plants. Magnitudes of national final and primary specific energy consumption (SEC) exhibited large variations across dairy products; in addition, the final SEC of individual plants and products exhibited significant variations within a country and between countries. Furthermore, we quantified national energy intensity indicators (Ells) accounting for dairy product mixes and technological advancement. The significant variations of SEC and Ell values indicate a high degree of likelihood that there is significant potential for energy savings in the global dairy processing industry. Based upon the study samples, we estimate potential energy savings for dairy processing industry in selected countries, and estimates annual reduction of 9-14 million metric-ton carbon-equivalent(1) could be achieved if measures are implemented to lower SEC values by 50-80% in half of global dairy plants.

The central goals of this paper are (1) to propose a simple typology of institutional and socio-cultural barriers to action by gathering insights from an inter-disciplinary set of literatures. (2) to explore the ways that these barriers influence the utilization of various forms of capacity to achieve greenhouse gas reduction and resiliency in three case study communities, and (3) to understand the dynamic interactions amongst, and relative importance of, these barriers at the local level. The evidence presented in this paper indicates that barriers are deeply interwoven phenomena, which may reinforce one another and create substantial inertia behind unsustainable patterns of municipal operations Nevertheless, the same factors that can inhibit action on climate change (such as an organizational culture of combativeness or mutual disrespect) can also facilitate it (as with a culture of collaboration or innovation). This article suggests that a deeper understanding of the ways in which barriers can be transformed into enablers of action is a critical next step in the evolution climate change policy design and implementation at the local level.

A welfare analysis, which focuses specifically on the integration of the Italian market, will certainly be a useful support to any policy decision. We argue that, given the peculiarities of the Italian market design, a volume coupling solution could avoid, at the moment, the costs of what could be a significant harmonization effort and, in the end, it might constitute the best short-term strategy.

The fuel economy of different vehicle types is subject to variation of government regulations; hence the fuel consumption of passenger cars (PCs), light trucks (Lts), heavy trucks (Hts), buses and motor cycles (MCs) are calculated with respect to (i) the number of vehicles, (ii) distance traveled, and (iii) fuel economy. On the other hand, the consumption rate of alternative energy sources (i.e. ethanol, methanol, biomass-diesel and CNG) is not evaluated here. The number of vehicles is evaluated using the economic elastic coefficient method, relating to per capita gross domestic product (GDP) from 1997 to 2007. The Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) system software is employed to develop a simple model to project fuel consumption in China until 2030 under these scenarios. Three energy consumption decrease scenarios are designed to estimate the reduction of fuel consumption: (i) 'business as usual' (BAU); (ii) 'advanced fuel economy' (AFE); and (iii) 'alternative energy replacement' (AER). It is shown that fuel consumption is predicted to reach 992.28 Mtoe (million tons oil equivalent) with the BAU scenario by 2030. In the AFE and AER scenarios, fuel consumption is predicted to be 734.68 and 600.36 Mtoe, respectively, by 2030. In the AER scenario, fuel consumption in 2030 will be reduced by 391.92 (39.50%) and 134.29 (18.28%) Mtoe in comparison to the BAU and AFE scenarios, respectively. In conclusion, our models indicate that the energy conservation policies introduced by governmental institutions are potentially viable, as long as they are effectively implemented.

These two sectors make up the largest portions of energy consumption in developing countries. However, due to multiple barriers and lack of effective polices, energy efficiency in dispersed energy end-use sectors has not been effectively put into practice. The new NAMA framework described in this paper is designed to fulfill the demand for public policies and public sector investment in developing countries and thereby boost private sector investment through project based market mechanisms, such as CDM. The new NAMA framework is designed as a need-based mechanism which effectively considers the conditions of each developing country. The building sector is used as an example to demonstrate how NAMA measures can be registered and implemented. The described new NAMA framework has the ability to interface efficiently with Kyoto Protocol mechanisms and to facilitate a systematic uptake for GHG emission reduction investment projects.

The results suggest that natural gas and coal prices have profound impacts on the carbon price needed to induce CCS. To extend previous analyses we develop a cost region graph that models technology choice as a function of carbon and fuel prices. Generally, the least-cost technology at low carbon prices is pulverized, coal, while intermediate carbon prices favor natural gas technologies and high carbon prices favor coal gasification with capture. However, the specific carbon prices at which these transitions occur is largely determined by the price of natural gas. For instance, the CCS-justifying carbon price ranges from $27/t CO2 at high natural gas prices to $54/t CO2 at low natural gas prices. This result has important implications for potential climate change legislation. The capital costs of the generation and CO2 capture plant are also highly important, while pipeline distance and criteria pollutant control are less significant. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The main reason does not seem to be geography, operating environment or industry structure. GB and Victoria have managed to accommodate increasirig demand at broadly constant or even declining costs and revenues while delivering higher quality of service, while NSW has not. The regulatory framework and the practice of the regulatory body within that framework seem relevant. Australian regulators have not used benchmarking techniques as the GB regulator has. Perhaps the most important explanatory factor is private ownership in GB and Victoria compared to state ownership in NSW. This could also impact on the nature and effectiveness of regulation.

We develop a two-plus-ten-region energy-focused computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that acknowledges land competition in analysing the sub-state local-regional economic implications of such a strategy, embedded within a global context. Our model is based on a full cost analysis of selected biomass technologies covering a range of agricultural and forestry crops, as well as thermal insulation. The local-regional macroeconomic effects differ significantly across technologies and are governed by factors such as net labour intensity in crop production. The high land intensity of agricultural biomass products crowds out conventional agriculture, and thus lowers employment and drives up land prices and the consumer price index. The regional economic results show that net employment effects are positive for all forestry based biomass energy, and also show for which agriculture based biomass systems this is true, even when accounting for land competition.

The instrument is a systematic interrogative tool for evaluating energy security of individual states or regions. It consists of eleven broad energy security dimensions associated with the current global energy system. These energy security dimensions take into account numerous quantitative and qualitative attributes of each country's energy security and policy, and include both traditional energy security concerns and many new factors, such as environmental, sociocultural and technological. Another dimension, largely absent from previous analyses, is the existence of, and the issues addressed in. energy security policy in each country. This instrument serves as an assessment system with which to evaluate energy security in the Asia-Pacific region. The existing studies on energy security in the Asia-Pacific region suffer from serious limitations. No study to date examines regional energy security policies by adopting a more comprehensive energy security definition as a starting point. Most studies also focus on a single country or issue. Even if they examine energy security in major regional economies, they lack critical comparative analysis. The instrument is valuable as it may be utilised to draw a comprehensive map of regional energy security situation, which can also include comparative analysis of energy security characteristics across the Asia-Pacific region. Ultimately, it may be utilised to set up a framework for improved regional energy cooperation with the aim of providing regional leaders with a blueprint for improving regional energy security and policy.

The results from our estimation provide evidence supporting the EKC hypothesis, and the estimated models are shown to be stable over the sample period. The uni-direction running from other variables to CO2 emissions are confirmed from the casualty tests.

Carbon dioxide, produced from almost every energy consuming activity, is the dominant greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. Water desalination is an energy intensive activity, and when it is powered by conventional energy sources, significant amounts of CO2 are released. For every cubic metre of fresh water produced, there is a 2 kg of CO2 reduction if renewable energy sources (RES) are used instead of electricity from the local grid. On the other hand, the cost of fresh water produced by desalination is much less if conventional sources of energy are used. Making appropriate policy choices require information on both costs and benefits. So here we estimate the critical CO2 cost, above which desalination units should use renewable energy instead of conventional energy sources. It was found that the critical CO2 emissions cost can be close to the CO2 capture cost and in many cases less than the penalties imposed by the European Commission. Several case studies of water desalination in the Aegean islands verify the conclusions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Main goal is to incorporate the prioritization criteria for the assessment of various energy policies for power alternatives, and evaluating these policies against these criteria. The three types of EPPs reviewed in this study are: electricity production from wind farms in the future, existing coal-based thermal power plants and planned nuclear power plants. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is utilized to assess the main and sub-factors of EPPs. Main factors such as economic, technical, social and environmental are assigned in first level of the AHP. The importance weights of factors are produced and priority values with realistic numbers are obtained using Fuzzy-AHP Chang's Model. Priority value for wind energy was determined as two times higher than the others when making the ultimate decision. On aggregate, importance weights of environmental (0.68) and social (0.69) factors make wind power leader. Sub-factors such as public acceptance, waste-emission and environmental impacts cause both nuclear and thermal power to have the lowest priority numbers. Additionally, the CO2 emissions trade was determined to be a very important criterion associated with both economic and environmental factors according to Kyoto Protocol. This study concludes that Turkey's existing thermal power stations should gradually be substituted by renewable energy options according to a schedule of Turkish energy policies in future.

The difference with its actual cost defines a social cost of wind power which is further divided into a technological and an adequacy component. Whereas the former may become negligible once thermal technologies pay for carbon emissions, the latter is a lower bound on WPG structural weakness w.r.t. thermal technologies. We apply our procedure to Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Portugal and Ireland using hourly load and WPG data over several years. Our empirical findings show that there is a grain of truth in both the pros and the cons of wind power. The system value of WPG varies from three quarters of the equivalent thermal cost of electricity (on a yearly basis) but the incompressible adequacy cost represents a premium over the cost of serving yearly load in a system ranging around one-fifth.

Critics claim the scale of reductions that the CDM is driving in the developing world is insufficient from a scientific perspective if we are to avoid dangerous climate change, that the project-by-project crediting process is inefficient, and that the reductions being achieved are not additional-meaning they would have happened anyway and thus should not be financially supported. Yet, the efficacy of CDM must be examined in the broader context of carbon mitigation in the developing world and the actions that are taking place. This paper examines the role that the CDM has played in promoting renewable energy development in China in order to assess how international carbon finance can best be used to help promote emissions mitigation in the developing world.

International attention is being given to quantifying such emissions. This paper presents the results of research into international cruise ship journeys to and from New Zealand. CO2 emissions from such journeys were calculated using an activity based, or bottom-up, model. Emissions factors for individual journeys by cruise ships to or from New Zealand in 2007 ranged between 250 and 2200 g of CO2 per passenger-kilometre (g CO2 per p-km), with a weighted mean of 390 g CO2 per p-km. The weighted mean energy use per passenger night for the hotel function of these cruise vessels was estimated as 1600 MJ per visitor night, 12 times larger than the value for a land-based hotel. Using a simple price elasticities calculation, international cruise journeys for transport purposes were found to have a greater relative decrease in demand than plane journeys when the impact of carbon pricing was analysed. The potential to decrease the CO2 emissions per p-km was examined, and if passenger accommodation was compacted and some luxury amenities dispensed with values similar to those of economy-class air travel were obtained.

Recently, sudden supply disruption caused by international disputes outside the EU have created serious problems for some EU countries and raised concern in many others. In these situations, it is highly desirable to have a tool to assess possible outcomes of supply disruptions. This paper presents a newly developed model, MC-GENERCIS, aimed to assess the robustness of the EU transnational gas transmission system during both normal and special operating conditions, including high-demand situations and/or a supply shortage. The model has a country-by-country resolution and examines all possible dispatching choices of national TSOs on the basis of a probabilistic MonteCarlo approach. The preliminary validation of the model through its application to the normal conditions for the winter 2008-2009 and to the recent supply disruption involving Ukrainian gas transit is also described.

The Coal Utility Environmental Cost (CUECost) model is used to estimate retrofit costs for five different NO control configurations on a large subset of the existing coal-fired, utility-owned boilers in the US. The resultant data are used to create technology-specific marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs) and also serve as input to an integer linear program, which minimizes system-wide control costs by finding the optimal distribution of NOx controls across the modeled boilers under an emission constraint. The result is a single optimized MACC that accounts for detailed, boiler-specific information related to NOx retrofits. Because the resultant MACCs do not take into account regional differences in air-quality standards or pre-existing NOx controls, the results should not be interpreted as a policy prescription. The general method as well as NOx-specific results presented here should be of significant value to modelers and policy analysts who must estimate the costs of pollution reduction.

Species diversity is inevitably impaired by anthropogenic impact. Thus, the economic and ecological systems compete for space and the question arises as to how this conflict should be resolved. The decisive parameters of the model are related to biological diversity (endemism vs. redundancy of species) and the patterns of economic geography (centrifugal vs. centripetal forces).

Using the production parameter, depletion-rate-of-recoverable-resources, we have analyzed the four crude oil fractions and found that the 75 Mb/d of crude oil production forecast for year 2030 appears significantly overstated, and is more likely to be in the region of 55 Mb/d. Moreover, analysis of the other fractions strongly suggests lower than expected production levels. In total, our analysis points to a world oil supply in 2030 of 75 Mb/d, some 26 Mb/d lower than the IEA predicts. The connection between economic growth and energy use is fundamental in the IEA's present modelling approach. Since our forecast sees little chance of a significant increase in global oil production, our findings suggest that the policy makers, investors and end users to whom WEO 2008 is addressed should rethink their future plans for economic growth, The fact that global oil production has very probably passed its maximum implies that we have reached the Peak of the Oil Age.

The respective coefficients for real gross fixed capital formation and the labor force are positive and statistically significant whereas the coefficient for coal consumption is negative and statistically significant.

A great variety of mathematical methods have been used for demand forecasting. The development and improvement of appropriate mathematical tools will lead to more accurate demand forecasting techniques. In order to forecast the monthly electric power demand per hour in Spain for 2 years, this paper presents a comparison between a new forecasting approach considering vector autoregressive (VAR) forecasting models applied to interval time series (ITS) and the iMLP, the multi-layer perceptron model adapted to interval data. In the proposed comparison, for the VAR approach two models are fitted per every hour, one composed of the centre (mid-point) and radius (half-range), and another one of the lower and upper bounds according to the interval representation assumed by the ITS in the learning set. In the case of the iMLP, only the model composed of the centre and radius is fitted. The other interval representation composed of the lower and upper bounds is obtained from the linear combination of the two. This novel approach, obtaining two bivariate models each hour, makes possible to establish, for different periods in the day, which interval representation is more accurate. Furthermore, the comparison between two different techniques adapted to interval time series allows us to determine the efficiency of these models in forecasting electric power demand. It is important to note that the iMLP technique has been selected for the comparison, as it has shown its accuracy in forecasting daily electricity price intervals. This work shows the ITS forecasting methods as a potential tool that will lead to a reduction in risk when making power system planning and operational decisions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

What attracts human capital? Understanding the skill composition of interregional job matches in Germany, Regional Studies. By examining pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors in the destination choices of heterogeneous job movers, this paper tries to explain the skill composition of interregional job matches in Germany. It thus provides insights on how policy can affect the spatial allocation of human capital to promote convergence between regions such as eastern and western Germany. Estimates from a nested logit model suggest that the spatial pattern of job moves by high-skilled individuals are mainly driven by interregional income differentials, while interregional job matches by less-skilled individuals are mainly determined by interregional differentials in job opportunities. The role of regional amenities in attracting high-skilled labour turns out to be less clear.","ZEW, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Arntz, M (通讯作者)，ZEW, POB 10 34 43, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany.",arntz@zew.de,,,,,,,46,61,75,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Given these truths, two key questions must be addressed to develop a low-carbon economy: how to use coal in a carbon-constrained future? How to increase domestic oil supply to enhance energy security? Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) may be a technological solution that can deal with today's energy and environmental needs while enabling China to move closer to a low-carbon energy future. This paper has been developed to propose a possible CCS roadmap for China. To develop the roadmap, we first explore major carbon capture opportunities in China and then identify critical CCS-enabling technologies, as well as analyze their current status and future prospects. We find that coal gasification or polygeneration in combination with CCS could be a nearly unbeatable combination for China's low-carbon future. Even without CCS, gasification offers many benefits: once coal is gasified into syngas, it can be used for many different purposes including for alternative fuels production, thereby increasing the domestic oil supply and the flexibility of the energy system.

As part of this regulatory process, incentives are put in place to improve the cost efficiency of network companies by rewarding good performance relative to a pre-defined benchmark. The techniques used to establish benchmarks are central to the efficiency improvements that are ultimately achieved. Much experience has been gained internationally in the application of benchmarking techniques and we now have a solid understanding of the main indicators of best practice. What we are lacking is a more complete understanding of the factors that influence choice of methods by regulators. In this paper, we present the results of an international survey of energy regulators in 40 countries conducted electronically between June and October 2008. Regulators from European, Australasian and Latin American countries are represented in the survey. Our results show that benchmarking techniques are now widespread in the regulation of gas and electricity networks. Best practice, however, is limited to a small number of regulators. We conclude by summarising existing trends and offering some recommendations on overcoming barriers to best practice efficiency analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyze employment growth in terms of conventional determinants-investments, wages, income, and specialization indices of industrial, distribution and business services activities-and three latent knowledge economy components (density of knowledge workers, R&D and innovativeness) for the Netherlands based on a sample of 496 municipalities. We apply a structural equation model (SEM) made up of a measurement model that relates the latent knowledge economy components to their observable indicators and a structural model that estimates the impacts of the determinants on employment growth. In addition to the conventional determinants and the knowledge economy components, the SEM accounts for spatial spillover effects, degree of urbanization and core-periphery dichotomy. The latent variables 'density of knowledge workers' and 'innovativeness' have significant and strong impacts. Since they are more common in larger than smaller urban agglomerations, we conclude that the impacts of these variables on employment growth are stronger in the former than the latter. The latent variable 'R&D-intensity' is not significantly, positively related to urban employment growth. This suggests that policy should emphasize innovation output and knowledge workers density rather than R&D to capture urban growth potentials in the knowledge economy.","[van Oort, Frank G.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Oud, Johan H.

That document reports on IEA scenarios for baseline and low-CO(2) alternative scenarios to 2050, across the energy economy. The study included creating scenarios for transport, using the IEA Mobility Model (MoMo). This paper reports on the transport-related ETP scenarios and describes the model used in the analysis. According to the ETP Baseline scenario, world transport energy use and CO(2) emissions will more than double by 2050. In the most challenging scenario, called BLUE, transport emissions are reduced by 70% in 2050 compared to their baseline level in that year (and about 25% below their 2005 levels). There are several versions of the BLUE scenario, but all involve: a 50% or greater improvement in LDV efficiency, 30-50% improvement in efficiency of other modes (e.g. trucks, ships and aircraft), 25% substitution of liquid fossil fuels by biofuels, and considerable penetration of electric and/or fuel-cell vehicles. In the second half of this paper, an overview of the MoMo model is provided. Details on the complete analysis are contained in the ETP 2008 document, available at www.iea.org.

For instance, their CO2 emission levels have increased tremendously since 1990. This research estimates energy and 'exergy (available energy)' efficiencies in Japan's residential/commercial sectors during the period 1990-2006. Since an exergy analysis reveals 'available energy losses', it is an effective tool to achieve sustainable societies. The primary objective of this paper is to examine the potential for advancing the 'true' energy efficiency in Japan's residential/commercial sectors-by observing energy and exergy efficiency disparities. The results show large differences between the overall energy and exergy efficiencies in the residential (60.12%, 6.33%)/commercial sectors (51.78%, 5.74%) in 2006. This implies great potential for energy savings in both sectors. Furthermore, this research suggests that the residential sector may face more difficulties than the commercial sector, although the latter appears to be less energy-efficient, according to recent statistics. This is because the disparity between energy and exergy efficiencies has expanded in the residential sector since 2000. This study illustrates the importance of exergy analyses in promoting sustainable energy policies and new adaptation strategies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It further examines possible industry responses, and identifies and provides a preliminary evaluation of potential opportunities to mitigate these impacts. The industry sectors investigated - steel, aluminum, chemicals and paper - are among the largest industrial users of fossil fuels in the US economy. The results of this examination show that climate policies that put a price on carbon could have substantial impacts on the competitiveness of US energy-intensive manufacturing sectors over the next two decades, if climate regulations are applied only in the United States, and no action is taken to invest in advanced low- and no-carbon technologies. The extent of these impacts will vary across industries, depending on their energy intensities, the mix of energy sources they rely on and how energy is used in production activities (heat and power, feedstock). Of relevance is also the speed and rigor with which industries adopt new technologies and retire (or replace) old ones. Other factors affecting these impacts include an industry's vulnerability to foreign imports and its ability to pass through cost increases to its customers in the face of international market competition.

This essay is to analyze the relation between energy intensity and technological progress by Cobb-Douglas production function in which energy, labor, capital and technological progress are taken as independent variables. It proves that the growth of output per capital and output per labor will increase energy intensity while technological progress will decrease energy intensity. Empirical research on Chinese industry is used here to indicate technological progress greatly decreases energy intensity. Because of the interferences of Asian financial crisis, there is something abnormal in the data. So in the empirical research, average weaken buffer operator (ABWO) is applied to weaken the interference of Asian financial crisis to the fixed assets, energy and value added. The results of the empirical research show that technological progress decreases energy intensity of Chinese industry an average of 6.3% every year in China. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We claim that the ongoing reduction of manufacturing trade costs may generate a net inflow of global demand towards the industrialized cores of developing countries. This will induce a reallocation of labor from traditional to modern sectors. In turn, such a sectoral shift may enlarge the catch-up (imitation) potential of developing countries and raise global growth rates, due to Grossman and Helpman's complementarity between imitative and innovative activities.

Except Papua New Guinea, none of the 14 PICs has fossil any fuel resources. Consequently, the other 13 PICs are totally dependent on oil imports for their economic activities. Since PICs have limited foreign exchange earning capacities, as they have a very narrow range of exports and are highly dependent on foreign aid, high oil prices in recent months have seriously tested their economic resilience. This paper applies the ARDL bounds testing methodology to four selected PICs, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu, which have consistent and reliable time series of data, with a view to assess the impact of oil price on economic growth. The findings are that oil price, gross domestic product and international reserve are cointegrated in all the four PICs. Further, both in the long and short runs, we observe that there is a uni-directional relationship as causality linkage runs only from oil price and international reserves to economic growth. The paper makes some policy recommendations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

By using concepts related to natural gas industry and the relations among the components of transmission and distribution network, a six-level supply chain has been introduced and presented schematically. The defined supply chain is a single-objective, multi-period, and single-product problem that is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming model, which can easily be linearized. The objective of this model is to minimize direct or indirect distribution costs. There are six groups of constraints including capacity, input and output balancing, demand satisfaction, network flow continuity, and relative constraints to the required binary variables. The solution algorithm of the problem is hierarchical; in each step, one section of the problem is solved using an exact method; the outputs of this section are passed to the next relative section as inputs. Finally, it is shown that the problem has been solved in a reasonable time and desirable results are attained. The use of proposed model and its solution approach have been studied in two gas trunk lines, to present the priority of its cost saving. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, energy demand for air conditioning is projected to increase rapidly over the whole 2000-2100 period, mostly driven by income growth. The associated CO2 emissions for both heating and cooling increase from 0.8 Gt C in 2000 to 2.2 Gt C in 2100, i.e. about 12% of total CO2 emissions from energy use (the strongest increase occurs in Asia). The net effect or climate change on global energy use and emissions is relatively small as decreases in heating are compensated for by increases in cooling. However, impacts on heating and cooling individually are considerable in this scenario, with heating energy demand decreased by 34% worldwide by 2100 as a result of climate change, and air-conditioning energy demand increased by 72%. At the regional scale considerable impacts can be seen, particularly in South Asia, where energy demand for residential air conditioning Could increase by around 50% due to climate change, compared with the situation without climate change.

Being a net oil importer, Thai government has declared a renewable energy development programme in order to secure sustainable development and energy security. Thailand spends more than 10% of GDP for energy imports and transport sector accounts for 36% of total final energy consumption of which 50% is diesel. Diesel marks a huge impact on Thai economy. Thai government's bio-diesel development strategy is to replace 10% of petro-diesel in transport sector by bio-diesel by 2012. The plan is to increase the use of bio-diesel from 365 million liters in 2007 to 3100 million liters by 2012. This paper reviews the current status and potential of bio-diesel in Thailand and investigates and discusses the qualities and weaknesses of the proposed road-map.

Despite significant poverty reduction since the late 1980s, Vietnam has seen a growing imbalance in regional development patterns. Recent research from Northern countries suggests that 'single universities in peripheral regions' (Boucher et al., 2003) can be key actors in regional development. This perspective is applied to the role of Vinh University within a rural region of Vietnam. The long-term, localized presence of universities in Southern countries represents an alternative to short-term, foreign development projects.

Service competitiveness and urban innovation policies in the UK: the implications of the 'London paradox', Regional Studies. The policy models currently employed in British cities to promote urban economic innovativeness and competitiveness echo national policies by being science-, manufacturing- and technology-based. Yet, the most powerful driver of both modern UK economic success and regional and urban inequality has been London-based innovation. This does not depend on local technological initiatives, but on labour-intensive, knowledge-based processes, especially within the financial and business services. This paper examines the importance of service-based innovation and competitiveness in the English urban system, dominated by London, and its implications for urban innovation policies. These currently offer little support to other UK cities either in gaining from London's experience of service-led success, or challenging its dominance over the most innovative tradable services.","UCL, Dept Geog, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Wood, P (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Geog, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",p.wood@geog.ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,34,34,3,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

W.-C. Regional development and the competitive dynamics of global production networks: an East Asian perspective, Regional Studies. The debate on the nature and dynamics of regional development in both academic and policy circles has now moved on from the earlier focus on endogenous regional assets to analysing the complex relationship between globalization and regional change. This position paper attempts to engage with this debate through the experience of regional development in East Asia. The paper shows that regional development cannot be understood independently of the changing dynamics of global production networks. While the existing literature on East Asia tends to focus on the state as the key driver of economic development at the national and regional levels, it is argued that the developmental state is a necessary but not sufficient condition for regional development to take place. Instead, one needs to study the complex strategic coupling of those economic actors, particularly large business firms, operating in specific regions in Asia with their lead firm counterparts orchestrating production networks on a global basis. To illustrate these strategic coupling processes and their impact on divergent regional development trajectories, the author draws upon his own primary data and other papers to be published in this special issue of Regional Studies. The paper concludes with some major implications for theorizing regional development and strategic regional policy options.

Energy and exergy efficiencies have been determined for the devices used in the agricultural sector of Malaysia, where petrol, diesel and fuel oil are used to run the machineries. Energy and exergy flow diagrams for the overall efficiencies of Malaysian agricultural sector are presented as well. The average overall energy and exergy efficiencies of this sector were found to be 22% and 20.728%, respectively, within the period from 1991 to 2009. These figures were found to be lower than those of Norway but higher than Turkey. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Ahamed, J. U.; Saidur, R.; Masjuki, H. H.; Ali, M. B.; Furqon, M.

This megaproject, to be completed in late 2011, provided an improved household cooking fuel, with its associated benefits in user costs, cleanliness, convenience, and environment, and reduced the government's huge subsidy for petroleum fuels. Presented from the perspective of Pertamina, Indonesia's sole NOC, and the program implementer, this paper describes the background of the fuels situation, the planning stages, including the preparatory analytical work, targeted market surveys and tests, and the subsequent building of the financial, technical, and institutional models for carrying out the program on an expeditious schedule. It presents the project's major execution steps, results of the program to date, and the unique institutional roles of each party, including the activities and benefits for the government, Pertamina, the public, the industry, and the crucial agents in the fuel supply chains. Finally there is a retrospective policy analysis and a discussion of key factors and challenges in the execution of Indonesia's largest-ever energy initiative to provide improved cooking fuel.

In order to appreciate these differences, a general supply and demand scheme has been suggested to measure the rate of entrepreneurship of an economy in the long term. This rate can be seen to depend on the level of development, the economic growth and the unemployment rate. However, the degree of competitive creativity linked to the entrepreneurial activity in its early, starting and establishing stages, particularly from a regional perspective, is not so well known. This is calculated using various indicators based on entrepreneurial decisions derived from the timing, sector and location opportunity when starting a business, as well as others that assess the commitment to innovation in dynamic markets generating emerging products. This paper analyses entrepreneurial activity from this completely new perspective, applying this to the Spanish regions (NUTS-1), with the intention of providing some useful results for research in this area.","[Garcia-Tabuenca, Antonio; Luis Crespo-Espert, Jose; Cuadrado-Roura, Juan R.] Univ Alcala de Henares, Inst Univ Anal Econ & Social, Alcala de Henares, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,"García-Tabuenca, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala de Henares, Inst Univ Anal Econ & Social, Alcala de Henares, Spain.",antonio.gtabuenca@uah.es; joseluis.crespo@uah.es; jr.cuadrado@uah.es,"Crespo-Espert, José Luis/AAA-6488-2019; Tabuenca, Antonio García/AAB-2475-2019","Crespo-Espert, José Luis/0000-0002-3669-5620;",,,,,19,9,10,1,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Present day global energy models are mostly too aggregate to account for this heterogeneity. Here, a bottom-up model for residential energy use that starts from key dynamic concepts on energy use in developing countries is presented and applied to India. Energy use and fuel choice is determined for five end-use functions (cooking, water heating, space heating, lighting and appliances) and for five different income quintiles in rural and urban areas. The paper specifically explores the consequences of different assumptions for income distribution and rural electrification on residential sector energy use and CO2 emissions, finding that results are clearly sensitive to variations in these parameters. As a result of population and economic growth, total Indian residential energy use is expected to increase by around 65-75% in 2050 compared to 2005, but residential carbon emissions may increase by up to 9-10 times the 2005 level. While a more equal income distribution and rural electrification enhance the transition to commercial fuels and reduce poverty, there is a trade-off in terms of higher CO2 emissions via increased electricity use.

Higher cost resources, such as tar sands and deep off-shore, are considered the best prospects for the future. Economic modelling is currently used to explore future price scenarios commensurate with delivering fuel to market. Energy policy requires modelling scenarios capturing the complexity of resource and extraction aspects as well as the economic profitability of different resources. Energy-return-on-investment (EROI) expresses the profitability of bringing energy products to the market. Net energy yield (NEY) is related to the EROI. NEY is the amount of energy less expenditures necessary to deliver a fuel to the market. This paper proposes a pattern for EROI of oil production, based on historic oil development trends. Methodology and data for EROI is not agreed upon. The proposed EROI function is explored in relation to the available data and used to attenuate the International Energy Agency (IEA) world oil production scenarios to understand the implications of future declining EROI on net energy yield. The results suggest that strategies for management and mitigation of deleterious effects of a peak in oil production are more urgent than might be suggested by analyses focussing only on gross production.

Using four different panel unit root tests it is found that all panel variables are integrated of order 1. From the Johansen Fisher panel cointegration test it is found that there is a cointegration vector among the variables. The Granger causality test results support that there is no evidence of long-run causal relationship, but there is unidirectional short-run causal relationship from economic growth and trade openness to carbon dioxide emissions, from economic growth to energy consumption, from trade openness to economic growth, from urbanization to economic growth and from trade openness to urbanization. It is found that the long-run elasticity of carbon dioxide emissions with respect to energy consumption (1.2189) is higher than short run elasticity of 0.5984. This indicates that over time higher energy consumption in the newly industrialized countries gives rise to more carbon dioxide emissions as a result our environment will be polluted more. But in respect of economic growth, trade openness and urbanization the environmental quality is found to be normal good in the long-run. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates how effectively the 'new' Member States comply with the requirements of Council Directive 2006/67/EC, which imposes the obligation to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products. The empirical focus of this analysis is not only motivated by the practical relevance of this issue, but also by the fact that eleven of the twelve new Member States were given grace periods between one and seven years to bring their national stockholding arrangements in line with the European requirements. The granting of extended deadlines raises the question whether this instrument indeed facilitates the transposition process. The empirical findings show that except for Latvia, compliance with the EU stockholding requirements is generally very good. A more detailed analysis of the Latvian case highlights that the transposition delays principally stem from budgetary constraints. More generally, the individual new Member States' capacity to cope with the financial burdens and the degree of adjustment pressure determine the variation in oil stock levels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology for evaluating the energy mix policy is crucial because of the characteristics of lead time embedded with the power generation facilities investment and the uncertainty of future electricity demand. In this paper, a modified binomial model based on sequential compound options, which may account for the lead time and uncertainty as a whole is established, and a numerical example on evaluating the optional strategies and the strategic value of the cleaner energy policy is also presented. It is found that the optimal decision at some nodes in the binomial tree is path dependent, which is different from the standard sequential compound option model with lead time or time lag concept. The proposed modified binomial sequential compound real options model can be generalized and extensively applied to solve the general decision problems that deal with the long lead time of many government policies as well as capital intensive investments.

The results of the input-output analysis show that net export of CO2 emissions increased quickly from 2002 to 2005 but decreased from 2005 to 2007. These trends are due to a reduction in total CO2 emission intensity, a decrease in the exchange rate, and small imports of embodied CO(2)emissions. The results of the SDA demonstrate that total export volume was the largest driving factor for the increase in embodied CO2 emissions during 2002-2007, followed by intermediate input structure. Direct CO(2)emissions intensity had a negative effect on changes in embodied CO2 emissions. The results suggest that China should establish a framework for allocating emission responsibilities, enhance energy efficiency, and improve intermediate input structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It is argued that two distinct sources of the size distortions can be identified. The first source is the finite-sample distribution of the long-run variance estimator used in the KPSS test, while the second source of the size distortions is the serial correlation not captured by the long-run variance estimator because of a too narrow choice of truncation lag parameter. When the relative importance of the two sources is studied, it is found that the size of the KPSS test can be reasonably well controlled if the finite-sample distribution of the KPSS test statistic, conditional on the time-series dimension and the truncation lag parameter, is used. Hence, finite-sample critical values, which can be applied to reduce the size distortions of the KPSS test, are supplied. When the power of the test is studied, it is found that the price paid for the increased size control is a lower raw power against a non-stationary alternative hypothesis.","Sveriges Riksbank, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden",Sveriges Riksbank,"Jönsson, K (通讯作者)，Sveriges Riksbank, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden.",kristian.jonsson@riksbank.se,,,Crafoord Foundation; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [P2005-0117:1],Crafoord Foundation; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"The author would like to thank Anindya Banerjee, three anonymous referees, Tommy Andersson, David Edgerton, Thomas Elger, Klas Fregert, Rolf Larsson, Johan Lyhagen, Joakim Westerlund and seminar participants at the Department of Economics, Lund University, for useful suggestions and discussions on the topics covered in, and relating to, this paper.

The empirical model that includes capital and labor force as the control variables is estimated for the panel of fourteen OECD countries during the period 1980-2007. Apart from the previous studies in the nuclear energy consumption and economic growth relationship, this study utilizes the novel panel causality approach, which allows both cross-sectional dependency and heterogeneity across countries. The findings show that there is no causality between nuclear energy consumption and economic growth in eleven out of fourteen cases, supporting the neutrality hypothesis. As a sensitivity analysis, we also conduct Toda-Yamamoto time series causality method and find out that the results from the panel causality analysis are slightly different than those from the time-series causality analysis. Thereby, we can conclude that the choice of statistical tools in analyzing the nature of causality between nuclear energy consumption and economic growth may play a key role for policy implications.

We provide the first analysis of the combined effect of these four influencing factors on the future energy demand for room conditioning of residential buildings and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Germany until 2060. We show that the heating energy demand will decrease substantially in the future. This shift will mainly depend on the number of renovated buildings and climate change scenarios and only slightly on demographic changes. The future cooling energy demand will remain low in the future unless the amount of air conditioners strongly increases. As a strong change in the German energy mix is not expected, the future GHG emissions caused by heating will mainly depend on the energy demand for future heating. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

I argue that export orientation and electricity at low variable cost from nuclear and hydropower plants have an interactive effect on energy efficiency innovation. Export-oriented countries have strong incentives to invest in energy efficiency innovation, as they are in a position to export these technology innovations for global markets. But if inexpensive electricity is supplied in a country, the domestic demand for energy efficiency innovation is missing, and so the home market cannot serve as a springboard for international commercialization. I test this theory against international patent data on energy efficiency innovation in insulation, heating, and lighting for 22 OECD countries, 1991-2007. The statistical analysis indicates that export orientation has large positive effects on energy efficiency innovation in countries that do not rely on nuclear and hydroelectricity.

Our empirical results show that CO2 emissions, energy consumption and economic growth have appeared to be cointegrated. Moreover, there exists bidirectional causality between CO2 emissions and energy consumption, and also between energy consumption and economic growth. It has also been found that energy consumption and economic growth are the long-run causes for CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions and economic growth are the long-run causes for energy consumption. The results indicate that China's CO2 emissions will not decrease in a long period of time and reducing CO2 emissions may handicap China's economic growth to some degree.

Distributed generation using diesel generators remains a common means of electricity provision for rural communities throughout the world. Due to rising fuel costs, the need to address poverty, and consequences of global warming, it is necessary to develop cost efficient means of reducing fossil fuel consumption in isolated diesel microgrids. Based on a case study in Nicaragua, a set of demand and supply side measures are ordered by their annualized costs in order to approximate an energy supply curve. The curve highlights significant opportunities for reducing the costs of delivering energy services while also transitioning to a carbon-free electrical system. In particular, the study demonstrates the significant cost savings resulting from the implementation of conventional metering, efficient residential lighting, and electricity generation using renewable energy sources.

The co-firing process reduces investment costs by converting biomass energy into electricity in existing conventional power plants. Biomass co-firing significantly reduces carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in power generation. To meet the increase in biomass demand, this paper has considered systematic energy crop production, which is expected to increase in the near future. Our aim is to analyze biomass co-firing systems in the Taiwanese electricity market. In this paper, we study two emerging biomass feedstocks: switchgrass and Miscanthus. We focus on the impact of energy crop co-firing on carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions for electricity generation. A Nash-Cournot competition model, which simulates potential biomass co-firing scenarios, is formulated for power markets. A case study conducted in the Taiwanese electricity market showed that biomass co-firing lowers total electricity demand and sale. Miscanthus is more economical than switchgrass in terms of the production cost and the land required to generate biopower for the same levels of biomass co-firing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model assumes that apartment seekers engage in a two-stage process, consisting of a non-compensatory strategy to retain only alternatives that meet search-criteria thresholds, followed by a compensatory strategy to finalize the choice. The first stage is represented by hierarchically correlated ordered-response models and the second stage by a multinomial logit model. The model estimation on data retrieved from a real-estate website, designed to track two-stage choice protocols, reveals the determinants of threshold selection and apartment choice. Results show that (i) threshold selection depends on individual characteristics, (ii) the proposed model is applicable to choice contexts with many alternatives, making it unique in the literature of semi-compensatory models and especially suitable for modeling residential choice, and (iii) the proposed model outperforms the compensatory model and reveals an upward bias in the parameters of the latter.","[Kaplan, Sigal; Bekhor, Shlomo; Shiftan, Yoram] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Kaplan, S (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Technion Campus, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",sigalkap@technion.ac.il; sbekhor@technion.ac.il; shiftan@technion.ac.il,"Bekhor, Shlomo/E-1741-2011","Bekhor, Shlomo/0000-0002-9152-6336",,,,,64,10,10,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Key changes comprised functional unbundling, market restructuring, regulatory reform, public corporatisation and privatisation. Technological development has been another indisputable constituent of these changes, in the wake of ICT revolution. The principle rationale behind these changes has been that they would improve productivity of the industry and social well-being of people. This paper examines the dynamics of productivity changes in the Australian electricity industry and conducts several hypotheses-testings to identify whether industry's efficiency measures are truly improved as a result of the reform-driven changes. Malmquist Total Factor Productivity Index approach and ANOVA are used for this purpose. The results reveal that the productivity gains in the industry have been largely driven by technological improvements and, to a lesser extent, by reform-induced comparative efficiency gains. On average at national level and for the entire industry, there are efficiency gains that, to large extents, can be attributed to functional unbundling and public corporatisation and, to a lesser extent, to market restructuring and privatisation. The results, however, reveal that the reform-driven changes have made insignificant contribution to comparative efficiency, at the level of thermal generation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In most countries SHSs are at an early stage of dissemination, and thus face a hurdle common to many emerging alternative energy technologies: many people do not know enough about them to decide whether to adopt one or not. This study uses survey data collected in Nicaragua to investigate characteristics that predict the knowledge and adoption of SHSs among the rural population. First, a series of probit models is used to model the determinants of four measures of SHS knowledge. Next, a biprobit model with sample selection is employed to investigate the factors that predict SHS adoption, conditional on having sufficient knowledge to make an adoption decision. Comparison of the biprobit formulation to a standard probit model of adoption affirms its value. This study identifies multiple determinants of SHS knowledge and adoption, offers several practical recommendations to project planners, and provides an analytical framework for future work in this policy-relevant area.

In Germany, drastic reductions of energy demand for space heating have already become a policy target over the last decade, both for new and existing dwellings. In this article, we evaluate the impact of past and future policies on the development of buildings with a very high energy performance (VHEP) and on their primary energy demand and emissions. These dwellings account for 4% of all dwellings which have been constructed since 2001 and 1% of the total building stock. We have defined different policy scenarios, all of which assume a gradual increase of requirements for new and existing buildings and a continuation of the support policies that stimulate both new constructions and ambitious refurbishments. In the most ambitious scenario, the proportion of VHEP dwellings will increase by up to 30% of the total stock in 2020 and the share of nearly zero and zero-energy dwellings will then make up 6%. This will lead to emission reductions of over 50% of the 1990 level and primary energy reductions of 25% compared with today. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

After considering several methods to evaluate the environmental performance of energy use, including: energy ecological footprint, input-output analysis, emergy-exergy analysis, and multi-criteria decision-making, an environmental performance evaluation model is proposed, which combines the analytical hierarchy process, fuzzy extent analysis, and membership degree analysis. In the model, 18 sub-indicators of environmental performance from energy use planning are classified into four categories: structure of energy use and industry, technology and efficiency of energy use, environmental impacts caused by energy use, and the socio-economic benefits of energy use. Membership degree analysis is applied to each indicator. Three energy use scenarios which are, respectively, environment-friendly, technology-led, and economic policy-led are evaluated. The results show that the technology-led energy use planning is best. The sustainable energy use policies are proposed from three aspects, including optimizing the energy use and industrial structure, encouraging development of energy-saving and air pollution control technologies, and enhancing legislation on energy use management. The policies are helpful to optimize the trade-offs between economic growth and environmental protection in Beijing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A number of previous macro-scale studies of residential energy consumption and energy-efficiency improvements are mainly concerned with national or international aggregate potential savings. In this paper we look into the details of how a collection of specific homes in one region might reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, with particular attention given to some practical limits to what can be achieved by upgrading the existing residential building stock. Using a simple model of residential, single-family home construction characteristics, estimates are made for the efficacy of (i) changes to behavioral patterns that do not involve building shell modifications; (ii) straightforward air-infiltration mitigation measures, and (iii) insulation measures. We derive estimates of net lifetime savings resulting from these measures, in terms of energy, carbon emissions and dollars. This study points out explicitly the importance of local and regional patterns in decision-making about what fraction of necessary regional or national emissions reduction might be accomplished through energy-efficiency measures and how much might need to concentrate more heavily on renewable or other carbon-free sources of energy.

Embodied emission intensities for the three coalitions are calculated and compared, with market exchange rate and purchase power parity separately used to investigate the difference between nominal and real production efficiencies. Emissions embodied in different economic activities such as production, consumption, import, and export are calculated and analyzed accordingly, and remarkable carbon trade imbalances associated with G7 (surplus of 1.53 billion tons, or 36% its traded emissions) and BRIC (deficit of 1.37 billion tons, or 51% its traded emissions) and approximate balance with ROW (deficit of 0.16 billion tons, or 3% its traded emissions) are concretely revealed. Carbon leakages associated with industry transfer and international trades are illustrated in terms of impacts on global climate policies. The last but not least, per capita consumption based emissions for G7, BRIC, and ROW are determined as 12.95, 1.53, and 2.22 tons, respectively, and flexible abatement policies as well as equity on per capita entitlement are discussed.

The uptake of such products and technologies is of importance, particularly at a time when climate change, diminishing energy resources and energy security are urgent issues. This paper reports on a case study of consumer adoption of hybrid vehicles, a green innovation that has been in the market since the late 1990s. The study is based on a questionnaire survey, conducted in 2009 in collaboration with Toyota GB, to investigate the dimensions that constitute motivations to purchase the Prius and to examine how policy can encourage hybrid adoption. The survey yielded 1484 responses, 1263 of which were used for the analysis: the results of the exploratory factor analyses provide information on consumer purchase motivations. The financial benefits related to transport policy are an important factor in consumer hybrid purchase motivations, and social norms and consumers' willingness to comply with the norms of their groups influence the purchase decision. We also find that various meanings are attached to hybrid vehicle ownership, and practical, experiential and affective values need to be communicated to consumers in terms of value added.

This study investigates the impact of exports on industrial energy intensity to explore the possibility of reducing energy intensity through greater exports. A panel varying-coefficient regression model with a dataset of China's 20 industrial sub-sectors over 1999-2007 suggests that in general, greater exports aggravate energy intensity of the industrial sector and that great divergences exist in the impact of exports on energy intensity across sub-sectors. A panel threshold model further estimates the thresholds for the major determinants of energy intensity: exports, input in technological innovations, and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) intensity. Given the great differences in specific sub-sector characteristics and the changing roles played by different factors across sub-sectors, there is no general export policy that would work for all sub-sectors in reducing sub-sector energy intensity. Instead, policies and measures aiming to encourage more efficient use of energy should take into full consideration the characteristics and situations of individual sub-sectors.

Canada, as well as comparisons with California, US, and the United Kingdom. The alignment between socio-political and community acceptance is considered for its impact on market acceptance of the technology. Barriers inhibiting social acceptance of RBSW projects include adequate capacity factor, cost effectiveness, wind variability, audio-esthetics impact, health and safety, procedural fairness, and transparency. A review of the policies for implementation of small wind projects in each location is presented. Strategies to overcome barriers to social acceptance are examined, along with recommendations for the increased implementation of RBSW projects worldwide. Recommendations to increase social acceptance and subsequent implementation of RBSW projects include the collaboration of government agencies, industry and community members, during RBSW implementation processes, and the provision of consistent, long-term, supportive policies and incentive programs for project owners.

Simulations were performed in the Texas, US (ERCOT) grid where different mixes of wind, solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power meet up to 80% of the electric demand. The primary constraints on incorporation of these sources at large scale are the limited time coincidence of the resource with normal electricity demand, combined with the limited flexibility of thermal generators to reduce output. An additional constraint in the ERCOT system is the current inability to exchange power with neighboring grids. By themselves, these constraints would result in unusable renewable generation and increased costs. But a highly flexible system - with must-run baseload generators virtually eliminated - allows for penetrations of up to about 50% variable generation with curtailment rates of less than 10%. For penetration levels up to 80% of the system's electricity demand, keeping curtailments to less than 10% requires a combination of load shifting and storage equal to about one day of average demand.

Such a WWS infrastructure reduces world power demand by 30% and requires only similar to 0.41% and similar to 0.59% more of the world's land for footprint and spacing, respectively. We suggest producing all new energy with WWS by 2030 and replacing the pre-existing energy by 2050. Barriers to the plan are primarily social and political, not technological or economic.

It finds that the primary energy technologies involved with low-income households involve a greater number of fuels and carriers, ranging from dung and fuelwood to liquefied petroleum gas and charcoal, but a fewer number of services. Middle-income households throughout the world tend to rely on electricity and natural gas, followed by coal, liquefied petroleum gas, and kerosene. These homes utilize energy to produce a much broader range services. The upper class or rich have access to the same energy fuels, carriers, and technologies as middle-income homes and families, but consume more energy (and more high luxury items).

This study addresses this topic by investigating the technical and economic feasibility of replacing diesel power generation with hybrid wind power systems in remote communities. For this purpose, the economic, technical and environmental characteristics of eight different hybrid wind power systems were established and compared in respect to their performance in the isolated community of French Island (Victoria, Australia). The results obtained in this study demonstrated the economic and environmental superiority of the hybrid wind-diesel-battery system over all other systems studied in this project. This system was found to have the lowest net present cost and cost per kWh among the modelled systems. Furthermore, the results clearly indicated that hybrid wind power systems are, in general, a feasible and preferable alternative to diesel power generation on the French Island. The research methodology and procedure that were developed in this project can be used to investigate and identify the most viable hybrid power system for other remote communities based on their specific environmental, social and economic circumstances.

We apply the model to address state-scale impacts of a renewable electricity standard (RES) and a carbon tax in one southeastern state, Georgia. Biomass is the lowest cost option for large-scale renewable generation in Georgia; we find that electricity can be generated from biomass co-firing at existing coal plants for a marginal cost above baseline of 0.2-2.2 cents/kWh and from dedicated biomass facilities for 3.0-5.5 cents/kWh above baseline. We evaluate the cost and amount of renewable electricity that would be produced in-state and the amount of out-of-state renewable electricity credits (RECs) that would be purchased as a function of the REC price. We find that in Georgia, a constant carbon tax to 2030 primarily promotes a shift from coal to natural gas and does not result in substantial renewable electricity generation. We also find that the option to offset a RES with renewable electricity credits would push renewable investment out-of-state. The tradeoff for keeping renewable investment in-state by not offering RECs is an approximately 1% additional increase in the levelized cost of electricity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The tests are parametric with asymptotic t and chi-squared limiting distributions and standard convergence rates. They do not require a transformation of the original data or a Kolmogorov style assessment of goodness-of-fit, explicitly account for parameter uncertainty, and have superior finite sample properties. An application to autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) models for trade durations shows that the difficulty with the assumed densities lies on the probability assigned to very small durations.

The aim which has been set derives from the necessity which is based on identified differences between the household lending methodologies in developed (German) and new (Latvia) market of mortgage lending despite both markets were exposed to the impact of global economical crisis. Three tasks have been set in order reach the aim. Firstly, to analyze the Latvian and German household lending market and the peculiarities of the situation. Secondly, to detect changes in the methodologies of household mortgage lending of Latvian and German commercial banks before the crisis (2006) and during the current (2010) periods. Thirdly, to compare the peculiarities of Latvian and German methodology and work out suggestions how to improve the methodology which takes into account management of credit risk. In order to carry out the set tasks, the following research methods have been used: the analysis of theoretical material, legislation, as well as the latest research analysis in areas of household lending and credit risk management. Besides, interviews of Latvian and German banking experts have been held. It also included the methods of statistical data processing. Research results have revealed that the methodology of household lending of German bank is more developed than Latvian banking methodology, which in turn served as the basis for working out recommendations in order to improve the Latvian banking methodology.","[Ilmars, Purins] BA Sch Business & Finance, LV-1013 Riga, Latvia",,,ilmars@klinika.lv,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,516.0,526,,,,,,11,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100070,0

This study examines the demand characteristics of Green Power in Australia and policies which could increase its sales. A sample of 250 pooled time series and cross sectional observations was used to estimate a statistically significant elasticity of demand for Green Power with respect to price of -0.96 with a 95% confidence interval of +/- 68%. The wide variation in market penetration between jurisdictions and between countries for Green Power, and the low awareness of Green Power found by surveys indicate that Green Power sales could be increased by appropriate marketing and government policies. The most cost effective means to increase sales was found to be advertising campaigns although only one Australian example was found, in the state of Victoria in 2005. It was also found that full tax deductibility of the Green Power premium to residential customers, exemption from the Goods and Services Tax and a tax rebate for Green Power are all probably less cost effective for promoting sales than direct government purchase of Green Power, in terms of cost per unit of increased sales.

From retro to avant-garde: a commentary on Paul Krugman's 'The New Economic Geography, Now Middle-aged', Regional Studies. This paper takes issue with Paul Krugman's claim that the New Economic Geography should be considered 'now middle-aged'. The New Economic Geography can be updated to account for current developments in advanced economies, notably innovation-driven agglomeration and urbanization. The New Economic Geography also needs improvement in its ability to address dynamic processes and causal forces in spatial economics. These updates would require that the New Economic Geography breaks some of its self-imposed theoretical and methodological shackles. This in turn would entail achieving a better balance between economists' love for parsimony and geographers' thirst for complexity. Economics itself offers some clues as to how to succeed in this task. Thus updated, the New Economic Geography could present a compelling approach to innovation-driven agglomeration and specialization in the advanced countries, as well as the development of regions in emerging economies.

In diesem Beitrag wird der Behauptung von Paul Krugman widersprochen, dass sich die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie inzwischen im mittleren Alter befindet. Die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie lasst sich aktualisieren, um auf die jungsten Entwicklungen in den Industriestaaten einzugehen, insbesondere auf die innovationsorientierte Agglomeration und Urbanisierung. Ebenso ist die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie hinsichtlich ihrer Fahigkeit zum Eingehen auf dynamische Prozesse und kausale Krafte in der Raumokonomie verbesserungsbedurftig. Fur diese Verbesserungen ware es erforderlich, dass die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie einige ihrer selbst auferlegten theoretischen und methodologischen Fesseln abwirft. Auf diese Weise wurde wiederum ein besseres Gleichgewicht zwischen der Liebe der Okonomen zur Sparsamkeit und dem Durst der Geografen nach Komplexitat geschaffen. Fur die Frage, wie dies zu erreichen ist, kan die Okonomie selbst einige Anhaltspunkte liefern. Durch eine solche Aktualisierung konnte die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie einen uberzeugenden Ansatz zur innovationsorientierten Agglomeration und Spezialisierung in den Industrielandern sowie zur Weiterentwicklung von Regionen in Schwellenlandern bieten.

En este articulo contradigo la afirmacion de Paul Krugman de que podriamos considerar que la Nueva Geografia Economica ahora ya ha madurado. La Nueva Geografia Economica puede actualizarse para responder a los desarrollos actuales en economias avanzadas, sobre todo en cuanto a la aglomeracion y la urbanizacion impulsadas por la innovacion. La Nueva Geografia Economica tambien necesita mejorar su capacidad para abordar procesos dinamicos y fuerzas causales en las economias espaciales. Para conseguir estas mejoras seria necesario que la Nueva Geografia Economica se liberase de algunos de sus grilletes teoricos y metodologicos que se ha autoimpuesto. De este modo tambien se lograria un mejor equilibrio entre el amor de los economistas por la parsimonia y la sed de los geografos por la complejidad. La misma economia ofrece algunas pistas sobre como tener exito en esta tarea.

First, in my country Latvia up to now no significant research has been carried out on the possibilities of developing a local government audit system. Likewise, no legal regulation exists for the setup, function, and co-ordination of such a system. And second, discussion of my findings and my conclusions with a broader international audience will hopefully contribute to the development of more harmonised all-European policies in this field. In Latvia, internal audit has been functioning since the year 1999. The 4th of December 2002, when the Law On Internal Audit came into force, was the starting point of internal audit function in the public sector, namely, the ministries and the central government agencies. However, this law does not refer to the local governments, except in cases when transactions are carried out with project funds financed by European Union's programmes. Debate on the necessity of local governments' internal audit in Latvia has been going on since the year 2003 when at the international conference Audit 2003 the idea was expressed that internal audit could be instrumental in improving the competitive ability of any local government. Of the 118 local governments in Latvia, currently only 17 have internal audit units. Is it good, or is it bad? I have made my research, and I can convincingly argue in favour of the conclusion that internal audit in local governments is able to fully incorporate with control and monitoring systems, fulfil all tasks set by local tax-payers, and help local policy makers and management achieve their aims in due time. But the current course of events shows that local governments in Latvia do not pay enough attention to internal audit, largely due to scarce financial resources.","[Sulca, Romena] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,Romena.Sulca@llu.lv,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,300.0,311,,,,,,12,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100041,0

In the hypothesis - improving the Latvian tax system is necessary to ensure economic development and social justice - a need of making taxes simple, just, comprehensible, and neutral is emphasised. The scientific findings will be used for improving the regulatory mechanisms for developing certain industries by means of taxes in order to promote sustainability of the national economy in the common EU market. The tax burden has to be differentiated according to income, thus reducing social tension in the country. An improved tax system has to promote the nation's wellbeing and culture and the emergence of a strong middle class by reducing the proportion of poor people in the society. It has to also prove its great economic and social role in the national economy. The Latvian tax system has to be reformed and improved according to the principle of paying capacity, at the same time national interests have to be taken into account.","[Vitola, Irija] Latvia Univ Agr, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,irija.vitola@llu.lv,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,212.0,218,,,,,,7,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100028,0

The main data source was the UK National Allocation Plan for the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, supplemented by capacity/output and specific energy consumption data for certain heterogeneous sectors. Around 60% of industry has been covered in terms of energy use, and 90% of energy-intensive sectors. The total annual heat use for these sectors was estimated at 650 PJ, with technically feasible annual savings in the region 36-71 PJ. This is in agreement with the only extant estimates for heat recovery from industrial processes, which are 65 and 144 PJ, respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[McKenna, R.

However, for a mature commercial industry to develop, sustainability as well as technological and economic issues pertinent to algal biofuel sector must be addressed first. This viewpoint focuses on three integrated approaches laid out to meet these challenges. Firstly, an integrated algal biorefinery for sequential biomass processing for multiple high-value products is delineated to bring in the financial sustainability to the algal biofuel production units. Secondly, an integrated renewable energy park (IREP) approach is proposed for amalgamating various renewable energy industries established in different locations. This would aid in synergistic and efficient electricity and liquid biofuel production with zero net carbon emissions while obviating numerous sustainability issues such as productive usage of agricultural land, water, and fossil fuel usage. A 'renewable energy corridor' rich in multiple energy sources needed for algal biofuel production for deploying IREPs in the United States is also illustrated. Finally, the integration of various industries with algal biofuel sector can bring a multitude of sustainable deliverables to society, such as renewable supply of cheap protein supplements, health products and aquafeed ingredients. The benefits, challenges, and policy needs of the IREP approach are also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Entry-exit tariff for gas transport systems have been recommended by the 3rd EU Energy Package, since they are cost reflective, facilitate gas trade and can provide signals for the location of gas injections or off-takes. The advisability of applying an entry-exit tariff system is discussed in this paper. Apart from this, authors propose an entry-exit tariff model and apply it to compute charges for the Spanish gas transport system in 2009. Results produced by the model are presented as coefficients which should multiply the current postal transport tariff. The paper concludes that entry-exit tariffs would be useful location signals which would result in a better use of the gas transport system in Spain. In those cases where demand exceeds available capacity, as it occurs at the congested connection with France, entry-exit tariffs could be supplemented by capacity charges at entry points resulting from auctions.

While the competition authorities supported the entry by approving Vattenfall's acquisition of three regional utilities, other market participants raised concerns over the emergence of an upcoming oligopoly in the German market for power generation. We contrast the efficiency hypothesis postulating pro-competitive effects of mergers with the market power hypothesis postulating anti-competitive effects. For the analysis of the two opposing hypotheses, we use an event study approach to the stock prices of Vattenfall's competitors in the German market. While we find no empirical evidence for increased market power in the German electricity market due to Vattenfall's mergers, there is some indication for efficiency increases. We therefore cannot oppose the view of the competition authorities predicting an overall positive effect for consumers as a result of Vattenfall's entry into the German electricity market.

Based on an original dataset of 15,279 low-income households, this paper studies the incidence and determinants of illegality in the context of low-income urban favelas. The probability of engaging in illegal behavior is explained not just by low income, but by a combination of concurring factors: sub-standard energy provision and equipment; inefficient/incorrect use of domestic electric appliances and running an informal in-house business. These recurrent issues in the urban favelas aggravate a sense of exclusion from growth, which is generally recognized as a trigger of illegality. The impact of energy demand on energy-related illegality is carefully analyzed, and different empirical strategies adopted to circumvent some simultaneity problem between both decision processes. The effectiveness of consumption-based energy subsidies is also explored. In spite of some contrary arguments in the literature, in the context of pen-urban slums, such measures may exert a positive impact in mitigating illegal access and use of energy. Effectiveness will be enhanced by accompanying measures such as: perceivable improvements of equipment, metering and maintenance, promotion of beneficiaries' awareness of energy usage, and energy-saving behaviors.

This paper analyzes future trends of both direct and life cycle energy demand (ED) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in China's road transport sector, and assesses the effectiveness of possible reduction measures by using alternative vehicles/fuels. A model is developed to derive a historical trend and to project future trends. The government is assumed to do nothing additional in the future to influence the long-term trends in the business as usual (BAU) scenario. Four specific scenarios are used to describe the future cases where different alternative fuel/vehicles are applied. The best case scenario is set to represent the most optimized case. Direct ED and GHG emissions would reach 734 million tonnes of oil equivalent and 2384 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050 in the BAU case, respectively, more than 5.6 times of 2007 levels. Compared with the BAU case, the relative reductions achieved in the best case would be 15.8% and 27.6% for life cycle ED and GHG emissions, respectively. It is suggested for future policy implementation to support sustainable biofuel and high efficient electric-vehicles, and the deployment of coal-based fuels accompanied with low-carbon technology.

Implications for public policies,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transport; Fuel; AIDS model,HABIT FORMATION; ELECTRICITY DEMAND; HOUSEHOLD DEMAND; PANEL-DATA; SYSTEM; TAX; SPECIFICATION; FOOD; EXPENDITURES; CONSUMPTION,"The significant increase in passenger transport activity (cars) experienced by Spain and its associated increase in energy consumption have several associated negative aspects, including a greater dependence on foreign energy sources and higher GHG emissions. Therefore, reducing the level of transport activity would bring important socioeconomic and environmental benefits. The aim of this paper, which focuses on energy consumption in the passenger transport, is fourfold: (1) to provide a diagnostic of energy consumption in the Spanish passenger transport system and the related problems; (2) to develop a model to calculate price and income elasticities of demand for transport fuel; (3) to apply this model to the Spanish passenger transport sector; (4) to infer policy recommendations derived from the results of the diagnostic and the model. It is claimed that, in view of those low price elasticities and high income elasticities and if a reduction in the scale of transport activity is deemed socially desirable, a combination of instruments is necessary. Fuel taxes play an important role within this combination. Apart from their long-term effects, the low price elasticity of demand for transport fuel would allow the collection of a significant amount of revenues, which could eventually be earmarked to encourage reductions in private transport demand and modal shifts with other instruments.

The Nelson-Siegel model has been recently reformulated as a dynamic factor model with vector autoregressive factors. We extend this framework in two directions. First, the factor loadings in the Nelson-Siegel yield model depend on a single loading parameter that we treat as the fourth latent factor. Second, we specify the overall volatility as a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) process. We present empirical evidence of considerable increases in within-sample goodness of fit for these advances in the dynamic Nelson-Siegel model.","[Koopman, Siem Jan; Mallee, Max I.

This paper explores ways of valuing diversity. A possible incentive mechanism for promoting diversity which takes account of underlying disparities between different technology options is developed. The mechanism provides a way of trading off cost and diversity and results in an efficient cost-diversity frontier by analogy with financial portfolio theory. If all technologies are believed to be equally disparate, the appropriate mechanism is a levy imposed on market share. If the technologies are not equally disparate, the levy needs to be adjusted by technology-specific multipliers that take account of levels of disparity and patterns of market share. The analysis is applied to two stylised situations. In the long-run equilibrium case, the implications of both different patterns of disparity and different values attached to diversity are investigated. The paper also explores the implications of applying such a mechanism to the current Great Britain electricity system. The implications in terms of financial flows, for both the market as a whole and for individual operators, are investigated. Finally, the appropriateness of such a mechanism in the light of other policy goals, and possible future research directions, is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In several European countries, wind generation is so far not burdened with full balancing responsibility. However, the more wind power penetration, the less bearable for the system not to allocate balancing costs to the responsible parties. Given the variability and limited predictability of wind generation, full balancing exposure is however only feasible conditionally to well-functioning balancing markets. On that account, recommendations ensuring an optimal balancing market design are formulated and their impact on wind generation is assessed. Taking market-based or cost-reflective imbalance prices as the main objective, it is advised that: (1) the imbalance settlement should not contain penalties or power exchange prices, (2) capacity payments should be allocated to imbalanced BRPs via an additive component in the imbalance price and (3) a cap should be imposed on the amount of reserves. Efficient implementation of the proposed market design may require balancing markets being integrated across borders. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, today trends in district heating pricing tend to move towards a more customer-oriented approach with predetermined prices under a longer periods, leading to a more complex price structure. If a district heating supplier offers district heating with predetermined prices in order to compete with similar electricity offers, the financial risk of the new price structure is significantly higher than the risk of an ordinary variable cost offer based on short-run marginal cost. In contrary to an electricity seller, the district heating company cannot transfer all of the risk of predetermined prices to the financial market, instead the company is thrown upon its own ability to handle the risk by, e.g., hedging its own energy purchase. However, all uncertainties cannot be coped with in this manner. Thus, there is a need for a methodology that can be used to estimate the financial risk of different price structures and to value different opportunities to reduce the risk. In this article, we propose a methodology, implemented in prototype software, to evaluate the risk associated with new price structures in district heating. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet few studies have investigated fuel tax incidence in a developing country context. We use household survey data and income-outcome coefficients to analyze fuel tax incidence in Costa Rica. We find that the effect of a 10% fuel price hike through direct spending on gasoline would be progressive, its effect through spending on diesel both directly and via bus transportation would be regressive (mainly because poorer households rely heavily on buses), and its effect through spending on goods other than fuel and bus transportation would be relatively small, albeit regressive. Finally, we find that the overall effect of a 10% fuel price hike through all types of direct and indirect spending would be neutral and the magnitude of this combined effect would be modest. We conclude that distributional concerns need not rule out using fuel taxes to address pressing public health and safety problems, particularly if gasoline and diesel taxes can be differentiated.

The six GCC countries fall in the top 25 countries of carbon dioxide emissions per capita and are perceived as the main actors blocking international climate change negotiations. The aim of this article is to discuss from a policy perspective the capacities of the GCC states to switch toward an ecological modernization of their energy sectors. At the beginning of the paper, I analyze the benefits of transforming oil wealth into funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency. After this, I discuss obstacles to such a transformation process based on the rentier states theory. Finally, I investigate governance of the GCC on all levels (international, regional, and local). The article shows that the GCC countries have recently adopted a more pro-active approach toward ecological modernization. This reorientation has not yet resulted in the development of consistent strategies and policies, however. The concluding assumption based on the concept of policy transfer is that pioneering projects such as Masdar City and innovative regulation like the green building code in Dubai will spread within the GCC.

If the economic environment of the past two decades has changed such that firms and individuals have greater mobility, the degree to which they act to avoid higher tax jurisdictions may be enhanced. Alternatively, if tax policies across states have converged, the responsiveness of economic activity to tax policy may have diminished. These potential dynamics may be manifest in, among other ways, a change in the degree to which variation in overall state tax burdens affect state economic growth. Results from a series of regressions using a panel of state-level data for the years 1985 through 2003 indicate that the degree to which higher tax burdens reduce economic growth has substantially diminished. For instance, results indicate that the negative effect of a $1,000 increase in state own-source revenues per capita had on the growth rate of private sector gross state product diminished from approximately negative 1.1 percentage-points in 1985 to virtually zero by 2003. This effect holds whether economic growth is measured as the growth rate of private sector gross state product or private sector employment in a state, whether tax collections are measured in inflation-adjusted per capita terms or as a share of state personal income, and whether we examine state taxes exclusively or combined state and local taxes.","[Hill, Brian] Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Perdue Sch Business, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA; [Deskins, John] Creighton Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, Coll Business Adm, Omaha, NE 68178 USA",University System of Maryland; Salisbury University; Creighton University,"Hill, B (通讯作者)，Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Perdue Sch Business, 1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.",johndeskins@creighton.edu; bchill@salisbury.edu,,"Hill, Brian/0000-0002-9671-0853",,,,,26,14,14,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Motivating the search for an alternative US dollar pricing of crude oil is the significant and inverse relationship (r=-0.82, p<0.01) between the US dollar major currencies index and crude oil price over the period January 1999-March 2009. A dynamically weighted petro-dollar currency basket is proposed based on the five currency claims (US dollar, Euro, British pound, Japanese yen and Swiss franc) and their varying proportions of foreign exchange reserves held by central banks. The major currencies US dollar index is compared against the proposed petro-dollar index to reveal an average US$8.1 billion annual gain in favor of the petro-dollar currency basket, offering OPEC members a revenue stream of diversified and highly liquid currencies to transition away from complete dependence on the US dollar crude oil pricing. The proposed petro-dollar crude oil pricing schema offers OPEC a crude oil price dynamically denominated in currencies reflecting the global use and importance of crude oil. This paper concludes with implementation issues facing a move toward the dynamically weighted petro-dollar crude oil pricing schema. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the performance of the Swedish TGC system, contributing to the European debate on the suitability of different types of frameworks. The expectations of the TGC system were that it would: (a) be effective in terms of increasing the supply of green electricity; (b) do this in a cost effective manner (from both a social and a consumer perspective): (c) generate an equitable distribution of costs and benefits and (d) drive technical change. So far, it has performed adequately in terms of effectiveness and social cost effectiveness. However, consumer costs have been substantially higher than expected, very large rents are generated and, at best, it contributes marginally to technical change. Thus. a TGC framework should be selected if the overriding concern is to minimize short term social costs of reaching a certain goal with a high degree of predictability. However, it cannot be expected to also drive technical change, keep consumer costs down and be equitable. Such trade-offs need to be revealed and not obscured by analysts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Mansur M.; Albinali, Khaled; DeMello, Lurion",,,Price dynamics of natural gas and the regional methanol markets,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Price dynamics of methanol and natural gas; Time-series modelling,ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE; COINTEGRATION; ECONOMY,"A 'methanol economy' based mainly on natural gas as a feedstock has a lot of potential to cope with the current and ongoing concerns for energy security along with the reduction of CO-2 emissions. It is, therefore, important to examine the price dynamics of methanol in order to ascertain whether the price of methanol is mainly natural-gas-cost driven or demand driven in the context of different regions. This paper is the first attempt to investigate the following: (i) is the natural gas price significantly related to the regional methanol prices in the Far East, United States and Europe? (ii) who drives the regional methanol prices? The paper is motivated by the recent and growing debate on the lead-lag relationship between natural gas and methanol prices. Our findings, based on the most recently developed 'long-run structural modelling' and subject to the limitations of the study, tend to suggest: (i) natural gas price is cointegrated with the regional methanol prices. (ii) our within-sample error-correction model results tend to indicate that natural gas was driving the methanol prices in Europe and the United States but not in the Far East. These results are consistent, during most of the period under review (1998.5-2007.3), with the surge in demand for methanol throughout the Far East, particularly in China, Taiwan and South Korea, which appears to have played a relatively more dominant role in the Far East compared to that in Europe and the United States within the framework of the dynamic interactions of input and product prices. However, during the post-sample forecast period as evidenced in our variance decompositions analysis, the emergence of natural gas as the main driver of methanol prices in all three continents is consistent with the recent surge in natural gas price fueled mainly, among others, by the strong hedging activities in the natural gas futures/options as well as refining tightness (similar to those that were happening in the crude oil markets).

Due to institutional, economic, and historical reasons the DSOs in the Nordic area are relatively numerous and heterogeneous in terms of ownership structure, size, and operating conditions. Since the deregulation in 1994-1999, the national regulators have independently devised regulation mechanisms that address the heterogeneity through econometric or engineering cost models as a basis for high-powered regimes. The frontier analysis models (such as data envelopment analysis in, e.g., Norway and Finland) are particularly useful here, given their incentive properties and cautious estimation of the production set. However, the total information rents in yardstick regimes and the bias in the frontier estimation are related to the number of observations (firms), which undermine their future application in the Nordic area under increasing interregional concentration. This paper develops a proposal for an alternative model, the revenue yardstick model, that can be applied across the national regulations and permit frontier estimations on final user cost rather than cost estimates, sensitive to, e.g., capital cost estimates, periodization, and allocation keys. The core of the model is a dynamic frontier yardstick model such as Agrell et al. (2005), but here applied only to strictly exogenous conditions, the output dimensions and the claimed revenues of the DSO. An equilibrium is implemented using asymmetric penalties for positive and negative deviations from the ex post frontier revenue, the yardstick, using the classic super-efficiency model in analogy with Shleifer (1985). The model is particularly aimed at an international (interregional) application as it may embed national differences in regulation without jeopardizing the long-term sustainability of the model.","[Agrell, Per J.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Sch Management & CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Bogetoft, Peter] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econom, Frederiksberg 2000, Denmark",Universite Catholique Louvain; Copenhagen Business School,"Agrell, PJ (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Sch Management & CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",per.agrell@uclouvain.be; pb.eco@cbs.dk,,"AGRELL, Per/0000-0002-3835-2365",,,,,30,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1867-8998,,978-3-642-12066-4,ENERG SYST,,,2010,,,,,,,293.0,+,,10.1007/978-3-642-12067-1_17,0.0,,,4,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BVS65,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292659100017,0

An adaptation levy of 2% is currently imposed on all CDM transactions which could raise around $500 million between now and 2012. This paper analyses the scope for raising further adaptation finance from the CDM, the economic costs (deadweight loss) of such a measure and the incidence of the levy, that is, the economic burden the levy would impose on the buyers and sellers of credits. We find that a levy of 2% could raise up to $2 billion a year in 2020 if there are no restrictions on demand. This could rise to $10 billion for a 10% tax. Restrictions on credit demand (called supplementarity limits, the requirement that most emission abatement should happen domestically) curtail trade volumes and consequently tax revenues. They also alter the economic impact of the CDM levy. Without supplementarity restrictions sellers (developing countries) bear twothirds of the cost of the tax.

S. Rules of the game: the place of institutions in regional economic change, Regional Studies. Institutions exert a pervasive influence on the evolution and character of regional economies. Yet, this role is poorly understood within recent debates on neoliberalism, varieties of capitalism, and other approaches to the study of economic change. A reconstituted institutional economic geography must accommodate individual agency, institutional evolution, interscalar relations, and comparative methodologies. Examining recent work on universities in local economies, as well as on creativity-based strategies and social inclusion/polarization, it is shown how locally distinctive institutional architectures shape evolutionary trajectories, leading to differentiated social and economic outcomes. The paper then enunciates some important principles of methodology and theory-building in institutional analysis.","Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",University of Toronto,"Gertler, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",meric.gertler@utoronto.ca,"Gertler, Meric S/E-5521-2013",,,,,,74,284,313,5,130,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper considers the role of market orientation and regional integration in foreign direct investment (FDI) productivity effects. Using data of United States multinational enterprises operating in eight industries and thirteen Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries during 1987-2003, the productivity effects of local market-oriented FDI versus export-oriented FDI are compared, with the latter being split into FDI oriented at the parent and that at parties in third countries. Their productivity effects are also considered within two regional agreements: the Canadian-United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) and the European Union. Robust positive horizontal effects of parent firm-oriented FDI and third-country-oriented FDI are found, with notable differences in the effects of these FDI types between CUSFTA and the European Union.

Starch reduces crystallization and centrifugation rates, occludes into sucrose crystals, and impedes refinery decolorization processes. The problem of starch in sugarcane juice has been exacerbated by the widespread adoption of green cane harvesting and also, perhaps by the necessity to incorporate useful traits from wild Saccharum germplasm into cultivated sugarcane. Use of alpha-amylase to hydrolyze starch during processing should be viewed as a short-term solution as the enzyme is relatively expensive and not always efficient. Availability of sugarcane varieties low in starch content should present a more sustainable, long-term solution. This chapter highlights problems caused by starch during the processing of sugarcane, as well as presents data suggesting that it would be possible to deploy sugarcane varieties low in starch content.","[Zhou, Marvellous; Kimbeng, Collins] LSU AgCtr, Sch Plant Environm & Soil Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Zhou, M (通讯作者)，LSU AgCtr, Sch Plant Environm & Soil Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",ckimbeng@agctr.lsu.edu,"Kimbeng, Collins/AAT-7585-2021",,,,,,33,2,2,0,1,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0097-6156,1947-5918,978-0-8412-2598-5,ACS SYM SER,ACS Symp.

Regulatory intervention is then necessary and established methods have been used to assess adequacy and help regulators to fix this market failure. In regional electricity markets, transmission interconnections play an important role in contributing to adequacy. However, the adequacy problem and related policy are typically considered at a national level. This paper presents a simple model to study how the interconnection capacity interacts with generation adequacy. First results indicate that increasing interconnection capacity between systems improves adequacy up to a certain level; further increases do not procure additional adequacy improvements. Furthermore, besides adequacy improvement, increasing transmission capacity under asymmetric adequacy criteria or national system characteristics could create several concerns about externalities. These results imply that regional coordination of national adequacy policies is essential to internalise adequacy of cross-border effects.

I simulate the wholesale electricity markets of the island of Ireland and Great Britain for 2005. I find that in order for the two markets to be integrated in 2005, additional interconnection would have to be large. The amount of interconnection decreases for high costs of carbon, since this causes the markets to become more similar. This suggests that in the absence of strategic behavior of firms, most of the gains from trade derive not from differences in size between countries, but from technology differences and are strongly influenced by fuel and carbon costs. Social welfare increases with interconnection, although at a decreasing rate. As the amount of interconnection increases, there are also positive effects on competition in Ireland, the less competitive of the two markets, Finally, it is unlikely that private investors will pay for the optimal amount of interconnection since their returns are significantly smaller than the total social benefit of interconnection.

As part of reform initiatives to enhance long-term sustainability of the country's electricity industry, South Africa's authorities have in recent years sought to develop an electricity pricing framework that is cost reflective and forms the cornerstone of demand management schemes meant to foster changes in consumption behaviour and enhance efficiency in resource use. The effects of any pricing policy on aggregate electricity consumption will depend on a useful understanding of the factors that influence electricity demand, and the magnitude to which electricity demand responds to changes in such factors. In this context, this paper applies the bounds testing approach to cointegration within an autoregressive distributed lag framework to examine the aggregate demand for electricity in South Africa during the period 1960-2007. The results indicate that in the long run, income is the main determinant of electricity demand. With electricity prices having an insignificant effect on aggregate electricity demand, future pricing policies will need to ensure that electricity prices are cost reflective and enhance efficiency of electricity supply and use.

The emergence of this new productive base raises new research issues: in what circumstances are the structuring, organization and implementation of these biodiesel productive chains taking place in Brazil? What are the effects of biodiesel production on local economies? Hence, the central objective of this study is identifying their economic and social impacts at the regions where they are installed. The analytical structure was constructed based on theories of regional and spatial economy: location coefficient, shift-share, theories of industrial location. A preliminary analysis identified that a biodiesel productive arrangement is emerging in the State of Piaui, Northeastern Brazil, with the purpose of stimulating regional development using alternative oil-bearing crops. However, the agricultural project in the town of Canto do Buriti/PI has faced problems of both a cultural and productive nature. Preliminary findings reveal productive, organizational, managerial and governance related difficulties and challenges that need to be faced when establishing a new productive base in a location that up to that point lacks a productive tradition.

The analysis is accomplished by using fuzzy multi-objective mathematical programming, and interpreting each objective function both by itself and in combination with the others, through a fuzzy multi-objective parametrization. The scenarios are defined by the energy consumption percentage increase, limited to be below some admissible maximum value, while still considering variations in the installed power. The costs, CO(2) emission, and the NDJ generated are analyzed and compared with the largest values obtained with the model of crisp mathematical programming, used for the original configuration.

This study established an integrated economic, energy, environmental, dynamic, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model representing endogenous technological change for China's climate change policy analysis. This study analyzed and compared the economic impact of different approaches to mitigation commitments as well as the potential role of technological change in the formulation of mitigation targets and commitments, taking into account China's climate policy-making needs based on the current international climate negotiation process. The results show that, absolute emission limits similar to the Kyoto Protocol will seriously impede the future economic development of China, while the impact of an 80% reduction in carbon intensity, forecast for 2050 based on the 2005 level, is relatively small. Technological change can promote economic growth, improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon intensity per unit of output through the substitution of production factors. Consequently it can reduce marginal abatement cost and related GDP loss by mitigation. At the same time it can increase mitigation potentials and extend the emission reduction amount, showing that consideration of the impact of technological change when deciding the emission reduction targets is necessary.

Because of concerns regarding climate change and the high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with conventional coal use, policies to encourage pathways that utilize coal for transportation should seek to reduce GHGs compared to petroleum fuels. This paper compares the GHG emissions of coal-to-liquid (CTL) fuels to the emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) powered with coal-based electricity, and to the emissions of a fuel cell vehicle (FCV) that uses coal-based hydrogen. A life cycle approach is used to account for fuel cycle and use-phase emissions, as well as vehicle cycle and battery manufacturing emissions. This analysis allows policymakers to better identify benefits or disadvantages of an energy future that includes coal as a transportation fuel. We find that PHEVs could reduce vehicle life cycle GHG emissions by up to about one-half when coal with carbon capture and sequestration is used to generate the electricity used by the vehicles. On the other hand, CTL fuels and coal-based hydrogen would likely lead to significantly increased emissions compared to PHEVs and conventional vehicles using petroleum-based fuels.

Prospects for growth in energy demand and higher prices can create opportunities for private investments in renewable energy industries. A conjoint analysis examined individuals' willingness to invest in wood-based energies following a random utility model. The study design included three investment attributes: annual returns on investment, type of investment, and location of investment. Three ordinal models that also included demographic and attitudinal characteristics indicate that wood-based energy is less preferred among potential investors compared to the stock market and solar/wind renewable energy investments. Expected returns and location of energy investments within the US are also major drivers of investment preferences. Favorable attitudes towards forestry and wood-based energy could enhance prospects for a greater number of potential investors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The approach used for this investigation measured the state by state severity of the 2001 recession and identifies the contribution that each state made to the overall U.S. GDP Okun gap. State by state long-term growth rates for both output and employment were calculated and an Okun gap contribution for the 2001-2005 period was estimated for each state. Each state's Okun gap contribution for output and employment was expressed in relative terms allowing for comparisons of volatility between states with respect to the 2001 recession. Finally, for both output and employment regressions were estimated using the relative Okun gap contribution as the dependent variable and selected demographic and economic measures as explanatory variables to explain the state and regional differences in cyclical performance. The results of the regression analysis provide insight into the factors that tend to increase state and regional cyclical volatility and the factors that tend to smooth volatility.","[Connaughton, John E.; Madsen, Ronald A.] UNC Charlotte, Dept Econ, Charlotte, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Connaughton, JE (通讯作者)，UNC Charlotte, Dept Econ, Charlotte, NC USA.",jec@uncc.edu; ramadsen@uncc.edu,,,,,,,18,4,5,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

It also lists seven main differences between such a system and a carbon tax along the following issues: amount of emissions reduced; flow of revenue to the public purse: cost of the system to the public; marginal cost of carbon emission reductions to the firm: generating excess rent; price setting mechanism and stability of system; as well as duration and commitment. When looking at emission reductions along these dimensions, it becomes clear that an internationally coordinated carbon tax may be a quicker and cheaper way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.

While the future scope and scale of the industry is not yet apparent, recent trends indicate that distributed generation electricity applications may play an important role in this transformation. This paper examines which types of utilities are more likely to adopt distributed generation systems and, additionally, which factors motivate decisions of adoption and system capacity size. Results of a standard two-part model reveal that private utilities are significantly more inclined to adopt distributed generation than cooperatives and other types of public utilities. We also find evidence that interconnection standards and renewable portfolio standards effectively encourage consumer-owned distributed generation, while market forces associated with greater market competition encourage utility-owned distributed generation. Net metering programs are also found to have a significant marginal effect on distributed generation adoption and deployment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is well understood that developments in China's energy sector now have global environmental implications. It is also well understood that this sector has in recent years experienced rapidly rising fuel costs. The MIT survey, by delving into technology choice, pricing, fuel sourcing, and environmental cleanup at the firm level, provides insights into how the Chinese power sector as a whole responds, and what the environmental implications are. The findings suggest rapid uptake of advanced combustion technologies across the system, largely in response to rising fuel costs. Environmental cleanup systems, particularly for sulfur dioxide, have also spread rapidly, in large part due to regulatory enforcement. Yet, operationally, plants pollute substantially. Price hikes encourage them to source low-grade fuel and idle cleanup systems. On the whole, the Chinese system infrastructurally has a proven capacity for rapid technological upgrading in the face of new market and regulatory pressures. Operationally, however, in part due to exposure to market forces, and in part due to limited state capacity for monitoring operations, even the most advanced power plants remain major polluters.

In this work, we analyze the true expectations of the oil market participants about the future availability of this fundamental energy source. We study the evolution through time of the curves of crude oil futures prices, and we conclude that the market participants, among them the crude oil producers, already expect a near-term peak of oil production. This agrees with many technical predictions for the date of peak production, including our own, that point to peak dates around the end of the present decade.

We establish the asymptotic distribution of the proposed average treatment effects estimator with data-driven smoothing parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed method is capable of performing much better than the conventional kernel approach whereby one splits the sample into subsamples corresponding to discrete cells.

We introduce a scalable infrastructure model for CCS (simCCS) that generates a fully integrated, cost-minimizing CCS system. SimCCS determines where and how much CO(2) to capture and store, and where to build and connect pipelines of different sizes, in order to minimize the combined annualized costs of sequestering a given amount of CO(2). SimCCS is able to aggregate CO(2) flows between sources and reservoirs into trunk pipelines that take advantage of economies of scale. Pipeline construction costs take into account factors including topography and social impacts. SimCCS can be used to calculate the scale of CCS deployment (local, regional, national). SimCCS' deployment of a realistic. capacitated pipeline network is a major advancement for planning CCS infrastructure. We demonstrate simCCS using a set of 37 CO(2) sources and 14 reservoirs for California. The results highlight the importance of systematic planning for CCS infrastructure by examining the sensitivity of CCS infrastructure, as optimized by simCCS, to varying CO(2) targets.

Nevertheless, good reasons can be found to justify a certain degree of heterogeneity among the member firms and at least two sub-clusters of firms, the 'core network' and 'periphery network', can be distinguished.

A stylized analytical model with a monopolist and a competitive fringe (distributed generators) will be developed to analyze the impact of feed-in tariffs on renewable power production. The vertically integrated monopolist maximizes profits by setting the electricity price for residual demand and a network access charge incurred by the fringe. The fringe receives a fixed feed-in tariff per unit of electricity produced. Under vertical integration, a rise in the feed-in tariff induces the monopolist to raise access charges for fringe firms and skim part of their additional income. This partially offsets the supply increase of the fringe firms stimulated by the feed-in tariff. However, in the case of effective unbundling with an externally set access charge, there is no possibility for the monopolist to extract part of the fringe's profit. Then, the feed-in tariff fully accrues to the competitive fringe, and its supply will further increase. This setting will be extended to horizontal expansion when the monopolist also enters the renewable production segment. The effects on prices and output will be derived and compared.

Analysis of the off-take electricity price range, which depends on the net electrical output and electricity market trends, indicates that it is more cost effective for cogeneration units greater than 1 MW to sell their electricity on the exchange market. This was confirmed by developing a mathematical model to calculate the cost-effectiveness ratio of a cogeneration unit. This ratio represents the relation between the profit spread, i.e. the difference between the profit generated from selling the electricity on the exchange market and the profit made from dispatching the electricity to HROTE, as well as the total investment costs. The model can be applied for changes in certain parameters, such as the net electrical output, volatility and spot electricity price. The Monte Carlo method is used to obtain the most probable cost-effectiveness ratio and average future electricity price. Together with these two economic parameters and market price analysis, it is possible to calculate and calibrate an acceptable off-take electricity price. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Excepting the case of fluorescent lights, no technology dominates the entire market but instead each conquers a specific niche. Most of the buildings in which these technologies are installed do not have lower-than-average energy intensity, measured as annual energy use per square meter of floor space. The exceptional technology that does measurably correlate with reduced energy intensity is daylighting. These results suggest that technologies are adopted to serve comfort or quality objectives rather than to save energy, or that buildings' users confound the designers' intentions. Decision makers thus should improve operating and maintenance practices, invest in building commissioning, and rely more heavily on passive design features to save energy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In June 1990, the Spanish government introduced a system of ceiling price regulation in order to ensure that liberalization was accompanied by adequate consumer protection. By 1998, prices were left to the free market. This paper examines the pricing behaviour of the retail gasoline market using multivariate error correction models over the period January 1993 (abolishment of the state monopoly)-December 2004. The results suggest that gasoline retail prices respond symmetrically to increases as well as to decreases in the spot price of gasoline both over the period of price regulation Uanuary 1993-September 1998) and over the period of free market (October 1998-December 2004). However, once the ceiling price regulation was abolished, cooperation emerged between the government and the major operators, Repsol-YPF and Cepsa-Elf, to control the inflation rate. This resulted in a slower rate of adjustment of gasoline retail prices when gasoline spot prices went up, as compared with the European pattern. Finally, the Spanish retail margin was by the end of our timing period of analysis, as in the starting years after the abolishment of the state monopoly, above the European average. This pattern confirms our political economic hypothesis, which suggests that the Spanish government and the oil companies were working together in reducing the inflation, in periods of rising oil and gasoline prices. It is also inferred that explaining the pricing pattern in energy markets may require different hypothesis than the classical perspective, involving just firms taking advantage of market power.

The most consistent finding concerns the great importance of strong Norwegian innovation systems in the maritime and oil and gas industries in underpinning the innovation dynamism of these clusters. This finding has some theoretical implications because the national level is mainly absent in the discourse on local buzz (knowledge spillovers inside the cluster boundaries) and global pipelines (international relations and knowledge flows).

C. S. Scaling-up regional development in globalizing China: local capital accumulation, land-centred politics, and reproduction of space, Regional Studies. Drawing on insights from political economy and Third World political ecology, this study identifies a new process of regional development in globalizing southern China where municipalities have engaged in a land-based and city-centred development as a means of original capital accumulation. Global capitalism and reshuffling of the socialist political economy have given rise to a strategy to scale-up the urban region and reproduce space for locally controlled development. Subsequent gain in growth and competitiveness has been accompanied by increased inequality and social discontents. Greater attention needs to be devoted to the social and political origins of regional development.

We describe a browser extension scheme, which transparently produces a certificate for each user, improving web authentication security and defending against password phishing and other attacks. Since the scheme combines the password entered by the user, the password associated with private key protected by trusted platform module, and user certificate provided by trusted computing platform, thieving only the password at web will not have an affect on user security. And no changes on the server side are required in the scheme.

It uses simple graphical techniques to assess whether a TWC scheme will increase, decrease or have an ambiguous effect on electricity demand, wholesale and retail electricity prices, carbon emissions and investment in energy efficiency. paying particular attention to the interpretation of 'additionality'. Following a comparable analysis of the impact of the EU ETS, the paper examines the implications of introducing a white certificate scheme in a country that is already participating in the EU ETS. It compares the effect of this combination of instruments to that of the EU ETS operating in isolation. It concludes that there is no necessary link between the price of white certificates and marginal cost of energy efficiency investment, the price of electricity or the ability of the suppliers to eliminate free riders from their subsidy schemes. Also, a TWC scheme will make no contribution to reducing global carbon emissions unless and until it leads to a tightening of the EU ETS cap. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective was to find out the environmental impact (EDIP 1997 category, waste evaluation) of the products that appear in the waste stream as a result of facility upgrades. The scope of the study starts from retrofitting of the lamps and air-conditioners through recycling and disposal. For a 36W fluorescent lamp, the bulk waste 1.64E-5 kg, hazardous waste 1.11E-4 kg, radioactive waste 1.09E-9 kg, and slag-ash 6.02E-7 kg occurred at the end of life of the retrofitting cycle. For a 12,000 Btu air-conditioner, the bulk waste 0.58 kg, hazardous waste 0.11 kg, radioactive waste 0.0002 kg, and slag-ash 0.01 kg also occurred at the end of life of the retrofitting cycle. These small amounts become important when viewed at the country level. These quantities imply that the policy makers who deal with hazardous waste should be aware of this waste-generating characteristic before issuing any pertinent policy. Consideration of this characteristic and planning for appropriate waste management methods at the beginning stage will reduce any future problem of contamination by the hazardous waste.

Use of renewables for electricity generation results in less greenhouse gas emissions compared with fossil fuel energy systems and often offers additional synergistic benefits. Despite the large potential for development of renewable energy sources in Bangladesh. currently their contribution to electricity generation remains insignificant, Existing policies and programs on renewable energy in Bangladesh are reviewed in relation to the Specific requirements needed for CDM. A number of barriers are identified that impede the implementation of the CDM mechanism. Overall, it is recommended that more appropriate energy strategies, including a new national renewable energy strategy, need to be formulated and implemented and more suitable institutional settings need to be provided to promote energy sustainability for Bangladesh.

Using international and Chinese firm and industry data over the period 1995-2004, we estimate a productivity growth-technology gap reaction function. We find that as China's coastal industry has closed the technology gap with the international frontier, labour productivity growth in the coastal region has begun to slow in relation to the interior. This may serve as an early indicator of China's initial movement towards reversing growth in spatial income inequality.","[Deng, Paul D.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Jefferson, Gary H.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02454 USA",Copenhagen Business School; Brandeis University,"Deng, PD (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",pdd.eco@cbs.dk; jefferso@brandeis.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [0519902]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0519902] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We most appreciate the helpful comments of George Hall, Catherine Mann, Lewis Putterman and seminar colleagues at the Copenhagen Business School.

First, in the context of a spatial model we generalize two indices. One is a dynamic generalization of the emanating effect that was introduced by Kelejian and colleagues. This index describes how events in one unit spill over time to other units due to spatial interactions. As an analogy, it corresponds to the effect that the smoking habits of a given teenager might have on the smoking habits of each of his/her friends. In a sense, our second index, termed the vulnerability index, is the reverse of the first one in that it describes the response of a given unit over time to events in neighbouring units. The analogy here would be how the smoking habits of a given teenager is affected by the smoking habits of all of his/her friends. Second, we empirically implement our indices in the context of a model explaining GDP per capita growth in various countries. In this context the vulnerability index describes the sensitivity of GDP growth in one country with respect to events in other countries; the emanating effect describes how events in one country effect the GDP growth in other countries.","[Kelejian, Harry H.] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Mukerji, Purba] Connecticut Coll, Dept Econ, New London, CT 06320 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Connecticut College,"Kelejian, HH (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",kelejian@econ.bsos.umd.edu; purbamukerji@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,10,10,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1056-8190,,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

In this research, scenarios for 2020 EVs penetration and charging profiles are studied integrated with different hypotheses for electricity production mix. The impacts in load profiles, spot electricity prices and emissions are obtained for the Portuguese case study. Simulations for year 2020, in a scenario of low hydro production and high prices, resulted in energy costs for EVs recharge of 20 cents/kWh, with 2 million EVs charging mainly at evening peak hours. On the other hand, in an off-peak recharge, a high hydro production and low wholesale prices' scenario, recharge costs could be reduced to 5.6 cents/kWh. In these extreme cases, EV's energy prices were between 0.9(sic) to 3.2(sic) per 100 km. Reductions in primary energy consumption, fossil fuels use and CO(2) emissions of up to 3%, 14% and 10%, respectively, were verified (for a 2 million EVs' penetration and a dry year's off-peak recharge scenario) from the transportation and electricity sectors together when compared with a BAU scenario without EVs.

Previous research has suggested that a significant proportion of people may 'reluctantly accept' nuclear power as a means of addressing the greater threat of climate change. Drawing on the results of a national British survey (n=1822), the current study found that attitudes towards nuclear remain divided, with only a minority expressing unconditional acceptance. In general, people who expressed greater concern about climate change and energy security and possessed higher environmental values were less likely to favour nuclear power. However, when nuclear power was given an explicit 'reluctant acceptance' framing - allowing people to express their dislike for nuclear power alongside their conditional support - concerns about climate change and energy security became positive predictors of support for nuclear power. These findings suggest that concern about climate change and energy security will only increase acceptance of nuclear power under limited circumstances-specifically once other (preferred) options have been exhausted.

Although a univariate specification based upon only lagged consumption performed better than most approaches, it provides little value to the policymaker who wants to understand the factors that influence oil consumption and by how much. One structural approach performed considerably better than all other approaches including the univariate model. This specification is the autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) model that allowed oil demand to respond differently (asymmetrically) to price increases and decreases. Certain forms of this equation, however, do well while others perform poorly.

As the electric power industry is the largest consumer of coal resources in China and also emits high levels of air pollutants each year, the Chinese government has enacted many technical and economic policies for energy conservation and emission reduction in the last few years. These policies are summarized in this paper, along with relevant laws and medium- and long-term plans, all of which address ideas such as adjusting the power generation mix, promoting demand-side management, introducing energy-efficient scheduling, and installing desulfurization units. The paper also assesses the results of these policies by analyzing several key indicators of energy consumption and emissions. The analysis shows that although some progress has been made in conserving energy and reducing emissions, substantial work is still required for China to catch up with developed countries.

This fact could result in an increase in the demand for such services. If this is true, the result would be an increase in total fuel consumption. Consequently, that part of the energy savings obtained through the increased energy efficiency would be lost. The existence of a Rebound Effect is especially important in the road freight transportation sector and is crucial for the definition of a national energy policy. In this study, data from the road freight transportation sector in Portugal for the years of 1987 through 2006 was analyzed. It was determined that an increase in energy efficiency did not cause a backfire, but did cause a total direct rebound effect of 24.1%. In addition, fleet operators were more inclined to adopt operational efficiencies than technological fuel efficiencies as a means of increasing the total operational efficiency.

The panel cointegration results show that in the long run, oil prices have a positive impact on nuclear energy consumption, suggesting the existence of the substitution relationship between nuclear energy and oil. The long-run elasticity of nuclear energy with respect to real income is approximately 0.89, and real income has a greater impact on nuclear energy than do oil prices in the long run. Furthermore, the panel causality results find evidence of unidirectional causality running from oil prices and economic growth to nuclear energy consumption in the long run, while there is no causality between nuclear energy consumption and economic growth in the short run.

Counter-trading is inefficient as it gives the wrong long term signals for entry and exit of power plants. However, in a non-competitive market, additional entry will improve the competitiveness of the market, and will increase social benefit by reducing price-cost margins. This paper studies whether the potential pro-competitive entry effects could make counter-trading more efficient than nodal pricing. We find that this is unlikely to be the case, and expect counter-trading to have a negative effect on overall welfare. The potential benefits of additional competition (more competitive prices and lower production cost) do not outweigh the distortions (additional investment cost for the entrant, and socialization of the congestion cost to final consumers).

This paper centers on estimating the emissions due to seaports, in such a way that they can be included as part of the city's inventory or be used by the port itself to monitor their policy and technology improvements for mitigating climate change. We propose the indicators GHG emissions per ton of cargo handled or per passenger and emissions per value of cargo handled as practical measures for policy making and emission prevention measures to be monitored over time. Adapting existing methodologies to the Port of Barcelona, we calculated a total of 331,390 tons of GHG emissions (CO2 equivalents) for the year of 2008, half of which were attributed to vessel movement (sea-based emissions) and the other half to port, land related activities (land-based emissions). The highest polluters were auto carriers with 6 kg of GHG emissions per ton of cargo handled. Knowing the highest emitters, the port can take action to improve the ship's activities within the port limits, such as maneuvering and hotelling. With these results, the port and the city can also find ways to reduce the land-based emissions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to do so, data from the Spanish Family Budget Surveys for various years are used to estimate growth incidence curves, decomposition models of poverty changes, and isopoverty curves. The results show that while economic growth in the long-term has meant an improvement of the lower income percentiles in Spain, this improvement is not uniform in the different regions. Limited possibilities for poverty reduction in the lower-income regions are also found. [image omitted] Ayala L. et Jurado A.

Cet article cherche a discuter si, oui ou non, il existe d'importants ecarts de la distribution de la croissance economique par tranche des revenus dans les regions d'Espagne. On emploie, alors, des donnees provenant de diverses enquetes sur le budget menager des foyers espagnols afin d'estimer des courbes qui tracent la frequence de la croissance, des modeles de decomposition du changement de la pauvrete, et des courbes de la isopauvrete. Les resultats laissent voir que la croissance economique a permis a long terme une amelioration pour les centiles inferieurs en Espagne. Toujours est-il que cette amelioration n'est pas generalisee sur le plan regional.

Armutsorientiertes Wirtschaftswachstum, Ungleichheit und Fiskalpolitik: der Fall der spanischen Regionen, Regional Studies. In diesem Beitrag wird untersucht, ob es hinsichtlich der Verteilung des Wirtschaftswachstums innerhalb der Einkommensgruppen von spanischen Regionen erhebliche Unterschiede gibt. Hierfur werden anhand der Daten aus den spanischen Familienetat-Erhebungen verschiedener Jahre Wachstumsinzidenzkurven, Dekompositionsmodelle von Armutsanderungen sowie Isolationsarmutskurven geschatzt. Aus den Ergebnissen geht hervor, dass sich durch das Wirtschaftswachstum zwar langfristig die Situation der unteren Einkommensperzentile in Spanien verbessert hat, aber diese Verbesserung in den verschiedenen Regionen nicht gleichmassig ausfallt. Ebenso werden begrenzte Moglichkeiten zur Verringerung der Armut in Regionen mit niedrigerem Einkommen gefunden.

Such thresholds or tipping points in the climate system are likely to depend on both the magnitude and rate of change of surface warming. The collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC) is one example of such a threshold. To evaluate mitigation policies that curb greenhouse gas emissions to levels that prevent such a climate threshold being reached, we use the MERGE model of Manne, Mendelsohn and Richels. Depending on assumptions on climate sensitivity and technological progress, our analysis shows that preserving the THC may require a fast and strong greenhouse gas emission reduction from today's level, with transition to nuclear and/or renewable energy, possibly combined with the use of carbon capture and sequestration systems.

This paper attempts to contribute to a theory of clusters in the biotechnology sector with special reference to those operating at the periphery and away from major and established centres. It identifies causes of delayed and stunted development such as inadequate institutional support, a lack of networking, diverging perceptions, and cognitive disagreement among major players in a cluster. The conclusions are formalised into six propositions. This research has implications for public sector policy and theory of peripheral clusters, thus enriching academic research which frequently concentrates on established clusters that have grown organically.

Shift-share decomposition is performed and the outcomes are investigated with exploratory spatial analysis and space-time econometric models. Substantial changes in the spatial patterns of productivity and its determinants can be observed during the study period. Results indicate a decrease in geographical clustering for productivity and both regional and sectoral factors.

These approaches typically use value added data for an industrial sector to decompose energy trends into structural, intensity and activity effects. Additionally in Europe a commonly employed top-down indicator called ODEX uses units of physical output, rather than value added, to analyse energy efficiency developments only. Therefore it has been difficult to compare ODEX directly to decomposition approaches. This paper presents a new decomposition method called VALDEX, based on the existing ODEX methodology, but using value added data. Extending ODEX to a full decomposition method allows tests commonly used in index decomposition theory to be applied and enables direct comparison with other methods. This helps evaluate the robustness of the existing ODEX methodology. Using industry data from three European countries, the results yielded by five decomposition methods are compared. In the cases examined, both the Laspeyres and VALDEX methods have significant residuals. Laspeyres consistently overestimates total energy consumption while VALDEX underestimates it. Methods that produce small or no unexplained residuals give converging results for each effect for the countries analysed, and provide a more reliable view of energy trends. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These assessment factors are quantified using simulations with measured hourly solar radiation and weather data from the National Solar Radiation Database as primary inputs. Hourly utility load data for each electric utility in Wisconsin for a complete year were used in combination with the simulated PV output to quantify the impacts of high penetration of distributed PV on the aggregate Wisconsin electric utility load. As the penetration rate of distributed PV systems increases, both economic and environmental benefits experience diminishing returns. At penetration rates exceeding 15-20% of the aggregate utility load peak, less of the PV-energy is utilized and the contribution of the aggregate electricity generated from PV approaches a practical limit. The limit is not affected by costs, but rather by the time-distribution of available solar radiation and mismatch with the coincidence of aggregate utility electrical loads. The unsubsidized levelized cost of electricity from PV is more than four times greater than the current market price for electricity, based on time-of-use rates, in Wisconsin. At the present time, the investment in solar PV as a cost-effective means to reduce emissions from traditional electricity generation sources is not justified. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Hawkes, AD",,,,"Hawkes, A. D.",,,Estimating marginal CO2 emissions rates for national electricity systems,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,CO2; Marginal; Electricity,GENERATION; POWER,"The carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction afforded by a demand-side intervention in the electricity system is typically assessed by means of an assumed grid emissions rate, which measures the CO2 intensity of electricity not used as a result of the intervention. This emissions rate is called the marginal emissions factor (MEF). Accurate estimation of MEFs is crucial for performance assessment because their application leads to decisions regarding the relative merits of CO2 reduction strategies. This article contributes to formulating the principles by which MEFs are estimated, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses in existing approaches, and presenting an alternative based on the observed behaviour of power stations. The case of Great Britain is considered, demonstrating an MEF of 0.69 kgCO(2)/kW h for 2002-2009, with error bars at +/- 10%. This value could reduce to 0.6 kgCO(2)/kW h over the next decade under planned changes to the underlying generation mix, and could further reduce to approximately 0.51 kgCO(2)/kW h before 2025 if all power stations commissioned pre-1970 are replaced by their modern counterparts. Given that these rates are higher than commonly applied system-average or assumed long term marginal emissions rates, it is concluded that maintenance of an improved understanding of MEFs is valuable to better inform policy decisions.

Evidence from Indian Cement Industry,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy use efficiency; Undesirable output; Data envelopment analysis,CONSUMPTION; MODELS,"Energy use in the production of desirable output often results in the generation of undesirable emission with detrimental impact on the environment, and whose disposal is frequently monitored by public authorities. Previous studies, however, paid little attention to undesirable output and environmental regulation related to its disposal while estimating energy use efficiency. Analysis of energy efficiency ignoring undesirable output could result in biased estimates of efficiency. Thus the aim of this paper is to estimate energy use efficiency in the presence of energy related undesirable emission by taking Indian cement industry as a suitable context of my analysis. Depending on the presence and absence of undesirable output and environmental regulation, three measures of efficiency have been estimated at the state level from 2000-01 to 2004-05 by applying Data Envelopment Analysis. Energy efficiency is defined as the ability of the producer to reduce the energy input to the largest extent Possible, conditional on the given level of output and non-energy inputs. Empirical results reveal that energy efficiency estimates are biased if only desirable output is considered. Results also demonstrate that environmental regulation has a reinforcing effect on energy use efficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study uses a cultural theory framework and focus groups conducted in the South West UK to develop deeper understandings of how individuals' worldviews can inform opinions and behaviour in relation to RE. These findings are used to explore ways in which government policies on RE might be tailored to engender greater public support and participation. Issues discussed include the provision of economic incentives, information on climate change and RE, linking renewables to overall energy behaviour, and landscape aesthetics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These coefficients can be interpreted as growth rates and cointegration mean level coefficients and express long-run properties of the model. For example, the growth rate coefficients tell us how much to expect (unconditionally) the variables in the system to grow from one period to the next, representing the underlying (steady state) growth in the variables. The estimation of the proposed formulation is made operationally in GRaM, which is a program for Ox Professional. GRaM can be used for analysing structural breaks when the deterministic terms include shift dummies and broken trends. By applying a formulation with interpretable deterministic components, different types of structural breaks can be identified. Shifts in both intercepts and growth rates, or combinations of these, can be tested for. The ability to distinguish between different types of structural breaks makes the procedure superior compared with alternative procedures. Furthermore, the procedure utilizes the information more efficiently than alternative procedures. Finally, interpretable coefficients of different types of structural breaks can be identified.","Stat Norway, Res Dept, NO-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Hungnes, H (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, POB 8131 Dep, NO-0033 Oslo, Norway.",havard.hungnes@ssb.no,"Hungnes, Håvard/JWP-1382-2024","Hungnes, Håvard/0000-0003-1588-0154",,,,,17,5,5,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0305-9049,,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

There is however a substantial case that this assumption is mistaken. This case derives from a consideration of the scale of the tasks and of the limits of non-carbon energy sources, focusing especially on the need for redundant capacity in winter. The first line of argument is to do with the extremely high capital cost of the supply system that would be required, and the second is to do with the problems set by the intermittency of renewable sources. It is concluded that the general climate change and energy problem cannot be solved without large scale reductions in rates of economic production and consumption, and therefore without transition to fundamentally different social structures and systems.

The paper examines the integrated power system plan developed by the Ontario Power Authority in 2007. The basic framework rests on a generic set of evaluation criteria reflecting basic requirements for progress towards sustainability that was adopted, reinterpreted and applied by the Authority in support of its proposed plan. In response to evident deficiencies in the Authority's work, the authors and colleagues undertook a re-examination using a more fully elaborated sustainability assessment framework, specified for application to power system planning. The results point to a plan and plan components substantially different from those proposed by the Authority. More generally, the results highlight three advantages of applying such a sustainability assessment framework: comprehensive coverage of key requirements for progress towards sustainability while ensuring careful attention to the context and concerns of the sector; emphasis on identifying plan options that avoid major trade-offs among the sustainability criteria and recognition of interactions among the social, ecological, economic and technological realms favouring options that offer multiple, mutually reinforcing and lasting benefits.

The broad-scale adoption of the electric vehicle could bring significant changes for society in terms of not only the technologies we use for personal transportation, but also moving our economies away from petroleum and lessoning the environmental footprint of transportation. This article investigates the role of standards, related training and certification for the electric vehicle. It is argued that the potential for the electric vehicle will be stunted without adequate attention being paid to standards, not only in terms of the speed of its uptake and smoothness of this transition, but also in terms of maintaining compatibility between jurisdictions, safety of the public, and helping to ensure environmental sustainability. We highlight a number of areas where new or adaptations of current standards, training and certification may be needed, notably in terms of batteries and charging infrastructures, electricity distribution and accounting for the environmental characteristics of this electricity, and different aspects of vehicle-to-grid and smart grid technologies.

The debates over the Kyoto Protocol and its successor, culminating in the COP15 Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009, maintained a strong preference for public over private financing. Yet it is also clear to most observers that the energy revolution will never happen without the involvement of private finance to drive private investment.

J,"Sherrington, C; Moran, D",,,,"Sherrington, Chris; Moran, Dominic",,,Modelling farmer uptake of perennial energy crops in the UK,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy crops; Farmer adoption,,"The UK Biomass Strategy suggests that to reach the technical potential of perennial energy crops such as short rotation coppice (SRC) willow and miscanthus by 2020 requires 350,000 hectares of land. This represents a more than 20-fold increase on the current 15,546 hectares. Previous research has identified several barriers to adoption, including concerns over security of income from contracts. In addition, farmers perceive returns from these crops to be lower than for conventional crops. This paper uses a farm-level linear programming model to investigate theoretical uptake of energy crops at different gross margins under the assumption of a profit-maximising decision maker, and in the absence of known barriers to adoption. The findings suggest that while SRC willow, at current prices, remains less competitive, returns to miscanthus should have encouraged adoption on a wider scale than at present. This highlights the importance of the barriers to adoption. Recently announced contracts for miscanthus appear to offer a significant premium to farmers in order to encourage them to grow the crops. This raises the question of whether a more cost-effective approach would be for government to provide guarantees addressing farmers concerns including security of income from the contracts. Such an approach should encourage adoption at lower gross margins. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

An activity-based cost (ABC) model uses geographic distribution of aircraft carriers as a proxy allocator of Department of Defense (DoD) baseline cost to regional operations. Allocation follows simply from DoD data that since 1990 no less than one aircraft carrier has been continuously on-station in the Persian Gulf; that eight are required to keep one on-station there; that the Navy has had eleven-fifteen carriers since 1990; and that Army and Air Force units are virtually never deployed to combat operations without Navy units. For 1976-2007 C-PGfp is estimated to be $6.8 x 10(12) and for 2007 $0.5 x 10(12) (2008$). This substantial military investment is not a remedy for the market failure at the heart of regional security problem, which is oil market power. When C-PGfp is added to economic losses attributed to market power in another recent study (Greene, 2010), the severity of this market failure becomes more apparent. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The efficiency levels for car models sold in Korea, including hybrid ones, were measured using the recently developed discrete additive data envelopment analysis (DEA) model that reflects consumer preference. The result of the analysis shows that current hybrid vehicles on the market are still at lower competitive advantage than traditional car models with conventional combustion engines and we can suggest a mix of incentive policies to promote the competitiveness of hybrid vehicles. In addition, we also identify two distinctive trends of hybrid vehicle development: environment-oriented hybrid vehicles and performance-oriented hybrid vehicles. It implies that the government should take account of development trends of hybrid vehicles to achieve the policy goals in designing support schemes and automobile companies that are willing to develop hybrid vehicles can also gain some insights for making strategic decisions.

Within the United States, the state of Texas currently has the largest wind energy capacity with 8797 total megawatts and an additional 660 MW under construction. With this rapid growth, it is important to achieve a better understanding of how wind energy is being perceived by the public. This paper explores three research strands: (i) describing the environmental attitudes of a population in close proximity to a wind farm development, (ii) determining the influence that proximity has on wind energy attitudes, and (iii) determining if the Not-In-My-Backyard (Nimby) phenomenon is appropriate for explaining human perceptions of wind energy. A survey questionnaire was developed to explore perceptions of wind energy in the region as well as general attitudes about energy and the environment. Results regarding general wind energy attitudes signify overall public support for wind energy. In addition, those living closest to the wind farm indicate the lowest levels of support, while those living farthest away indicate much stronger support. Findings support the view that the use of Nimby does not adequately explain the attitudes of local wind farm opposition. Alternative explanations and planning implications are discussed with a focus on public participation and education. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The empirical results obtained do not appear to be in accord with the PIH. Instead, consumption's response to income innovations is found to be much weaker than that predicted by PIH; in particular, the response displays an asymmetric pattern in the sense that it is much stronger for negative than positive income innovations.

Finally, we propose a way to distribute territorially these effects in the Community of Madrid, using eleven intra-regional areas.","[Garrido-Yserte, Ruben; Teresa Gallo-Rivera, Maria] Univ Alcala de Henares, Inst Econ & Social Anal, Area Territorial & Urban Studies, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Madrid 28802, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,"Gallo-Rivera, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala de Henares, Inst Econ & Social Anal, Area Territorial & Urban Studies, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Plazade Victoria 2, Madrid 28802, Spain.",ruben.garrido@uah.es; maria.gallo@uah.es,"Rubén, Garrido-Yserte/E-4545-2015; Maria Teresa, Gallo Rivera/U-8190-2017","Rubén, Garrido-Yserte/0000-0003-2008-1154; Maria Teresa, Gallo Rivera/0000-0003-1566-5753",,,,,30,37,45,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The sugar industry has three avenues for achieving these goals: (i) Improve the over-all efficiency of the process by reducing power and water usage; (ii) expand its markets with a range of innovative edible products; and (iii) enter into the 21st century's bio-based economy by developing products to replace petrochemical-derived products. The industry has done well with the first two of these, but has found barriers to exploiting the latter possibility. Nevertheless, many possibilities exist for utilizing the co-products and waste-products of sugar manufacture, as well as the sugar itself, to produce new and useful products and chemicals that reduce the world's dependence on petrochemical feedstocks.","Sugar Proc Res Inst Inc, New Orleans, LA 70124 USA",,"Godshall, MA (通讯作者)，Sugar Proc Res Inst Inc, New Orleans, LA 70124 USA.",MA.Godshall@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,,40,5,5,0,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 SIXTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0097-6156,1947-5918,978-0-8412-2598-5,ACS SYM SER,ACS Symp.

First it exhibits that standard tools in the measurement of income inequality such as the Lorenz curve and the Gini-inclex, can successfully be applied to the issues of inequality measurement of carbon emissions and the equity of abatement policies across countries. These tools allow policy-makers and the general public to grasp at a single glance the impact of conventional distribution rules such as equal caps or grand-fathering, or more sophisticated ones, on the distribution of greenhouse gas emissions. Second, using the Samuelson rule for the optimal provision of a public good, the Pareto-optimal distribution of carbon emissions is compared with the distribution that follows if countries follow Nash-Cournot abatement strategies. It is shown that the Pareto-optimal distribution under the Samuelson rule can be approximated by the equal cap division, represented by the diagonal in the Lorenz curve diagram.

Although various policy measures are available to address these concerns there has been much discussion on a out one such measure in particular: the use of offsetting measures at the border. This article compares policy discussions in the US and the EU on how to address competitiveness and carbon leakage concerns, with a focus on the role of import-related border adjustment measures. It analyses the kinds of measures that so far have been put forward with a view to addressing competitiveness and carbon leakage; compares the approaches to the problems in the US and the EU: and provides a preliminary discussion of international cooperation on border adjustment measures. It concludes that two kinds of cooperation are needed between the EU and the US - not only cooperation through formal international negotiations, but also cooperation through international learning processes, in which the EU and the US learn from each other about design and implementation issues as they develop their respective cap-and-trade systems.

The results indicate that the causal nexus between electricity consumption and economic growth varies across countries. There is a unidirectional, short-run causality from electricity consumption to real GDP for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, and Ecuador. This means that an increase in electricity consumption directly affects economic growth in those countries. In Venezuela, there is a bidirectional causality between electricity consumption and economic growth. This implies that an increase in electricity consumption directly affects economic growth and that economic growth also stimulates further electricity consumption in that country. However, no causal relationships exist in Peru. The documented evidence from seven South American countries can provide useful information for each government with regard to energy and growth policy.

These companies financed their plants through their own equity and debt with support from the PSP Hydro project. This support comprised a subsidy of 30-50% of investment costs, technical and business development assistance, project monitoring and financial controlling. The experiences gained so far have important implications for similar future micro-hydro energy sector development projects and this paper puts forward three key messages: (i) institutional arrangements rather than technical quality determine the success of such projects: (ii) truly sustainable rural electrification through micro-hydro development demands a high level of local participation at all levels and throughout all project phases, not just after plant commissioning; and (iii) real impact and sustainability can be obtained through close collaboration of local private and financial sector firms requiring only limited external funds. In short, micro-hydro projects can and will be taken up by local investors as a business if the conditions are right. Applying these messages could result in an accelerated uptake of viable micro-hydro activities in Rwanda, and in the opinion of the authors elsewhere too. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This model, however, is inappropriate for energy policy, and its use is termed the Apollo fallacy. The goal of the Apollo Program was the demonstration of engineering prowess while any alternative energy technology must succeed in the marketplace. Several Apollo-like energy programs have been tried and all have failed at high cost. it is argued that the use of Apollo has political benefits but that it is detrimental to the adoption of potentially effective energy policies.

Crude oil must be refined to be useful and jet fuel is only one of many products that can be derived from crude oil. jet fuel is extracted from the middle distillates fraction and competes, for example, with the production of diesel. Crude oil is a limited natural resource subject to depletion and several reports indicate that the world's crude oil production is close to the maximum level and that it will start to decrease after reaching this maximum. A post-Kyoto political agenda to reduce oil consumption will have the same effect on aviation fuel production as a natural decline in the crude oil production. On the other hand, it is predicted by the aviation industry that aviation traffic will keep on increasing. The industry has put ambitious goals on increases in fuel efficiency for the aviation fleet. Traffic is predicted to grow by 5% per year to 2026, fuel demand by about 3% per year. At the same time, aviation fuel production is predicted to decrease by several percent each year after the crude oil production peak is reached resulting in a substantial shortage of jet fuel by 2026. The aviation industry will have a hard time replacing this with fuel from other sources, even if air traffic remains at current levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Private cars were responsible for approx 45% of transport energy demand in 2006 (excluding fuel tourism). The average annual growth of new cars between 1990 and 2006 was 5.2%. This paper focuses on these new cars entering the private car fleet, in particular the purchasing trend towards larger size cars. This has considerably offset the improvements in the technical efficiency of individual car models. The analysis was carried out on the detailed data of each individual new vehicle entering the fleet in 2000-2006. The average CO(2) emissions per kilometre for new petrol cars entering the Irish fleet grew from 166 to 168 g CO(2)/km from 2000 to 2005 and reduced to 164 in 2006. For diesel cars the average reduced from 166 in 2000 to 161 in 2006. The paper also discusses how a recent change in vehicle registration taxation and annual motor tax had a significant impact purchasing trends by supporting lower emission vehicles. Cars with emissions up to 155 g CO(2)/km represented 41% of new private cars sold in Ireland in 2007 compared with 84% during the period July-November 2008. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the GPOA, G8 leaders pledged to encourage the development of cleaner, more efficient and lower-emitting vehicles, and to promote their deployment by, among other means, asking the IEA to review existing standards and codes for vehicle efficiency and to identify best practices. In order to properly response to the above-mentioned requests from G8 leaders, the IEA has launched, among other activities, study on policies for transforming the way we use energy focusing on end-use efficiency including the one in transport sector and made a comprehensive response to the GPOA at the 2008 G8 Summit Meeting in Japan with 25 recommendations on energy efficiency. Regarding these recommendations, the G8 leaders have proclaimed, in the G8 Hokkaido Toyako Summit Leaders Declaration, that they would maximize implementation of the IEA's 25 recommendations.

Thus, the relationship between energy consumption and GDP is crucial for realizing their future development and growth objectives. This article tests for Granger causality and provides long-run structural estimates for the relationship between energy consumption, GDP and urbanization for a panel of Pacific Island countries. For the panel as a whole in the long-run there is bidirectional Granger causality between energy consumption and GDP and these variables exert a positive impact on each other. A 1% increase in energy consumption increases GDP by 0.11%, while a 1% increase in GDP increases energy consumption by 0.23%. The findings suggest that for the panel as a whole these countries should increase investment in energy infrastructure and regulatory reform of energy infrastructure to improve delivery efficiency, continue to promote alternative energy sources and put in place energy conservation policies to reduce unnecessary wastage. These strategies seek to realize the dual objectives of reducing the adverse effects of energy use on the environment, while avoiding the negative effect on economic growth of reducing energy consumption.

We outline a Permit Allocation Contest (PAC) that distributes permits to firms based on their rank relative to other firms. This ranking is achieved by ordering firms based on an observable 'external action' where the external action is an activity or characteristic of the firm that is independent of their choice of emissions in the tradable permit market. We argue that this mechanism has a number of benefits over auctioning and grandfathering. Using this mechanism efficiently distributes permits, allows for the attainment of a secondary policy objective and has the potential to be more politically appealing than existing alternatives.

The results of this study indicated that in China there is a tendency on the Internet to disseminate primarily the positive information about bio-energy with a great emphasis on its benefits. In addition, the study shows that when analyzing the content of the news articles, biogas and liquid bio-fuels will be the main bio-energy development trends in China in the near future.

Firstly, efficiency changes over the last 15 years of rural electric cooperatives in the REP are examined using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Then, the critical determinants of the efficiency changes including political indicator are identified with an application of the Tobit model. Results from the DEA analysis show the overall efficiency score, on a scale of zero to one, changes in the 0.856-0.929 range in 15 years, with two turnaround points in 1996 and 2001. These are the years that the national elections were held. The results also find a gap between the efficient rural electric cooperatives and the inefficient rural electric cooperatives. The results of the Tobit model imply that political power has a negative impact on efficiency. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Commercial electricity intensity has more recently converged toward a bell-shape distribution. By contrast, industry electricity intensity is largely converging toward two distinct groups of countries: one with relatively high electricity intensity and another one with relatively low electricity intensity.

Second, the framework is applied on detailed data about the Flemish tradable certificates support system. Several salient conclusions confirm observations from research in other Countries causing growing awareness. First, most crucial is a careful and detailed qualification of renewable energy sources and technologies. Without, even effectiveness is not reliably measurable. Second, nearby targets of renewable energy output must follow from a clearly designed transition trajectory towards a sustainable electricity sector, Such transition is intertwined with an industrial technological policy for bringing the necessary technologies to development and maturity.

As the market is characterized by spatial competition, a spatial lag model is used to avoid misspecification. The results show that independent retailers generally heighten price competition, as they charge significantly lower prices. At the same time, as consumers might consider gasoline sold at unbranded stations to be inferior, they also reduce price competition for branded stations. Independents therefore ultimately have only a small influence on the prices charged by branded stations.","Vienna Univ Econ & Business Adm, Inst Econ Policy & Ind Econ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Pennerstorfer, D (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business Adm, Inst Econ Policy & Ind Econ, Augasse 2-6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",dieter.pennerstorfer@wu-wien.ac.at,"Pennerstorfer, Dieter/ABE-9902-2020","Pennerstorfer, Dieter/0000-0002-6191-4397",,,,,23,41,47,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The method proposed is analysed technically and economically. Electricity generation in wind farms does not usually coincide with the electrical demand curve. If the wind-power penetration becomes high in the Spanish electrical grid, energy management will become necessary for some wind farms. A method is proposed in this paper to adjust the generation curve to the demand curve by storing electrical energy in batteries during off-peak hours (low demand) and selling stored energy to the grid during peak hours (high demand). With the results obtained and reported in this paper, for a Wind-Batteries system to be economically as profitable as a Wind-Only system, the selling price of the energy provided by the batteries during peak hours should be between 22 and 66c(sic)/kWh, depending on the technology and cost of the batteries. Comparison with flexible thermal generation has been performed. Additionally, the results are compared with those obtained if using hydrogen (Wind-Hydrogen system, which uses an electrolyser, hydrogen tank, and fuel cell instead of batteries), concluding that the Wind-Batteries system is both economically and energetically far more suitable.

This index has an impact on regional performance after controlling for technological capabilities, agglomeration economies, and other factors. Apart from a direct effect of openness, an indirect effect was found coming through patents. This suggests that open regions tap into wider knowledge networks that then affect performance. From a policy perspective, making a region less 'provincial' can be as important as investments in local infrastructures and networks.","[Gambardella, Alfonso] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Cespri, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Mariani, Myriam; Torrisi, Salvatore] Bocconi Univ, Dept Inst Anal & Publ Management & Cespri, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Torrisi, Salvatore] Univ Bologna, Dept Management, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; University of Bologna,"Gambardella, A (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Cespri, Via Filippetti 9, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",agambardella@unibocconi.it; mmariani@unibocconi.it; torrisi@unibo.it,"; Gambardella, Alfonso/K-2641-2012","TORRISI, SALVATORE/0000-0003-4194-5644; Gambardella, Alfonso/0000-0002-8714-5813",,,,,21,26,27,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

It considers the various arguments behind calls for a 'city region' focus, and reviews recent experiences in the Netherlands and England. This highlights that the concept of a 'city region' can be mobilized both as an organizing device and to call attention to place dynamics. There are dangers in a narrow focus on administrative and economic considerations when promoting the creation of 'city region' institutional arenas. Instead, greater attention is needed to promote more integrated, locally specific, place development agendas.","Univ Newcastle, Global Urbanism Res Unit, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Healey, P (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Global Urbanism Res Unit, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",patsyhealey@btinternet.com,,,,,,,72,52,57,1,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A structured information collection method is designed based on Extenics theory; it can collect proper data or information according to a information list cube integrating web search technology and Extenics, then process the information by data mining and Extension transformation.

New federal laws on biofuels promotion have sparked an investment boom. The main activity has been in the biodiesel sector-partly because diesel is the dominant fuel sector in Argentina, and partly because the country had already engineered a soy revolution over the past 15 years, becoming the world's largest exporter of soy oil and soy meal. Biodiesel allows this revolution to be extended-from soy as foodstuff to soy as fuelstock. The biodiesel revolution now underway promises to extend Argentina's latecomer advantages by combining greater scale and lower costs with introduced technical innovations such as genetically modified crops and no-till farming. In this way, Argentina can be seen to be demonstrating the superiority of biofuel production in countries of the South over the conditions obtaining in countries of the North-including superior resources availability, superior energetics and lower costs. Whereas Brazil has demonstrated its superiority in sugarcane-based ethanol, Argentina is about to demonstrate its superiority in soy-based biodiesel. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This Study uses the Functions of Innovation Systems approach to identify key policy issues that need to be addressed in order to prolong Not-way's international leadership position in the development of CCS. The analysis shows that Norway has been Successful in building an innovation system around CCS technology. The key determinants for this achievement are pinpointed in this article. However, the evolution of the innovation system seems to have entered a critical phase that is decisive for a further thriving development of CCS in Norway. The results provide a clear understanding of the current impediments in the CCS innovation system and stress the need to direct policy initiatives at the identified weak system functions-i.e. entrepreneurial activity and market formation-to improve the performance of the system. We discuss how policyrnakers can use these insights to develop a coherent set of policy instruments that would foster the deployment of CCS concepts related to power production and enhanced oil recovery in Norway.

We concentrate on the following issues. Firstly, we analyze the euro achievements during the past 10 years, especially during the financial crisis. And it is worth noting that the single currency has been proved to play the role of an anchor of confidence and stability in times of crisis. Secondly, we further study the challenges brought on by the internal and external factors. And the core problem is that it is a currency without a country. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the governance of the Eurozone and the political issues to which this leads. Without a political union, the Eurozone is at risk and its currency is likely to remain a distant second to the US dollar far into the foreseeable future.","[Wang, Yuanhe] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Polit & Social Dev, Rizhao 276826, Peoples R China",Qufu Normal University,,wangyuanhe8866@163.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-077-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,381.0,384,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BQC58,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280695600085,0
