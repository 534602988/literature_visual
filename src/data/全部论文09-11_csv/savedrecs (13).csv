A move to global free trade would imply higher world economic welfare equal to the sum of all nations' volume-of-trade, or efficiency, effects. Since the sum of the terms-of-trade effects across all nations is zero, terms-of-trade effects are contentious. Konishi, Kowalczyk and Sjostrom (2003) have shown that if customs unions do not affect trade with non-member countries, immediate global free could be achieved if free trade were proposed together with international sidepayments equal to the terms of trade effects. How large would these terms of trade effects, and hence transfers, be? This paper presents estimates from a simple computable general equilibrium model of a world economy of perfect competition. We show that, in some cases, terms-of-trade effects are small compared to efficiency gains, and transfers are not necessary for free trade. In other cases, terms-of-trade gains may account for more than 50% of a country's gains from free trade and transfers could be large.","[Kowalczyk, Carsten] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Riezman, Raymond] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Riezman, Raymond] Univ Nottingham, GEP, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Riezman, Raymond] Univ Munich, CES Ifo, Munich, Germany",Tufts University; University of Iowa; University of Nottingham; University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Kowalczyk, C (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",carsten.kowalczyk@tufts.edu; raymond-riezman@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,19,7,9,2,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Results show that the period was one of atypically rapid growth of total factor productivity (TFP). The rise in firm efficiency occurs across almost all industries and firm types: large or small, state or private, domestic or foreign owned. Changes in Firm ownership type have no direct impact on firm efficiency. However, increased market competition related to rising market share of private firms, new market entrants, foreign-owned firms, and international trade raises TFP across all firms in an industry, whether private or state owned. In addition, competitive pressures that sort out inefficient firms of all types and retain the most efficient, coupled with the entry of new private firms that are at least as efficient as surviving firms, prove to be the major source of TFP gains. Results strongly confirm that market competition fosters efficiency.","[Orazem, Peter F.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Vodopivec, Milan] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Iowa State University; The World Bank,"Orazem, PF (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 267 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",pfo@iastate.edu; mvodopivec@worldbank.org,"Orazem, Peter/D-6525-2016","Orazem, Peter/0000-0003-2092-5089",,,,,30,11,11,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

A key result of our analysis is that the standard negative relationship between money demand and the bond interest rate is seen to be part of a larger economic reality encompassing a broader range of empirically testable implications, including the possibility that the relationship may be positive.

Second, all of these measures of pro-poorness can be decomposed across income sources or components of consumption expenditure (depending on the application). This permits the analyst to unbundle a pattern of growth, revealing the contributions to overall pro-poorness of constituent parts. Third, all of these pro-poorness measures can be modified to measure pro-poorness at percentiles.

Yet, by bridging the US domestic saving-investment gap, capital inflow that matched the huge US current account deficit also enabled a faster rate of domestic capital accumulation than home saving alone would have permitted. Consistent with the theory of international capital movements, this study identifies and compares the respective contributions of domestic and foreign saving to US gross domestic product per worker over the two decades prior to the onset of the US banking crisis. By revealing that foreign borrowing contributed significantly to raising US output and hence living standards over this period, it adds a new dimension to the debate about global imbalances.","[Makin, Anthony J.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Narayan, Paresh Kumar] Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Burwood, Vic, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Deakin University,"Makin, AJ (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",t.makin@griffith.edu.au,"Narayan, Paresh/AAE-8777-2019; Narayan, Paresh Kumar/AEM-2143-2022; Makin, Anthony/C-6738-2017","Makin, Anthony/0000-0002-5556-9590; Narayan, Paresh/0000-0001-7934-8146",,,,,40,0,0,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

This paper considers a wide array of alternative supply contracts, each of which consists of a mixture of constant per-unit wholesale prices, buy-back arrangements, and post sale payments contingent on sales made, such as revenue sharing or buybacks. We show that linear supply contracts specifying any combination of two of these three instruments can implement the vertical integrated outcome for a monopoly, thereby generating the supplier's preferred inventory configuration and price distribution. We extend our results to differentiated product oligopoly, demonstrating that each supplier obtains its preferred inventory configuration and price distribution, given the choices of its rival. Distributors choose optimal inventories from the suppliers' standpoint, even if suppliers do not know the distribution of demand uncertainty, and, given the perfect competition among distributors, all profits in the supply chain are captured by suppliers. Thus, suppliers are able to deal with demand uncertainty with remarkably little information about demand, and without the need to control dealer actions in detail. In particular, suppliers need not specify either dealer inventories or resale prices, but instead encourage distributors to order based on information in their possession and to set prices that generate desirable resale price dispersion.

We incorporate the employment rate as an intermittent variable in the bivariate model between electricity consumption and economic growth-thereby creating a simple trivariate causality framework. Our empirical results show that there is a distinct bidirectional causality between electricity consumption and economic growth in South Africa. In addition, the results show that employment in South Africa Granger-causes economic growth. The results apply irrespective of whether the causality is estimated in the short-run or in the long-run formulation. The study, therefore, recommends that policies geared towards the expansion of the electricity infrastructure should be intensified in South Africa in order to cope with the increasing demand exerted by the country's strong economic growth and rapid industrialisation programme. This will certainly enable the country to avoid unprecedented power outages similar to those experienced in the country in mid-January 2008. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, it models the volatility of oil return as a stochastic volatility process whose mean is subject to shifts in regime. The shift is governed by a two-state first-order Markov process. The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the models. The main findings are: first, there is clear evidence of regime-switching in the oil market. Ignoring it will lead to a false impression that the volatility is highly persistent and therefore highly predictable. Second. incorporating regime-switching into the SV framework significantly enhances the forecasting power of the SV model. Third. the regime-switching stochastic volatility model does a good job in capturing major events affecting the oil market. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Consistent with the existing corruption indices, the subjects in India exhibit a higher tolerance of corruption than the subjects in Australia. However, the subjects in Singapore have a higher tolerance and the subjects in Indonesia have much lower tolerance of corruption than expected.

We compare the constant-reward second-price auction with the socially optimal mechanism and show that the auction generates social welfare that is close to the optimal mechanism, while requiring less information and weaker commitment.

In this paper we investigate experimentally the hypothesis that the motivation driving an action is relevant for its perceived kindness and, as a consequence, for reciprocal behavior. In particular, we examine the hypothesis that, for a given distributional outcome, positive reciprocity is less strong in response to strategically motivated actions than to non-strategically motivated actions. Our results indicate that, both at the aggregate and the individual level, reciprocity is significantly stronger when strategic motivations can be ruled out. These findings suggest that intentions matter and, in particular, that models of intention-based reciprocity should take into account the nature of the motivations behind choices.

These articles provide a characterization of the decision criterion that satisfies the axioms and shows that the two axioms are equivalent to physical limits in the long-run future. The author proves that maximizing discounted utility with a long-run survival constraint is equivalent to maximizing a criterion that treats equally the present and the future. The equal treatment axioms are therefore the essence of sustainable development. The weight. given to the long-run future is here identified with the marginal utility of the environmental asset along a path that narrowly misses extinction. An existence theorem is also provided for optimizing according to the welfare criterion that treats equally the present and the future.

We show that allowing the principal to strategically distribute the production inputs across heterogenous agents as part of the contract design, the principal is able to change what appears to be a uniform contract into individualized contracts tailored to fit agents' preferences or characteristics. Using micro level data on swine production contract settlements, we find that contracting farmers are heterogenous with respect to their risk aversion or the costs of effort and that this heterogeneity affects the principal's allocation of production inputs across farmers. Relying on the identifying assumption that contracts are optimal, we obtain the estimates of a lower and an upper bound of agents' reservation utilities. We show that farmers with higher risk aversion have lower outside opportunities and hence lower reservation utilities. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we consider the case where controls co-exist with an exchange rate band aimed at managing the nominal exchange rate. We develop a methodology to deal explicitly with the interaction between these two policies. The main findings may be summarized as follows: (a) a tightening of capital controls on inflows depreciates the exchange rate and (b), we find that a tightening of capital controls increases the unconditional volatility of the exchange rate, but makes it less sensitive to external shocks.

We show that the cognitive hierarchy model is a special case of Truncated QRE. We conduct experiments designed to differentiate these approaches.

The cases are drawn principally from Asia, where the pattern has often been a dominant single-party structure evolving into a full multi-party democratic structure. This results from the interaction of the politics and changes that result from the growth process itself, such as the emergence of politically active middle and entrepreneurial classes. The role of political leadership in managing, sequencing, and pacing these transitions is discussed. We do not yet have a general model for which these cases would be instances.

Under these circumstances, optimal congestion tolls are differentiated across carriers, and a uniformity requirement on airport charges (as occurs when slots are sold or tolls are Uniform) distorts carrier flight choices. Flight volumes tend to be too low for large carriers and too high for small carriers. But quantity-based regimes, where the airport authority allocates a fixed number of slots via free distribution or an auction, lead carriers to treat total flight volume (and thus congestion) as fixed, and this difference generates an efficient outcome as long as the number of slots is optimally chosen.

However, a new breed of export control policy, namely domestic sale requirement, is pursued by some developing countries. According to this policy, a certain percentage of the output is required to be sold in the domestic market and only the remaining production can be exported. Indonesia has undertaken this policy in addition to subsidizing domestic sales of crude oil to benefit the consumers. This study analyzes the effects of these two policies on prices, quantities, and welfare, and compares these effects to those of export quota. The results show that the domestic sale requirement-cum-subsidy policies are clearly inferior to free trade but superior to export quota, because under these policies, unlike under the export quota, supply is allowed to respond to world market prices.","Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho,"Devadoss, S (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",devadoss@uidaho.edu,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Having successfully integrated globally before the financial meltdown of the 1990s, and integrating regionally at an even faster pace since then, East Asia's middle-income countries must now accelerate a third integration, this time at home. Growth based on scale economies and specialization requires managing both gravity and friction.

A comparison of the corporate size distributions before and after the VAT introduction of 1989 shows a clustering of corporations just below the threshold-a pattern that is attributable to the behavioral responses. To rule out the confounding influences of the changes in the company attributes over the years, we applied a semiparametric density decomposition technique developed by DiNardo, Fortin. and Lemieux (DiNardo J., Fortin N.M., Lemieux T., Labor market institutions and the distribution of wages, 1973-1992: a semiparametric approach.

A regime is said to be transparent if planned inflation is observable and reveals the central bank's preferences and to be non-transparent if planned inflation is unobservable and can be only imperfectly inferred from actual inflation. Acentral bank in the non-transparent regime is said to become more transparent when actual inflation becomes a better signal of planned inflation. I find several results about transparent and non-transparent regimes: some are novel and some contrast with the results of earlier papers. In particular, I demonstrate that in a non-transparent regime, increased transparency need not improve the public's ability to infer a central bank's private information. I show that society and central banks are better off with more transparency. My numerical results suggest that society and central banks prefer the transparent to the non-transparent regimes.

Investor groups cannot be classified as positive or negative feedback traders on market returns when both stock and futures markets are considered, which is inconsistent with the results in Ghysels and Seon (2005). Foreign investors and domestic institutions tend to take opposite positions in both markets. The impact of foreign investors on the basis change is significantly negative in the futures market, whereas domestic institutions have a negative relation in the stock market. This supports the view that selling activity of foreign investors in the futures market pulls the futures price down compared with the index value and, consequently, induces the reverse cash-and-carry trade of domestic institutions. This relationship, which negatively influenced the Korean economy during the crisis, as shown in Ghysels and Seon (2005), still exists in the Korean financial markets.","[Song, Young-Rae; Yang, Yong-Jun; Oh, Hyung-Sik] Seoul Natl Univ, Investment Engn Lab, Coll Engn, Seoul 151744, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Song, YR (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Investment Engn Lab, Coll Engn, Seoul 151744, South Korea.",kaljabi4@snu.ac.kr; mogwai95@snu.ac.kr; ohk@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

First, the role of the economist John Maynard Keynes-as theoretician, compiler, supporter and user-is addressed. This role is substantial and has been greatly misunderstood or misrepresented by a large part of the literature. Second, the pioneering contributions made at the start of the 20th century by Alfred Flux, Arthur Bowley and Josiah Stamp, and later by Colin Clark, are detailed. The debates between these men mark the emergence of National Accounts as a serious discipline. Their work was supported by the earlier theoretical contributions of Alfred Marshall, and by practical developments, in particular the instigation of a Census of Production in 1907. Taken together, the two considerations tell a good part of the story of the emergence of National Accounting on the world stage.","Govt Econ Serv, HM Treasury, London SW1A 2HQ, England",,"Tily, G (通讯作者)，Govt Econ Serv, HM Treasury, 1 Horseguards Rd, London SW1A 2HQ, England.",geoff.tily@hm-treasury.gov.uk,,,,,,,63,19,21,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

This model captures some salient features of Chinese trade and allows us to analyze the impact of trade liberalization on wage inequality. At present, Chinese trade displays the following features: high-quality cars are imported and low-quality cars are produced and consumed domestically, for which some parts are imported. These features lead us to consider trade liberalization as two types of tariff reduction: namely, a tariff reduction on final quality-differentiated goods and a tariff reduction on intermediate goods. This study shows that the two types of tariff reduction have completely different effects on wage inequality. Moreover, the results show that welfare inequality and wage inequality change in opposite directions when the tariff on final quality-differentiated goods is reduced.","[Ma, Yan; Dei, Fumio] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Kobe University,"Ma, Y (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",mayan003@kobe-u.ac.jp; dei@kobe-u.ac.jp,"Ma, Yan/GXM-7843-2022",,,,,,14,11,13,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

An empirical model was analyzed to observe the impact of electric power prices on the selection of a liberalization model in the power sector. This was achieved by the use of an ordered response. fixed effect and a random effect model. An instrument variable technique was also used to estimate the impact of the liberalization model on the electric power price. This technique addressed the problems of simultaneity bias between the electric power price and the liberalization models selected. These econometric models were designed using panel data from 78 countries in four regions (developed countries, Asian developing countries, the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and Latin America) for the period from 1985 to 2003. The research findings suggest that higher electricity prices are one of the driving forces for governments to adopt liberalization models. However, the development of liberalization models in the power sector does not necessarily reduce electricity prices. In fact, contrary to expectations, there was a tendency for the price to rise in every market modeled. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We contribute to the scrutiny by asking how university bioscientists design and finance their research, with particular attention to the mutuality of research portfolio choice and funding success. The analysis requires consideration of other major influences on academic science, including scientific norms, human capital, and institutional environment. Drawing on a national survey of university bioscientists, we find that public financial support encourages more basic investigation and private support encourages more applied investigation. Yet downstream research is only moderately more excludable than upstream. Once research basicness and other program factors are accounted for, neither the next public nor the next private dollar brings significantly more excludable laboratory discoveries. Public money is attracted to applied and excludable research, and private and public funding crowd each other out at the margin. Professional norms have substantial impacts on the research pursued and financing obtained.","[Buccola, Steven] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Ervin, David] Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Yang, Hui] Bank Amer, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA",Oregon State University; Portland State University; Bank of America Corporation,"Buccola, S (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, 213 Ballard Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",sbuccola@oregonstate.edu; dervin@pdx.edu; hui.yang@bankofamerica.com,,,,,,,65,11,14,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

If capital is perfectly mobile between sectors, a pure transfer has no long-run impact on the real exchange rate. A decline in the traded sector occurs because the transfer, being denominated in traded output, substitutes for exports in financing imports. While a pure transfer causes short-run real exchange appreciation, this response is temporary and negligibly small. Transfers allocated to productivity enhancement do generate permanent real exchange rate adjustments in response to the sectoral reallocation of productive factors. The analysis, which employs extensive numerical simulations, emphasizes the tradeoffs between real exchange adjustments, long-run capital accumulation, and economic welfare, associated with alternative forms of transfers.","[Tekin, Serpil; Turnovsky, Stephen J.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Cerra, Valerie] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; International Monetary Fund,"Turnovsky, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",sturn@u.washington.edu,,,,,,,34,12,15,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We collect data on overconfidence among 460 twin pairs. Overconfidence is measured as the difference between the perceived and actual rank in cognitive ability. Cognitive ability is measured using a 20-minute test of general intelligence. We find a highly significant joint effect of genes and common environment, but our estimates of the relative contributions of genetic and common environmental variation are less precise.

The hypothesis has, however, not been tested empirically. This paper addresses the issue by estimating the impact of PTAs on countries' ability to attract multinationals. The evidence is broadly consistent with expectations. The formation of PTAs leads to in increase in FDI by outside multinationals, but the effect varies sharply with the size of integrated markets and Countries' comparative advantage. Countries integrated with larger markets experience a greater increase in total and export-platform FDI. Those with a higher labor endowment also attract more FDI especially in labor-intensive industries, but at the expense of their labor-scarce PTA partners. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Our results indicate that the strength of the exchange rate pass-through substantially declined over time mainly due to a fall in inflation rates and to some extent due to the so-called composition effect. The asset price channel is weak and is likely to remain weak because of shallow stock and private bond markets and because of low stock and bond holdings of domestic households. House prices may become an exception with booming mortgage lending and with high owner occupancy ratios. While the credit channel could be a powerful channel of monetary transmission - as new funds raised on capital markets are close to zero in CEE - it is actually not, as both commercial banks and non-financial corporations can escape domestic monetary conditions by borrowing from their foreign mother companies. The moderately good news, however, is that those banks and firms are influenced by monetary policy in the euro area because their parent institutions are themselves subjected to the credit channel in the euro area.","[Egert, Balazs] Univ Paris 10, Dept Econ, OECD, Nanterre & William Davidson Inst, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [MacDonald, Ronald] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Universite Paris Nanterre; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of Glasgow,"Égert, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 10, Dept Econ, OECD, Nanterre & William Davidson Inst, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",,,,,,,,140,32,33,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

In this model, when other traders are uncertain about the manipulator's target price, the mean target price has no effect on prices, and raising the variance of the target price can increase average price accuracy, by boosting the returns to informed trading and thereby incentives for traders to become informed.","[Hanson, Robin] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Oprea, Ryan] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",George Mason University; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Hanson, R (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",,,,,,,,25,24,34,1,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0427,,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2009,76.0,302,,,,,304,314,,10.1111/j.1468-0335.2008.00734.x,0.0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,421SR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264379100006,0

Dissent is useful to (1) foster the use of objective (and sometimes private) information in decision making and (2) give credibility to the Decision Maker's choices. However, dissent comes at the cost of hurting the Implementer's intrinsic motivation, thereby impairing organizational efficiency. We show that dissent can be optimal, in particular, when information is useful and uncertainty is high. Moreover, dissent remains an optimal organizational form even when Implementers can choose their employer or when Decision Makers have real authority over hiring decisions.

Without comprehensive measures of output, productivity statistics may be misleading. I outline methods used in the measurement of both private and public sector productivity and discuss the measurement of public sector productivity in practice. Finally I discuss studies that examine factors underlying productivity differences and productivity growth in public and private sector organizations.

The aim of this paper is to shed light on the impact of the European economic integration on Spanish labour market and the convergence to a European level of prosperity. We found that the Balassa-Samuelson effect, product market competition, and capital liberalization have been the main driving forces in this period. The adjustment dynamics show that Spanish inflation has adjusted in the long run to the European purchasing power parity level (as measured by the German price level) corrected for the Balassa-Samuelson effect. In the medium run this long-run convergence was achieved by two types of Phillips curve mechanisms; one where the inflation/unemployment trade-off was triggered off for different levels of the interest rate and real wage costs, another one where the trade-off was a function of the real exchange rate and the interest rate. Excess wages and/or increasing cost levels in the tradable sector led to higher unemployment rather than higher prices. Thus, much of the burden of adjustment was carried by unemployment in this period.","[Juselius, Katarina] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ordonez, Javier] Jaume I Univ, Castellon De Plana, Spain",University of Copenhagen; Universitat Jaume I,"Juselius, K (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",Katarina.Juselius@econ.ku.dk; jmonfort@eco.uji.es,"Ordonez, Javier/K-3665-2014","Ordonez, Javier/0000-0002-1453-2441",,,,,37,0,0,0,8,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 3,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,20094,,,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20LS,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208142100001,0

In this paper, we apply cointegration methodology to assess the short- and long-run impact of fluctuations in the yen-dollar real exchange rate on Japan's trade balance with the U.S. for 117 industries. We find that depreciation causes the trade balance to improve in the long-run for about one-third of Japanese industries.

It is shown that tenure track may help reduce information rent for the department in the situation where a smaller portion of high productive researchers are entitled to undertake very costly and time-consuming research project with a high potential value. However, when the probationary period cannot efficiently screen out the low productive researchers, providing both short-term non-tenured contract and tenure contract without probationary period or merely providing short-term non-tenured contract will be more likely taken by department. Therefore, the coexistence of different contractual forms in higher educational system, including the growing use of non-tenure track in some academic sectors can be economically explained.

Predicting competitive outcomes therefore requires identifying the productive and strategic advantages of different organizational configurations: pure public, pure private or a public-private mix. We consider a make-versus-buy decision in a government procurement context by identifying the strength of public agencies as having an inherent advantage in accessing local infrastructure while private firms are identified as having a superior incentive to exploit returns to scale technologies due to their ability to service multiple localities. We focus on the choice of system configuration for the provision of Emergency Medical Services (EMS), a socially important service which benefits from infrastructural synergies as well as technological improvements (i.e. medical quality). We test our predictions on a panel data set of the 200 largest US cities and find that smaller cities and poorer access to hospitals favor the mixed public-private configuration in the provision of EMS.

We find a strong divide between Single-Member District (SMD) and Proportional Representation (PR) deputies High statistical significance of gas production is demonstrated throughout the three Duma terms and shows Gazprom's key position in the post-Soviet Russian economy. Oil production is variably significant in the two first Dumas, when the main legislative debates on oil privatization occur. There is no constant left-right continuum, which is consistent with the deputies' proclaimed party ideology. The pro- and anti-reform poles observed in our Poole-based single dimensional scale are not necessarily connected with liberal and state-oriented regulatory policies, respectively.

In the regression analysis, transaction costs associated with entry into the labor market and reservation wages are estimated simultaneously along with market wages. The estimation results provide evidence of the existence of transaction costs in the labor market and discrimination against backward classes with regard to access to regular employment. In line with previous studies, the results suggest that the achievements of India's reservation policy so far have at best been limited. In addition, a comparison between the estimates from the model employed in this paper and conventional (reduced-form) approaches shows that discrimination in labor market entry is likely to be underestimated in the conventional reduced-form approaches.

The reason for this exercise is twofold. Firstly, it is generally accepted that individual households regard consumer durables as assets even though they are not treated as such in the System of National Accounts 1993. Secondly, the issue is related to the definition of household saving ratios. For instance, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board publishes three household saving measures. The main difference between these saving ratios is that one is derived by treating expenditure on consumer durables as investments while the other two are compiled by considering them to be household final consumption expenditure. We find that the effect of capitalizing consumer durables on EA saving ratios is moderate.

In particular, the intention is to discover if price increases in certain Autonomous Communities, as a result of the application of the regional tranche of the Hydrocarbon Retail Sales Tax (HRST) has affected fuel purchases in neighboring Communities. In order to achieve the above-mentioned objectives, the monthly purchases of automotive diesel in Aragon between January 2001 and March 2007 is estimated from the fuel price in Aragon, the relation between prices in each of the bordering Communities and Aragon, weighted by density of traffic, the number of vehicles registered in that Community, and three dummy variables representative of the implementation of the regional tranche of the HRST in Madrid, Catalonia, and Valencia. The paper finds empirical evidence to demonstrate a positive effect of the relative prices in the neighboring Communities and vehicle registrations, and also a negative effect of prices in Aragon, upon the acquisition of diesel in this region.

In one of two possible cases, it is shown that any reduction in the capacity of a public service will lower total surplus unless the price of the public service is too low and its quality is too high.","Yokohama City Univ, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Yokohama City University,"Nishijima, M (通讯作者)，Yokohama City Univ, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

The basic idea is to solve first for the stationary solution of the model, without aggregate shocks but with fully specified idiosyncratic shocks. Afterwards one computes a first-order perturbation of the solution in the aggregate shocks. This approach allows to include a high-dimensional representation of the cross-sectional distribution in the state vector. The method is applied to a model of household saving with uninsurable income risk and liquidity constraints. Techniques are discussed to reduce the dimension of the state space such that higher order perturbations are feasible. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As the RMB has followed a remarkably predictable appreciation over time, I examine the price of Chinese exports to the USA after unpegging the exchange rate. Results suggest that the Chinese industries with greater import market share were able to raise their prices after the removal of the pegged exchange rate regime; however, over time there is a significant deflationary trend. Chinese export prices tended to decrease under an unanticipated RMB appreciation; this effect was more pronounced for industries with more pricing flexibility. This suggests that Chinese exporters are consistently pricing to market and thus creating a significant foreign exchange policy implication. Specifically, a more flexible exchange rate regime will likely have little impact on the prices of Chinese exports to the USA but might increase the profit volatility of Chinese firms.","Coll Charleston, Dept Econ & Finance, Charleston, SC USA",College of Charleston,"Witte, MD (通讯作者)，Coll Charleston, Dept Econ & Finance, Charleston, SC USA.",wittem@cofc.edu,,,,,,,12,2,3,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2009,17.0,2,,,,,65,78,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01142.x,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,425AV,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264610300005,0

This paper reviews that literature, focusing on two categories of studies: (1) those that assume that a country's characteristics are invariant to the adoption of a common currency and (2) those that assume that a monetary union alters an economy's structure, resulting in trade creation and credibility gains. The literature reviewed suggests that a relatively small group of countries, typically including South Africa, satisfies the criteria necessary for monetary unification. The literature also suggests that, in a monetary union comprising all SADC countries and a regional central bank that sets monetary policy to reflect the average economic conditions (e.g. fiscal balances) in the region, the potential losses (i.e. higher inflation) from giving up an existing credible national central bank, a relevant consideration for South Africa, could outweigh any potential benefits of trade creation resulting from a common currency.",,,,,,,,,,,77,18,21,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We apply our model to the valuation of an investment in the car parts industry documented in previous literature.

We investigate the impact of the actual tax reforms on married couples' participation through a model of heterogeneous households. Theoretically, we elucidate what aspects of the tax reforms are important for a family time allocation choice when the work choice is discrete. Quantitatively, we show that even in the 1980's, changes in tax laws account for only 8% of the increase in the proportion of two-earner couples, although this small average impact masks a much larger impact experienced by women with high earning husbands. Another important finding is that the Earned Income Tax Credit substantially discourages work participation among married couples with low-earning husbands. A notable contribution of this work is the accurate incorporation of the complex U.S. tax code into a model of heterogeneous households, which is done using TAXSIM, a tax calculator software.","[Bar, Michael] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Leukhina, Oksana] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Bar, M (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",mbar@sfsu.edu; oksana@email.unc.edu,,"Leukhina, Oksana/0000-0003-0490-3111",,,,,32,9,12,0,7,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Results indicate that the market for university graduates has expanded much more than that for undergraduates, and that idiosyncratic shocks are more relevant driving job flows for university graduates than for nongraduates.

The respective evolutions of the HIIT and VIIT of the IT industry indicate that HIIT has often dominated VIIT in the IT industry, which is obviously contrary to the present pattern of world trade. The empirical results further reveal the principal pattern of the IT firms' foreign direct investment strategies as facilitating the market rather than seeking efficiency in the host regions. The effect of revealed comparative advantage in relation to VIIT and HIIT demonstrates that vertical specialization is significant between Asia and the EU whereas horizontal specialization plays a key role between Asia and the US. The Asian financial crisis significantly promoted VIIT in regard to Asian IT firms in the US market. Finally, regional trade associations such as the EU and Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have strengthened the vertical specialization of EU IT firms in Asian countries.","Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Chang, SC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm, 43,Sec 4,Keelung Rd, Taipei, Taiwan.",scchang@ba.ntust.edu.tw,,,,,,,46,7,10,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

This paper presents a model of city growth that rationalizes this pattern. Increasing returns to scale constitute the force that favors agglomeration of resources in a city, and convex costs associated with the stock of installed capital represent the congestion force that limits city size. The key to generating sequential city growth is the assumption of irreversible investment in physical capital. As expected, the presence of a positive external effect of aggregate city capital on individual firms makes the competitive equilibrium inefficient.","Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA",Clemson University,"Cuberes, D (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA.",cuberes@clemson.edu,,,,,,,36,9,9,0,6,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

In the prisoners' dilemma, if the probability of trembles is sufficiently small, both players in every location will ultimately cooperate most of the time.","[Cui, Zhiwei; Zhai, Jian] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Cui, Zhiwei] Beijing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xuan] E Carolina Univ, Greenville, NC 27858 USA",Zhejiang University; Beihang University; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,"Cui, ZW (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",cuizhi-wei82@yahoo.com.cn; jzhai@zju.edu.cn; liux@ecu.edu,"Cui, Zhiwei/AAI-4021-2020","Cui, Zhiwei/0000-0002-2822-2145",,,,,22,3,3,0,5,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

This parameterization will appear to be equivalent to the one used in the empirical literature. The Cournot and the competitive outcomes coincide, respectively, with the softest and the toughest oligopolistic equilibrium outcome. The concept offers an alternative to the conjectural variations approach with better foundations. It can be viewed as a canonical description of oligopolistic behavior which can receive different theoretical justifications and provide a convenient tool for modeling purposes. Two illustrative cases (linear and isoelastic demands) are developed and the possibility of endogenizing (strategically) the choice of competitive toughness by the firms is examined.

For a two-month horizon the corn, soybean meal and hog markets show no signs of a risk premium, while very weak support for a time-varying premium emerges in live cattle.

So this paper is a cross-disciplinary study between nanotechnology and social sciences. There are two different scenarios about the future of nanotechnology. One is the proof of radical nanotechnology and the other is the acceptance of the claim that nanotechnology is only an enabling technology.

Istria could greatly benefit from this concept, which should be systematically analyzed in order to get a clear picture of how justified it is to create an Istrian golf region.

Tourism demand forecasting using tourist arrivals from the UK to the whole Cyprus did not provide significant results. Short-term estimations from error correction models have proved that real income and relative prices are significant determinants of tourist arrivals to the both parts of Cyprus except the case of German tourist arrivals to the South Cyprus. Conditional Granger causality tests confirmed causation that runs from real income and relative prices to tourist arrivals from mainlands of Turkey and Greece to both parts of Cyprus in the long-term.,"[Katircioglu, S.; Yorucu, V.] E Mediterranean Univ, Famagusta, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Katircioglu, S (通讯作者)，E Mediterranean Univ, POB 95 Famagusta,N Cyprus Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Turkey.",,"Katircioglu, Salih T./H-3494-2016",,,,,,31,0,0,0,9,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

Since the beginning of the nineties, virtual organizations are applauded as the most economically efficient organizational structure to confront the challenges of increasing global competition and environmental complexity. However, when looking at this new organizational activity from a relational constructionist perspective, several critical questions and dilemmas emerge that go unnoticed in the literature. At the same time, in real life 'Open Innovation' cases, the possibilities and boundaries of virtual organizing are also becoming clearer. Compared to classical organizing, virtual organizing makes different demands on managing interdependencies, collaboration, communication. leadership and evaluation, decision making, loyalty and identification with the company. This article inquires into the processes and effects of boundary blurring: dilemmas and challenges concerning trust, loyalty and identity/identification; critical career elements and inclusion/exclusion mechanism: and the role of the leader/facilitator as convener.

Our main findings are as follows. First, the cointegration test reveals that public investment in agriculture and the productivity of agricultural land exhibit a significant positive relationship in the long run, where the elasticity of land productivity in relation to public investment in agriculture is 0.55. Second, when controlling for endogenous structural breaks, the long-run equilibrium relationship for the productivity of the agricultural land model is still supported. Third, the results of the weak exogeneity test indicate that a causal relationship exists in the long run between public investment in agriculture and the productivity of land, indicating that the growth of the agricultural sector must in the long run be based on the government's public investment in the agricultural sector. Furthermore, as the agricultural sector grows, this growth is able to stimulate public investment on the part of the government in the agricultural sector, so that the two affect each other. Fourth, from the short-run error correction model estimation, it is found that public investment in agriculture is a major means of adjusting for the disequilibria that occur within the system. Fifth, in the short run, the unidirectional causal relationship in terms of the productivity of agricultural land on public investment in agriculture is established, otherwise it is not established. From this it can be seen that in the short run, the government is unable to reveal the effectiveness of its public investment in agriculture.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung 40227, Taiwan; [Hsu, Yi-Chung] Natl Taichung Inst Technol, Dept Publ Finance & Taxat, Taichung, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.",ccl@nchu.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,56,6,7,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

(2007) found that a sticky-price model does not generate sectoral co-movement and that the propagation mechanism is weak in response to monetary shocks if prices in the durable goods sector are significantly flexible, which raises a co-movement problem in sticky-price models. In this paper, we estimate sticky-price models with both durable and nondurable goods sectors in order to examine sectoral price stickiness and co-movement using actual data. The estimation results show that prices in both sectors are relatively sticky and the co-movement problem does not occur in the usual settings. We find, however, that the co-movement problem may occur when we introduce persistent price-markup shocks in a sticky-price model. We also estimate nominal rigidities models with sticky wages as well as sticky prices and find that sticky wages are helpful in explaining sectoral co-movement in addition to sticky prices.","Yeungnam Univ, Gyongsan, South Korea",Yeungnam University,"Lee, JH (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Gyongsan, South Korea.",lee1838@ynu.ac.kr,"Lee, Junhee/A-2247-2019","Lee, Junhee/0000-0003-3634-051X",,,,,15,2,2,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The letter gave rise to a lively debate on whether policymakers should pay attention to the link between inflation and M4 money growth. Using UK data since the introduction of inflation targeting in October 1992, we show that: (i) the relationship between inflation and M4 growth is not stable over time, and (ii) the tendency of M4 to exert inflationary pressures is conditional on annual M4 growth exceeding 9.8. Above this threshold, the money effect on inflation is very small. The implication is that the Monetary Policy Committee should not be particularly worried for not paying close attention to M4 money movements when setting interest rates.","[Milas, Costas] Keele Univ, Dept Econ, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England; [Milas, Costas] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy",Keele University,"Milas, C (通讯作者)，Keele Univ, Dept Econ, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England.",c.milas@keele.ac.uk,,"Milas, Konstantinos/0000-0002-9789-384X",,,,,31,5,7,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

However, empirical studies examining the long-run relationship between the military expenditures of the two countries offer little evidence in favor of such an interaction. This paper attributes the poor results of the previous literature to the adherence to linear cointegration techniques and argues that if the adjustment towards long-run equilibrium is asymmetric, nonlinear co-integration models should be employed. Accordingly, this paper considers threshold autoregressive (TAR) and momentum threshold autoregressive (M-TAR) models as alternative adjustment processes for the cointegration relationship, following Enders and Siklos (2001). The results indicate that the relationship between the variables can be characterized by a threshold cointegration specification following an M-TAR type adjustment process.","[Oecal, Nadir] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Yildirim, Juelide] Gazi Univ, Dept Econometr, Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; Gazi University,"Öcal, N (通讯作者)，Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey.",ocal@metu.edu.tr,"Öcal, Jülide Yıldırım/G-5706-2018","Öcal, Jülide Yıldırım/0000-0002-4739-6028; Ocal, Nadir/0000-0001-6607-0587",,,,,15,8,8,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

A look at the case of Chile,INVESTIGACION ECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,inflation targeting; balance-of-payments constrained economies; inflation; Chile; Latin America; Central Bank; monetary policy,MONETARY-POLICY,"The current international financial system is anchored on the United States dollar. Countries that do not issue the reserve currency must be able to acquire, and indeed accumulate, the currency they cannot issue to carry real and financial transactions. As a result, their external performance shapes and constrains to a significant extent their capacity to pursue domestic policies including fiscal and monetary policies. In this sense countries are said to be 'balance-of-payments' constrained. This paper examines, for the case of Chile, the limitations imposed by external conditions to the undertaking of a monetary policy strategy, inflation targeting, which focuses explicitly on a domestic objective, namely a low and stable rate of inflation. Chile adopted an inflation targeting strategy in 1991. Since, the adoption of the inflation targeting strategy followed two clear and distinct phases. The first one lasted from 1991 to 1999 and can be termed an Eclectic Inflation Targeting Regime (EiT). From 1999 to the present Chile switched to a Full Fledged Inflation Targeting Regime (FFIT). The analysis of both phases shows that pursuing inflation targeting under balance-of-payments constrained conditions ultimately leads to a conflict of interest between internal and external objectives, and that the conflict tends to be solved in favor of the latter.","Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile",,"Caldentey, EP (通讯作者)，Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile.",esteban.perez@eclac.org,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,4,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

In this framework, we empirically consider the hypothesis of a non-linear effect of military expenditure on economic growth. Differences between the costs and benefits of the defence sector has traditionally explained the non-linear relationship suggesting that shocks to insecurity may also be a source of non-linearity as they determine a re-allocative effect within government expenditure. While parametric partial correlations are in line with empirical findings, the robustness of estimations is tested by using a non-parametric approach. The negative relationship between military expenditure and growth in countries with high levels of military burden predicted by theory becomes significant only after including a proxy for re-allocative effects in the growth equation.","Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, I-06123 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Pieroni, L (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",lpieroni@unipg.it,,,,,,,27,58,59,2,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

They use a growth model with human capital and find that optimal taxes on both capital income and labor income converge to zero in steady state. For one of the models under consideration, I show that the representative household's problem does not have an interior solution. This raises concerns since these corners are inconsistent with aggregate data. Interiority is restored if preferences are modified so that human capital augments the value of leisure time. With this change, the optimal tax problem is analyzed and, reassuringly, the Jones, Manuelli, and Rossi results are confirmed: neither capital income nor labor income should be taxed in steady state.","Univ Durham, Dept Econ, Durham DH1 3HP, England",Durham University,"Reinhorn, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Econ, Durham DH1 3HP, England.",reinhorn@hotmail.com,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6116,1935-1690,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The paper identifies two new channels through which money growth affects self insurance, interest rate and capital accumulation. The paper also shows that the resulting non-linearities in the relationships between the rate of inflation, the steady state capital stock and the interest rate, may even cause an optimal rate of inflation not to exist. Further, the Friedman rule is shown to be suboptimal for some economies.","Drake Univ, Des Moines, IA 50311 USA",Drake University,"Roy, S (通讯作者)，Drake Univ, Des Moines, IA 50311 USA.",sunanda.roy@drake.edu,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

With regard to the causes identified as the input motion of Spanish investment in Latin America can be explained by the size of the economies and the process of privatization in the region. Furthermore, in contrast to the above, the statistical relationship between Spanish investors and the functioning of the real side of Latin American economies is quite weak, which is to be interpreted in the light of previous work suggesting that when recorded a high concentration of FDI in sectors of non-tradable (services), as is the case, it creates a tenuous impact on macroeconomic variables that determine growth and domestic macroeconomic balance.","[Ruesga Benito, Santos Miguel; da Silva Bichara, Julimar] Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Benito, SMR (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",ruesga@uam.es; julimar.dasilva@uam.es,"BENITO, SANTOS MIGUEL RUESGA/AAG-2003-2020; Bichara, Julimar S/L-2394-2013; Bichara, Julimar/ABA-4674-2020","Bichara, Julimar/0000-0002-1403-0134",,,,,30,0,0,0,3,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

The first is a discontinuity in the distribution across population types of the willingness to accept payment in return for certain services such as giving blood, because such services given free are more worthwhile than when performed for payment. The second is that people who give services free may refuse to sell them for some positive price (this is known as crowding out). The paper models both phenomena when individuals act to signal their type in a two-period game with assortative matching. The former is the unique equilibrium of a signaling game in which individuals announce the prices at which they will perform a civic action. The latter may be observed as one of two equilibria of a screening game in which individuals have only a binary participation decision available to signal their type.","[Seabright, Paul B.] GREMAQ, IDEI, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Seabright, PB (通讯作者)，GREMAQ, IDEI, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",seabrigh@cict.fr,,,,,,,36,16,17,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Although the electric-only efficiency of DG is lower than that of central-station production, relatively high tariff rates and the potential for CHP applications increase the attraction of on-site generation. Nevertheless, a microgrid contemplating the installation of gas-fired DG has to be aware of the uncertainty in the natural gas price. Treatment of uncertainty via real options increases the value of the investment opportunity, which then delays the adoption decision as the opportunity cost of exercising the investment option increases as well. In this paper, we take the perspective of a microgrid that can proceed in a sequential manner with DG capacity and HX investment in order to reduce its exposure to risk from natural gas price volatility. In particular, with the availability of the HX, the microgrid faces a tradeoff between reducing its exposure to the natural gas price and maximising its cost savings. By varying the volatility parameter, we find that the microgrid prefers a direct investment strategy for low levels of volatility and a sequential one for higher levels of volatility.

The countries of Central and Eastern Europe in particular tend to consider a new tax phenomenon - a flat tax rate. This has been a part of the tax system in the Czech Republic since January 1, 2008 as well. The nominal tax rates predicate the real rate of taxation insufficiently. A more objective way to measure the tax circumstances of the taxpayers in individual countries is relative indicators such as the tax incidence of taxpayers with an average wage, the calculation of an efficient tax rate or measuring the tax progressiveness. This paper shows that changes in the efficient tax rate do not have to influence the relevant change of tax progressiveness. The aim of this paper is to show the impact of personal income tax changes on the efficient tax rate and the tax progressiveness in the Czech Republic.","[Siroky, Jan; Makova, Katerina] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Siroky, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",jan.siroky@vsb.cz; katerina.makova@seznam.cz,"Mokrá, Kateřina/I-8472-2018; Siroky, Jan/I-6346-2018","Mokrá, Kateřina/0000-0002-6175-2172; Siroky, Jan/0000-0001-9802-5801",,,,,13,8,8,0,5,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

In this paper, we use a detailed plant-level dataset to study the impact on productivity of two reforms (initiated in 1991) aimed at increasing product market competition in India - liberalization of foreign direct investment (FDI) and reduction in tariff rates. First, we examine the effect of the liberalization policies on mean plant-level productivity in the targeted industries. We find significant increases in productivity in the FDI and tariff-liberalized industries, particularly in the longer term (1993-94). We check and find our results robust to a range of robustness tests. Next, we examine the role of intensive (within-plant productivity growth) and extensive (reallocation from less to more productive plants) margins in the post-reform productivity improvement, and find a predominant role for the former. Finally, we assess potential channels for within-firm productivity improvement. Consistent with a role for price competition, we find evidence of greater declines in output prices as well as concentration measures in the liberalized sectors.","Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Sivadasan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jagadees@umich.edu,,,,,,,63,43,54,0,12,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In the past, when petroleum prices soared, there were discussions at various levels about alternatives. These discussions might have been sporadic but the seriousness of the issue should not be understated. The economic viability of options such as the production of ethanol from sugar or other bio-fuels needs detailed economic analysis to give direction to future discussions. This article analyses the economics of ethanol production from sugar cane. The analysis is influenced by the experiences of countries such as Brazil, where ethanol is produced and used as a transport fuel on a commercial level. The foreign exchange savings potential of this fuel option is also explored briefly. The framework for economic analysis is based on the Dutch Sustainable Development Group's study of 2005.","[Stauvermann, Peter J.; Kumar, Sunil] Univ S Pacific, Sch Econ, Suva, Fiji",University of the South Pacific,"Stauvermann, PJ (通讯作者)，Univ S Pacific, Sch Econ, Suva, Fiji.",,"Stauvermann, Peter Josef/I-3470-2019","Stauvermann, Peter Josef/0000-0001-7011-2209",,,,,11,3,3,0,4,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

It is supposed to lead to the identification of language games which take place in the discourse on management, within individual trends and theories, and even on the local scale within organizations. The researcher's involvement means agreement to intervene in the cognizable corporate world. Neo-pragmatic orientation balances the casual and scientific discourses. Perception of the meaning of hermeneutic and symbolic processes stresses the historic and non-universal character of management knowledge. It is postulated to use humanistic methodology derived from cultural anthropology, humanistic sociology, linguistics, pedagogy, cognitive sciences and psychology.

The crisis of the mid 1960s was caused by internal factors, namely the utter neglect of sound economic policies. By contrast, the crisis of the late 1990s was triggered by external factors, namely a sudden shift in market sentiments among foreign creditors and investors, which led to panic Comparing these two deep economic crises is of interest since it indicates that an economy depending on only one (but unsustainable) institution, a strong president, is vulnerable to internal or external shocks.

We find that changes in the legal minimum wage affect only those workers whose initial wage (before the change in minimum wages) is close to the minimum. For example, increases in the legal minimum wage lead to significant increases in the wages and decreases in employment of private covered sector workers who have wages within 20% of the minimum wage before the change, but have no significant impact on wages in other parts of the distribution. The estimates from the employment transition equations suggest that the decrease in covered private sector employment is due to a combination of layoffs and reductions in hiring. Most workers who lose their jobs in the covered private sector as a result of higher legal minimum wages leave the labor force or go into unpaid family work; a smaller proportion find work in the public sector. We find no evidence that these workers become unemployed. Our analysis of the relationship between the minimum wage and household income finds: a) increases in legal minimum wages increase the probability that a poor worker's family will move out of poverty, and b) increases in legal minimum wages are more likely to reduce the incidence of poverty and improve the transition from poor to non-poor if they impact the head of the household rather than the non-head; this is because the head of the household is less likely than a non-head to lose his/her covered sector employment due to a minimum wage increase and because those heads that do lose covered sector employment are more likely to go to another paying job than are non-heads (who are more likely to go into unpaid family work or leave the labor force).

Risk perceptions toward alcohol are an important predictor of consumption behavior. We analyze how alcohol policies and various sources providing information about alcohol's effects impact adolescents' risk perceptions about alcohol. We employ the 2008 Flash Eurobarometer survey, 'Young people and drugs', with 12,312 (15-24 year old) resident citizens across the 27 EU member states. After adjusting for inter-country variation, most alcohol policies tested had no significant influence on risk perceptions. Only the blood alcohol concentration limit for driving and health warnings on advertisements and/or alcoholic beverage containers showed a significant effect, increasing risk perceptions among adolescents. Three sources of information dissemination about alcohol's risks and effects showed significant influence on risk perceptions. While information about the risks of alcohol from parents increased risk perceptions, information from friends decreased it. The influence of media campaigns was only marginal, though indicating a small decrease in risk perceptions. If the desire is to increase risk perceptions, policy makers should emphasize the short-term effects and externalities of alcohol consumption as well as focus on the clear and salient dissemination of risk information that may influence the normative environment.

This can occur even if improvements in technology have raised agricultural productivity and made production less responsive to weather variability. Indeed, negative environmental shocks can produce a drop in wages that outweighs the increase in wages due to an equivalent positive environmental shock. Consequently, the amount of grain stored increases more slowly in good seasons than it decreases in bad ones. This paper gives new insights on the catastrophic effects produced by widespread droughts in India during the second half of the 19th century. Notwithstanding the introduction of new modes of production and the modernization of infrastructures, the interaction between environmental variability and new institutional arrangements might have contributed to increase the vulnerability of peasants to famine.","Univ Pisa, Dept Econ, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"D'Alessandro, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Econ, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",s.dale@ec.unipi.it,,"D'Alessandro, Simone/0000-0002-5550-3313",,,,,34,1,1,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We find strong support for the poverty environment hypothesis since household economic wealth is a significant and negative determinant of firewood consumption. Firewood can therefore be considered as an inferior good for the whole population in the rural area under study, although further evidence shows that at the top of the wealth distribution, there might be a floor effect in the decreasing firewood consumption. Besides economic wealth, our analysis also shows that the own-price effect is important in explaining firewood consumption behavior, the price effect gaining importance with rising incomes. Finally, increasing education is also found to be a key factor in energy consumption behavior, especially when dealing with energy source switching behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Philip II of Spain accumulated towering debts while stopping all payments to his lenders four times. How could the sovereign borrow much and default often?

In this study we analyze the linkages that exist among FDI, trade and industrial dissimilarity in relation to business cycle co-movements using a panel data set taken from 77 pairs of developed countries. The error component three-stage least squares (EC3SLS) estimates from a simultaneous equations model with panel data are shown to be superior to the estimates obtained from single equation models or simultaneous equations models with cross-sectional data. Our results indicate that FDI serves as a channel of international business cycle transmission that is equally important as the channels of trade and monetary policy. On the contrary, industrial dissimilarity is identified as having an indirect impact on the business cycle correlation through trade and FDI. Furthermore, our findings suggest that in our sample FDI is of the horizontal type and tends to substitute for trade. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Important issues such as competitive market, changing technical, political and social environment have a key role in personnel selection. It is the crucial task which determines the company's present and future. Many decisions made cannot be accurately forecast or assessed. Understanding of the multiple criteria method and knowledge to calculate the algorithm of the method allows a decision maker to trust solutions offered by solution support systems to a greater extent. Many individual attributes considered for personnel selection such as organizing ability, creativity, personality, and leadership exhibit vagueness and imprecision. The fuzzy set theory appears as an essential tool to provide a decision framework that incorporates imprecise judgments inherent in the personnel selection process. In this paper, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) algorithm using the principles of fusion of fuzzy information, additive ratio assessment (ARAS) method with fuzzy numbers (ARAS-F) and step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) technique are integrated. The proposed method is apt to manage information assessed using both linguistic and numerical scales in a decision making problem with a group of information sources. The aggregation process is based on the unification of information by means of fuzzy sets on a basic linguistic term set. The computational procedure of the proposed framework is illustrated through an architect's selection problem.","[Kersuliene, Violeta] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Off Legal Affairs, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Turskis, Zenonas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Kersuliene, V (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Off Legal Affairs, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",violeta.kersuliene@vgtu.lt; zenonas.turskis@vgtu.lt,"Turskis, Zenonas/AAA-9159-2021; Turskis, Zenonas/H-3035-2018","Turskis, Zenonas/0000-0002-5835-9388;",,,,,40,186,190,4,53,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

However, this result is potentially hampered by two limitations. First, it may be contingent to the specific choices made regarding the poverty line and the poverty indices used for the analysis. As a consequence, it may collapse if one uses alternative poverty lines or poverty measures. Second, it results from a focus on the sole monetary aspects of poverty. As income does not cover all facets of well-being and since the relationship between these two concepts are quite fuzzy, it may be worth using a broader view of well-being, hence opting for a multidimensional approach of poverty analysis. In the present paper, these two issues are addressed using multidimensional stochastic dominance procedures on the joint distribution of income, education and health in seven Chinese provinces.

A central bank participating actively in this market is modelled as benign in two ways: exerting less externalities than other banks and maximizing welfare rather than profit. Because other banks react strategically to the central bank's presence due to its low externalities, there is a risk that it backfires, with these other banks' taking more risky positions than if the central bank were not there. The proper role of the central bank may actually be to stay out.","Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Nilssen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095 Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",tore.nilssen@econ.uio.no,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

These probabilities are then interacted with the real minimum wage level in the employment regressions to ensure analysis is restricted to the individuals most at risk when the minimum wage is raised.

Under this alternative system, workers are required to save a fraction of their wage in special accounts, whereas the unemployed are allowed to withdraw savings from these accounts. Previous studies argued that such a reform will improve employment incentives considerably and thereby lead to a dramatic decrease in unemployment levels and durations. We show that this expected impact hinges critically on the assumptions on time preferences. Using recent insights from behavioural economics, we demonstrate that the theoretical impact of UAs is ambiguous rather than substantially positive.

However, the greatest contemporary threat of excessive inequality might be its contribution to increased environmental degradation. This article explores the manner in which inequality augments consumption, by drawing upon Thorstein Veblen's theory of consumer behavior whereby in societies in which fluid social mobility is believed possible, inequality encourages households to seek social certification through consumption. The ideology, institutions, and behavior generated by this focus on consumption reduce the potential for people to achieve certification of value through more environmentally friendly domains such as work and community. This article also addresses the manner in which inequality impedes responses aimed at reducing environmental damage by augmenting the political power of those whose interests would be most harmed by measures to protect the environment.","American Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Wisman, JD (通讯作者)，American Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,,"Wisman, Jon D./0000-0001-7563-3150",,,,,94,22,27,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Phillips (1950) presented his machines, as formally described, with linear differential equations. In doing so, he fell into what Samuelson came later to define as the linearity dogma. It is argued here that the Phillips machines are not linear mechanisms but are coherent with a system of nonlinear difference-differential equations. Here, this system is in turn approximated with a set of non-linear differential equations, which are isomorphic with the Hicks-Goodwin flexible multiplier accelerator models. Consistent with this conjecture and following a Goodwin-Phillips' suggestion, we have presented a digital simulation of two coupled would-be Phillips machines. Whether the data generated with the set of nonlinear difference equations is consistent with the observations emerging from the actual coupled Phillips machines could be verified by comparing the data emerging from the two systems the digital and the analogue ones.","Univ Trento, Dipartimento Econ, I-38100 Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Zambelli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dipartimento Econ, Via Inama 5, I-38100 Trento, Italy.",stefano.zambelli@unitn.it,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Our article is the first to establish a causal link between the health of banks providing trade finance and growth in a firm's exports relative to its domestic sales. We overcome measurement and endogeneity issues by using a unique data set, covering the Japanese financial crises from 1990 through 2010, which enables us to match exporters with the main bank that provides them with trade finance. Our point estimates are economically and statistically significant, suggesting that the health of financial institutions is an important determinant of firm-level exports during crises.","[Amiti, Mary] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA; Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; Columbia University,"Amiti, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA.",,,,,,,,33,314,367,2,80,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

A related field experiment on Israeli children shows that only boys react to competition by running faster when competing in a race. We here test if there is a gender gap in running among 7-10 year old Swedish children. We also introduce two female sports, skipping rope and dancing, to see if competitiveness is task dependent.

Much of the empirical work cited as being in support of asymmetry, however, has not directly tested the hypothesis of an asymmetric transmission of oil price innovations. Moreover, many of the papers quantifying these asymmetric responses are based on censored oil price VAR models that have recently been shown to be invalid. Other studies are based on dynamic correlations in the data and do not distinguish between cause and effect. Recently, several new methods of testing and quantifying asymmetric responses of U.S. real economic activity to positive and negative oil price innovations have been developed.

This research investigates the extent to which consumer preferences for a residential appliance are affected by information on whether or not the appliance manufacturer was a member of the GPP. Data for the study were obtained from a contingent choice exercise in an online survey of a national sample of adults. The results suggest that consumers are, on average, willing to pay an extra $48.52 to $70.95 for a refrigerator manufactured by a company that is a member of the GPP. These amounts appear to generally exceed the additional costs associated with using green power to manufacture a refrigerator and suggest that GPP could effectively be used to market consumer products.

We show analytically that investment is positively related to Tobin's Q and cash flow, even in the absence of adjustment costs or financing frictions. Both Q and investment move in the same direction as expected revenue growth, so changes in expected revenue growth induce Q and investment to comove positively. Similarly, shocks to current cash flow, arising from shocks to the user cost of capital in our model, cause investment and cash flow per unit of capital to comove positively. Furthermore, we show that this alternative mechanism for the relationship among investment, Q, and cash flow delivers larger cash flow effects for smaller- and faster-growing firms, as observed in the data. Moreover, the empirically small sensitivity of investment to Tobin's Q does not imply implausibly large adjustment costs in our model (since there are no adjustment costs). Calibrating the model generates values of Q similar to those in the data; investment is more sensitive to cash flow than it is to Q, and both responses are of empirically plausible magnitudes.","[Abel, Andrew B.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Eberly, Janice C.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Northwestern University,"Abel, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,"Eberly, Janice/KCY-3297-2024","Eberly, Janice/0000-0001-9305-0944",,,,,25,61,74,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The practical relevance of such an analysis is threefold: recent studies underline the importance of export variety for economic growth; empirical results show that export variety was influenced by the EU membership; and looking separately at export quality permits a better understanding of price competitiveness. Our results show that all NMSs significantly increased the average number of brands exported to the EU market, the largest increases being observed in 2004 and after. This indicates that integration into the EU market occurs in the extensive as well as the intensive dimension. We also find that all NMSs increased the average quality of their exports during the decade studied although there are differences between countries. Thus, a large part of the increase in the prices of exports from NMSs resulted from improving quality and did not result in a loss of competitiveness. Finally, estimates of relative quality are much more stable than relative prices, suggesting that our measure of relative quality is better than the traditional proxy.","[Benkovskis, Konstantins; Rimgailaite, Ramune] Bank Latvia, Monetary Policy Dept, Riga, Latvia",,"Benkovskis, K (通讯作者)，Bank Latvia, Monetary Policy Dept, Riga, Latvia.",konstantins.benkovskis@bank.lv; ramune.rimgailaite@bank.lv,"Gerhards, Guntis/D-5197-2009","Benkovskis, Konstantins/0000-0003-1935-6843",,,,,18,7,7,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0967-0750,,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

The average earnings effects for those who remain in the labor force are moderate, a 3% loss relative to non-displaced workers after seven years. Splitting displaced workers on within-and between-firm movers, we find that the estimated earnings loss is entirely driven by between-firm movers who experience a 3.6% loss.

By combining multiple punishment stages with self-contained episodes of interaction, we are able to disentangle the effects of retaliation and norm-related punishment. An additional treatment provides information on the norms bystanders use in judging punishment actions. Partly confirming previous findings, punishment behavior and bystanders' opinions are guided by an absolute norm. This norm is consistent over decisions and punishment stages and requires full contributions. In the first punishment stage, our results suggest a higher personal involvement of punishers, leading to a nonlinearity defined by the punishers' contribution. In later punishment stages, the personal-involvement effect vanishes and retaliation kicks in.

This paper proposes an indicator of the fiscal stance which computes the fiscal adjustment required to reach a specific debt-GDP targeted given the forecasts of future deficit and interest rates obtained from an unrestricted (recursively-estimated) VAR model. The index is easy to compute and can be decomposed to disclose the different contribution of revenue, expenditure, nominal yields, inflation and growth to the fiscal stance. For this reason it provides a transparent and detailed measure of the fiscal stance, particularly suitable for multi-country surveillance. As a result, the index improves on the tax-gap indicators widely used by governments and international agencies, and is far more informative than formal econometric tests of fiscal sustainability. The time series of the indicator for individual EU countries and the US show that their fiscal position has fluctuated considerably over the last 40 years, and has particularly deteriorated since 2007. The index predicts that the adjustment required to restore pre-crisis debt-GDP levels are higher for high debt countries like Greece, Italy and Portugal. They become more severe the shorter is the time horizon for the adjustment. As a large degree of uncertainty surrounds the assessment of the fiscal stance in the medium and long run, we argue that policy makers should inform their policy based on the worst case scenario predicted by the indicator.","[Polito, Vito] Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, Wales; Univ York, Cardiff Business Sch, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Cardiff University; University of York - UK,"Polito, V (通讯作者)，Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, Wales.",,,,,,,,60,17,18,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

The identification strategy takes advantage of the 1977 amendments to the Social Security Act, which led to a large, unanticipated reduction in Social Security benefits for those born after January 1, 1917. Despite the advanced age of the notch cohorts, there is a significant, negative and surprisingly elastic relationship between Social Security income and hours of work. This suggests that currently proposed reductions in benefits would induce Social Security recipients to work more hours in retirement, even through their 70s and early 80s. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In an overlapping generations model, heterogeneous agents may acquire skills when young thereby determining the skill composition of their cohort. Current and anticipated trade policies influence education decisions and thus voters' trade policy preferences. We show that there may exist two political steady states: one protectionist and one liberal. Transition from the former to the latter can be achieved by government announcements, temporary educational subsidies, or tariff liberalization by trading partners, but generally not by transfer payments to adversely affected workers. We find additionally that reform is politically feasible only if the proposed liberalization is sufficiently large, suggesting that radical reform may be necessary for escaping a protectionist political rut.

On the one hand, the controversy surrounding a minimum wage appears to be partly justified because the effects of the introduction and increase of a minimum wage may differ greatly depending on the labour market structure. On the other, the current academic literature does not provide clear evidence of which collectives are likely to be more affected in terms of employment by the introduction or increase of a minimum wage. Using the data for the period 2000-2008, this study aims to examine the effect of a minimum wage on youth employment in Spain, taking into account both regional differences and the dynamic behaviour of employment. Unlike previous papers on this subject, we additionally consider the effect of seasonality on employment, a particularly widespread feature of youth employment in Spain. The results obtained in our analysis do not provide clear evidence of any negative effect of a minimum wage on youth employment during the period under study. While this result may point to the existence of a monopsonistic structure of the labour market, the coexistence of increases both in the minimum wage and in youth employment rate during this period could also be explained in the light of a perfectly competitive labour market with a high degree of dynamism and a structural change in employment demand.","[Blazquez Cuesta, Maite; Llorente Heras, Raquel; Moral Carcedo, Julian] Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Cuesta, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",,"Blazquez, Maite/V-8795-2018; MORAL CARCEDO, JULIAN/L-2361-2013","Blazquez, Maite/0000-0002-2152-890X; MORAL CARCEDO, JULIAN/0000-0002-7142-3110",,,,,36,3,3,0,20,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

The overall concept of pollution, however, actually consists of various components which may behave differently and are not easily combined into a single measure. As a result, the measurement or tracking of an EKC becomes more difficult as one tries to develop a tractable measure of pollution for modeling or policy purposes. For example, in China levels of sulfur dioxide and particulate pollution show some signs of diminishing while nitrogen dioxide levels have increased as China's auto fleet has grown. Consequently, different studies estimating an EKC often generate different results depending upon which pollutant is used and how it is measured. This paper generates composite measures of Chinese air pollution using Nemerow methodology as well as a new epidemiological index based upon the health effects of the pollutants. The paper then tests these index measures to determine whether they display evidence of an EKC and also to examine how they behave in comparison to the individual pollutants. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Results show that the costs of achieving Kyoto in the long run, although not comparable to any environmental policy from the past, could be contained if a shift toward a less carbon intensive economy is induced; through improvements in energy efficiency, through changes in the energy mix and in production and consumption patterns and, finally, and crucially, through technological innovation.","Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain",University of Basque Country; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"González-Eguino, M (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain.",,"González-Eguino, Mikel/M-6057-2013; Azkarate, Ainhoa/K-9087-2013","Azkarate, Ainhoa/0000-0003-0471-3094",,,,,38,3,3,1,6,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

This article describes some recent work that introduces human capital into the standard model. This has some interesting, and even surprising, implications for labour supply elasticities. In particular, once we account for the effects of human capital, it appears that labour supply elasticities may be much larger than conventional wisdom would suggest. This, in turn, implies that the efficiency costs of labour income taxation may be much larger than is commonly assumed. Consequently, labour income taxation should be viewed as comparably costly to other types of taxation (such as capital income taxation).","Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Keane, MP (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",m.keane@unsw.edu.au,"Keane, Michael/R-6329-2019; Keane, Michael/O-2840-2013","Keane, Michael/0000-0002-3918-1377",,,,,14,2,2,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

The reasons for this have been the subject of considerable research, with one of the primary aims being to investigate the role of inequality of opportunity as a determinant of educational attainment. Where inequality of opportunity adversely affects educational outcomes, appropriate policy intervention may be able to increase both efficiency and equity (Behrman & Taubman, 1989). In this article, we use information on twins to assess the role of family background (or environment) in determining educational attainment in Australia, and to assess the changes in this role over recent decades. Our best estimate is that environmental diversity accounts for as little as 8 per cent of the variance in educational outcomes. Moreover, in the face of rather substantial changes in the arrangements for financing tertiary education in Australia, the influence of common family background on educational outcomes has not changed.","[Le, Anh T.; Miller, Paul W.] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Slutske, Wendy S.] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA; [Martin, Nicholas G.] Queensland Inst Med Res, Herston, Qld 4006, Australia",Curtin University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute,"Miller, PW (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",paul.miller@curtin.edu.au,"Martin, Nicholas/R-9235-2019","Martin, Nicholas/0000-0003-4069-8020",,,,,34,9,10,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

The present study is apparently the first attempt in the literature to examine directly the effects of crime and corruption (and one of few to examine the effects of terror) on private investment by examining the behavior of investors over time in a specific country within a structured model of investment. Israel was chosen as the subject of the study. According to international indexes, Israel's status as a civil society has degraded over the past decade and according to the corruption index of Transparency International, it is now ranked 33rd in the world. The results of the research can serve as the basis for comparison in similar studies of other Western countries. The study's conclusions support the hypothesis that crime and major (but not sporadic), significant or ongoing, terror events play an important part in determining the investment behavior of firms in Israel, both in the short and the intermediate/long run.","[Zelekha, Yaron] Ono Acad Coll, IL-52364 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Bar-Efrat, Ohad] Bank Israel, Jerusalem, Israel",Bank of Israel,"Zelekha, Y (通讯作者)，Ono Acad Coll, 14 Hagaon Eliyahu St, IL-52364 Ramat Gan, Israel.",yaronzl@013.net.il,,,,,,,25,8,11,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Nonlinear cointegration is confirmed for the oil-stock nexus in the panel. Because threshold cointegration is found, the threshold vector error correction models can be run to investigate the presence of asymmetric dynamic adjustment. The Granger causality tests demonstrate the existence of bidirectional long-run Granger causality between crude oil shocks and stock markets for these OECD and non-OECD countries. However, the short-run Granger causality between them is bidirectional under positive changes in the deviation and unidirectional under negative ones. Moreover, the speed of adjustment toward equilibrium is faster under negative changes in the deviation than that under positive ones in these OECD and non-OECD countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using a data set for 28 OECD countries spanning the period 1978-2007, we contribute to the literature on success probabilities of consolidation attempts by exploring the impact of corruption, and in particular the interplay of corruption and the choice of the policy instrument. We find that corruption significantly reduces the success rate. When controlling for the change in government expenditures, however, the impact of corruption is insignificant or at least becomes less pronounced. We therefore relate the choice of the fiscal instrument to corruption and find that corrupt countries rely significantly less on expenditure cuts during periods of consolidation attempts. We conclude that international organizations should be careful in observing what corrupt countries do when trying to consolidate their budgets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We uncover a robust hump-shaped relationship between the voting share of an interest group and its contributions to a legislator. This pattern is rationalized in a simultaneous bilateral bargaining model where the larger size of an interest group affects the amount of surplus to be split with the politician (thereby increasing contributions), but is also correlated with the strength of direct voter support the group can offer instead of monetary funds (thereby decreasing contributions). The model yields simple structural equations that we estimate at the district level employing data on individual and PAC donations and local employment by sector. This procedure yields estimates of electoral uncertainty and politicians' effectiveness as perceived by the interest groups. Our approach also implicitly delivers a novel method for estimating the impact of campaign spending on election outcomes: we find that an additional vote costs a politician on average $145.

The time structure of the panel data allows us to control for unobserved heterogeneity, whereas cross-sectional data make it possible to instrument openness by its geographical component. In both setups, we purge the data of business cycle effects, include a host of institutional and geographical variables, and control for within-country trade. Our main finding is robust to various definitions of unemployment rates and openness measures. Our benchmark specification suggests that a 10 percentage point increase in total trade openness reduces aggregate unemployment by about three quarters of one percentage point. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An increase in the number of jobs registered with the social security system was one of the key features of the period.

The increase in protected employment also benefited social sectors that have traditionally been neglected, although there are factors that restrict the access of certain population groups to such jobs. Another research finding is that if the head of the household has a protected job, other household members have better chances of gaining a similar job themselves.","[Groisman, Fernando] Natl Council Sci & Tech Res CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Groisman, Fernando] Univ Buenos Aires, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires,"Groisman, F (通讯作者)，Natl Council Sci & Tech Res CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",fgroisman@conicet.gov.ar,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2011,,104,,,,,77,97,,,,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865EW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298294700004,0

Notably, the shock-to-risk explains almost none of the decline in output during 2001 prior to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks but does clarify why the recovery was relatively weak afterwards, and it explains the bulk of the decline in output during 2008 and 2009.","Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Cover, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, POB 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",jcover@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,16,6,7,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

It identifies the condition under which countries can restrain the use of concealed barriers based on PTS and establishes that countries will not reduce the cooperative protection level to its minimum attainable level under the optimal PTS. This paper then considers third-party trigger strategies (TTS) under which the WTO allows each country to initiate a punishment phase based on the WTO's judgement about potential violations. By comparing the optimal PTS and optimal TTS, it demonstrates that the WTO facilitates a better cooperative equilibrium by changing the nature of punishment-triggering signals from private to public, which in turn enables countries to use a more efficient punishment, such as an asymmetric and a minimum punishment.","Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Park, JH (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea.",,,,,,,,31,30,30,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

This finding is further taken as evidence of capital market imperfections. We show, using a perfect capital markets model, that time-to-build for capital projects creates an investment-cash-flow sensitivity as found in empirical studies that may not be indicative of capital market frictions. The result is due to mis-specification present in empirical investment-q equations under time-to-build investment. In addition, time aggregation error can give rise to cash-flow effects independently of the time-to-build effect. Importantly, both errors arise independently of potential measurement error in q.

Using a non-parametric local propensity score regression, the study finds that the economic disadvantage associated with having a child in high school is particularly large in poor socioeconomic environments; however, this disadvantage is a result of preexisting differences in the educational and fertility expectations and is not because of a diminished capacity of the socioeconomic environment to mediate the effect of an unplanned childbirth. The findings suggest that childcare assistance and other policies designed to alleviate the burden of child rearing for young mothers of low means may not produce the desired improvement in their subsequent educational and labor market outcomes.

In this Nash tariff game, the trade of physical commodities only occurs geographically across countries, and the trade of inside money allows for intertemporal allocation of consumptions. When the preferences, present and future endowments for each country are given, according to our numerical analysis, trade surplus or deficit (inside money) and optimal tariff rates are endogenously determined when general equilibrium conditions hold. One country may purchase inside money to shift current consumption to the future, and the other may be willing to issue inside money for smoothing its consumptions in two periods. This imbalance trade contradicts traditional trade models which imply a balanced trade policy. We further find that the price of inside money as an implied interest rate also is determined by the trade intervention policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We do so by comparing the distributions of binary sequences from actual time series of financial markets and series built up from purely algorithmic means. Our discussion is a starting point for a further investigation of the market as a rule-based system with an algorithmic component, despite its apparent randomness, and the use of the theory of algorithmic probability with new tools that can be applied to the study of the market price phenomenon.

After confronting the limits to growth, the economic interests, methods and thoughts, even its use of words and concepts are slowly but persistently modified. The discussion of equilibrium is replaced by the concern for a sustainable path. Instead of finding out how to produce more it looks for better, cheaper and recyclable commodities. Labor saving serves by and large the reduction of the working week and transformation of the life-cycle instead of surplus-production. The markets of developed countries are more easily glutted and their recessions deeper. The ever louder and more aggressive marketing attests to all this. It is high time to renew our old ways, to revisit the aged analytical and forecasting models. The renovation of obsolete concepts is rendered necessary to facilitate the introduction of an orderly and planned future of prudence.

It finds that managerial ownership alone does not affect either the risk or the profit levels of Korean banks. In contrast, an increase in managerial ownership adds to the total risk of Japanese banks. However, increased risk-taking behavior does not produce higher levels of profit for Japanese banks. The coefficients of the interaction term between franchise value and managerial ownership are negative and statistically significant for both the Korean and the Japanese banking industries. This means that an increase in managerial ownership in banks with high franchise values discourages risk-taking behavior. The results confirm the disciplinary role of franchise value on the risk-taking behavior of banks.

This finding is stable across different indicators for regional aggregate education and robust to agglomeration, wage curve, price level and amenity effects.

Based on data from 2002 to 2009, three sets of GMM models are considered in this article for analyzing the macroeconomic relevance of the credit channels in Brazil: (i) the first set analyzes the effects of shocks on economic variables which are essential for credit supply; (ii) the second set considers the effects of the same variables used in the previous case on credit spread; and (iii) the third set takes into account the effects of changes in the credit market conditions on the product. In addition, with the intention of showing the effects of shocks on the variables which are relevant in the GMM models for credit supply, spread, and product. a VAR analysis is made. Finally, with the objective of testing the results, a GMM system model is built. The findings denote that the effects of economic shocks on credit supply and on credit spread are in accordance with the credit channel theory. In particular, it is observed that shocks on the interest rate are not transmitted directly to the economy but through the credit channels. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

All changes are measured relative to changes for art not subject to the DDS and relative to changes in the auction markets for art in countries where there has been no change in law. We do a difference-in-difference analysis, differencing price growth and sales growth across market segments and across countries over the period 1993-2007. Our results suggest that the introduction of the DDS has not had a consistent negative impact on the UK art auction market during the period of study.","[Graddy, Kathryn] Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Banternghansa, Chanont] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Brandeis University; University of Chicago,"Graddy, K (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",kgraddy@brandeis.edu,,"Graddy, Kathryn/0000-0003-0832-0239",,,,,35,12,12,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Until the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007, high inflation was a persistent problem for advocates of Latvian participation in the Euro collaboration. By allowing for transitional effects and separating the impact of nominal and real factors on inflation, where real factors are related to the structural shifts at the heart of transition economies, we render the inflation history more understandable. We show that the effects accompanying real factors constitute the key component of overall inflation over the twelve-year period of observation, keeping nonstructural inflation below the Maastricht criteria for most of the period. The real contribution of real factors to inflation provides Latvia with better prospects for future growth and higher standards of living, and hence should be less worrisome than the nominal contribution. Still, when it comes to compliance with the Maastricht criteria, the Economic and Monetary Union makes no distinction between the two, complicating convergence for transition economies.","[Borgersen, Trond-Arne; King, Roswitha M.] Ostfold Univ Coll, Fac Econ Social Sci & Languages, Halden, Norway",Ostfold University College,"Borgersen, TA (通讯作者)，Ostfold Univ Coll, Fac Econ Social Sci & Languages, Halden, Norway.",,,"Borgersen, Trond Arne/0000-0002-0105-8883",,,,,36,7,7,1,9,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

A group of studies have tried to measure habituation by seeing how lagged values of life events affect present happiness. We propose an additional adaptation channel: current happiness may depend directly on past happiness, which amounts to assessing whether happiness is autoregressive. We run dynamic happiness regressions using individual-level panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, the Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers, the British Household Panel Survey and the Swiss Household Panel. As in previous studies, the coefficients on lagged events (e.g., becoming unemployed, getting married) suggest strong habituation. However, all the econometric models suggest that the coefficient on lagged happiness is positive and significant. We discuss whether this may be evidence of happiness having an inertial force (besides the usual habituation channel). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Integrated financial markets tend to propagate liquidity traps. In a global environment, fiscal policy may be effective in raising GDP when the economy is stuck in a liquidity trap, but it does so in a 'beggar thy neighbor' fashion; when one economy is in a liquidity trap, the cross country spillover effect of fiscal policy is negative. We examine the welfare optimizing policy response to a liquidity trap when countries coordinate on fiscal policy. Fiscal policy may be an effective tool in responding to a liquidity trap, although it is never optimal to use fiscal expansion sufficiently to fully eliminate a downturn. Moreover, there is little case for coordinated global fiscal expansion. For the most part, the country worst hit by a liquidity trap shock should use its own policies to respond, without much help from foreign policies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our basic game is a Nash demand game where one player has an outside option available. A chat treatment allows bargainers to send cheap-talk messages prior to playing the basic game, and in a contracts treatment, they can additionally propose and accept binding contracts. We propose that strategic uncertainty comprises at least two facets: coordination-type, which is lower in the chat game than in the basic game, and rationality-type, which is lower in the contracts game than in the chat game. We find that both types of strategic uncertainty impact bargaining outcomes: moving from the basic game to the chat game, and thence to contracts, improves several aspects of outcomes, such as higher efficiency, less opting out and less under-demanding. Other results include a treatment effect on the types of agreements that are reached. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Countries thus tend to have systematic policies in place for FDI promotion, devised and implemented especially through investment promotion agencies (IPAs). This paper adds to the literature on FDI incentives by examining the beliefs or attitudes of people working in the FDI promotion industry and the extent to which they coincide with the known FDI pull factors. To that end, we utilize a data set of attitudes of people largely working in regional and national IPAs in Europe and the Western Balkans. Cluster analysis reveals that in fact we can talk about three sets of beliefs or attitudes toward FDI: pessimistic, Keynesian, and neoclassical. Keynesians largely favor fiscal measures for attracting FDI, whereas neoclassicals dislike fiscal measures and government interventions and prefer good economic fundamentals and infrastructure and qualified personnel. Interestingly enough, most of the eastern European Union as well as southeastern European respondents can be classified as Keynesians; on the other hand, almost all neoclassicals are from western Europe.","[Kuncic, Aljaz; Svetlicic, Marjan] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Kuncic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.",,"SVETLIČIČ, MARJAN/GRQ-5496-2022",,,,,,38,4,4,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

An illustrated empirical application indicates that our proposed test is able to unveil more evidence than the KSS test in favor of no unit root of real exchange rates in 15 Asian countries.

Specifically, it reports on the development and delivery of a survey instrument for measuring capabilities, calculates for each respondent a Nehring-Puppe type index of capabilities and examines the distribution of index scores. The main analytic part of the paper then goes on to develop a generalized linear latent and mixed model (GLLAMM) for assessing the impact of capabilities on life satisfaction, in which allowance is made for (i) unobserved heterogeneity and (ii) possible endogeneity, by introducing latent individual effects and by instrumenting capability variables using income and other socio-economic variables. Our empirical results show that empathy, self-worth, goal-autonomy, discrimination, safety and stress are statistically significant determinants of life satisfaction, in a decreasing order of importance. The paper concludes by suggesting that, if replicated, the findings have profound implications for the conceptualisation and evaluation of economic progress. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

Whenever an individual is delegated to make decisions that affect others, such as in the typical corporate structure, does the individual make decisions that reflect the risk preferences of the party bearing the consequences? We examine this question in two simple settings, lottery choices and sealed-bid auctions, using controlled laboratory experiments. We find that when an individual makes a decision for an anonymous stranger, there is a tendency to exhibit less risk aversion. This reduction in risk aversion is relative to his or her own preferences, and it is also relative to his or her belief about the preferences of others.

In particular, we adopt synthetic control methods to assess the effect that inflation targeting has had on each emerging economy that adopted such policies in the 1990s and 2000s. The evidence suggests that inflation targeting helped Colombia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland reduce their inflation rates. Although Chile is often regarded as a poster child for inflation targeting policies in emerging economies, no significant reductions in inflation levels were found when a later policy start date some analysts believe to be more reflective of the true policy adoption date was used.","RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Lee, WS (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Level 12,239 Bourke St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",wangsheng.lee@rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,18,23,27,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The allocation rule awards each member their outside payoff, plus an equal share of the surplus. The resulting allocation maximizes coalition stability. Stable coalitions are Strong Nash equilibria since no subset of members has an incentive to leave. Similarly, no subset of non-members has an incentive to join a stable coalition if the game is concave in this region. The allocation is risk-dominant. All stable coalitions are robust to the maximum probability of 50% that players' deviate from their individual best-responses. The paper compares the allocation to the Shapley value and the Nash bargaining solution, and illustrates why these traditional rules result in small coalitions when applied to issues such as international environmental agreements.","Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"McGinty, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",mmcginty@umw.edu,,,,,,,19,10,10,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

S. states are permanent, which contradicts the stochastic convergence hypothesis. We suggest that this finding is due to the well-known low-power problem of unit root tests in the presence of high persistence (i.e., low speed of convergence) and small samples. First, interval estimates of the largest autoregressive root for the relative income in the 48 U. S. contiguous states are quite wide, including many alternatives that are persistent but stable. Second, interval estimates of the half-life of relative income shocks that are robust to high persistence and small samples suggest that in most cases shocks die out within zero to ten years. Third, estimation of a fractionally integrated model for the relative income process suggests strong evidence of mean reversion in the data. These findings provide ample support for the stochastic convergence hypothesis.","Fac Ibmec RJ, Dept Econ, BR-20030020 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Faculdade de Economia e Financas do Ibmec,"Mello, M (通讯作者)，Fac Ibmec RJ, Dept Econ, Av Presidente Wilson 118-1101, BR-20030020 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",mmello@ibmecrj.br,,,,,,,19,13,13,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The paper provides a summary of 12 primary studies of the marketing-drinking relationship. Each primary study surveyed a sample of youth to determine baseline drinking status and marketing exposure, and re-surveyed the youth to determine subsequent drinking outcomes. Logistic analyses provide estimates of the odds ratio for effects of baseline marketing variables on adolescent drinking at follow-up. Using meta-regression analysis, two samples are examined in this paper: 23 effect-size estimates for drinking onset (initiation); and 40 estimates for other drinking behaviours (frequency, amount, bingeing). Marketing variables include ads in mass media, promotion portrayals, brand recognition and subjective evaluations by survey respondents. Publication bias is assessed using funnel plots that account for 'missing' studies, bivariate regressions and multivariate meta-regressions that account for primary study heterogeneity, heteroskedasticity, data dependencies, publication bias and truncated samples. The empirical results are consistent with publication bias, omitted variable bias in some studies, and lack of a genuine effect, especially for mass media. The paper also discusses 'dissemination bias' in the use of research results by primary investigators and health policy interest groups.","Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Nelson, JP (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,,85,20,22,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Consistent with the theory, the grand contest generates the highest effort levels among all simultaneous contests. In multi-prize settings, equal prizes produce lower efforts than unequal prizes. The results also support the argument that joint contests generate higher efforts than an equivalent number of subcontests. Contrary to the theory, there is significant over-dissipation. This over-dissipation can be partially explained by strong endowment size effects. Subjects who receive higher endowments tend to over-dissipate, whereas such over-dissipation disappears when the endowments are lower. This behavior is consistent with the predictions of a quantal response equilibrium. We also find that less risk-averse subjects over-dissipate more.

In order to embezzle more, the manager chooses to increase the firm's output. This partially corrects the market failures associated with the oligopoly distortion. Nevertheless, pervasive and large-scale embezzlement is detrimental and should be addressed, although moderate embezzlement might be socially good. We also consider how the length of tenure affects the manager's behaviours: extending the tenure cannot eradicate embezzlement, and an insufficient rise of the reward rate may only defer embezzlement.","[Li, Jie] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Cai, Dapeng] Nagoya Univ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Zhejiang University; Nagoya University,"Li, J (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",lnslj@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Li, Jie/AAE-6389-2019",,,,,,21,0,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

To explore the sources of gender earnings gaps, we decompose the gaps using the method proposed by Machado and Mata (2005). We have three major findings. First, gender earnings gaps are larger both in lower positions and in higher positions in the earnings distribution. Both the glass ceiling effect and the sticky floor effect exist in Hong Kong. Second, gender earnings gaps in higher positions are much explained by gender differentials in productivity-related characteristics; however, gender earnings gaps in lower positions are barely explained by these characteristics. Third, the effect of occupational segregation on gender earnings gaps depends on specific positions in the earnings distribution. In lower positions, occupational segregation is not a big problem and has little impact on gender earnings gaps; in higher positions, however, occupational segregation favors male workers and enlarges gender earnings gaps.

Although it is widely assumed that leaders affect the performance of their organizations, the complexity of this social-science research area has meant that comparatively little empirical progress has been made. We deliberately choose a narrow focus. We examine a high-skill setting in which there are accurate data on performance. We argue that an influential role is played by a leader's expert knowledge. A strong predictor of a leader's success in year T is that person's level of technical attainment, in the underlying activity, in approximately year T-20. Our data are on US professional basketball. The paper documents a correlation between brilliance as a player and the (much later) winning percentage and playoff success of that person as a team coach. The results suggest that leaders' effects on performance are substantial and are visible in the data within the first 12 months of a coach being hired. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Throughout its history, not only have the techniques of measuring inflation changed, but so has its social and policy functions. In the process, the phenomenon inflation measurements were intended to represent has also taken on new significance. The function of inflation measurement initially focused on providing a scientific way of regulating wage disputes in the early twentieth century. By the end of the century, it had become an instrument of macroeconomic policy coordination and sought to measure inflation in the economy as a whole. Inflation measurement, thus, performs economic functions that are now increasingly dissociated from earlier social functions. Growing social inequality will require new ways of conceiving and managing inflation.","St Thomas Univ, Fredericton, NB E3B 5G3, Canada",Saint Thomas University Canada,"Hayes, M (通讯作者)，St Thomas Univ, Fredericton, NB E3B 5G3, Canada.",,"Hayes, Matthew F/ACF-2301-2022","Hayes, Matthew F/0000-0002-5324-6536",,,,,49,9,12,0,11,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This growth experience has been based mainly on China's internal dynamics. In the first half of the era, economic growth was driven by improvement in both allocative efficiency and productive efficiency. From the early 1990s until the present time, however, economic growth has been increasingly based on dynamic increasing returns associated with a growth path that is characterized by capital deepening. In both periods, the growth paths and their associated institutional frameworks appear to contradict principles of the free market economy: the mainstream doctrines of globalization. In the form of an analytical overview, this paper seeks to explain and interpret the dynamics and developmental implications of China's economic transformation. The analytics draws on a range of relevant economic theories including Marxian theory of capital accumulation, post-Keynesian theory of demand determination, and Schumpeterian theory of innovation. It is posited that these alternative theoretical perspectives offer better insights than mainstream neoclassical economics in explaining and interpreting China's economic transformation.","[Lo, Dic] Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Lo, Dic] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Ctr Res Comparat Polit Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Renmin University of China,"Lo, D (通讯作者)，Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",diclo@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,25,25,2,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Six periods in US economic history are identified by a cluster analysis of observations in the PCA score plot. The method is data driven with no a priori information on the number or dates of breaks. Our findings give independent support to the effect of the oil price shock in 1973, and the introduction of the Great Moderation period. Of the five transition periods, two have been identified by previous studies as breaks (1973,1984), one is a well-known date of monetary policy change (1979), and two had not previously been identified (1970,1977-1978). In the long-run inflation and the federal funds rate are unrelated to industrial production and unemployment. Inflation and interest are positively associated as predicted by the Fisher hypothesis. These long-run relations argue against the use of monetary policy to peg the rate of unemployment or real interest rates. In the short-run inflation acts a leading indicator for unemployment for the period 1959-1997, but not for the period after 1997. The well-established reduction in macroeconomic volatility in the mid-1980s is specific to the period from 1985 to 1997; volatility subsequently rises above pre-1979 levels.

We use detailed survey data from Italian manufacturing firms that provide a firm-specific measure of credit rationing based directly on firms' responses to the survey rather than indirectly on firms' financial statements. After controlling for productivity and other relevant firm attributes, and accounting for the endogeneity of credit rationing, we find that the probability of exporting is 39% lower for rationed firms and that rationing reduces foreign sales by more than 38%. While credit rationing also appears to depress domestic sales, its impact on foreign sales is significantly stronger. The analysis also suggests that credit rationing is an obstacle to export especially for firms operating in high-tech industries and in industries that heavily rely on external finance.

I build a simple model of heterogeneous technology and heterogeneous workers that features complementarities between the quality of ideas and abilities. I show that changes to the skill bias of technology and to trade costs can both reproduce the observed pattern since (i) they have similar asymmetric effects on productive vs. unproductive firms, and (ii) positive assortative matching in the labor market transmits this asymmetry across high and low skill workers. Focusing on the different channels through which skill-biased technical change and trade integration operate suggests ways to disentangle the magnitude of each. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Rogers, H",,,,"Rogers, Howard",,,Shale gas-the unfolding story,OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,natural gas; shale gas; unconventional gas; Q410,,"In the early 2000s US gas production was in slow but steady decline despite increasing drilling activity. As US natural gas prices rose in response to the resulting tight market, the only supply-side solution appeared to lie in the development of liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in the Middle East and Africa for importation to the North American market. Almost unnoticed in its early stages, the US shale gas phenomenon gathered momentum from 2004 onwards through the combination and application of two proven technologies, namely horizontal drilling and pressure-induced hydraulic fracturing or 'fracking'. The pioneers of this approach were not the majors but the much smaller, domestically focused 'independent' upstream companies who, together with a well-established and adaptable service sector, instigated what is now commonly referred to as the 'shale gas boom' and which has increased US natural gas production to the point where only minimal imports of LNG are expected to be required for the foreseeable future. This paper looks at the genesis of the US shale gas industry, the intensive nature of its operations, and the factors which have underpinned its success to date. It also addresses the question of whether similar developments might be expected in Europe and what specific challenges would need to be overcome. In a world where increased LNG supply has created trade flow and price linkages between regional gas markets, the paper also examines the impact US shale production has had on other markets through the re-direction of LNG originally intended for the US market.","Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Rogers, H (通讯作者)，Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford, England.",howard.rogers@oxfordenergy.org,,,,,,,24,66,79,0,248,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Simulation exercises indicate that had optic fibers (fiber-to-the-home; FTTH) been made available to the whole country in 2005, only 10% of households would have switched to that mode.

Three types of debt (nominal, indexed, and foreign) and two regimes (fixed and flexible) are considered. Indexed debt is insulated against unexpected inflation. The real (domestic-currency) value of foreign debt is subject to valuation effects from real exchange rate shocks. The 'fear-of-floating' result, that foreign debt makes pegging more attractive, is shown to hold unambiguously only if the peg is fully credible. If the peg lacks credibility, a critical factor is the perceived likelihood of using the 'escape clause' of a switch to a float, which raises the costs of pegging. Foreign debt increases the temptation to resort to the escape clause, so when a peg is not fully credible (as is almost always the case in reality), pegging tends to be less attractive than floating in the presence of foreign debt.

We show that these assumptions have opposite predictions on the relation between entrepreneurial activity and firm-level TFP: with different entry costs, in areas with more entrepreneurs firms' average productivity should be lower; with heterogeneous external effects it should be higher. We test these implications on a sample of Italian firms and unambiguously reject the entry costs explanation in favor of the externalities explanation.

A second flaw concerns the model of global economic engagement that created a triple economic hemorrhage of spending on imports, manufacturing job losses, and off-shoring of investment. The new growth model hollowed out the economy and relied on growing debt and asset price inflation. As the process deepened the economy needed ever larger bubbles to grow. Financial deregulation and excess kept the model going longer than expected, but it meant the economy experienced a financial crash and deeper collapse when the contradictions finally surfaced.

Discussions are based on the related theories of internationalisation namely the Uppsala Model, Network Approach and International New Venture or Born global. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaire and a total of 250 responds were received. Findings indicate that exporting was the most used mode of entry and increasing profit was the main reason for internationalisation. Various internationalisation processes were adopted but the step-by-step and cautious approach seems to be the most popular. Potential difficulties and uncertainties in making profit appear to be the major reason for SMEs that did not internationalise. Crosstab analysis has been conducted to look at the characteristics of SMEs that internationalise.

Results suggest two distinct pricing regimes associated with off-and peak-harvesting seasons. The market power parameter is significant in the peak-harvest regime, but not in the off-peak regime. Moreover, price changes are transmitted completely throughout the marketing channel in the off-peak regime when the market power parameter is zero, but not in the peak-harvest regime when the market power parameter is positive. This suggests that produce buyers are more apt to exercise market power when farm supplies are abundant than when they are scarce, and that the exercise of such power causes the farm-retail price linkage to become asymmetric.","[Acharya, Ram N.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Kinnucan, Henry W.] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Caudill, Steven B.] Rhodes Coll, Dept Econ, Memphis, TN 38112 USA",New Mexico State University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Acharya, RN (通讯作者)，New Mexico State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, MSC 3169,POB 30003, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",acharyar@nmsu.edu,"Kinnucan, Henry W./A-5808-2008",,,,,,43,24,30,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The enforcement power of the anti-trust agency has increased dramatically. At the same time adverse trends in competition policy have emerged and strengthened. The main reason was, paradoxically, a growing role of anti-trust policy in the Russian government. The enforcement of anti-trust rules is expected to result immediately in control of the price level and/or support of a defined group of market participants (e. g. suppliers of food products). In this context legal rules are changing in a way that leads to an increase in the number of false positives (type I errors) in anti-trust cases. False positives not only impose a burden on the accused but also distort the incentives of market participants, restrain potentially efficient business practices and also paradoxically can prevent competition. This article considers three examples of adverse development of anti-trust rules in Russia: regulation of trading activity, rules on collusion and excessive prices of collectively dominant market participants, and rules on discrimination as an abuse of a dominant position.","[Avdasheva, Svetlana] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Inst Ind & Market Studies, Moscow, Russia; [Shastitko, Andrei] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Bur Econ Anal Fdn, Moscow, Russia; [Shastitko, Andrei] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Appl Inst Econ, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Lomonosov Moscow State University; Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Avdasheva, S (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Inst Ind & Market Studies, Moscow, Russia.",avdash@hse.ru,"Shastitko, Andrey/N-1121-2013","Shastitko, Andrey/0000-0002-6713-069X",,,,,17,11,12,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,4,,,,,493,505,,10.1080/14631377.2011.622571,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,883HL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299624800005,0

However, this literature is often cast in the pure labor supply general equilibrium model, which is not completely consistent with real tax systems where Labor Income Taxation (LIT) is not the only instrument used by governments. Hence, we explicitly introduce Value-Added Taxation (VAT) on consumption goods in the conventional model, and we derive an analytical formula for the MCF which does incorporate general equilibrium interactions between the different tax bases. Then, we illustrate how much this matter for empirical estimates of MCF using French data. Our numerical example suggests that, when computing MCF for a LIT reform, taking account of the impact of LIT reform on tax revenue from VAT can make a great deal of difference, typically increasing MCF and accounting for around 0.2 to 0.8 of estimates. In addition, MCF is then really less likely to be less than one than in the conventional framework.","[Beaud, Mickael] Univ Montpellier 1, F-34006 Montpellier, France",Universite de Montpellier,"Beaud, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier 1, F-34006 Montpellier, France.",mbeaud@univ-montp1.fr,,"Beaud, Mickael/0000-0002-0165-7034",,,,,17,0,0,1,5,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Is it empirically acceptable for us to claim that when a country starts with poorer pro-market infrastructures and institutions, she will be less likely to escape from poverty later on?

Our results show that two kinds of banks coexist in Europe: cross-selling banks, more interested in 'depositors' than in loans, and traditional banks, interested in granting loans to good borrowers. The awareness of the deep difference existing between these two types of banks now operating in Europe is very important for the implementation of an effective economic policy in the face of the financial crisis. We find evidence that cross-selling banks tend to be localized in countries where the banking system is less concentrated but they are not characterized by lower interest margins.","[Cosci, Stefania] LUMSA Univ, Dept Econ, I-00193 Rome, Italy; [Ciarrapico, Anna Micaela] Tor Vergata Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, I-00133 Rome, Italy",Universita LUMSA; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Cosci, S (通讯作者)，LUMSA Univ, Dept Econ, I-00193 Rome, Italy.",s.cosci@lumsa.it,"cosci, stefania/AIE-3424-2022",,,,,,5,4,4,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

When product menus are endogenous, however, tests for price discrimination may be biased by the fact that unobservables affecting costs or demand may jointly determine product menus and prices, leading one to falsely infer price discrimination. Using observed product characteristics or fixed effects to control for these unobservables confounds inference on the nature of price discrimination by potentially overcorrecting the original bias. I propose a difference-indifferences approach that is robust to this critique.

It is hypothesized here that the entrant firm's home market profits influence the entrant's competitive behavior even when entry is costless and completely reversible. In the experiment, entrants and incumbents tacitly collude when each has its own monopoly market. In contrast, an entrant from a competitive market practices hit-and-run entry whenever such opportunities exist, forcing the incumbent monopolist to price at average cost. The experiment results suggest that the usefulness of hit-and-run competitive threat in a contestable environment depends crucially on the relative profits in the entrant's and the incumbent's home and entry markets.","Franklin & Marshall Coll, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA",Franklin & Marshall College,"Dasgupta, U (通讯作者)，Franklin & Marshall Coll, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",utteeyo.dasgupta@fandm.edu,"Dasgupta, Utteeyo/AAX-6127-2021","Dasgupta, Utteeyo/0000-0003-4187-0494",,,,,64,1,1,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Ethnic concentration relates to racial harassment through at least three channels: hostility in the attitudes of majority individuals that finds expression in harassment behaviour, the probability that minority individuals meet majority individuals, and the cost of expressing hostility aggressively. Thus, harassment cannot simply be modelled as a stronger form of hostility. Using unique data for Britain, we show that, in areas of higher local ethnic concentration, experience of harassment is lower, even though hostility on the side of the majority population is not.","[Dustmann, Christian; Preston, Ian] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0AX, England; [Dustmann, Christian; Fabbri, Francesca; Preston, Ian] UCL, Ctr Res & Anal Migrat CReAM, London WC1H 0AX, England; [Fabbri, Francesca] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, DE-80539 Munich, Germany",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; University of Munich,"Dustmann, C (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0AX, England.",c.dustmann@ucl.ac.uk; f.fabbri@lmu.de; i.preston@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,46,25,29,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

To overcome this situation, several STI-related policies and strategies on building. technological competence were adopted and apparently did not seem to work. In this article an attempt is made to depart slightly from the earlier perspective in the Nigeria's STI policy agenda which only emphasize the development of technological capability by identifying factors like the provision of adequate funding, investing in key infrastructure, creation of technological innovations, and focusing on a few core technologies, as the solutions. Alternatively, it is argued that non-technological capabilities like management innovations, managerial competencies development, as well as transforming organizations to be knowledge-based should also be accorded high priority in the STI agenda. Accordingly a framework is deployed and expanded suggesting proposition of new policy emphasis that would increase organization's capacity to absorb knowledge, build entrepreneurial outlook, and facilitate managerial best practices and learning abilities which can ultimately result in higher productivity and growth.","[Dutse, A.

The increased attention to no financial measurement reflects increased requirement of information for managing and decision making processes because of strong competition, constantly changing environment of organization. Those processes are based on organizations' relations with an environment. The dimensions that lead to the deeper analysis of relations between performance measurement system and environment of organization are very important for today organizations. According to this aspect, it could be stated that performance measurement system (PMS) which covers financial and no financial measurement and fits with environment of organization should be critical for today's organizations and need deeper and continue researches. It is important to contribute to a better understanding of the factors that affect the features and content of PMS in organizations and the relationship between these factors, performance measurement practices and environment of organization (Alas, Sharifi & Sun, 2009; Ginevicius & Podvezko, 2009; Gudas, 2009). The dimensions that lead to the deeper analysis of such factors and relations were disclosed in this article according to different theoretical assumptions - institutional, contingency and complexity theories. Institutional theory will answer the question what factors form and influence internal and external environment of organizations and herewith the features and content of PMS. Contingency theory will answer the question - what external environment is surrounding the organization and influencing its internal environment. Complexity theory will answer the question - how organization reacts to its external environment. Combining the main presumptions of institutional, complexity and contingency theories it could be maintained that the level of environmental uncertainty and organizations reactions to it could be dimensions according to which features and content of PMS in different organizations could be researched. Those two dimensions form four types of organization's environment peculiarities of which performance measurement system should be reflected.

The conventionally held view, which has a basis in the seminal work of Schumpeter (1911), is that the stock market development is beneficial to the economy since it provides liquidity and an avenue for risk sharing and diversification, allows efficient allocation of resources to productive investment, reduces information and transaction costs and, consequently allows firms to undertake profitable investments. This view has been supported by various early empirical studies noting a positive relation between stock market development and economic growth. It has also been supported by recent studies utilizing advanced time series econometrics and finding the causal influences of stock market development on economic performance. Still, against this view and empirical evidence, some have also noted potential detrimental effects of stock market development through saving reduction, facilitation of counterproductive corporate takeovers, attraction of speculative inflows and reversal of financial capitals. The questions as to whether the stock market development influences macroeconomic performance and whether it can be employed as a development policy strategy are particularly relevant for emerging or developing economies. Over the past years, these economies have attempted to promote their stock markets with the objective of improving resource allocation and, consequently, of propelling their economic growth. However, after especially the liberalization of their financial markets, they have been exposed to sharp swings and wide fluctuations of their market performance, which may have inflicted detrimental impacts on macroeconomic performance. In this regards, the 1997/1998 Asian crisis, which started in Thailand and propagated to other Asian economies, is a good example. In looking at whether stock market development contributes to macroeconomic performance, existing studies have mainly looked at the relation between stock market development indicators and measures of economic performance using a linear regression model or has ascertained the causal relations that run from the stock market development indicators to macroeconomic variables using such approached as Granger causality, vector error correction modeling (VECM) and vector autoregressive modeling (VAR). While it is essential to document a strong relation between them, the linear regression model is not sufficient to establish causation. Moreover, the employment of a dynamic model such as the VAR or VECM and the finding of a causal pattern that runs from the stock market development to economic growth are not sufficient for policy prescription. This stems from the fact their relation or causal influences may shift due to the shift in regimes, signifying that the stock market development cannot be employed as a policy variable. In short, their relations are the subject of the well-known Lucas critique. In this paper, we utilize a 4-variable framework and quarterly data from 1993 to 2007 to examine the stock market and macroeconomic performance relation for Thailand. To this end, we first evaluate the causal patterns between a measure of stock market development and measures of macroeconomic performance, which is essential to evaluate whether stock market development 'causes' growth. Then, we assess whether the relations between the two main variables, i.e. measures of stock market development and macroeconomic performance, are structurally invariant to policy shifts. Hence, in addition to using standard time-series econometrics of cointegration and vector autoregressions (VAR), we alo examine within the error correction setting the superexogeneity of the stock market development. More specifically, to make a strong case for promotion of the stock market as a development strategy, the stock market development must be superexogenous since their relationship is structurally invariant to policy shifts and, accordingly, circumventing the famous Lucas critique in making policy recommendation. The cointegration test results suggest the presence of a long run relationship among the variables, namely, real gross domestic product (GDP), market capitalization ratio, investment ratio, and the aggregate price level. Further, the impulse-response functions and variance decompositions simulated from the estimated VAR models clearly indicate positive and sizeable contributions of stock market development to real GDP as well as investment ratio. Finally, the superexogeneity test indicates that the stock market development is superexogenous in the system. Thus, the relation between economic development and stock market development is structurally invariant to policy shifts. In the case of Thailand, there is a strong case for policy prescription to promote the development of its stock market as a catalyst to economic growth.","Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Ibrahim, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia.",mansorhi@econ.upm.edu.my,"Ibrahim, Mansor/AAU-6887-2020",,,,,,47,9,10,0,27,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We find evidence for the weak government hypothesis, that is, coalition governments issue significantly more debt than single party governments - a result that is typically explained by the common pool problem. As our data suggest, this result crucially hinges on the position or strength of the finance minister within coalition governments. We find that coalition governments with a strong finance minister are - in terms of borrowing - not significantly different from single party governments. In addition, we find (weak) evidence for an opportunistic political business cycle. As borrowing is significantly lower in pre-election years it appears that German voters favour fiscal discipline. There is no evidence for partisan behaviour, so party ideology seems to play a negligible role.","[Jochimsen, Beate] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Nuscheler, Robert] Univ Augsburg, Dept Econ, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",Free University of Berlin; University of Augsburg,"Jochimsen, B (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",beate.jochimsen@fu-berlin.de,"Jochimsen, Beate/K-4876-2019; Nuscheler, Robert/HNS-9880-2023","Jochimsen, Beate/0000-0001-6950-3026; Nuscheler, Robert/0000-0001-7841-6653",,,,,52,28,30,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This increase is driven by young cohorts receiving higher returns for education acquired post-1990 and middle-aged cohorts receiving higher returns over time. I estimate that these rising returns account for over 77% of the growth in wage inequality.","Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Kovacheva, P (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",pkovache@princeton.edu,,,,,,,27,3,3,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,2,,,,,237,255,PII 937639674,10.1080/14631377.2011.570052,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,764XM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290667900006,0

What ownership affects is just the allocation of wealth. Using data from the National Basketball Association (NBA), this article argues that player mobility is likely to be affected by player ownership due to transaction cost imposed by the institution.

I find that sibling correlations in a range of health and socioeconomic outcomes start quite high at birth and remain high over the life course. The sibling correlation in birth weight is estimated to be 0.5. Sibling correlations in test scores during childhood are as high as 0.6. Sibling correlations in adult men's wages are also around 0.5. Decompositions provide suggestive evidence on which pathways may account for the gradients in health and SES by family background. For example, sibling correlations in cognitive skills and non-cognitive skills during childhood are lower controlling for family income. Similarly, parent education levels can account for a sizable portion of the correlation in adult health status among brothers.","Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Mazumder, B (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA.",bmazumder@frbchi.org,,,"NIA NIH HHS [P01 AG029409-05, P01 AG029409] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,20,20,23,0,10,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The authors aimed to analyze whether the restructuring and changes in ownership of energy monopolies in Lithuania contributed to the creation of competitive electricity market The analysis was not restricted to the procedures of companies' reorganization, it integrated the national energy strategy, legal regulation of electricity sector, actual changes in the ownership of Lithuanian energy companies and subsequent decisions of the courts. This article is the first attempt to systematically analyze the history of the reorganization of Lithuanian electricity companies. The reform of electricity monopolies in Lithuania could be categorized from different perspectives, but there are commonly discussed issues, characterized as: (i) corporatization; (ii) legal separation of heat sector activities from electricity sector activities; and (iii) unbundling of electricity activities; (iv) privatization; (v) establishment of new companies for the implementation of the specific goals of electricity sector. Three main goals of Lithuanian electricity sector reform are identified: (i) the connection of Lithuania's high tension electricity networks with Poland and Sweden; (ii) integration into the electricity market of the Western Europe and the Nordic countries; (iii) construction of a new regional nuclear power plant. The legislative reform of energy sector can be divided into three stages: (i) the adoption of national legal norms after the declaration of independence; (ii) the harmonization of national law with the European Union legal acts and (iii) the creation of preconditions to construct a new nuclear power plant and to integrate Lithuanian electricity market into the Western European and Nordic countries electricity markets. The research showed that the restructuring and changes in ownership of energy companies still have not enhanced the competition in Lithuanian electricity market. Electricity policy goals - to ensure the strategic reliability of electricity supply and integrate Lithuania into the European Union market - have not been accomplished yet. The major supplier of electricity remains Russia and the electricity power system is still not connected to Western Europe and Nordic countries. However, the companies carrying out the interconnection projects, managing Electricity power exchange and coordinating the construction of a new nuclear power plant are established. These changes give rise to thinking, that Lithuania is on the way to liberalization of electricity market.","[Milciuviene, Saule] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Law, LT-44248 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Tikniute, Agne] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Dept Law, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Mykolas Romeris University,"Milciuviene, S (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Law, K Donelaicio St 58, LT-44248 Kaunas, Lithuania.",Saule@hydrogen.lt; agne.tikniute@mruni.eu,"Tikniute, Agne/AAY-9238-2020",,,,,,21,0,0,0,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

As China's economy continues to transition from centrally planned to market oriented, internal pressure for increased use of market mechanisms in trading corn and other commodities is continuous. Moreover, there is also external pressure for increased use of market mechanisms because of the accession of China to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The objective of this article is to evaluate the dynamic interrelationships between Chinese corn prices in producing, consuming and export/import locations and the US Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) price. A novel dataset including daily prices from dominant cash markets at producing regions, at export/import ports and at major consuming regions within China, as well as prices at Chicago is used in the analysis. Based on results of Vector Error Correction (VEC) model, prices in these markets are correlated in short run while error correction terms indicate long-run relationship among Chinese prices only. Causality relationships suggest that Dalian export price in China precedes the US price in the short run. However, shocks to any of Chinese prices have no long-term impact on the behaviour of US corn prices and the vice versa.","[Miljkovic, Dragan; Wilson, William W.] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58108 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,"Miljkovic, D (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, NDSU Dept 7610, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",dragan.miljkovic@ndsu.edu,,,,,,,23,0,0,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This article focuses on the effectiveness of policies aimed at stimulating the supply of S&E workers in the Netherlands. Despite the 'common wisdom' of severe and increasing shortages, we do not find evidence for a tight labour market of S&E workers. Instead, the data suggest that S&E workers have become less scarce since 1996. Stimulating enrolment in S&E studies may not be an effective policy for increasing R&D activity in the Netherlands because the majority of Dutch S&E freshmen do not end up working in R&D. They drop out during their S&E study or choose other jobs. In addition, the internationalization of the market for S&E workers tends to counter the effects of supply-side policies because the growing supply of foreign S&E graduates puts downward pressure on wages. As a result, demand-side policies may be more effective because they are directly targeted at fostering R&D.","[Noailly, Joelle; Webbink, Dinand] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [Jacobs, Bas] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Noailly, J (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",J.Noailly@cpb.nl,,"Noailly, Joelle/0000-0002-9053-0958",,,,,10,2,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This article undertakes an empirical investigation to assess the extent of de facto sterilization and capital mobility in Singapore and Taiwan using quarterly data between 1990 and 2008. Our empirical results suggest that, since, 2001 both Singapore and Taiwan have a high degree of - but not perfect - de facto capital mobility.

Workers optimally invest in the stock market and at the same time hedge labour income risk. Firms rationally take agents' portfolio decisions into account. In equilibrium, the cost of capital of each sector is endogenous. The distortion induced by moral hazard generates counterintuitive effects on the real economy. For example, the value of labour market participation may be higher under moral hazard than under first best, further a positive productivity shock may decrease welfare in the moral hazard economy. In addition, our model generates predictions on the effects of moral hazard on asset markets. For example, in the presence of moral hazard, the capital asset pricing model fails because firms, by choosing optimal incentive contracts, transfer risk both through wages and through the stock market. This leads to several cross-sectional asset pricing anomalies, such as size and value effects. As we characterize optimal contracts, we can also present empirical predictions relating workers' compensation, firm productivity, firm size, and financial market abnormal returns.","[Parlour, Christine A.; Walden, Johan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Parlour, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,23,7,7,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

However, empirical evidence supports a U-shaped relationship between consumption and mortality, implying that the monotonicity of that relation is local but not global. This paper develops a two-period OLG model where life expectancy is a non-monotone function of consumption, and where agents form myopic anticipations about life expectancy. The existence, uniqueness and stability of steady-state equilibria are studied. It is shown that overconsumption equilibria - i.e. equilibria at which consumption exceeds the level maximizing life expectancy - exist in highly productive economies with a low impatience. We identify also conditions under which there exist long-run cycles in output and longevity around overconsumption equilibria. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Significant differences between individuals and clusters are found, but so is a persistent within individual variation, which leads us to conclude that subjects do not commit to one particular bidding strategy and alternate across several processes.","Univ Murcia, Dept Econ Anal, E-30001 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Romeu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Dept Econ Anal, E-30001 Murcia, Spain.",aromeu@um.es,"Romeu, Andres/F-4650-2016","Romeu, Andres/0000-0003-0489-469X",,,,,25,0,0,0,3,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,4,,,,,473,488,,10.2298/PAN1104473R,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,867MC,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298457500003,0

We highlight the role of two technologies characteristic for media platforms: the technology to produce content and to place advertisements. Licensing incentives are driven solely by indirect network effects arising from the aversion of users to advertising. We establish a relationship between licensing incentives and the nature of technology, the decision variable on the advertiser side, and the structure of platforms' revenues. Only the technology to place advertisements is licensed. If users are charged for access, licensing incentives vanish. Licensing increases the advertising intensity, benefits advertisers and harms users. Our model provides a rationale for technology-based cooperations between competing platforms, such as the planned Yahoo-Google advertising agreement in 2008.","[Sapi, Geza] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Suleymanova, Irina] Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf Inst Competit Econ, D-4000 Dusseldorf, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Sapi, G (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",gsapi@diw.de; irina.suleymanova@dice.uni-duesseldorf.de,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,11,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Seeking to survive in the turbulent environment organizations need to assess the complexity of environment and to choose strategic development directions which are concretized in organizational strategy. Every organization is guided by its strategy, by a design or plan for achieving an organization's policy goals and objectives, however the inequality between intended and implemented strategies exists (Mintzberg, 1978). Acknowledging this fact, the paper raises a question why organizations focus on difficulties by implementing their strategies and provides an insight into the aspects related to a successful implementation of an intended strategy into praxis. The fruitful strategy formulation and the effective strategy implementation require the coordination of multiple actors and their activities (Heide, Gronhaug & Johannessen, 2002). Whereas top management is responsible for the strategic and organizational decisions that affect the organization as a whole (Helfat, Harris & Wolfson, 2006) and line managers operate as an intermediary between strategic and operational organizational activities (McCarthy, Darcy & Grady, 2010), the interaction between these two key actors in order to minimize the gap between strategies is essential. Assuming that some aspects may affect the success of key actors interaction, the assumptions, which determine the nature of interaction are presented. The paper looks into four assumptions: organizational culture, organizational structure, communication and allocation of resources which discloses the complexity of interaction. The paper proposes the discussion concerning the top management and line managers interaction and the key dimensions of that interaction seeking to ensure the implementation of strategic directions into praxis. Whereas top management and line managers can cooperate in a various number of activities, some dimensions of interaction are more significant. Goals determination, strategy formulation and strategy implementation are three key dimensions where interaction between top management and line managers is in demand if the organization strives to translate strategic directions into praxis. Finally assessing the character of activity and the discussed assumptions, the theoretical aspects on interaction between top management and line managers were verified during the empirical research in educational organizations and is presented in this paper. This brings to conclusion that the interaction between top management and line managers implementing strategic directions into praxis should be considered as a central issue of management literature. The paper is based on the material of the Leonardo da Vinci innovation transferring project Crossnational quality management in continuing learning for people with low educational attainment in the European context (Landerubergreifendes Qualitatsmanagement in der Weiterbildung fur Personen mit niedrigem Bildungsstand im Europaischen Kontext) (No 2009-1-PL-LEO05-05039).","[Savaneviciene, Asta; Stankeviciute, Zivile] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Savaneviciene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",asta.savaneviciene@ktu.lt; zivile.stankeviciute@stud.ktu.lt,"Savanevičienė, Asta/I-8581-2019","Savanevičienė, Asta/0000-0003-3132-860X; Stankeviciute, Zivile/0000-0002-5578-4645",,,,,40,5,5,0,21,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The privatization of telephone firms around the world provides an excellent opportunity to test this theory. Using a sample of repeated privatization sales I test whether governments can effectively signal commitment by selling ownership gradually and transferring managerial control immediately. The use of panel data with fixed-effects provides consistent estimates when commitment is not observed and time-invariant. Unobserved commitment is rendered time-invariant by using repeated sales within a government administration, typically within two years. The results cast doubt on the ability of governments to effectively signal commitment and increase the market value of firms in privatization sales.

Policymakers are considering a number of measures to avoid a recurrence of such large external imbalances. One such measure is the promotion of better labour rights around the world. Proponents argue that higher labour standards would boost US exports by increasing income growth abroad and reduce US imports by shrinking international price differences. Opponents of such a policy move argue that it is disguised protectionism that will impede trade and harm living standards in the USA and abroad. In this paper, I combine US trade data with data on international labour standards and other relevant economic variables to study any links between labour rights abroad and US trade. The results suggest that the USA would have benefited from more exports if there had been better worker rights around the world, but that labour rights would not have had any measurable impact on US imports.

The firm possesses a perpetual option to invest in a project at any instant by incurring an irreversible investment cost at that time. The amount of the irreversible investment cost determines the intensity of investment that augments the value of the project. Tax progression is specified in a particular case of a constant marginal tax rate with an exogenously given tax exemption threshold that makes the average tax rate increase with the tax base. We show that the firm's investment decisions are neutral to tax progression only when the exogenously given tax exemption threshold is sufficiently large. When tax neutrality does not hold, we show that progressive taxation has a perverse effect on investment intensity. Finally, we show that progressive taxation induces the firm to invest earlier as compared to the case under proportional taxation (i.e., in the absence of any tax exemption). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Using panel data constructed from annual reports, this article offers a general overview of these new funds in terms of size, family affiliation and performance. Special emphasis is placed on fees and total expense ratios, because such features of asset management industries in developing countries such as Thailand have been understudied. Consistent with findings for other countries, Thai funds investing in high-risk, equity securities charge consistently higher fees and expenses than those that focus on fixed income securities. Investors of large funds pay higher management fees, while funds belonging to big families appear to charge lower management fees and total expenses. Finally, there is some suggestive evidence of a negative association between fees charged and investment returns, although simultaneity renders any causal implications inappropriate.","Asian Inst Technol, Sch Management, Klongluang, Pathumthani, Thailand",Asian Institute of Technology,"Wongsurawat, W (通讯作者)，Asian Inst Technol, Sch Management, Klongluang, Pathumthani, Thailand.",winai@ait.ac.th,,,,,,,23,6,7,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

One of the important factors that have been affecting changes in the tourism sector, are tourists, their life-style, preferences and needs that have been also changing significantly. Changes in consumer market and intense competition in the recent years have increased the need for travel agencies to concentrate on retaining and attracting the right customers. The paper presents partial findings of the research focused on customer satisfaction in tourism conducted by the Department of Marketing in 2009 - 2010. The previous analyses of the findings (already published) showed that tourists are more independent and sophisticated when organizing their holidays (some of them do not use services of travel agencies), cost (price) orientated and preferring comfort and individual holiday program. These are the reasons why many of them do not use services offered by travel agencies and do not book their holidays there. The paper discuses a customer segment profile of the travel agency that was obtained by testing the statistical significance of differences on demographic and psychographic characteristics between the customers of travel agencies and individual holiday makers.","[Zemanova, Adela; Simova, Jozefina] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Liberec 46001, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,adela.zemanova@tul.cz; jozefina.simova@tul.cz,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,13,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,590,598,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200063,0

Even in the latter case, copyright enforcement and DRM are substitutes, and, thus, stronger copyright enforcement by the government reduces the usage of inefficient DRM.

By extending the analysis we establish a positive relation between investment in firm-specific training and the probability that a worker dismissed for behavioral reasons receives severance payments, and suggest that a mandatory increase in severance payments may yield a Pareto improvement.

In this paper, we present evidence on a possible explanation for persistent differences in productivity at the firm and the national level - namely, that such differences largely reflect variations in management practices. We have, over the last decade, undertaken a large survey research program to systematically measure management practices across firms, industries, and countries. Our survey approach focuses on aspects of management like systematic performance monitoring, setting appropriate targets, and providing incentives for good performance. We explain how we measure management; identify some basic patterns in our data; then turn to the question of why management practices vary so much across firms and nations. What we find is a combination of imperfectly competitive markets, family ownership of firms, regulations restricting management practices, and informational barriers allow bad management to persist.","[Bloom, Nicholas] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Van Reenen, John] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England",Stanford University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bloom, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nbloom@stanford.edu; j.vanreenen@lse.ac.uk,"Van Reenen, John/AAG-9587-2019; Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019",,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,600,660,1,108,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Using pseudo data generated by a sticky price model of the US economy, we then show that the structural VARs are capable of reproducing the price puzzle only when monetary policy is passive. The omission in the VARs of a variable capturing expected inflation is found to account for the price puzzle observed in simulated and actual data.","[Castelnuovo, Efrem] Univ Padua, I-35100 Padua, Italy; Bank Finland, Helsinki, Finland; London Business Sch, London, England",University of Padua; Bank of Finland; University of London; London Business School,"Castelnuovo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",,"Surico, Paolo/G-7283-2014",,,,,,34,80,84,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

This paper offers a cultural explanation for the limited LTC insurance development in Europe. It argues that family ties, by enhancing informal care-giving duties, inhibit individuals' expected (public and private) insurance coverage. The empirical analysis of the paper exploits cross-country and sub-group variability of a representative database of European Union member states, containing records on LTC coverage and family structure. Drawing upon two measures of familistic culture or family ties, we find a negative association between family ties and expected coverage of LTC for different sub-samples. These results are robust to a set of checks for different definitions of family ties and controls, and for a sub-sample of first- and second-generation migrants. Policy implications suggest that widespread expansion of LTC coverage might need to accommodate existing familistic cultural norms to avoid insurance crowding out.","London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Costa-Font, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.",j.costa-font@lse.ac.uk,"David, Maribel/E-2812-2012; Costa-i-Font, Joan/C-9609-2013","Costa-i-Font, Joan/0000-0001-7174-7919",,,,,48,56,62,0,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We identify three categories of contributions: to measurement, to axiomatics, and to application. A representative subset of the literature generated by the FGT methodology is discussed and grouped according to this taxonomy. We show how the FGT paper has played a central role in several thriving literatures and has contributed to the design, implementation, and evaluation of prominent development programs; the breadth of its impact is evidenced by the many topics beyond poverty to which its methodology has been applied. We conclude with a selection of prospective research topics.","[Thorbecke, Erik] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Thorbecke, Erik] Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Foster, James] George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Foster, James] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Foster, James] Univ Oxford, Oxford Poverty & Human Dev Initiat, Oxford Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 3TB, England; [Greer, Joel] Ctr Medicare Serv, Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Baltimore, MD 21244 USA; [Greer, Joel] Ctr Medicaid Serv, Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Baltimore, MD 21244 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; George Washington University; George Washington University; University of Oxford; CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,"Thorbecke, E (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, B-16 MVR, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",fosterje@gwu.edu; et17@cornell.edu,,,,,,,142,116,133,1,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

This literature uses the concepts and approaches of applied economics to investigate a range of historical issues and there are strong parallels with the questions that have been addressed in the literature on contemporary migrations. Here I focus on the period 1850-1940 and chiefly on migration from Europe to the New World. The survey is organized around six themes that include the forces driving migration, over time and across space; the assimilation of migrants and their effects on wages and income distribution in source and destination countries; and the evolution of immigration policy. Although this literature has drawn heavily on the tool kit of applied economists it also provides a wider perspective on many of the issues that concern migration today.","[Hatton, Timothy J.] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Hatton, Timothy J.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Essex; Australian National University,"Hatton, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",,,,,,,,115,21,25,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

A unique and consistent data set from three waves of the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Australia (LSIA, 1993-95) is used to estimate probit models of the probability of being unemployed separately for males and females of Asian and non-Asian origins. The unemployment probability gap between the two migrant groups is decomposed into two components, the first associated with differences in their human capital and other demographic characteristics, and the second with differences in their impacts (called discrimination). The results provide an evidence of discrimination against Asian male migrants in all three waves. Discrimination against Asian females is detected only in the first wave. The Asian females who are professionals and can speak English 'well' are rather favoured relative to their non-Asian counterparts. Thus, the empirical evidence on discrimination against migrants of Asian origin is mixed.","[Junankar, P.

For this purpose, we considered five weekly KOSPI 200 sector index series. Using the iterated cumulated sums of squares (ICSS) algorithm, we determined the timing of volatility changes corresponding to major economic and political events, including the 1997 Asian currency crisis, the Russia crisis of 1998, the IT bubble of 2000, the 9/11 terror attack of 2001, the Iraq war of 2003 and the global financial crisis that has been recently affecting nations worldwide. After incorporating these volatility change, volatility persistence in the GARCH model was significantly reduced. This result implies that ignoring exogenous changes overestimates volatility persistence. Thus, incorporating information on exogenous changes in conditional variance will improve the accuracy of volatility forecasting.","[Yoon, Seong-Min] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Pusan 609735, South Korea; [Kang, Sang Hoon] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Pusan 609735, South Korea",Pusan National University; Pusan National University,"Yoon, SM (通讯作者)，Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Jangjeon2 Dong, Pusan 609735, South Korea.",smyoon@pusan.ac.kr,"Yoon, Seong-Min/AFL-6471-2022","Yoon, Seong-Min/0000-0003-3011-9486",,,,,22,0,0,0,5,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

Here FDI is defined as the movement of production bases from the North to the South by the northern firms because the incentive of FDI is the lower production cost in the South. By our numerical analysis, the increase of exogenous FDI arrival rate leads to a higher imitation rate in the South, industry shift from the North to the South (the increase of the ratio of the southern imitation firms and multinational firms compared to the ratio of northern innovation firms) and lower wage inequality between the North and the South. But there is no change in the long run innovation rate and the decrease of short run innovation rate. On the other hand, globalization is defined here as the increase of South population. By my numerical analysis, globalization leads to less copying of Northern products, faster technological progress, more industry shift from the North to the South utilizing the increase in multinational firms, and greater wage gaps between the two regions.","Wonkwang Univ, Div Int Trade, Coll Business & Econ, Iksan Si 570749, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea",Wonkwang University,"Kim, S (通讯作者)，Wonkwang Univ, Div Int Trade, Coll Business & Econ, 344-2 Shinyong Dong, Iksan Si 570749, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea.",suyikim@wonkwang.co.kr,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,9,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

Efforts to contain costs may also be relevant with regard to public expenditure on health and long-term care but, thus far, no country has started to really deal with these issues. Still, some countries have made substantial progress in securing the long-term sustainability of their welfare systems.

Collaborative research seems to be a key factor explaining the relative success of some European countries, in particular when it comes to publishing in top journals, attained predominantly through international collaborations.","[Cardoso, Ana Rute] Spanish Natl Res Council IAE CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Madrid, Spain; [Cardoso, Ana Rute; Zimmermann, Klaus F.] Inst Study Labor IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Cardoso, Ana Rute] IAE CSIC, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Guimaraes, Paulo] Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); IZA Institute Labor Economics; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of Bonn; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Cardoso, AR (通讯作者)，Spanish Natl Res Council IAE CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Madrid, Spain.",anarute.cardoso@iae.csic.es; guimaraes@moore.sc.edu; zimmermann@iza.org,"Guimaraes, Paulo D/A-7085-2008; Cardoso, Ana Rute/B-5888-2009","Guimaraes, Paulo D/0000-0002-2992-1028; Cardoso, Ana Rute/0000-0002-6168-8959",,,,,20,23,24,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV 10,2010,63.0,4,,,,,479,494,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00484.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,665XS,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283071600003,0

Thus, incentives may arise to spend more money where media coverage is higher. We present a simple model to explain the allocation of public spending across jurisdictions contingent on media activity. A politician seeking to maximize the probability of reelection will shift more money to jurisdictions where an extra dollar raises more votes because a larger share of the electorate is informed about his policy. The main prediction of the model is that media activity is higher in the core areas of media markets. This implies higher spending levels there and lower spending levels in remote jurisdictions. Empirical support for this prediction is found using United States data on county-level federal grant allocation, Designated Market Areas and the location of licensed television stations.","[Bruns, Christian; Himmler, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Bruns, C (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cbruns@uni-goettingen.de; ohimmle@uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,24,0,1,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,,,ECON GOV,Econ.

The PT regime outperforms the IT regime, and the gain depends on the degree of financial market frictions. This is because inflation is better anchored under PT, owing to the expectation channel, and therefore the monetary authority has more leverage to deal with the financial market distortions. We also find that the gain is higher if the optimal rule reacts to asset prices instead of the output gap, and the rule requires a positive response to asset prices.On compare le ciblage du niveau des prix (Np) au ciblage du taux d'inflation (Ti) dans un modele d'equilibre general dynamique stochastique quand il y a imperfections dans les marches de la dette et des actions.

This situation gives rise to a trade-off between the costs and benefits of reliability. The Dutch government has responded to this trade-off by changing the rule stipulating that electricity networks must be able to maintain supply even if one component fails (known as the N-1 rule), even in maintenance situations. This rule was changed by adding the phrase unless the costs exceed the benefits. We have developed a cost-benefit framework for the implementation and application of this new rule. The framework requires input on failure probability, the cost of supply interruptions to end-users and the cost of investments. A case study of the Dutch grid shows that the method is indeed practicable and that it is highly unlikely that N-1 during maintenance will enhance welfare in the Netherlands. Therefore, including the limitation unless the costs exceed the benefits in the rule has been a sensible policy for the Netherlands, and would also be a sensible policy for other countries.

Furthermore, the signs of the exchange rate coefficients differ between Japan and the US. In this paper, we formulate a three-country model with coexisting exporters and multinational firms that engage in Cournot competition to rationalize these effects. In this model, we identify two counteracting effects which govern the bilateral and third-country effects of an exchange rate increase on bilateral multinational activity. Our theoretical framework is flexible enough to explain the Japanese as well as the US patterns of exchange rate effects and it allows us to identify those factors that are responsible for the respective differences.","[Egger, Hartmut] Univ Bayreuth, RW Dept Econ, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Egger, Peter] ETH, CEPR, CESifo, WIFO, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter] GEP Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Egger, Peter] ETH, KOF, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ryan, Michael] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA",University of Bayreuth; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Nottingham; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Western Michigan University,"Egger, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, RW Dept Econ, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",hartmut.egger@uni-bayreuth.de; egger@kof.ethz.ch; michael.ryan@wmich.edu,"Egger, Hartmut/A-7397-2014","Ryan, Michael/0000-0001-9381-3112; Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",,,,,15,2,2,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

This problem is even more pronounced in a nonlinear threshold framework when stationary covariates are included. In this paper, we propose new threshold cointegration tests based on instrumental variables estimation. The newly suggested IV threshold cointegration tests have standard distributions that do not depend on any stationary covariates. These desirable properties allow us to formally test for threshold cointegration in a nonlinear Taylor rule. We perform this analysis using real-time U.S. data for several sample periods from 1970 to 2005. In contrast to the linear model, we find strong evidence of cointegration in a nonlinear Taylor rule with threshold effects. Overall, we find that the Federal Reserve is far more policy active when inflation is high than when inflation is low. In addition, we reaffirm the notion that the response to counteract high inflation was weakest in the 1970s and strongest in the Greenspan era. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It also explores the earnings gap between Latin American employees and other groups of foreign workers from both developing and developed countries. The study is based on the Wage Structure Survey 2006, which is the first nationally representative sample of both foreign and Spanish employees. Using the Machado-Mata econometric procedure, earnings differentials across the whole wage distribution are decomposed into a component related to observable characteristics and another associated to different returns to such endowments. First, we find that, in absolute terms, the earnings differential between Latin American and Caribbean immigrants and natives that is not explained by observable characteristics increases across the wage distribution. While the large gap at the top might be mainly explained by problems of transferability of skills among immigrants, the low differential at the bottom is likely to be related to the compressive effect exerted by labor market institutions such as the minimum wage and collective agreements. A quite similar pattern is observed when they are compared with developed countries' workers. Secondly, there does not seem to be a significant wage gap between Latin American and the rest of foreign employees from developing countries, possibly because immigrants are largely employed in low-skill jobs where Spanish proficiency is not an essential asset.","[Ignacio Anton, Jose] Univ Salamanca, Dept Econ Aplicada, Salamanca 37007, Spain",University of Salamanca,"Antón, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Dept Econ Aplicada, Campus Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",janton@usal.es; bustillo@usal.es; mcarrera@usal.es,"Carrera Troyano, Miguel/L-5989-2014; Antón, José-Ignacio/L-6469-2014","Carrera Troyano, Miguel/0000-0002-5016-5482; Antón, José-Ignacio/0000-0001-9623-3121",,,,,48,4,6,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

For example, when using real option theory to value an investment, a density function for the future price of oil is central to the option valuation. The literature on oil pricing offers two views. The arbitrage pricing theory literature for oil suggests geometric Brownian motion and mean reversion models. Empirically driven literature suggests ARMA-GARCH models. In addition to reflecting the volatility of the market, the density function of future prices should also incorporate the uncertainty due to price jumps, a common occurrence in the oil market. In this study, the accuracy of density forecasts for up to a year ahead is the major criterion for a comparison of a range of models of oil price behaviour, both those proposed in the literature and following from data analysis. The Kullbach Leibler information criterion is used to measure the accuracy of density forecasts. Using two crude oil price series, Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) representing the US market, we demonstrate that accurate density forecasts are achievable for up to nearly two years ahead using a mixture of two Gaussians innovation processes with GARCH and no mean reversion.

Yet, China did not industrialize until 150 yr after England and nearly a century after less advanced European countries. This represents a puzzle because two-sector neoclassical growth models, such as Hansen and Prescott (2002), that accurately match industrialization, require that more technologically advanced countries industrialize at an earlier date.

It describes firms as ongoing, multilateral relational contracts from whose operation - that is, from performance over time by specific individuals in the roles and relationships defined by the contract - emerge the firm's idiosyncratic routines and capabilities. It emphasizes the role of entrepreneurs in the creation of firms and the close dependence of organizational capabilities on human performance, and argues that this account is consistent with a reasonable individualism that allows for social outcomes to be determined by the actions and interaction of individuals. It then proposes that firms are nonetheless institutional facts and thus ontologically subjective but epistemically objective components of reality, and concludes with directions for future work.","Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Middletown, CT USA",Wesleyan University,"Adelstein, R (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Middletown, CT USA.",radelstein@wesleyan.edu,,,,,,,40,14,15,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

Controlling for worker and establishment characteristics, output-market wage premia are increasing in market remoteness and employee education. Establishment human capital is also increasing in output-market remoteness.

We pay particular attention to the mechanisms by which families retain control over firms, and the incentives of the families in control to expropriate other stakeholders by way of tunnelling. We examine the role of earnings management in facilitating tunnelling, and evidence about the incidence of earnings management in family firms. Our review suggests that while the literature on these aspects of family control is rich, the contexts in which the empirical exercises are undertaken are relatively few, and hence there is considerable opportunity to expand it to other contexts, in particular in the form of cross-country comparisons of the relative impact of agency conflicts and institutions on these issues.","[Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Gregoriou, Andros] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Aston University; University of East Anglia,"Bhaumik, SK (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",,,,,,,,134,58,64,4,95,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The panel analysis conducted in this paper suggests that the adoption of the common currency has, thus far, exacerbated regional inequality in poorer EU countries, while it has not significantly affected regional inequality within richer countries.

When evaluating DSGE models on an absolute basis, however, we find that the benchmark estimated medium-scale DSGE model forecasts inflation and GDP growth very poorly, although statistical and judgmental forecasts do equally poorly. Our finding is the DSGE model analogue of the literature documenting the recent poor performance of macroeconomic forecasts relative to simple naive forecasts since the onset of the Great Moderation. Although this finding is broadly consistent with the DSGE model we employ the model itself implies that especially under strong monetary policy, inflation deviations should be unpredictable a wrong model may also have the same implication. We therefore argue that forecasting ability during the Great Moderation is not a good metric by which to judge models.","[Edge, Rochelle M.] Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Washington, DC USA; [Guerkaynak, Refet S.] Bilkent Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Edge, RM (通讯作者)，Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Washington, DC USA.",,"GURKAYNAK, REFET SOYKAN/Y-9672-2018","GURKAYNAK, REFET SOYKAN/0000-0003-4266-7463",,,,,33,73,78,0,12,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

The results show that a permanent increase in the domestic stock of public capital financed by a reduction in public consumption raises domestic welfare if the productivity of public capital is high and the weight of public consumption in private utility is low compared to private consumption. The effect on foreign welfare is negative in the short run, but positive in the long run. This implies that, if foreign authorities care not only about the present discounted value of welfare but also about welfare dynamics, a permanent domestic reallocation of public spending might result in a virtuous global technological cycle.

More concretely, this rate is assumed to be variable over time, subject only to be between prescribed upper and lower limits. In this kind of setup, the model is represented by a two dimensional dynamical system, which happens to be non-autonomous. In contrast to the Ramsey model, the linearization method cannot be used. It will be necessary to use different techniques to derive the dynamic properties of the model's solution, as well as investigate its long-run growth and asymptotic stability. This will be done using the method proposed by Guerrini (2006), when studying the Solow model with a variable population growth rate. The paper also shows that closed-form analytic solutions can always be derived for the model, when capital's share is equal to the reciprocal of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

However, the increase in unemployment that followed this slowdown was more pronounced in European economies relative to the USA. In this paper we present an efficiency wage model, which enables us to identify two basic channels through which the productivity slowdown can affect workers' effort incentives. Predictions of the model are consistent with the different trends in unemployment across countries over this period in the face of a similar slowdown in productivity. We also demonstrate how the link between growth and unemployment depends upon labour market institutions in such a way that we can reconcile the mixed empirical results observed in the literature.","[Haruyama, Tetsugen] Kobe Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Leith, Campbell] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Kobe University; University of Glasgow,"Haruyama, T (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",,"Leith, Campbell/N-1025-2019; Leith, Campbell B/C-9505-2011","Leith, Campbell/0000-0002-6406-2636;",,,,,47,4,4,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

We find that Fed's monetary policy has only reacted significantly to changes in inflation when they were between approximately 6.5-8.5%. However, the policy stance change on these changes was relatively small. The findings suggest that the US Fed has been too averse to change from its current monetary policy stance, and that it has not reacted noticeably to changes in the US economic activity, as measured by the output gap. The generalized functional form for the monetary policy rule suggests that similar non-linearity exists in the directional change of the Fed rate. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier By.

The common goal is to allow the description of a more general class of non-rival goods. The literature proposes several approaches to describe the externality created by the public good which to some extent determine the results of the model. In this note we try to show the hypotheses underlying the different functions used. We argue that the different approaches are suitable only if used in the right framework and this should be kept in mind when choosing the function in relation to the type of public good to be studied.

Second, I extend the base model by incorporating insights from behavioral finance where risk is instead determined by fund manager losses. Simulation results reveal that slight global manager losses can trigger a widening of both markets' risk premium, accelerating the decline in asset prices worldwide. Statistical analysis reveals that global managers are a stabilizing force in smaller numbers; however, they become destabilizing in larger numbers. The ability to reduce risk by diversifying across markets results in excessive risk taking. If global managers exist in larger numbers, systematic over leverage may result such that a deleveraging process can lead to the spreading of financial crises. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We study a timing game between two different countries: before providing public goods, the two policymakers non-cooperatively decide their preferred sequence of moves. We establish conditions under which a first- or second-mover advantage emerges for each country, highlighting the role of spillovers and the complementarity or substitutability of public goods. As a result, we are able to prove that there is no leader when, for both countries, public goods are substitutable. When public goods are complements for both countries, each of them may emerge as the leader in the game. Hence a coordination issue arises. We use the notion of risk-dominance to select the leading government.

We test these predictions by using recent Demographic and Health Surveys data sets for twelve Sub-Saharan countries.

We model the logarithm of expenditures and consider five different models. The first two are two-part and sample selection cross-section models. Two-part panel data models turn out to be inappropriate for dealing with expenditures. We thus estimate sample selection models with panel data: one without a lagged dependent variable and two with a lagged dependent variable. These two latter models differ in their assumptions on the variance of the residuals. Modelling heteroscedasticity may indeed be important to avoid the bias due to the retransformation problem. We show that lagged dependent variables are important factors for heteroscedasticity. For the models with state dependence, we provide a new solution to the initial conditions problem by controlling for generalised residuals. We establish that panel data models highly improve the correlation explained by the model in the time-series dimension without damaging the fit in the cross-section dimension. For all indicators of fit, the model with state dependence and heteroscedasticity seems to dominate the others. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Under the current global economic downturn, in addition, the region's energy-intensive industries are faced with the challenge of weakening demand for their outputs. This paper casts light on the relation between the price and demand for energy Based on firm-level data, it shows that the price elasticity of industrial energy demand is about -0.4 on average. There are a number of data issues in interpreting the results correctly, but Albania and Macedonia are systematically found to have a relatively elastic demand for energy on the order of -0.7 to -0.8. In these countries, therefore, price adjustments would be one of the effective policy options to balance demand with supply during the period of energy crisis. In other countries, the demand response would be much weaker; pricing cannot be the only solution. Other policy measures, such as facilitation of energy efficiency and improvements in the quality of infrastructure services, may be required.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Iimi, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,10,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

He is one of those exceptional scholars whose work reflects a broad and thoroughly integrated vision. In carefully and creatively implementing that vision, he has led a remarkable resurgence of interest in tax policy research over the last decade. Emmanuel's work can be divided into five areas: the theory of optimal taxes and transfers; the measurement of income and wealth distributions; the measurement of behavioral responses to personal taxation; the taxation of corporate dividends; and retirement saving. A great deal of his work is closely interrelated across these topics, which makes the whole considerably greater than the sum of the parts.

The standard growth model with overlapping generations of consumers (OLG) is extended to include uncertainty and a financial asset. In the absence of an international asset market, the two autarkic economies converge to the same globally attracting steady state under rational expectations dynamics. When the two asset markets are unified internationally, additional asymmetric steady states appear, implying that the steady state with equal levels of capital becomes unstable, causing symmetry breaking. The paper derives general sufficient conditions for a saddle node bifurcation of the symmetric steady state.

For cross-sectional variation, government employees with special pension plan are used as control group. The paper finds that a social security system crowds out household saving.

We argue that social organizations contribute directly to broader welfare aspects of development as part of the third sector of the economy, which undertakes the provision of public goods, such as health and education, in synergy with state institutions. This is counter to views that associate social organizations with anti-growth rent-seeking and lobbying activities. We begin with a multivariate regression analysis, which reveals that membership in social organizations is positively associated with human development, along with state institutions of public expenditure and the quality of governance. We then conduct a case study analysis to explore further the historical and cultural contextual factors of European welfare systems that determine the capacity of third sector organizations to enhance generalized co-operation, synergistic relations and social welfare against particularist interests.","[Christoforou, Asimina] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Christoforou, Asimina] Univ Crete, Rethimnon, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Crete,"Christoforou, A (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece.",asimina@aueb.gr,,,,,,,45,14,14,0,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This paper discusses how we got there and how recent developments in the study of dynamical systems allow us to go beyond that. It traces the evolution of the teaching of economics from Alfred Marshall, who built his supply-and-demand framework within a complexity vision of the economy. It suggests that that complexity vision was lost as economists formalized the supply-demand framework and extended it to the entire economy.

The analysis is for the U.S.; however, lessons from other countries regarding desirable properties of a poverty measure are considered. A primary focus is internal consistency between thresholds and resources. This study is among the first for the U.S. to describe an internally consistent poverty measure, drawing from recommendations of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS). Thresholds reflect spending needs as outflows. Resources measure inflows available to meet spending needs. The U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey is used for thresholds, and the Current Population Survey is the basis for resources. Trends are reported with comparisons to the official and a relative measure. An important finding is that increases in expenditures for shelter, captured in the NAS thresholds, suggest a greater increase in the number of families not able to meet basic needs than is reflected by official poverty statistics over this time period.","[Garner, Thesia I.] US Bur Labor Stat, Div Price & Index Number Res, US Dept Labor, Washington, DC 20212 USA",United States Department of Labor,"Garner, TI (通讯作者)，US Bur Labor Stat, Div Price & Index Number Res, US Dept Labor, Washington, DC 20212 USA.",garner.thesia@bls.gov,,,,,,,61,7,7,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Results suggest that the Pedroni panel cointegration tests do not confirm a long-term equilibrium relationship between electricity consumption per capita and real GDP per capita. Moreover, since no cointegration was found, error-correction mechanisms plus causality tests cannot be run for further steps in the long-term to investigate the causality between electricity consumption and economic growth. Overall, it can be said that the electricity consumption related policies have no effect or relation on the level of real output in the long run for these countries. As a conclusion, the literature has conflicting results and there is no consensus either on the existence or the direction of causality between electricity consumption and economic growth. Thus, the findings of this study have important policy implications and it shows that this issue still deserves further attention in future research. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For comparison purposes, the application was also extended to standard linear models. During the empirical presentation of both models, significant nonlinear effects were found and linearity was rejected. The SETAR model was found out to be relatively better than the linear autoregressive model in out-of-sample point and interval (density) forecasts. Results from our STR model showed that the residual variance of the fitted STR model was only about 65.7% of that of the linear ARX model. Thus, we can conclude that the inclusion of the nonlinear part, which basically accounts for the arrival of extreme price events, leads to improvements in the explanatory abilities of the model for electricity consumption in Ethiopia.

Consequently, hiring workers who are public service, or pro-socially, motivated helps to overcome incentive problems and to increase organizational efficiency, thus reducing the need for high-powered incentives. However, such an argument would be undermined should workers' pro-social or intrinsic motivation dissipates rapidly with job tenure. Based on longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), we explore patterns of overall and domain satisfaction measures for workers who made the transition from private to public sector employment. We are particularly interested in finding out whether any possible boost in satisfaction with the nature of the work itself, our proxy for pro-social or Public Service Motivation (PSM), associated with accepting public sector employment dissipates following the transition into public sector employment. Our results reject the hypothesis of a rapid and complete adaptation of PSM back to baseline or pre-transition levels. Interestingly, this is not the case for public to private or for within-sector transitions, which result in a short-lived increase in intrinsic motivation. This is welcome evidence for the advocates of the benefits of having pro-socially or intrinsically motivated people working in the public sector.","[Georgellis, Yannis] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Business, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Tabvuma, Vurain] Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Bournemouth University; Brunel University,"Georgellis, Y (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Sch Business, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.",ygeorgellis@bournemouth.ac.uk; ecpgvvt@brunel.ac.uk,"Georgellis, Yannis/AAP-6343-2020; Georgellis, Yannis/A-6411-2012","Georgellis, Yannis/0000-0002-7866-8014;",,,,,40,31,45,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2010,63.0,2,,,,,176,191,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00468.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,581AI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276492000002,0

For an efficient monetary policy, any change in the central bank policy rate is meant to be transmitted to retail interest rates, ultimately influencing consumer and business lending rates and therefore aggregate domestic demand and output. The disaggregated GETS methodology is employed, which allows us to reveal the relative importance of the central bank and money market rates as policy vehicle variables in the two banking systems. Our empirical results for the two banking systems are rather mixed as far as it concerns the pass-through transmission and completeness. We also refer to the lessons learned prior to and after the collapse of the monetary and financial system on both sides of the Atlantic. We believe that this study has interesting policy insights and provides certain policy suggestions, which might be useful for the regulatory authorities in their attempt to monitor and reinforce monetary policy effectiveness.

We investigate whether the individual decision to start exporting and exported volume are influenced by the presence of nearby product and/or destination specific exporters, using a gravity-type equation estimated at the firm-level. Spillovers are considered at a fine geographical level corresponding to employment areas (348 in France). We control for the new economic geography-type selection of firms into agglomerated areas, and for the local price effects of firms agglomeration. Results show evidence of the presence of export spillovers on the export decision but not on the exported volume. We interpret this as a first evidence of export spillovers acting through the fixed rather than the variable cost. Spillovers on the decision to start exporting are stronger when specific, by product and destination, and are not significant when considered on all products-all destinations. Moreover, export spillovers exhibit a spatial decay within France: the effect of other exporting firms on the export decision is stronger within employment areas and declines with distance.

In this paper, we distil the essence of the experience of East Asia-of Japan initially, then of Korea and Taiwan, and now of China-in a set of flexible precepts that we suggest underpin the policies and strategies pursued with success by these East Asian economies. In the spirit of proposing an alternative to the Washington Consensus, we suggest that these precepts-pragmatic and known to work-be dubbed the Beijing-Seoul-Tokyo Consensus (or BeST Consensus for development). The essence of this consensus is its focus on capability building, on dynamic transitions from one stage to the next, and on building an institutional platform to capture latecomer effects. We outline what this BeST Consensus might be and discuss why it is that its elements appear to work so well; and whether they can still be applied in the world of 21st-century conditions.","[Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Mathews, John A.] LUISS Guido Carli Univ, Rome, Italy",Seoul National University (SNU); Luiss Guido Carli University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348; Mathews, John/0000-0002-4380-7563",,,,,35,24,27,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

To do so, we combine data on individual worker productivity from a firm's personnel records with information on each worker's social network of friends in the firm. We find that compared to when she has no social ties with her co-workers, a given worker's productivity is significantly higher when she works alongside friends who are more able than her, and significantly lower when she works with friends who are less able than her. As workers are paid piece rates based on individual productivity, social incentives can be quantified in monetary terms and are such that (i) workers who are more able than their friends are willing to exert less effort and forgo 10% of their earnings; (ii) workers who have at least one friend who is more able than themselves are willing to increase their effort and hence productivity by 10%. The distribution of worker ability is such that the net effect of social incentives on the firm's aggregate performance is positive. The results suggest that firms can exploit social incentives as an alternative to monetary incentives to motivate workers.","[Bandiera, Oriana] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Barankay, Iwan] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Rasul, Imran] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Pennsylvania; University of London; University College London,"Bandiera, O (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,"Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1, RES-538-28-1001, RES-544-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,208,265,0,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Our findings suggest a close proximity between the evolution of capital flows and the observed fluctuations of Portuguese macroeconomic growth. TFP growth estimates based on growth accounting reveal, furthermore, a very disappointing performance of the Portuguese economy during the period under study, with an average annual rate of TFP growth of 0.8% being observed. Performance varies across industries, but the bulk of activities show very modest rates of TFP growth.","Univ Porto, Fac Letras ISFLUP, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"da Silva, EG (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Letras ISFLUP, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",esilva@letras.up.pt,,"Silva, Ester/0000-0002-8358-3576",,,,,37,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,,,PORT ECON J,Port.

Investment in the monopolistic competition sector is determined by consumers' savings under uncertainty. Savings are always lower than their efficient levels in the presented economy. If consumers' preferences exhibit prudence, then an improvement of the underlying information system (in the sense of Blackwell 1953) leads to a decrease of expected savings. The social value of information may be negative in that case from an ex ante point of view. Better information may strengthen the market failure caused by imperfect competition.

The same cannot be said on the relationship between financial development and poverty reduction-an equally important aspect. In this study, we visit the theoretical arguments and conduct an empirical analysis of the relationship between the capital account dimension of financial liberalisation and poverty for developing countries for the period 1985-2005. In particular, we employ the 'system GMM' technique to test whether capital account liberalisation has helped alleviate poverty, and also whether the extent to which capital account liberalisation affects poverty depends on the quality of institutions. We also use OLS and IV techniques to verify our findings. Our findings indicate that there is no statistically significant relationship between the degree of capital account liberalisation during the period and the poverty rate. Developing countries with higher institutional quality have lower poverty rates, but the effect has low statistical significance. A higher degree of capital account liberalisation is associated with a lower income share for the poor.","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Arestis, Philip] Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ 5, Bilbao, Spain; [Caner, Asena] TOBB Econ & Technol Univ, Ankara, Turkey",University of Cambridge; University of Basque Country; TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",pa267@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,30,31,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Since Spain joined the European Monetary Union (EMU), two main important factors behind the housing boom appear to be the decrease of nominal interest rates due to the disappearance of currency risk premia, and demographic factors related to immigration and changing patterns in household composition. In order to assess the importance of these and other factors, in this paper we estimate a New Keynesian model of a currency area with durable goods, using data for Spain and the rest of the EMU. We find that parameter estimates are similar to the ones estimated in the literature, in that, in particular, durable goods prices are more flexible than nondurable consumption goods. We find that housing demand and technology shocks are the main driver of the recent housing boom. Finally, we examine the role of different rigidities suggested in the literature to help the model fit the data. We find that labor market frictions, that in the model imply costly labor reallocation across sectors, are crucial to explain main features of the data. On the other hand, financial frictions that impose a collateral constraint on borrowing do not appear to be relevant.","[Aspachs-Bracons, Oriol] Caixa Estalvis & Pens Barcelona, Res Dept, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Rabanal, Pau] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Aspachs-Bracons, O (通讯作者)，Caixa Estalvis & Pens Barcelona, Res Dept, Avinguda Diagonal 621-629, Barcelona 08028, Spain.",oaspachs@lacaixa.es; prabanal@imf.org,,,,,,,31,25,25,0,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

The effect of the threshold of criminal responsibility on the ability of voters to control politicians is non-monotonic.

Outsourcing reduces production costs but is associated with spillovers to foreign potential competitors. Spillovers over time increase productivity of firms in the foreign country and make them stronger competitors on the common market. The paper analyzes the inter-temporally optimal behavior of the firm and shows that two outcomes are possible in the long-run. One outcome is that there is one steady state where the firm invests a positive amount in the foreign country and the other outcome is a continuum of steady states with no investment. The paper then derives conditions such that it is optimal for the firm to invest in the foreign country and characterizes different types of optimal dynamic investment patterns. In addition, using numerical dynamic optimization methods, the effect of the speed of technology adoption and of the wage differential on total labor income in the home country is studied taking into account the transition dynamics.

The view taken in this paper holds that evaluating actual mergers' efficiency effects be similar in spirit to estimating causal treatment effects. By applying the matching framework we use a methodology that, given a rich enough dataset, is capable of resolving a twofold problem of empirical merger analysis: the missing data and the selection problem. A high-quality panel dataset of more than 800 Austrian universal banks covering the period from 1996 to 2002 allows us to estimate a logit selection model based on recent developments in dynamic merger analysis to explain the adoption of a merger strategy, and to apply various matching techniques to cope with the missing data and self-selection problem linked to the estimation of merger effects. The analysis provides evidence in favor of the view that horizontal mergers exert positive effects on bank performance, especially, in terms of improved cost performance. The findings also suggest that pre-merger effects are likely to occur in terms of lower costs immediately before the establishment of the merger.

Early on, the nature of labor market adjustment displayed a notable resemblance to that observed in past severe downturns. During the latter half of 2009, however, the path of adjustment exhibited important departures from that seen during and after prior deep recessions. Recent data point to two warning signs going forward. First, the record rise in long-term unemployment may yield a persistent residue of long-term unemployed workers with weak search effectiveness. Second, conventional estimates suggest that the extension of Emergency Unemployment Compensation may have led to a modest increase in unemployment. Despite these forces, we conclude that the problems facing the U.S. labor market are unlikely to be as severe as the European unemployment problem of the 1980s.","[Elsby, Michael W.

Our findings suggest that futures contracts on energy commodities are valuable to market participants with an interest in hedging against price fluctuations in energy markets by buy-and-hold strategies. However, this conclusion is reversed when one takes the perspective of traders whose core interests can be better approximated through the return to risk-bearing. In fact, this paper documents that return-to-risk maximizing agents are unlikely to profit from trading energy futures in addition to energy stocks. Moreover, futures for energy commodities fail to offer significant diversification gains with respect to energy stocks once investors adopt simple dynamic trading strategies that rely on readily available pricing information.

Our general objective is to model how feedback, competition and stochasticity (on the production side) interact in electricity markets, and eventually assess what their effects are on both the participants and the society. For this, day ahead electricity markets are modeled as dynamic closed loop systems, in which the feedback signal is the market price. In parallel, the Cournot competition model is considered. Mixed portfolios with significant share of renewable energy are based on stochastic threshold cost functions. Regarding trading strategies, it is assumed that generators are looking at optimizing their individual profits. The point of view of the society is addressed by analyzing market behavior and stability. The performed simulations show the beneficial effects of employing long term bidding strategies for both generators and society. Sensitivity analyses are performed in order to evaluate the effects of demand elasticity. It is shown that increase in demand elasticity reduces the possibility for the generators to exploit their market power. Furthermore, the results suggest that introduction of wind power generation in the market is beneficial both for the generators and the society. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our research goals are, first, to study what consequences the introduction of heterogeneous investment horizons has for agent-based financial market models, and second, how effective transaction taxes are in stabilizing financial markets. Numerical simulations reveal that under sufficiently small tax rates traders abstain from short-term trading in favour of longer investment horizons. This change in behavior leads to less volatility and less mispricings. When the tax rate exceeds a certain threshold, however, mispricings increase as also found in Westerhoff (Heterogeneous Traders and the Tobin Tax and The Use of Agent-Based Financial Market Models to Test the Effectiveness of Regulatory Policies). This emergent property is due to the fact that taxation reduces short-term fluctuations and causes longer lasting trends in the exchange rate. As a result, the longer term fundamentalist trading rule becomes unpopular in favor of the longer term trend-chasing rule.","[Demary, Markus] Cologne Inst Econ Res, D-50668 Cologne, Germany; [Demary, Markus] Univ Kiel, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Demary, M (通讯作者)，Cologne Inst Econ Res, Konrad Adenauer Ufer 21, D-50668 Cologne, Germany.",demary@iwkoeln.de,,,,,,,49,9,9,0,8,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,FEB 23,2010,4.0,,,,,,,,20108,,,,,44,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865AG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298282100001,0

Instead, recovering compliance expenses through usage insensitive charges could avoid causing unnecessary economic harm to consumers.","LECG, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",,"Danner, C (通讯作者)，LECG, 201 Mission St,Suite 800, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",cdanner@lecg.com,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Many economic scholars studying welfare arrangements refer to Say's law and insinuate a self-destructive welfare state. However, little is known about the empirical validity of these assumptions and hypotheses. We study the dynamic effect of different welfare arrangements on benefit fraud. In particular, we analyze the impact of the welfare state on the respective social norm, i.e. benefit morale. It turns out that a high level of public social expenditures and a high unemployment rate are associated with a small positive (or no) immediate impact on benefit morale, which however is (partly) crowded out by adverse medium and long run effects. In contrast to earlier studies we do not find that younger birth cohorts have lower values of benefit morale.","[Schneider, Friedrich G.] Univ Linz, IZA, CESifo & CREMA, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Lackner, M (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Altenbergerstr 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",mario.lackner@jku.at,,"Lackner, Mario/0000-0003-2134-2301; Halla, Martin/0000-0003-2651-3894",,,,,32,19,20,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2010,63.0,1,,,,,55,74,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00460.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,543UR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273604700004,0

Assuming a continuation in the upward trend for the public consumption to output ratio consistent with that observed for this variable between 1970 and 2004 for most developed economies, we find that the optimal tax system becomes more intensive in income taxation relative to consumption taxation, and that public disbursements become less intensive in public investment, which is consistent with the co-evolution of these ratios over the last 40 years.","[Marrero, Gustavo A.] Univ La Laguna, Fac Ciencias Econ, Dept Anal Econ, Tenerife, Spain; [Marrero, Gustavo A.] FEDEA, Madrid, Spain; [Marrero, Gustavo A.] CAERP, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna,"Marrero, GA (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Fac Ciencias Econ, Dept Anal Econ, Campus Guajara, Tenerife, Spain.",gmarrero@ull.es,"Marrero, Gustavo A./A-4745-2008","Marrero, Gustavo A./0000-0003-4030-0078",,,,,41,7,7,0,8,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

In a market-based financial system, banking and capital market developments are inseparable, and funding conditions are closely tied to the fluctuations in leverage of market-based financial intermediaries. Balance-sheet growth of market-based financial intermediaries provides a window on liquidity in the sense of the availability of credit, whereas financial crises tend to be associated with contractions of balance sheets.

Additionally we look at the effect of 'profiling' and biased reporting. If police single out or profile a group for more investigation, then crime in the profiled group decreases. If a certain group is reported on more frequently through biased reporting by citizens, crime in the group reported on actually increases. In the second model, we consider a neighbourhood structure where individuals get information on possible criminal activity by neighbours on one side and decide whether to report or not based on the signal. When costs of reporting are low relative to the cost of being investigated, the costs of investigation increase in the number of reports and there is at least one biased individual. We show there is a 'contagion equilibrium' where everyone reports his or her neighbour.","[Bandyopadhyay, Siddhartha] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Chatterjee, Kalyan] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",University of Birmingham; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Bandyopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",s.bandyopadhyay@bham.ac.uk; kchatterjee@psu.edu,,"Bandyopadhyay, Siddhartha/0000-0002-6771-7327",,,,,24,2,2,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

This argument is underpinned by empirical evidence documenting substantial dispersion in the marginal products of resources, particularly capital, in developing countries. But why does misallocation persists? That is, why don't distortions disappear on their own? This is particularly true for capital misallocation, a point we illustrate in a simple model of capital accumulation with credit constraints. We distinguish between misallocation on the intensive and the extensive margin, and show that the former should disappear asymptotically under general conditions, while the latter may persist. We conclude by discussing possible theories of persistent misallocation.

Recently, the shift to inflation targeting and a freely floating exchange rate has brought about an even more volatile exchange rate. We examine the causal link between export performance and exchange rate volatility across different monetary policy regimes within the cointegrated Vector Autoregression (VAR) framework using the implied conditional variance from a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model as a measure of volatility. Although treating the volatility measure as either a stationary or a nonstationary variable in the VAR, we are not able to find any evidence suggesting that export performance has been significantly affected by exchange rate uncertainty. We find, however, that volatility changes proxied by blip dummies related to the monetary policy change from a fixed to a managed floating exchange rate and the Asian financial crises during the 1990s enter significantly in a dynamic model for export growth-in which the level of relative prices and world market demand together with the level of exports constitute a significant cointegration relationship. A forecasting exercise on the dynamic model rejects the hypothesis that increased exchange rate volatility in the wake of inflation targeting in the monetary policy has had a significant impact on export performance.","[Boug, Pal] Stat Norway, Res Dept, NO-0033 Oslo, Norway; [Fagereng, Andreas] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy",Statistics Norway; European University Institute,"Boug, P (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, NO-0033 Oslo, Norway.",pal.boug@ssb.no,,"Boug, Pal/0000-0003-3809-982X; Fagereng, Andreas/0000-0002-0427-9737",,,,,52,28,29,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

There are two types of capital one of which is specific to the primary export sector while the other moves freely among the different sectors. Inflows of foreign capital of either type unambiguously improve the economic conditions of the unskilled working class.

Given the theoretical possibility of non-linear equilibrium due to downward real wage rigidity we employ econometric tests that allow for the presence of non-linearities in the long-run equilibrium. We adopt the notion of 'hidden co-integration' suggested by Granger and Yoon. This methodology has several advantages with respect to other non-linear models.

The chosen reference year is 2007 - the last year for which such statistical recordings were available. The second chapter examines some of the Romanian economy's structural features revealed by the matrices A and (l-A)-1, insisting on the driving effects of interdependencies (direct and indirect) generated by cross-sector productive flows. The third chapter focuses on the impact of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) upon the output. On the one hand, the implications of changes in volume are estimated (for example, data on 2007 are recalculated for a variation of +1-5% in the GFCF). On the other hand, the influence of the sectoral structure of the indicator in question is quantified with the help of three different macroeconomic simulations.

We employ the relatively recent 'optimal approximation' band pass filter developed by Christiano and Fitzgerald (2003) in order to identify a Eurozone business cycle. We also utilize two alternative assumptions regarding the behaviour of the trend component of Euro area real GDP. The empirical results suggest that the single currency experiment appears to have reduced trend growth in the Eurozone, both ex ante during the Maastricht nominal convergence phase, and also ex post, during the period 2001Q1 to 2006Q1. With respect to cyclical behaviour, we identify a very robust measure of the Eurozone business cycle in the post-1994 period which does not appear to be sensitive to the particular assumption made regarding the trend rate of growth of real GDP.","[Drake, Leigh] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Mills, Terence C.] Univ Loughborough, Dept Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",University of Nottingham; Loughborough University,"Drake, L (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Jubilee Campus,Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",leigh.drake@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,10,9,10,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A large amount of literature therefore focuses on nonlinear forecasting models, such as Markov switching models, which only indirectly capture the relation with turning points. This article investigates a direct approach to using information on turning points from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) chronology to model and forecast macroeconomic data. Our Qual VAR model includes a truncated normal latent business cycle index that is negative during NBER recessions and positive during expansions. We motivate our forecasting exercise by demonstrating that if starting from a linear specification, a truncated normal variable is an omitted variable, then forecasts of the remaining variables will become nonlinear functions of their own past. We apply the Qual VAR model to recursive out-of-sample forecasting and find that the Qual VAR improves on out-of-sample forecasts from a standard VAR.","[Dueker, Michael] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63166 USA; [Assenmacher-Wesche, Katrin] Swiss Natl Bank, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Swiss National Bank (SNB),"Dueker, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, POB 442, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",mdueker@stls.frb.org,,"Assenmacher, Katrin/0000-0002-2812-5521",,,,,20,11,12,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Problems in defining the competence of a company are predetermined by the fragmentary pattern of research and the lack of interdisciplinary approach: competence as the universal topic is studied in many academic fields (Gao, Li, & Clarke, 2008). Besides, competence is independently studied by representatives of different disciplines as well as different science trends, each of them putting accents according to their scientific interests. Thus, the answer to the question What is competence and what it is not? is not as simple and clear as it may seem at first sight. The lack of clear and standardized terms stops further research in this field of competence measurement, management, etc. The paper analyses the term of a core competence and its interpretations in an audit discipline. The content of competence needs top-level executives, profiles of their strategic consultation, organisational training faces with respective corrections. In other words, classic strategic management is certainly not disproved; just all of its fields should be verified and modelled through the prism of risk and crisis management (Banyte, 2008). Framework for International Education Statements (FIES) allows looking at the audit risk in terms of competence assessment, that is, creates preconditions for competence assessment and improvement of theoretical fundamentals of the audit risk management algorithm (Staliuniene, 2009). On the basis of such fundamentals, the concept of competence is defined, standards of universally accepted good practice are determined in the fields of training and refresher courses of professional accountants and auditors as well as the requirements for the competence of audit professionals. The standard mentioned explains the concept of competence as the demonstrated ability to perform relevant roles or tasks to the required standard. Competence may be assessed by a variety of means, including workplace performance, workplace simulations, written and Oral tests of various types, and self-assessment. Such assessment will give just an episodic conclusion but will not ensure competitive advantage, which only proves the status of audit as a knowledge-intensive organisation (Rajala & Westerlund, 2005, Muller & Doloreux, 2007, Staliuniene, 2009). The question is how to determine what competences are in order in particular situation in audit business while trying to match expatiations of customers, effectively using available resources and gaining the benefits of external opportunities. This study aims to conceptualize the core competencies ranking model. The model presented and verified in this paper is based on integration of BSC to ERM (COSO) models. Results of the research let us maintain that the audit organisations should pay more attention to the immediate pursuit of the core competences. Acceptance and continuance of the relationship with the customer remain the core competence.","[Gimzauskiene, Edita; Staliuniene, Jolanta Dalia] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Gimzauskiene, E (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",edita.gimzauskiene@ktu.lt; jolanta.staliuniene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,27,3,5,1,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Brand switching data can be presented as a square table that displays customer purchases on two different, usually contiguous occasions. For market-policy makers, such a square table can be used for at least three purposes: examining substitution patterns brands; consumer loyalty and customer retention; forecasting losses and gains of each brand (Colombo eta!, 2000). This paper aims to explore the meaning of brand switching matrices through Social Network Analysis (SNA) to understand the impacts of customers purchasing behaviors. Brand switching analysis also can be regarded as indicators of consumer satisfaction in a competitive market. In short, SNA is a boad intellectual approach, which views social systems as networks of relations between social actors (brands respectively in this paper). It is its contention for attitudes, strategies and behaviors of the brands of a market structural system are affected by their relations to other brands, by the positions they hold within the whole market of switching relations as well as by its characteristics and structure. For the research purposes mentioned above, SNA, in this paper, is intentionally used as a proper method and makes sense in brand switching data. This paper proves the following contributions: (1) it provides a more sophisticated analysis of the brand switching data using techniques already been used in other fields, and (2) it is to understand the pattern of interrelations among brands existing in the market. Marketing managers and researchers should be attracted to the idea that this is a way of working out better explanations for brand switching data.","[Ho, Chia-Hui] Far E Univ, Dept Tourism Management, Taipei, Taiwan",,"Ho, CH (通讯作者)，49 Chung Hua Rd, Hsin Shih 744, Tainan County, Taiwan.",chia@cc.feu.edu.tw,,,,,,,30,1,1,2,8,NATIONAL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

The results indicate a negative association between underpricing and the length of lockup, supporting our signalling hypothesis that IPO firms and underwriters employ underpricing and lockup duration in a substituted way to signal the firm quality.

The results of the study reveal that financial development as measured by broad money (M2), international trade and real income growth are cointegrated; thus, a long-run equilibrium relationship can be inferred among these three variables. On the other hand, Granger causality test results suggest that in Cyprus the growth in real income stimulates the growth of international trade (both exports and imports) and the growth of money supply. Furthermore, growth in imports of goods and services also stimulates a growth in exports of goods and services of Cyprus. Although this result contradicts our initial expectations, it indicates the importance of capital inflows in Cyprus that plays a major role in financing the investments mainly in the tourism sector. As a final point, the results of this study reveal that the supply-leading, export-led growth and import-led growth hypotheses are not confirmed by this study whereas the demand-following hypothesis can be justified for the Cypriot economy when M2 measure of money supply is under consideration.","[Jenkins, Hatice Pehlivan; Katircioglu, Salih Turan] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Katircioglu, ST (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, POB 95, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey.",salih.katircioglu@emu.edu.tr,"Katircioglu, Salih T./H-3494-2016",,,,,,43,49,52,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper, we report on a step contest that we carried out at a large Swedish workplace in order to test whether competition for symbolic awards can be used to promote physical exercise. Each individual was equipped with a pedometer and registered the number of steps daily during a four week period. Participants competed both in teams and individually and the winning team and individual received symbolic prizes. To evaluate the effect of the competition, we randomized teams into a control group and two treatment groups. We found that the step contest significantly increased both the fraction of subjects that completed the step contest and the number of steps. The number of steps was about 1,000 steps higher in the main treatment group than in the control group (an increase by about 10 percent). This is a conservative estimate as the dropouts on average walked fewer steps than individuals completing the study. In an additional treatment, we also included a daily step goal in the contest. The step goal had no additional significant effect on the number of steps, which may be due to the relatively low step goal used (7,000 steps per day).","[Johannesson, Magnus; Ranehill, Eva] Stockholm Sch Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics,"Johannesson, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",magnus.johannesson@hhs.se; robert.ostling@iies.su.se; eva.ranehill@hhs.se,"Johannesson, Magnus/E-9680-2011; Ranehill, Eva/JVO-4435-2024","Johannesson, Magnus/0000-0001-8759-6393; Ostling, Robert/0000-0002-5099-2584",,,,,52,13,13,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Using the US patents of the two firms as a basis, this paper finds that in terms of the quantity of patents, Samsung Electronics' catch-up with Sony happened around the mid-1990s, and in terms of the quality of patents, Samsung Electronics' catch-up occurred earlier, at the beginning of the 1990s. In addition, Samsung Electronics has come to be more independent from Sony, proving that Samsung Electronics has gone beyond simply imitating and applying Sony's technology. This paper also analyzes the other aspects of catch-up, namely the generality and the originality of the knowledge base, technology cycle and appropriability. Samsung Electronics caught up with Sony in terms of sales, corporate value and brand value only after the 2000s. Our study shows that technological catch-up precedes the catch-up in other dimensions. This implies that technological catch-up sets the stage for value- and brand-value-based catch-up.","[Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Joo, Si Hyung] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program TEMEP, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",kenneth@snu.ac.kr,"Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348",,,,,34,27,29,1,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The minimum rate is a mark-up over an exogenous foreign interest rate, marginal transaction costs, and a risk premium. In order to present its case, the paper utilizes and extends the oligopoly model of the banking firm.

We found that ATMs do not have any influence on the ROA of Japanese banks; however, it was revealed that ATMs had positive effects on fees and commissions (income) from 2000 to 2003, and positive effects of ATMs on interest income were also seen recently. We conclude that in Japan, ATMs do not influence ROA, which includes the overall profits of bank transactions, but do contribute to particular businesses in that they can make the most of their abilities.","Aichi Gakuin Univ, Fac Business & Commerce, Aichi 4700195, Japan",Aichi Gakuin University,"Kondo, K (通讯作者)，Aichi Gakuin Univ, Fac Business & Commerce, Aichi 4700195, Japan.",kondo@dpc.aichi-gakuin.ac.jp,,,,,,,10,8,10,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Unlike many previous studies dealing mostly with a tourism destination image concept, the approach employed in this paper proposes a more comprehensive measure of destination image and includes the dimensions of tourism destination awareness, quality, and loyalty The theoretically proposed model was empirically verified for two competitive European tourism destinations (Slovenia and Austria) from the perspective of two culturally heterogeneous tourist markets (Germans and Croatians). The results imply that the traditionally investigated image concept represents the most important dimension in a destination's evaluation. However, for a more comprehensive evaluation the dimensions of tourism destination awareness, quality and loyalty should be added. Drawing on the results, the paper also offers some implications for tourism organizations in developing and implementing destination marketing strategies in foreign markets.","Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Konecnik Ruzzier, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",maja.konecnik@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,50,15,21,2,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We analyze the investment decision in the presence of adjustment costs of two types, i.e., capital adjustment costs (CAC) and investment adjustment costs (IAC). We compare the investment and trade patterns with adjustment costs against those of a model without adjustment costs and with (quasi-) flexible prices. We show that having adjustment costs results into more volatile consumption and net exports series, and less volatile investment. We document three important facts on US trade dynamics: (1) the S-shaped cross-correlation between real GDP and the real net exports share, (2) the J-curve between terms of trade and net exports, and (3) the weak and S-shaped cross-correlation between real GDP and terms of trade. We find that adding adjustment costs tends to reduce the model's ability to match these stylized facts.

Liquidity management should also contribute to realization of this fundamental aim. Many of the current asset management models that are found in financial management literature assume book profit maximization as the basic financial purpose. These book profit-based models could be lacking in what relates to another aim (i.e., maximization of enterprise value). The corporate value creation strategy is executed with a focus on risk and uncertainty. Firms hold cash for a variety of reasons. Generally, cash balances held in a firm can be called considered, precautionary, speculative, transactional and intentional. The first are the result of management anxieties. Managers fear the negative part of the risk and hold cash to hedge against it. Second, cash balances are held to use chances that are created by the positive part of the risk equation. Next, cash balances are the result of the operating needs of the firm. In this article, we analyze the relation between these types of cash balances and risk. This article presents the discussion about relations between firm's net working investment policy and as result operating cash balances and firm's value. This article also contains propositions for marking levels of precautionary cash balances and speculative cash balances. Application of these propositions should help managers to make better decisions to maximize the value of a firm.","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Corp Finance & Value Management, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Michalski, G (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Corp Finance & Value Management, Ul Komandorska 118-120,Pok 1-Z KFPiZW, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",Grzegorz.Michalski@ue.wroc.pl,"Michalski, Grzegorz/A-4771-2010","Michalski, Grzegorz/0000-0002-8211-4057",,,,,20,19,19,0,20,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

I employ rolling regressions and the Kalman (1960) filler to calculate time-varying regression coefficients relating previously identified structural shocks in NMSs and the European Monetary, Union. In general, the results show no evidence of convergence and therefore imply limited merits of accession. Additionally, they suggest that the catching-up process hi NMSs is slowing down.","Wabash Coll, Dept Econ, Crawfordsville, IN 47933 USA",,"Mikek, P (通讯作者)，Wabash Coll, Dept Econ, Crawfordsville, IN 47933 USA.",,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

This would allow the parking standards to be applied also to the land use management in accordance with accessibility to the urban zones by means of travel other than by car. This implies that in the course of producing vehicle parking standards the level of parking restrictions is to be defined depending on the Public Transport Accessibility Level. If Public Transport Accessibility Level of a zone the subject development belongs to is high, the number of parking spaces to be provided is restricted and customers are encouraged to shift to alternative transport modes. Thus defined parking standards assist in the development of sustainable transport system.

What is not widely known, though, is that there was at least one giant and wildly speculative investment episode that was successful in that it produced above-market profits for original investors. The British railway mania of the 1830s involved real capital investment comparable, as a fraction of GDP, to about $2 trillion for the U. S. today. It faced withering skepticism and criticism, much of it very reasonable, as its supposedly rosy prospects were based on extrapolation from the brief experience of just a couple of successful early railways. Yet by the mid-1840s, it was seen as a success. The example of the railway mania of the 1830s serves as a useful antidote to claims that bubbles are easy to detect or that all large and quick jumps in asset valuations are irrational. This episode also suggests the need to reexamine much of the work on business cycles and the diffusion of technologies. The standard literature in this area, starting from Juglar and continuing through Schumpeter to more recent authors, almost uniformly ignores large investment mania, whose nature does not fit the stereotypical pattern.","Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Odlyzko, A (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",odlyzko@umn.edu,,,,,,,40,6,6,0,6,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The declining shares of African agriculture in GDP, total exports and employment constitute evidence of stagnation. Its growth and transformation are affected by key elements of the world trade order; such as agricultural domestic supports, export subsidies and non-tariff barriers of the OECD countries, emerging global system of intellectual property protection and the increasing corporate concentration of the international markets for agricultural products. Only the negotiations on the elimination of agricultural export subsidies have made relatively more progress at the Doha Development Round of multilateral trade negotiations, while African negotiators cannot significantly alter current world opinion regarding global intellectual property protection system. Therefore, the solution of the former issues lies in investing significant negotiating capital while adaptation and adjustment would resolve the latter. Hence, Africa must find innovative ways of enhancing its agricultural research and technology capacity by creating suitable linkages with the global system. Finally, though the problems related to non-competitive business practices can be resolved at the international level through appropriate forum, African countries should seek a deeper understanding of the issues as a basis for articulating the way forward.","Univ Ibadan, Dept Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria",University of Ibadan,"Oyejide, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Ibadan, Dept Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria.",adeoyejide@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The total quantities offered by firms at Nash equilibria within this model and those of the market demand curve at the same price levels are not equal. All emanate from the misspecification of the price equation with substitutable goods by Spence which is not appropriate for the Nash equilibria model with many firms.

The dynamic for a distribution of strategies is also derived, which we show can be written in a form similar to a positive definite dynamic. The asymptotic Solution (in the ultra long run) is discussed for 2-player, 2-strategy coordination and anti-coordination games, and we show convergence to Nash equilibrium in both cases. The second, and better, approximation is in the form of a diffusion equation. This is considerably more difficult to analyze. However, we derive a formal solution and show that it leads to the same asymptotic limit for the distribution of strategies as the 1st-order approximation for 2-player, 2-strategy anti-coordination games.

The basic hypothesis tested is that if order flow reflects heterogeneous expectations about macroeconomic fundamentals, and currency markets learn about the state of the economy gradually, then order flow can have both explanatory and forecasting power for exchange rates. Using one year of high frequency data collected via a live feed from Reuters for three major exchange rates, we find that: i) order flow is intimately related to a broad set of current and expected macroeconomic fundamentals; ii) more importantly, order flow is a powerful predictor of daily movements in exchange rates in an out-of-sample exercise, on the basis of economic value criteria such as Sharpe ratios and performance fees implied by utility calculations.

Supporters join the terrorist group if they gain more from their participation than from their economic opportunities. Preemptive measures by the government can result in a backlash that encourages recruitment through new grievances. Suicide attacks can also lead to recruitment. Increases in preemption costs and/or economic opportunities can reduce the overall level of terrorism, while increasing the proportion of suicide to normal attacks. An increase in the effect of preemption on recruitment, or the propaganda effect of suicide bombings has the opposite effect of increasing normal and suicide attacks, but decreasing the proportion of suicide to normal attacks in the terrorist organization's strategy profile.","[Sandler, Todd] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Rosendorff, B.

We collect data that parallel those used in Edlin and Karaca-Mandic and apply their empirical method to gain further insights about the accident externality. Consistent with Edlin and Karaca-Mandic, we find larger external costs for higher density roads, although the sizes largely depend on the variable definition and the model specification. One intriguing result is that per-vehicle external costs are considerably smaller in Japan than those in the U.S. In Kyoto, for example, an additional driver increases accident costs for other drivers by $248--$802, while it is $1,725--$2,432 in California where the traffic density is approximately the same. However, on a per-mile basis, much closer externalities are obtained. This finding indicates that the large externality in high-density roads underscored in Edlin and Karaca-Mandic is partly attributed to the fact that U.S. drivers drive longer distances, comparatively speaking.","[Saito, Kuniyoshi] Tezukayama Gakuin Univ, Nara, Japan; [Kato, Takaaki] Univ Kitakyushu, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan; [Shimane, Tetsuya] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan",University of Kitakyushu; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Saito, K (通讯作者)，Tezukayama Gakuin Univ, Nara, Japan.",kuniyoshi.saito@gmail.com; tkato@env.kitakyu-u.ac.jp; shimane@soc.titech.ac.jp,"Saito, Kuniyoshi/AAM-7800-2020; Kato, Takaaki/GYQ-8453-2022","Kato, Takaaki/0000-0002-7095-5676; Saito, Kuniyoshi/0000-0002-2787-9540",,,,,32,5,6,0,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The importance of this agreement and the elaboration of a climate change policy make it necessary to define and establish national policy measures and to bring into force environmental regulations that will reduce GHG emissions. Extending our knowledge of the economic-ecologic relationships that exist within the production sphere can assist in defining and implementing successful environmental policies. In this paper, an Environmental/Input-Output linear programming model is proposed. To develop the model we consider the input-output model as a linear programming problem combining two types of restrictions: environmental restrictions establishing GHG emission targets, and economic restrictions. The model shows how targets for the emissions of GHGs may be reached and can affect production activity composition.","[San Cristobal, Jose Ramon] Univ Cantabria, Dept Marine Sci, Escuela Tecn Super Naut, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Cristóbal, JRS (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Marine Sci, Escuela Tecn Super Naut, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",jose.sancristobal@unican.es,,,,,,,30,19,26,7,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

We use policy-relevant NUTS 4 unemployment rates,for transition economies characterized by both relatively intense (Poland, Slovakia) and relatively mild labor market hardships (the Czech Republic). We apply diverse analytical techniques to seek traces of convergence, including and beta and sigma convergence as well as a time-series approach. The transition economies typically experienced rapid growth of unemployment rates due to profound restructuring. Naturally, these processes affected local labor markets asymmetrically, as regions were diversified with respect to industry composition and economic outlooks. The results in each of the countries suggest that diverging unemployment rates seem nested in the data. Further, regions with both very high and very and low unemployment show signs of high persistence and low mobility in the national distribution. The findings allow its to define the patterns of local labor market dynamics, pointing out differentiated divergence paths. These tendencies persist despite cohesion policy financing schemes, which allocate relatively more. resources to deprived regions in all these countries.","[Tyrowicz, Joanna; Wojcik, Piotr] Univ Warsaw, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Tyrowicz, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,"Tyrowicz, Joanna/I-3270-2019; Wójcik, Piotr/E-8094-2015; Wójcik, Piotr/R-5395-2019","Tyrowicz, Joanna/0000-0002-5928-332X; Wójcik, Piotr/0000-0003-1853-8784",,,,,29,2,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

The fall in trade costs results in investment diversion from the U.S. and Canada, yet lower fixed costs may increase FDI even in those countries via an increased incentive to locate production facilities abroad rather than only domestically.

We design an environment similar to the one that payday loan customers face and then conduct a laboratory experiment to examine what effect, if any, the existence of payday loans has on individuals' abilities to manage and to survive financial setbacks. Our primary objective is to examine whether access to payday loans improves or worsens the likelihood of financial survival in our experiment. We also test the degree to which people's use of payday loans affects their ability to survive financially. We find that payday loans help the subjects to absorb expenditure shocks and therefore survive financially. However, subjects whose demand for payday loans exceeds a certain threshold level are at a greater risk than a corresponding subject in the treatment in which payday loans do not exist.","[Wilson, Bart J.] Chapman Univ, Econ Sci Inst, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Findlay, David W.; Meehan, James W., Jr.] Colby Coll, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Schurter, Karl] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA",Chapman University System; Chapman University; Colby College; University of Virginia,"Wilson, BJ (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Econ Sci Inst, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",bjwilson@chapman.edu; dwfindla@colby.edu; jwmeehan@colby.edu; charissawellford@yahoo.com; kes3u@virginia.edu,,"Wilson, Bart/0000-0001-5770-0102",,,,,48,8,11,2,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We develop a continuous-time model wherein a firm is endowed with a perpetual option to invest in a project at any time by incurring a partially reversible investment cost at that instant. The amount of the investment cost is directly related to the intensity of investment that is endogenously chosen by the firm at the instant when the investment option is exercised. We show that higher irreversibility of investment induces the firm to raise its optimal investment trigger, thereby deferring the undertaking of the project. Furthermore, we show that changes in irreversibility of investment have no impact on the firm's optimal investment intensity due to two opposing effects that exactly offset each other. Finally, we show that higher irreversibility of investment reduces the value of the investment option and, therefore, makes the firm less valuable. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Since its inception, the Chinese IPO market has transformed from a tightly-controlled system to a more market-oriented system,. Reforms include the abolishment of listing quotas and fixed issue price determination: allowing for more market participation in IPO pricing. The regulatory changes of Chinese IPO market, though improving over time, actually are not monotonic. The regulatory framework started from over-restrictive to over-unrestrictive. then fine-tuned with additional restrictions. This study documents the regulatory reforms during the sample period and investigates how these regulatory changes affect IPO underpricing in China. During this period, we find that Chinese IPOs exhibit a huge underpricing. The size of the Underpricing. however, decreases over the sample period. This study further finds that the IPO pricing method before the regulatory changes, which was based on a fixed P/E ratio pre-determined by the regulators, contributed significantly to the IPO underpricing in China. After adopting a series of regulatory reforms allowing underwriters discretion in the determination of issue price, this regulatory Underpricing component vanishes. This study has policy implications in demonstrating the impacts of regulatory frameworks oil IPO Underpricing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Academics and the official sector had been promoting CACs at least since 1995, yet market practice did not begin to change until 2003. This delay is often attributed to the opposition of investors and sovereign borrowers to CACs. This paper evaluates the publicly stated as well as the suspected private motives of the two sides to block the proliferation of CACs. It draws on a wide range of existing evidence and adds some new theoretical considerations to show that there is no reason to be sceptical of CACs unless bailouts exist as an alternative crisis resolution mechanism. This conclusion may be of interest purely for the sake of historical accuracy. But more importantly, it may help to better understand any potential future resistance by market participants, for example in the process of introducing CACs in bonds governed by German law.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Häseler, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, Hamburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,58,14,14,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0950-0804,,,J ECON SURV,J.

Numerous researchers have found diverse results concerning environmental pollution loadings and an augmented national income of trade's effect on factor productivity and economic growth. However there is a minimal amount of examination on trade's potential role and influence on pollution loadings, which has caused controversy and postulation. This essay differs from previous research in two areas. First, it includes the variable intra-industry trade to continuing discussion on trade and environmental pollution loadings. Second, it explores a straightforward empirical investigation of variations in chosen environmental pollution loadings with intra-industry trade for Korea-Philippines and Korea-Singapore relations via total trade and industrial level data. For the environmental pollution indicator, CO2 was utilized, while intra-industry trade, foreign direct investment, and income were applied for the explanatory variables. The regression results were mostly consistent with prior expectations. However, regression analysis showed somewhat unsatisfactory results for the intra-industry variable because the series of data were not long enough. Lack of detailed information and statistical significance with foreign direct investment and income variables was also a factor. The regression results showed a positive intra-industry effect on Korea's and the Philippines' environmental pollution loading as a result of Korea-Philippines trade, and income negatively affected Korea's environmental pollution loading and positively affected Singapore's in Korea-Singapore trade.","[Jung, Moon Hyun] Seowon Univ, Dept Int Trade, Cheongju, South Korea; [Eun, Woong] Hannam Univ, Dept Global Trade, Taejon, South Korea",Seowon University; Hannam University,"Jung, MH (通讯作者)，Seowon Univ, Dept Int Trade, Cheongju, South Korea.",slnkq@hnu.kr; mhjung@seowon.ac.kr,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

This paper considers the pass through of oil prices into consumer liquid (i.e. petrol, diesel and heating) fuel prices in such an environment. The pass through of oil prices into consumer liquid fuel prices has already been addressed extensively in the literature. Nonetheless much of this literature has either focused on the United States or on a time period when oil prices were relatively stable. or has used monthly data. The main contribution of this paper is a comprehensive combination of many features that have been considered before but rarely jointly. These features include: (I) the analysis of the euro area as an aggregate and a large number of countries (the initial 12 member states): (2) the consideration of different time periods: (3) the modelling of the data in raw levels rather than in log levels. This turns out to have important implications for our findings: (4) the use of high frequency (weekly) data, which, as results will suggest, are the lowest frequency one should consider: (5) the investigation of the different stages of the production chain from crude oil prices to retail distribution - refining costs and margins, distribution and retailing costs and margins: (6) the examination of prices including and excluding taxes - excise and value-added; (7) the modelling of prices for three fuel types - passenger car petrol and diesel separately and home heating fuel oil; (8) lastly we also address the issue of possible asymmetries, allowing for the pass through to vary according to (a) whether price are increasing or decreasing and (b) whether price levels are above or below their equilibrium level. The main findings are as follows: First, as distribution and retailing costs and margins have been broadly stable on average, the modelling of the relationship between consumer prices excluding taxes and upstream prices in raw levels rather than in logarithms has important implications for the stability of estimates of pass through when oil price levels rise significantly. Second, considering spot prices for refined prices improves significantly the fit of the estimated models relative to using crude oil prices. It also results in more economically meaningful results concerning the extent of pass through. Third, oil price pass through Occurs quickly, with 90% occurring within three to five weeks. Fourth, using a relatively broad specification allowing for asymmetry in the pass through from upstream to downstream prices, there is little evidence of statistically significant asymmetries. Furthermore, even where asymmetry is found to be statistically significant, it is generally not economically significant. Lastly, these results generally hold across most euro area countries with few exceptions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, resale may reduce the seller's revenue. In a simple model with complete information, however, allowing resale and bundling the objects on sale are complement strategies for the seller (under reasonable conditions)-by bundling and allowing resale the seller earns a higher revenue than by selling the objects separately and/or forbidding resale. We also show why allowing resale may reduce efficiency. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed formula applies to the intersection of two different sets, one of which is bounded by the availability of purchasing power, while the other is bounded by the availability of leisure time. The necessity of considering both kinds of constraints stems from a definition of choice freedom in terms of capability to do rather than capability to have. A natural measure should be one that numbers all possible choice bundles making up an opportunity set.

The development of evolutionary game theory has provided an equilibrium concept more directly connected with adjustment dynamics, and the evolutionary stability of the equilibria of the Cournot game have been extensively studied in the literature. Several articles show that the Walrasian equilibrium is the stable ESS of the Cournot game. But no general result has been established for the difficult case of simultaneous heterogenous mutations. Authors propose specific selection dynamics to analyze this case. Vriend (2000) proposes using a genetic algorithm for studying learning dynamics in this game and obtains convergence to Cournot equilibrium with individual learning. The resulting convergence has been questioned by Arifovic and Maschek (2006). The aim of this article is to clarify this controversy. It analyzes the mechanisms that are behind these contradictory results and underlines the specific role of the spite effect. We show why social learning gives rise to the Walrasian equilibrium and why, in a general setup, individual learning can effectively yield convergence to the Cournot equilibrium. We also illustrate these general results by systematic computational experiments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This market value of an installed worker, which I call Tobin's Q of a worker, is inversely proportional to the average quality of the match between employers and workers. Based on this measure, I find that the labour market friction rises during a period of productivity boom. This phenomenon is indirectly supported by the data where it is found that the relative value of a worker with respect to tangible capital shows a positive association with the total factor productivity. The model suggests that firms may be compromising the quality of a skill match during a period of tight labour market conditions.","Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Durham, England",Durham University,"Basu, P (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Durham, England.",parantap.basu@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

This holdout problem is a common feature of the land-assembly literature because development frequently requires the assembly of multiple parcels of land. We use experimental methods to examine holdout behavior in a laboratory bargaining game that involves multi-person groups, complementary exchanges, and holdout externalities. The results of six treatments that vary the bargaining institution, number of bargaining periods, and cost of delay demonstrate that holdout is common across institutions and is, on average, a payoff-improving strategy for responders. Both proposers and responders take a more aggressive initial bargaining stance in multi-period bargaining treatments relative to single-period treatments, but take a less aggressive bargaining stance when delay is costly. Nearly all exchanges eventually occur in our multi-period treatments, leading to higher overall efficiency relative to the single-period treatments, both with and without delay costs.","[Schmitt, Pamela; Swope, Kurtis] USN Acad, Dept Econ, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA; [Cadigan, John] Gettysburg Coll, Dept Econ, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA; [Shupp, Robert] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; United States Naval Academy; Gettysburg College; Michigan State University,"Schmitt, P (通讯作者)，USN Acad, Dept Econ, 589 McNair Rd, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA.",jcadigan@gettysburg.edu; pschmitt@usna.edu; shupprob@anr.msu.edu; swope@usna.edu,"Shupp, Robert/I-5635-2012",,,,,,31,23,24,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We conducted experiments which demonstrate that introducing a small amount of competition to a bilateral ultimatum game - by adding just one competitor - induces large behavioral changes among responders and proposers, causing large changes in accepted offers. Models that assume that all people are self-interested and fully rational do not adequately explain these changes. We show that a model which combines heterogeneous fairness concerns with decision errors correctly predicts the comparative static effects of changes in competition. Moreover, the combined model is remarkably good at predicting the entire distribution of offers in many different competitive situations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

On September 1997, a new childcare policy was initiated by the provincial government of Quebec, the second most populous province in Canada. Licensed and regulated providers of childcare services began offering day care spaces at the subsidized fee of $5/day/child for children aged 4. In successive years, the government reduced the age requirement, created new childcare facilities and spaces, and paid for the additional costs entailed by this low-fee policy. No such important policy changes for preschool (including kindergarten) children were enacted in the nine other Canadian provinces over the years 1997-2004. Using annual data drawn from Statistics Canada's Survey on Labour and Income Dynamics and a difference-in-differences quasi-experimental methodology, the paper estimates the dynamic labour supply effects of the program. The results demonstrate that the policy had long-term labour supply effects on mothers who benefited from the program when their child was less than 6. A striking feature of the results is that they are driven by changes in the labour supply of less educated mothers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, unemployment reduces the JJ turnover of male and female workers of all educational levels. There is a pro-cyclical response in the JNE transitions of the less-educated males and a counter-cyclical response in the JNE transitions of the less-educated females.

The results indicate that foreign ownership leads to significant productivity improvements in the acquired plants. The improvements become visible in the acquisition year and continue in subsequent periods. After three years, the acquired plants exhibit a 13.5% higher productivity than the control group. The rise in productivity is a result of restructuring, as acquired plants increase investment outlays, employment and wages.

This paper builds on the methodology proposed by Pesaran, Schuermann, and Weiner [Pesaran, M.H., Schuermann, 1, and Weiner, S.M., (2004), Modeling regional interdependencies using a global error correcting macroeconometric model, journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 22, 2, 129-169.] and supplemented by Pesaran, Schuermann.

S.M., (2006), Macroeconomic dynamics and credit risk: a global perspective, journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, Volume 38, Number 5, August 2006, 1211-1261.] which has made a significant advance in credit risk modelling in that it avoids the use of proprietary balance sheet and distance-to-default data, focusing on credit ratings which are more freely available. In this paper a country-specific macroeconometric risk-driver engine which is compatible with and could feed into the GVAR model and framework of PSW (2004) is constructed, using vector error-correcting (VECM) techniques. This allows conditional loss estimation of a South African-specific credit portfolio but also opens the door for credit portfolio modelling on a global scale, as such a model can easily be linked to the GVAR model. The set of domestic factors is extended beyond those used in PSW (2004) in such a way that the risk-driver model is applicable for both retail and corporate credit risk. As such, the model can be applied to a total bank balance sheet, incorporating the correlation and diversification between both retail and corporate credit exposures. Assuming statistical over-identification restrictions, the results indicate that it is possible to construct a South African component for the GVAR model that can easily be integrated into the global component. From a practical application perspective the framework and model is particularly appealing since it can be used as a theoretically consistent correlation model within a South African-specific credit portfolio management tool.

Evaluating the evidence from China,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Foreign investment; Pollution; Environmental regulation; China,DIRECT-INVESTMENT; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; POLLUTION; TRADE; LOCATION; ENFORCEMENT; INNOVATION; DIFFUSION; INFLOWS; POLICY,"At the center of the pollution haven debate is the claim that foreign investors from industrial countries are attracted to weak environment regulations in developing countries. Some recent location choice studies have found evidence of this attraction, but only for inward FDI in industrial countries. The few studies of inward FDI in developing countries have been hampered by weak measures of environmental stringency and by insufficient data to estimate variation in firm response by pollution intensity. This paper tests for pollution haven behavior by estimating the determinants of location choice for equity joint ventures (EJVs) in China. Beginning with a theoretical framework of firm production and abatement decisions, we derive and estimate a location choice model using data on a sample of EJV projects, Chinese effective levies on water pollution, and Chinese industrial pollution intensity. Results show EJVs in highly-polluting industries funded through Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are attracted by weak environmental standards. In contrast, EJVs funded from non-ethnically Chinese sources are not significantly attracted by weak standards, regardless of the pollution intensity of the industry. These findings are consistent with Pollution haven behavior, but not by investors from high income countries and only in industries that are highly polluting. Further investigation into differences in technology between industrial and developing country investors might shed new light on this debate.

Two alternative earnings surprise measures are used and they both provide strong post-earnings announcement drifts. In order to find an explanation for this anomaly we first make several unconditional adjustments, which include the CAPM, the Fama-French (J Financ Econ 33:3-56, 1993) three-factor model, a liquidity factor, controlling portfolios by size and book-to-market ratio, and controlling for the momentum effect. Second, we make a conditional analysis following two different approaches: (i) studying the relation with the business cycle and (ii) studying whether this phenomenon can be explained through a conditional version of the CAPM and the Fama-French model. None of these adjustments are able to satisfactorily capture the Spanish post-earnings announcement drift.

We show that past empirical evidence, which strongly supports the growth effect as the main driver of current account dynamics, is misconceived. The remarkable empirical success of the growth effect is driven by the dominance of the cross-sectional variation, which, under conditions met by the data, is generated by an accounting approximation. In contrast to previous findings that the portfolio share of net foreign assets to total assets is constant in a country, both our theoretical and empirical results support a highly persistent process or a unit-root process, with some countries displaying a trend. Finally, we reestablish the composition effect as the quantitatively dominant driving force of current account dynamics in the past data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The sharp rise in the amount of reserves held by many emerging markets since the mid-1990s can be traced to the rise in the globalization hazard that confronts emerging markets. A modest probability of globalization hazard ( sudden stop) can induce emerging markets to self-insure fully by hoarding international reserves, rather than relying on nonreserve alternatives of taking precautions.","Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",JLee3@imf.org,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Our method extends work in the field by incorporating randomness into the base load portion of the supply stack function and equating it with a noisy demand process. We obtain closed form solutions for European option prices written on average spot prices considering two different supply models: a mean-reverting model and a Markov chain model. The results are extensions of the classic Black-Scholes equation. The model provides a relatively simple approach to describe the complicated price behaviour observed in electricity spot markets and also allows for computationally efficient derivatives pricing.

We are using a firm-level panel data for the manufacturing sector in Tunisia to investigate whether adoption of ICT influences efficiency in factor use. The analysis is conducted through the use of a parametric method to measure technical efficiency. We estimate a stochastic production frontier and the relationship aims to explain technical efficiency differentials in a single stage as suggested by Battese and Coelli [Battesse, G.E, Coelli, T.J. ( 1995). A model for technical inefficiency in a stochastic frontier production function for panel data. Empirical Economics, 20, 325-332]. The results have confirmed the presence of positive returns to ICT capital. We have found that the impact of ICT on efficiency is strong. Our results also suggest that it is important to carefully control for human capital related characteristics of employment when studying the effect of ICT. The evidence shows that achieving benefits from investment in ICT requires complementary investments and changes in human capital. This means that the combined use of ICT and human capital in a firm would enhance its efficiency beyond the direct effects of these factors taken alone. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Quantile regression techniques are applied, allowing for more nuanced information. The key results are, firstly, that the pupil-teacher ratio is insignificant in explaining pass rates for schools below the 95th percentile of the school performance distribution. Secondly, the impact of resources on performance is not strong and, where there is a significant effect, it is highly dependent on the resource in question and the metric utilised for the dependent variable. Thirdly, knowledge infrastructure may be important to understand the absolute and relative performance of schools. Fourthly, proxy variables for teacher and parent characteristics are strongly significant, and the former should probably be a priority focus for any policy programme aimed at improving Grade 12 performance levels in South Africa.","[Bhorat, Haroon; Oosthuizen, Morne] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Dev Policy Res Unit, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Bhorat, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Dev Policy Res Unit, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.",haroon.bhorat@uct.ac.za,"Oosthuizen, Morne J/G-9870-2014","Oosthuizen, Morne J/0000-0002-2329-2953",,,,,25,13,18,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

R&D is always taxed in oligopolies for high degrees of product differentiation. For lower degrees of product differentiation the duopoly is subsidized or the government remains inactive. In contrast, the monopoly is always subsidized. The government with a duopoly may be active or inactive depending on the degree of product differentiation. Thus, we may observe a reversal in the sign of the optimal R&D policy if the degree of product differentiation changes or, alternatively, if there is a change in the number of firms. Similar qualitative results hold if trade policy uses output subsidies, instead of R&D promotion.","[Kujal, Praveen] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Ruiz, Juan M.] DG Int Affairs, Banco Espana, Madrid 28014, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Banco de Espana,"Kujal, P (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Calle Madrid 126, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",kujal@eco.uc3m.es; jruiz@bde.es,,,,,,,14,4,4,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Unlike previous research, our econometric methodology adopts the least squares dummy variable (LSDV) estimator and generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation. In addition, for our robustness check, we introduce time-varying country dummies to control for multilateral resistance, and country-pair fixed effect to control for unobserved bilateral heterogeneity. Several features deserve attention. First, the lagged dependent variable (1-period lag) is statistically significant; thus, we can admit the existence Of a persistence effect. Second, the coefficients on trade-creating effects in our LSVD and system GMM are likely to be upward biased Third, considering the coefficients on extra-bloc trade, the trade-diverting effect does not seem to constitute a significant drawback. Fourth, we can conclude that the natural trading partners for Korea appear to be the European Union (EU) and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Consequently, the volume of trade criterion is the most suitable candidate for identifying natural trading partners.","Kongju Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Kong Ju, South Korea",Kongju National University,"Lee, CW (通讯作者)，Kongju Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Kong Ju, South Korea.",cwhalee@kongju.ac.kr,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,11,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"RM 4503 WORLD TRADE CTR, 159-1 SAMSUNG-DONG,GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

J,"Thomsen, SL",,,,"Thomsen, Stephan L.",,,Explaining the Employability Gap of Short-Term and Long-Term Unemployed Persons,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DISCRIMINATION; EMPLOYMENT; SMOKING,"European countries provide a number of different active labor market policy programs to reduce the risk and the amount of long-term unemployment. Programs focus on particular sets of barriers to employment, such as lack of motivation (via sanctions), lack of job search skills (via job search assistance), lack of experience (via wage subsidies), or lack of marketable skills (via training programs). Numerous studies have been conducted to analyze the effectiveness of these activities. The results clarify that a number of programs are not very successful in reaching the intended goals. The major reason may be that the available programs do not (or do not fully) meet the needs of the unemployed. In this paper, differences in the employability between short-term and long-term unemployed persons are studied in order to reveal the crucial factors of job-finding chances. Analyzing the factors driving employment chances is a necessary step to shed light on the needs of job seekers and to derive recommendations for a (re-)arrangement of active labor market policy according to those needs. The empirical analysis is based on unique survey data of short-term and long-term unemployed persons merged with administrative data for Germany, including usually unavailable information. The results highlight three significant and important findings. First, differences in formal skills could only explain a small part of the employability gap between short-term and long-term unemployed persons. Hence, providing courses that aim at increasing skills of the individuals (at least in Germany) may reduce the employment gap, but the scope is limited. Second, differences in obstacles to employment - in particular care obligations - are relevant. If long-term unemployed persons were equal in characteristics to the short-term unemployed, the employability gap between both groups would clearly be narrower. Third, differences in the state of health, and in particular limitations in working ability, largely account for the employment gap. For this reason, policy makers should pay more attention to the last two findings when designing the placement process. The set of active labor market programs should be revised addressing these aspects in order to increase the employability of the participants.","[Thomsen, Stephan L.] Otto von Guericke Univ, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany; [Thomsen, Stephan L.] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany",Otto von Guericke University; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Thomsen, SL (通讯作者)，Otto von Guericke Univ, POB 4120, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany.",stephan.thomsen@ovgu.de,"Thomsen, Stephan/AAF-3588-2019","Thomsen, Stephan/0000-0002-9677-9199",,,,,36,12,12,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2009,62.0,3,,,,,448,478,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00445.x,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,469GJ,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267883700007,0

Our study employs the newly threshold error-correction model (TECM) elaborated by Enders and Granger [Enders, W., Granger, C.W.F., 1998. Unit-root tests and asymmetric adjustment with an example using the term structure of interest rates. Journal of Business Economics & Statistics 16, 304-311] and Enders and Siklos [Enders, W., Siklos, P.L., 2001. Cointegration and threshold adjustment. journal of Business Economics & Statistics 19, 166-176], assuming the nature of the relationship between the variables is on the basis of non-linearity. The empirical evidence suggests that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between NTD/JPY and the stock prices of Japan and Taiwan during the time period investigated. However, an asymmetric threshold cointegration relationship only exists in Taiwan's financial market. Furthermore, we extend our research by taking into account the effect of the U.S. exchange rate specifically on Taiwan's financial market. This research also finds a long-term equilibrium and asymmetric causal relationships between NTD/USD and the stock prices of Taiwan. In addition, the results of TECM Granger-Causality tests show that no short-run causal relationship exists between the two financial assets considered for both countries' cases. However, in the long run a positive causal relationship running from either the Japan or U.S. exchange rate to the stock prices of Taiwan strongly argues for the traditional approach.

We first identify a novel party competition effect in a setting with two opposing parties. Compared with at large selection of candidates, party selection makes office-holders more willing to avoid extreme ideological stands, and this benefits voters of all ideologies. We then allow for additional parties. With strategic voting, citizens benefit most when the only two parties receiving votes are more moderate. With sincere voting, even with three parties, extreme parties can thrive at the expense of a middle party; and whether most citizens prefer two or three parties varies with model parameters.

In each period, agents produce and trade output in a market, and allocate it to consumption and investment. Productivity is higher if total capital stock is above a threshold. The threshold externality generates two steady states - a suboptimal 'poverty trap' and an optimal steady state. In a baseline treatment, the economies converge to the poverty trap. However, the ability to make public announcements or to vote on competing and binding policies, increases output, welfare and capital stock. Combining these two simple institutions guarantees that the economies escape the poverty trap.","[Capra, C.

This study utilizes contingent valuation methodology (CVM) and a random utility model (RUM) to analyze Minnesotans' decision-making mechanisms for supporting a new stadium initiative. While previous studies have attempted to measure the welfare associated with a sports franchise, we develop and discuss bias that may be imparted to estimates when the researcher fails to calculate a choke price. Further, we develop an unbiased approach to identify welfare when respondents perceive a risk of losing the franchise.

We show that the negative effect of a productivity shock on inflation and the positive effect of a cost-push shock are crucially determined by the proportion of firms that belong to the unionized sector. The larger this number, the larger are these effects. Consequently, the larger the union coverage, the larger should be the optimal response of the nominal interest rate to exogenous productivity and cost-push shocks. The optimal inflation and output gap volatility increases as the number of the unionized firms in the economy increases. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The ultimate goal is to shed some light on the appropriate use of existing diagnostic tests for cross-equation error correlation. Our discussion is supported by means of a set of Monte Carlo experiments and a small empirical study on health. Results show that tests based on the average of pairwise correlation coefficients work well when the alternative hypothesis is a factor model with non-zero mean loadings. Tests based on spacings are powerful in identifying various forms of strong cross-section dependence, but have low power when they are used to capture spatial correlation.","[Moscone, Francesco] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Tosetti, Elisa] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Leicester; University of Cambridge,"Moscone, F (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",,"tosetti, elisa/ABD-1195-2020","tosetti, elisa/0000-0003-0979-2828; Moscone, Francesco/0000-0001-5378-680X",ESRC [ES/G00160X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G00160X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,35,53,56,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

To obtain sharp results, we restrict attention to an economy that takes as given the price of imports and the demand schedules for its exports (a small economy). We first establish that welfare can be decomposed into four terms: productivity, terms of trade, variety and curvature, where the last is a term that captures heterogeneity across varieties. We then show how a consumption subsidy, an export tax, or an import tariff allows our small economy to deal with two distortions that we identify and thereby reach its first-best allocation. We also show that an export subsidy generates an increase in productivity, but given the negative joint effect on the other three terms (terms of trade, variety, and curvature). welfare falls. In contrast, an import tariff improves welfare in spite of the fact that productivity falls. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Since this latter feature is not supported by economic theory, this paper uses the Random Coefficient Model proposed by Swamy (1970) and empirically estimates EKCs for sulfur dioxide with specific turning points from a sample of 73 high and low income countries. A crucial aspect is that there are large differences between the estimated turning Points of the EKCs for the different countries in the sample, which points to the relevance of using the approach employed here since assuming a common structure for all countries erroneously hides this relevant empirical feature. Moreover; the analysis of the structure of file EKCs estimated suggests that regulatory processes resembling market mechanisms could induce the empirical emergence of EKCs. Finally, taking into consideration the most recent concerns in the literature, we econometrically checked, on the one hand, for the validity of the usual theoretical assumption of exogeneity of the per capita income variable in the EKC relationship and, on the other hand, for all eventual structural change causing the sign change in the pollution-per capita income relationship of the EKC. The weak exogeneity and the structural break tests employed tendered plausible that income per capita is really the driver variable determining the EKC relationship found.","[Ficueroa B, Eugenio] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Ficueroa B, Eugenio] Univ Chile, CENRE, Santiago, Chile; [Pasten C, Roberto] Univ Talca, Coll Business Adm, Talca, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Talca,"Ficueroa, E (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile.",efiguero@econ.uchile.cl; rpasten@utalca.cl,,"Pasten, Roberto/0000-0003-1239-0643",,,,,60,15,17,0,6,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

Hooligans differ in their preferred level of fighting, and obtain utility also from social identity that belonging to a supporter club gives. We find that an increase in discriminative policing, like intelligence units, always reduces violence. Indiscriminate policing, such as the use of teargas or random jailing of potential law breakers, may, however, backfire and result in smaller and more brutal groups.","[Poutvaara, Panu] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Priks, Mikael] Stockholm Univ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Helsinki; Stockholm University,"Poutvaara, P (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.",panu.poutvaara@helsinki.fi,"Poutvaara, Panu/AAW-4491-2020","Poutvaara, Panu/0000-0003-2070-784X",,,,,32,15,15,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Censoring of consumption levels is accommodated by estimating a censored equation system, using quasi maximum-likelihood and copula methods which allow the specification of non-Gaussian error distributions. Findings suggest that a misspecified error distribution can obscure the effects of explanatory variables on alcohol consumption. The procedure produces very different empirical estimates from a more conventional (Gaussian) estimator. Income does not affect alcohol consumption, with socio-demographic factors such as education, employment, and marital status playing more definitive roles. Regional differences are also found.

The European Union (EU) is known for its policy of gender mainstreaming that has been implemented in member states. The EU, hower, promotes a neoliberal approach in the economy that seems to be in contradiction to the promotion of gender equality. In Poland, tendencies to liberate, privatize and deregulate are warmly welcomed as cures for economic underdevelopment. Gender equality, on the other hand, has been challenged as a relic of the former political system.

CLUES AND IMPLICATIONS,REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CONSUMPTION; BEHAVIOR; EQUITY; COSTS; MODEL,"I create comparable estimates of aggregate credit card use based on household data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and industry data. The two sources match up well on credit card charges and fairly well on account totals. But the SCF always yields much lower estimates of revolving debt. My estimated lower bound for the discrepancy in 2004 is half of the revolving credit card debt total implied by industry data. There is no obvious source for this remaining discrepancy and some evidence that the discrepancy has grown over time. Such growth is worrisome because it parallels substantial changes in credit card use and in the pool of credit card users, suggesting that the discrepancy could be driven by household underreporting that is correlated with unobserved heterogeneity. This correlation could confound inference on the relationship between credit card borrowing and outcomes of interest like household financial condition, consumption paths, and portfolio choice. Given this possibility it is critical to continue developing evidence on whether and why household surveys undercount credit card borrowing.","Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Dartmouth College,"Zinman, J (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, 314 Rockefeller Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",jzinman@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,29,41,48,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Locational market power arises when locational advantage allows suppliers to act non-competitively and raise prices above competitive levels. We propose a quantifiable definition of locational market power and analyze its properties over a general network. We also conduct a detailed analysis of the topological cause of the market power for a real electrical network using network analysis tools. We show that strategic alliances among small generators with geographical advantage can lead to significant amounts of market power. In the case of inelastic demand. the collusive behavior among suppliers leads to higher incidence of locational market power. This power is curtailed as demand becomes more responsive to price, supporting the view that efficient markets require active participation from the consumers. We also observe that if the supply is more elastic than demand, then supply can override some of the positive effects of elastic demand.

The size principle-stating that motoneurons with successively higher activation thresholds innervate successively larger portions of muscle-is thought to result from this competition. However, it was not known how. We define a game in which motoneurons compete to innervate a maximal number of muscle-fibers. Their strategies are their activity levels. We resolve an existing paradox of contradictory experimental data regarding the role of activity in this competition, explain the emergence of the size principle, and provide new experimentally testable predictions. We conclude that the time of winnings has a competitive value, Such that it is better to win more in later competitions. This conclusion has implications for economical systems.

The results show that allocative efficiency-and therefore aggregate productivity-increases through intensified competition by entrepreneurs grasping at opportunities. This fierce competition leads to price reductions that result in the improvement of measured aggregate productivity. The price reduction also forces relatively less able entrepreneurs to become workers. As resources are then dealt with only by relatively talented entrepreneurs, this selection effect also increases aggregate productivity.

This framework permits an assessment of male-female differences in labour market behaviour on gender wage differentials. The model captures worker decisions leading to transitions between labour market states and jobs, and firm responses to such transitions via wage offers. Special attention is paid to part-time workers, who have substantially less labour market attachment than full-time workers. The results indicate labour market behaviour differences play a role in determining gender wage differentials within education levels. The importance of these differences varies by education level and hours of work. These findings have implications for policies aimed at reducing gender wage differentials, and for researchers assessing the causes of gender wage differentials in situations where a large fraction of women work part-time.","[Bowlus, Audra J.] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Grogan, Louise] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Guelph,"Bowlus, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",lgrogan@uoguelph.ca,,"Bowlus, Audra/0000-0002-7671-2210",,,,,32,12,16,3,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We propose a reclassification of the literature according to whether it has been mainly assimilated or differentiated with respect to the traditional conceptualization of innovation in the manufacturing sector. We also review the integrative (or synthesizing) contributions, and suggest a taxonomy for the modes of innovation in services, based on the Lancasterian characteristics-based approach to product definition. We conclude with a summary of the key arguments and a proposed agenda for the evolutionary theory to integrate the conceptualization of innovation in services.","[Gallouj, Faiz; Savona, Maria] Univ Sci & Technol Lille 1, Fac Econ & Social Sci, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille,"Gallouj, F (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol Lille 1, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Bat SH2, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",Faiz.Gallouj@univ-lille1.fr; Maria.Savona@univ-lille1.fr,"Gallouj, Faïz/AEB-1304-2022; Gallouj, Faïz/P-6851-2017","Gallouj, Faïz/0000-0002-9837-8778; Gallouj, Faïz/0000-0002-9837-8778",,,,,96,317,356,0,106,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Extending the Taylor rule to allow for this type of uncertainty, we find evidence that the predictions of the theoretical literature on responses to uncertainty are reflected in the behavior of policymakers, suggesting that policymakers are adhering to prescriptions for optimal policy. Our estimates suggest that the effect of uncertainty on interest rates was most marked in 1983, when uncertainty increased interest rates by up to 140 basis points, in 1990-1991, when uncertainty reduced interest rates by up to 80 basis points, and in 1996-2001, when uncertainty reduced interest rates by up to 70 basis points over 5 yr.

We show that two payoff types are strategically distinguishable if and only if they satisfy a separability condition. The separability condition for each agent essentially requires that there is not too much interdependence in preferences across agents. A social choice function, mapping payoff type profiles to outcomes, can be robustly virtually implemented if there exists a mechanism such that every equilibrium on every type space achieves an outcome that is arbitrarily close to the outcome generated by the social choice function. This definition is equivalent to requiring virtual implementation in iterated deletion of strategies that are strictly dominated for all beliefs. The social choice function is robustly measurable if strategically indistinguishable payoff types receive the same allocation. We show that ex post incentive compatibility and robust measurability are necessary and sufficient for robust virtual implementation.","[Bergemann, Dirk] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Morris, Stephen] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Yale University; Princeton University,"Bergemann, D (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",dirk.bergemann@yale.edu; smorris@princeton.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0850718, 0851200] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,35,24,27,3,11,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Agents are assumed to have three components of the expectation of future asset returns, namely fundamentalist, chartist and noise trader. Furthermore agents differ in the characteristics describing these components, such as time horizon. risk aversion and the weights given to the various components. The model developed here extends a great deal of earlier literature in that the order submissions of agents are determined by utility maximisation, rather than the mechanical unit order size that is commonly assumed. In this way the order flow is better related to the ongoing evolution of the market. For the given market structure we analyze the impact of the three components of the trading strategies on the statistical properties of prices and order flows and observe that it is the chartist strategy that is mainly responsible of the fat tails and clustering in the artificial price data generated by the model. The paper provides further evidence that large price changes are likely to be generated by the presence of large gaps in the book. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This subtle difference significantly lowers the likelihood of trust but increases the likelihood of cooperation conditional on trust. Evidence is presented that the change in trust is consistent with first movers failing to anticipate the later result. Drawing upon the analogy that the trust game represents a model of exchange, the results suggest that markets should be organized so that the buyer moves first and not the seller as in the original trust game.","Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Deck, C (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",cdeck@walton.uark.edu,,,,,,,24,4,5,2,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

However, under current practices, this contribution is not sustainable because forests are experiencing a high rate of depletion in this continent. This paper investigates the immediate factors of deforestation in Cameroon in relation to food security of poor populations. Quantitative estimates show that cocoa producer prices, food crop prices and timber export price index on one hand, and the oil boom, the structural adjustment policies and the devaluation of the CFA franc on the other hand are quite important in stimulating the clearing of forests. Equally, the agricultural value added per hectare increases the profitability of maintaining forests. Finally, food security has a negative relationship with forest depletion. Therefore, in order to protect the remaining forest areas and render the contribution of forests to food security sustainable, attention to non-forest policies should be a first-order priority in the future.","[Gbetnkom, Daniel] Off W Africa, UNECA, Niamey, Niger; [Gbetnkom, Daniel] Univ Yaounde II, Fac Econ & Management, Yaounde, Cameroon",UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA),"Gbetnkom, D (通讯作者)，Off W Africa, UNECA, POB 744, Niamey, Niger.",dagbetnkom@yahoo.com,,,,,,,44,12,16,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

At most, the role of the state is to endorse customary laws and add some minimal general rules. Some see no essential difference between custom and law. By contrast, this paper argues that law has properties that cannot be reduced to custom or private ordering alone. Customary mechanisms are insufficient to explain adherence to complex systems of law. Furthermore, law proper arose when customs were violated and some higher adjudication was required. We require an explanation of how a system of complex legal rules may be enforced, and why people often obey laws in the absence of obvious incentives or disincentives.

Standard models of these auctions do not pin down relative bidding postures, but we show that by adding small amounts of private value information, a unique equilibrium can be restored. Additional common value information affects a bidder's payoff both directly, by increasing his information rent. and indirectly, by shifting the relative bidding posture of his opponent. Although the latter effect need not be positive, we establish broad conditions under which bidders with more information do better than their rivals. We turn to information acquisition and release and show that the desire to influence relative bidding postures can lead sellers to create new information rents (by releasing information privately to only one bidder) and bidders to forego information rents (instead choosing to gather information that a rival already has).

By conducting a nationwide village-level survey, we find that these organizations are playing an important role in the provision of local public goods and services. To explain villagers' participation rates in these organizations, we specify and estimate two simultaneous equations and find that the level of villagers' distrust in township leaders exerts a significant and positive influence on the participation rates. We argue that, when distrusting local government officials, largely for their unwillingness or inability to provide public goods and services, villagers might attempt to participate in autonomous social organizations to serve their own and community's interests independently from the local Party-state. We also find that lineage structure and relations and labor out-migration have significant impacts on villagers' participation in such social organizations.

It is surprising that U.S. firms actively maintained constant nominal prices for their shares while general prices in the economy went up more than tenfold. This is especially puzzling given that commissions paid by investors on trading ten $35 shares are about ten times those paid on a single $350 share. We review potential explanations including signaling and optimal trading ranges and find that none of the existing theories are able to explain the observed constant nominal prices.

Rather, they resell mobile services by purchasing airtime at wholesale rates from mobile network operators (MNOs). Unlike ordinary resellers, MVNOs rely on brand appeal and reputation acquired in other businesses to sell mobile services (often bundled with other products). Significant worldwide growth in voluntary MNO-MVNO partnerships, without intervention from public policies that mandate MVNO access to MNO networks, raises many interesting issues. Since MNOs that sell wholesale services to MVNOs potentially forfeit sales in downstream retail markets, voluntary relationships are plausible only if MVNOs add value by widening and/or deepening MNO-served markets. This paper provides sufficient conditions for profit-maximizing MNOs and MVNOs to form voluntary strategic partnerships based on resale, product differentiation, and rebranding. The two key factors are (1) value of the MVNO's brand reputation and (2) wholesale discount at which the MNO offers service to the MVNO. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Discussed are early studies of determinants of FDI (1) as well as determinants of FDI based on the neoclassical trade theory (2), ownership advantages (3), aggregate variables (4), the ownership, location and internalization advantage framework (5), horizontal and vertical FDI models (6), the knowledge-capital model (7), diversified FDI and risk diversification models (8) and policy variables (9). From each of the nine theories, the relevant determinants of FDI are derived. Empirical studies indicate the importance of these determinants in the real world. The paper shows that there is not one single theory of FDI, but a variety of theoretical models attempting to explain FDI and the location decision of multinational firms. Therefore, any analysis of determinants of FDI should not be based on a single theoretical model. Instead, FDI should be explained more broadly by a combination of factors from a variety of theoretical models such as ownership advantages or agglomeration economics, market size and characteristics, cost factors, transport costs, protection, risk factors and policy variables.","Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Faeth, I (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,,,,,,,155,175,222,1,97,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0950-0804,,,J ECON SURV,J.

We conduct this analysis by merging three large statewide administrative datasets from Florida concerning all births during the period 1997-2001. We match the birth records of infants and the school records of their older siblings in order to relatively precisely identify marginally eligible and marginally ineligible families that are very similar in their observable characteristics.

The conventional wisdom presumes that as rent-seeking is harmful for oligarchs themselves, institutions such as property rights will emerge spontaneously. We explicitly model a dynamic game between the oligarchs and a dictator who can contain rent-seeking. The oligarchs choose either a weak dictator (who can be overthrown by an individual oligarch) or a strong dictator (who can only be replaced via a consensus of oligarchs). In equilibrium, no dictator can commit to both: (i) protecting the oligarchs' property rights from the other oligarchs and (ii) not expropriating oligarchs himself. We show that a weak dictator does not limit rent-seeking. A strong dictator does reduce rent-seeking but also expropriates individual oligarchs. We show that even though eliminating rent-seeking is Pareto optimal, weak dictators do get appointed in equilibrium and rent-seeking continues. This outcome is especially likely when economic environment is highly volatile. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper illustrates how domestic credit market imperfections can alter the standard predictions about the consumption smoothing possibilities under financial autarky and international financial integration. I use a two-country international real business cycle model where the non-traded sector in the small country faces borrowing constraints due to contract enforceability problems. If the international risk-sharing opportunities are non-existent, households can secure themselves against the shocks in the non-traded sector only by adjusting their labor effort, which leads to changes in sectorial output and terms of trade. The deterioration of the terms of trade acts as a dampening effect on consumption, causing it to be less volatile under financial autarky relative to financial integration. Under financial integration, international financial assets provide the insurance against domestic productivity shocks without affecting the relative prices, hence allowing the consumption to react more.

In this environment, the optimal contract can be described by a promotion contract. The distribution of contract offers is dispersed within and across experience levels. As workers stay longer in the market and promotion dates get closer, the option value of holding a job increases. Firms offer early promotions to attract more experienced workers. A positive relation between experience and earnings can arise purely from firms' optimal response to labour market competition brought about by workers' on-the-job search.

The hypothesis is that the nonlinear component of inflation persistence results from a technological shock and might positively contribute to economic growth. The microfoundations are derived from an assumption of Calvo pricing and sticky-information Keynesian Phillips curve. The hypothesis is evaluated empirically with the use of monthly data series for inflation for 119 countries. Linear and nonlinear (bilinear) inflation persistence measures have been estimated with the use of a bilinear autoregressive moving average model in a state space form. Further on, correlation analysis has been performed for these countries to detect a relationship between economic growth and linear and nonlinear persistence.

While short rates dutifully followed the Target up, long maturity rates actually fell. Alan Greenspan in 2005 Congressional testimony labeled the strange behavior of the spread between long rates and the Target a conundrum. This paper examines the conundrum. We present robust empirical evidence that the increase in foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds explains at least half of the decline in long maturity rates.

If the tax burden on corporate gross incomes is increasing, the companies' management can follow two reasons in deciding the dividend payout: to allocate more for investments, or to increase the dividend ratio. Each of these decisions can be argued based on Corporate Finance principles, depending on the management objectives. This paper found no significant correlation between the dividend policy and the corporate tax burden. However, the dividend payout reacted when the regulations related to the tax treatment of incomes were changed in 2005. Moreover, the dividend policy seems to be sensitive to the ownership structure, which can be explained by the impact of some agency problems.","[Dragota, Mihaela; Dragota, Victor; Tatu, Lucian] Acad Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Bucharest 010374, Romania; [Tatu, Delia] Acad Econ Studies, Dept Econ, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dragota, M (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Piata Romana 6,Sector 1, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",mihaela.dragota@fin.ase.ro; victordragota@yahoo.com; lucian.tatu@fin.ase.ro; delia.tatu@economie.ase.ro,"Tatu, Lucian/C-4560-2011; Dragota, Victor/B-9076-2011; Dragota, Ingrid-Mihaela/C-6609-2011","Dragota, Victor/0000-0001-7284-5297; Dragota, Ingrid-Mihaela/0000-0002-4864-7503",,,,,35,7,7,0,9,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Additionally, some strategic generators may have been prompted the system operator to require them to inject electricity into the system to solve network congestions.

We track participants in the NLSY79: one-third of these baby boomers were hurt at work, but 38% of them did not file for workers' compensation. We find that the typical young baby boomer who is never injured has both much higher absolute wealth and wealth growth rates than boomers who are ever injured. Regression results that control for unobserved heterogeneity suggest, however, that the injury does not predict lower wealth unless workers have reported wage losses or spells off work because of their accidents. For these employees wealth is dramatically reduced, regardless of their participation in the workers' compensation system. We also find that injured workers significantly reduce their consumption over time. These results raise new questions about the adequacy of workers' compensation benefits and the quality of jobs injured workers are able to return to. They suggest that sudden health problems caused by occupational injuries may affect more than employers' costs and individuals' incomes; they may have also wider and longer lasting consequences in term of families' wealth and well-being.

Results from country-level and bank-level regressions are more supportive of the lazy banks view. but the safe asset view seems to play a role at moderate levels of public debt held by banks. There is also evidence of a harmful interaction between public debt and financial repression.

The model outcome shows that divergence from a de jure regime is a process of slow learning in small steps, which indicates that the learning completes over time. Therefore, divergence does not have a long-term effect on the distribution of exchange rate regime.

Both the CPI and the PPI are considered. The relative price is the major determinant of the nominal exchange rate except for Malaysia when the CPI is used. The widely used double-log form for PPP can be rejected in seven of the eight countries when the CPI is used and in six of the eight countries when the PPI is used. The unitary elasticity cannot be rejected for Korea when the CPI is used and can be rejected for other cases. Hence, most countries have a nonlinear functional form of PPP and exhibit a nonunitary elasticity.","SE Louisiana Univ, Coll Business, Hammond, LA 70402 USA",University of Louisiana System; Southeastern Louisiana University,"Hsing, Y (通讯作者)，SE Louisiana Univ, Coll Business, Hammond, LA 70402 USA.",yhsing@selu.edu,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We find that consumers typically use multiple payment media and that this behavior is closely related to the use of debit cards besides cash. Moreover, it turns out that the use of multiple payment media is directly related to consumer awareness but that not controlling for the endogeneity of awareness can bias its effect downwards. Conditional on the use of multiple payment methods, however, awareness does not distinguish those making debit a primary payment method from those making it secondary to cash.","[Takalo, Tuomas] Bank Finland, Monetary Policy & Res Dept, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Hyytinen, Ari; Takalo, Tuomas] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Takalo, Tuomas] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",Bank of Finland; University of Jyvaskyla; University of Cambridge,"Takalo, T (通讯作者)，Bank Finland, Monetary Policy & Res Dept, POB 160, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland.",tuomas.takalo@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,4,5,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

It extends the Kagan et al. (2005) framework and develops a model of resource allocation between expenditure on civilian government consumption and on security in a non-cooperative (Cournot) arms race between a developed country and a less-developed country. The model is used to predict the optimal mix of weapons of the two countries engaged in the arms race, and to evaluate the applicability of international strategic WMD limitation agreements. Applying the model to the arms race between Israel and Syria shows that if considered from a purely monetary perspective, such an agreement, in which the monetary transfer to Syria is made by either Israel or a third party, is within reach. A strategic agreement to limit North Korea's WMD is also economically feasible, but only when the monetary transfer to North Korea is shouldered by a third party such as the USA or a coalition of neighboring countries.","[Tishler, Asher] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Kagan, Kobi; Weiss, Avi] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Levkowitz, Alon] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept E Asian Studies, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University; Bar Ilan University; Tel Aviv University,"Tishler, A (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",atishler@post.tau.ac.il,,"Levkowitz, Alon/0000-0002-7165-3928",,,,,64,5,5,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.
