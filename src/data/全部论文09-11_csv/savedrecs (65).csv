Exploring the regional distribution of inbound foreign direct investment in the UK in theory and practice: evidence from a five-region study, Regional Studies. This paper examines the main factors that attract inbound foreign direct investment (FDI) at the UK regional level using econometric data from five sample UK regions (the South East, the West Midlands, the North West, Wales, and Scotland) broadly representing the country's regional economic divide. The findings indicate that regional and national (but not European Union-level) factors, linked to several underlying strategic determinants, help determine the regional distribution of inbound foreign direct investment, and its inter-regional variation. The paper concludes that governmental policy-makers at the national and regional levels can have an important role to play in drawing targeted foreign direct investment inflows to the UK regions.","[Fallon, Grahame] Univ Northampton, Northampton Business Sch, Northampton NN2 7AL, England; [Cook, Mark] Wolverhampton Univ, Wolverhampton Business Sch, Telford TF2 9NT, Shrops, England",University of Northampton; University of Wolverhampton,"Fallon, G (通讯作者)，Univ Northampton, Northampton Business Sch, Pk Campus,Boughton Green Rd, Northampton NN2 7AL, England.",grahame.fallon@northampton.ac.uk; mark.cook@wlv.ac.uk,,,,,,,79,31,31,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper investigates spread-backwash effects associated with non-agricultural gross domestic product and employment growth across 922 cities and counties in Central China between 2000 and 2005. Simultaneous equation estimates find mixed spread-backwash effects from prefecture and higher-level cities to comparable or lower-level cities and counties. Spread effects of gross domestic product and employment growths are also indicated between county-level cities. However, county-level cities exerted backwash effects on rural counties. The paper discusses the implications of these findings in relation to the construction of urban economic growth zones in Central China as an important strategy of Central Rise.","[Ke, Shanzi] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Feser, Edward] Univ Illinois, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",Hunan University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Ke, SZ (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China.",shanzike@hotmail.com; feser@illinois.edu,"Feser, Edward/CAJ-0598-2022","Feser, Edward/0000-0003-3283-3974",,,,,42,58,71,11,83,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The findings highlight the dynamics of the local labour markets in a case such as Greece, where the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) claims that wage flexibility is limited. This study does not find evidence that wages in Greece are rigid, but finds a wage curve elasticity of close to -0.1, which corresponds to evidence from many counties.

Results indicate no direct long-run price relations between fuel and agricultural commodity prices, and limited if any direct short-run relationships. In terms of short-run price movements, sugar prices are influencing all the other agricultural commodity prices except rice. With sugar the number one world input for ethanol, results indicate increased ethanol production is potentially influencing short-run agricultural commodity prices.

We examine the sustainability of regional forest biomass use in the context of existing thermal heating, electricity, and biofuels production, projected resource needs over the next decade including existing forest product market demand, and impacts on price and feasibility. Assuming $36 per dry tonne at roadside, 4.1 million dry tonnes of forest biomass could be available region-wide. However, less is likely available due to localized environmental and forest cover type constraints, and landowner willingness to harvest timber. Total projected demand of 5.7 million dry tonnes, based on current and announced industry capacity, exceeds estimates of biomass availability, which suggests that anticipated growth in the forest-based bioeconomy may be constrained. Attaining projected demand will likely require a combination of higher cost feedstocks, integration of energy and non-energy uses, and careful management to meet environmental constraints. State distinctions in biomass harvest guidelines and the propensity for third-party forest certification will be critical in providing environmental safeguards. The cumulative effect of policy initiatives on biomass competition are discussed in the context of an emerging Lake States bioeconomy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents the results of an analysis of the potential cost-effectiveness of different policy options aimed to foster the production and consumption of energy-efficient appliances in different European countries. Our results suggest that incentives to promote the use of energy-efficient appliances can be cost-effective, but whether or not they are depends on the particular country and the options under consideration. From the cases considered, tax credits on boilers appear to be a cost-effective option in Denmark and Italy, while subsidies on CFLi bulbs in France and Poland are cost-effective in terms of (sic)/ton of CO2 abated. Comparing the subsidies against the energy tax options, we find that the subsidies are in most cases less cost-effective than the energy tax. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Scenarios are used to envision how such a significant decarbonization might be achieved through the application of advanced vehicle technologies and fuels, and various options for behavioral change. A Kaya framework that decomposes GHG emissions into the product of four major drivers is used to analyze emissions and mitigation options. In contrast to most previous studies, a relatively simple, easily adaptable modeling methodology is used which can incorporate insights from other modeling studies and organize them in a way that is easy for policymakers to understand. Also, a wider range of transportation subsectors is considered here-light- and heavy-duty vehicles, aviation, rail, marine, agriculture, off-road, and construction. This analysis investigates scenarios with multiple options (increased efficiency, lower-carbon fuels, and travel demand management) across the various subsectors and confirms the notion that there are no silver bullet strategies for making deep cuts in transport GHGs. If substantial emission reductions are to be made, considerable action is needed on all fronts, and no subsectors can be ignored. Light-duty vehicles offer the greatest potential for emission reductions; however, while deep reductions in other subsectors are also possible, there are more limitations in the types of fuels and propulsion systems that can be used. In all cases travel demand management strategies are critical; deep emission cuts will not likely be possible without slowing growth in travel demand across all modes. Even though these scenarios represent only a small subset of the potential futures in which deep reductions might be achieved, they provide a sense of the magnitude of changes required in our transportation system and the need for early and aggressive action if long-term targets are to be met.

One strategy is to increase dieselisation rates of the vehicle fleet. Recent trends in fuel economy show improvement since 1995, however, efforts need to go further if the EU Voluntary Agreement targets on CO2 (a greenhouse gas emission standard) are to be achieved. Trends show diesel car sales have accelerated rapidly and that the advantage of new car fuel economy of diesel cars over gasoline ones is narrowing posing a new challenge. We estimate the demand for new car fuel economy in the UK. In the long-run consumers buy fuel economy, but not in the short-run. We found that long-term income and price changes were the main drivers to achieve improvements particularly for diesel cars and that there is no break in the trend of fuel economy induced by the agreement adopted in the 1990s.

The Chinese government plans to increase nuclear generating capacity to 40GWe by 2020, while the installed capacity is 8.6 GWe in 2007. In view of the enthusiasm shown for nuclear electricity throughout the country, the actual scale of Chinese nuclear power development is expected to reach 70 GWe by 2020. However, the low cost proven uranium reverses (cost category to < 130 US $/kg) in China only meet half demand of 40 GWe capacity in 2020. And overlying China's increased demand is continued political sensitivity about the uranium trade. Meanwhile, the capacity of China's spent fuel reprocessing cannot keep up with the increasing spent fuel. And the legal administrative system of radioactive waste and spent fuel management is outdated.

Similarly, the law of comparative advantage represents a conceptual framework for determining the type of trade. However, several assumptions of the LQ limit both its general applicability and usefulness. This study recommends that comparative advantage can provide another channel to re-examine the LQ from the viewpoints of both interregional and international trade, where the former can correct the LQ from dependence problems of the location theory and the latter inserts international trade into the LQ to show another vital source of exports, especially for a small open economy and increasing globalization today. Furthermore, the optimal LQ is obtained by integration of the above two new revisions to respond to all types of trade. Finally, the evidence finds that differences in base employment between traditional and these new LQ indices are substantial and hence revised LQ should be considered profoundly.","Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Finance, Chungli 32023, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University,"Chiang, SH (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Finance, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Chungli 32023, Taiwan.",shchiang@cycu.edu.tw,"Chiang, Shu-hen/AAS-6562-2021",,,,,,30,20,25,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Certain offset project types may also deliver co-benefits including safeguarding or promoting biodiversity, supporting human development and poverty reduction, and enabling market and technology development in low-carbon sectors. These co-benefits might encourage consumers to participate in the voluntary offset market, depending on their effects both on consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for offsets and on implementation costs. However, the offset market is not yet sufficiently developed to give a clear indication of consumer WTP for offsets with varying attributes. This exploratory stated preference study therefore uses a choice experiment to estimate WTP for certified and uncertified offsets, with or without these specific co-benefits, in an aviation context. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to do so. Our results suggest that uptake of voluntary offsets may be encouraged by investing in projects with co-benefits and by emphasising those co-benefits to consumers. They also suggest that certification regimes will add value to offsets, helping compensate for increased costs, provided that consumers are made fully aware of them. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To increase the same, concerns of RE developers are being addressed by the government and regulatory bodies. One such concern is availability of transmission grid for evacuation of power. Transmission lines required for power evacuation from RE generators are typically not included in their network plan by the transmission utility. Considering the financial health and underperformance of these utilities, even if the required transmission lines are included in the network plan, RE developers are uncertain and unsure of the timely execution of the plan. Ministry of Power has earlier notified guidelines [Government of India, Ministry of Power, 2006a. Resolution on tariff based competitive-bidding guidelines for transmission service; Government of India, Ministry of Power, 2006b. Resolution on guidelines for encouraging competition in development of transmission projects] for enabling private sector participation in transmission to enable the private developers to build the required evacuation infrastructure. This paper evaluates the options available as per the legislative and regulatory framework in India through which the evacuation infrastructure for the RE projects can be built by the transmission utility or the potential investors. The key concept of dedicated transmission line, which has been a keenly debated and often a misunderstood issue, is also discussed in great detail. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The Clean Development Mechanism and the international diffusion of technologies: An empirical study, Energy Policy 36, 1273-1283], we gave a general description of technology transfers by Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects and we analyzed their drivers. In this paper, we use the same data and similar econometric models to explain inter-country differences. We focus on 4 countries gathering about 75% of the CDM projects: Brazil, China, India and Mexico. Sixty eight percent of Mexican projects include an international transfer of technology. The rates are, respectively, 12%, 40% and 59% for India Brazil and, China. Our results show that transfers to Mexico and Brazil are mainly related to the strong involvement of foreign partners and good technological capabilities. Besides a relative advantage with respect to these factors, the higher rate of international transfers in Mexico seems to be due to a sector-composition effect. The involvement of foreign partners is less frequent in India and China, where investment opportunities generated by fist growing economies seem to play a more important role in facilitating international technology transfers through the CDM. International transfers are also related to strong technology capabilities in China. in contrast, the lower rate of international transfer (12%) in India may be due to a better capability to diffuse domestic technologies.

Also, new governmental policies, essentially in developed countries, are trying to implement renewable energies. For these reasons, a case-study in Portugal of a water pumping system was analysed to operate connected to solar and wind energy sources. A stand-alone and a grid-connected systems were tested. The stand alone was compared with the cost of extending the national electric grid. In the grid-connected system two solutions were analysed, one with a water turbine and another without. To be able to implement a water turbine, a larger water pump was needed to Pump the necessary water as for consumption as for energy production. For the case analysed the system without a water turbine proved to be more cost-effective because the energy tariff is not yet so competitive as well as the cost of water turbines.

How different are the British in their willingness to move? Evidence from international social survey data, Regional Studies. This paper analyses people's willingness to move using data from the 1995 British Social Attitudes Survey and International Social Survey Programme. The personal characteristics and sub-regional indicators that are important in explaining the willingness to move within Britain are identified. It is also found that the willingness to move is only higher in a few other countries, including the USA. The equivalent desire to move is found to be much lower in Eastern European countries and in several other European Union Member States. Compositional effects, such as age and education, are generally important in explaining differences in attitudes towards migration in comparison with other Western economies. However, structural effects such as institutions, history, and culture tend to play a more dominant role in explaining differences compared with countries in Central and Eastern Europe.

This paper assesses the appropriateness of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for meeting rural development challenges in the New Member States (NMS). It argues that while the mitigation of structural problems confronting rural areas in these countries is critical to meeting the challenge of effectively integrating Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) into the European Union, the CAP is poorly suited to this task. Overall, the CAP was insufficiently reformed to accommodate CEE accession effectively and it represents a failure of the European Union to adjust adequately from an exclusively Western European institution into an appropriate pan-European organization.","[Gorton, Matthew; Hubbard, Carmen; Hubbard, Lionel] Newcastle Univ, Ctr Rural Econ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Gorton, M (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Ctr Rural Econ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Agr Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",matthew.gorton@ncl.ac.uk; carmen.hubbard@ncl.ac.uk; lionel.hubbard@ncl.ac.uk,"Gorton, Matthew/GPP-3457-2022; Gorton, Matthew/A-7653-2009","Gorton, Matthew/0000-0002-4579-5092; Gorton, Matthew/0000-0002-4579-5092",,,,,46,76,77,3,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

Balanced development in globalizing regional development? Unpacking the new regional policy of South Korea, Regional Studies. This paper critically examines South Korea's adoption of 'new regionalism' as a basis for its regional policy initiatives. It is argued that this new regional policy poses dualism between endogenism and exogenism, and as such fails to reformulate and re-articulate theoretical and policy views on the globalization of regional development. Instead of dualism, a concept of 'multi-scalar governance' has been developed as an analytical lens through which regional development in the era of globalization can be analysed. Based on this viewpoint, the drawbacks of the new regional policy - the problems of triangular inter-scalar coordination - are specifically reviewed. For this analysis, archival re-examination and in-depth interviews with policy-makers have been employed.

The manufacturer decides the price of the direct channel and the retail decides the retail price. We develop conditions under which the manufacturer and the retailer share the market is equilibrium. Then the demand analysis as well as the two pricing regimes of the manufacturer that maximize the profits of the entire supply chain is developed. We show that the proportion of the T-consumer in the market plays important role in determining both the existence of dual channels in equilibrium and the pricing strategies of the manufacturers.

Using a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this study analyzes the impact of oil price on biofuel expansion, and subsequently, on food supply. The study shows that a 65% increase in oil price in 2020 from the 2009 level would increase the global biofuel penetration to 5.4% in 2020 from 2.4% in 2009. If oil prices rise 150% from their 2009 levels by 2020, the resulting penetration of biofuels would be 9%, which is higher than that would be caused by current mandates and targets introduced in more than forty countries around the world. The study also shows that aggregate agricultural output drops due to an oil price increase, but the drop is small in major biofuel producing countries as the expansion of biofuels would partially offset the negative impacts of the oil price increase on agricultural outputs. An increase in oil price would reduce global food supply through direct impacts as well as through the diversion of food commodities and cropland towards the production of biofuels.

This paper analyses the returns to education for entrepreneurs in urban and rural regions in Finland and compares these to the returns for wage earners. These areas show different rates of self-employment, higher rates being found in rural areas and lower rates in urban areas. The analysis is based on a rich, register-based dataset that includes a 7% random sample of all Finns. To avoid potential sources of bias, Mincer-type income equations are estimated using different estimation procedures. The results show regional variation in returns to education. In rural areas, returns to education are somewhat higher for entrepreneurs than for wage earners. Highly educated entrepreneurs especially gain advantage from their education. In urban areas as well as in the entire country, the returns for the two occupation groups are rather similar.","[Tokila, Anu; Tervo, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla,"Tokila, A (通讯作者)，Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",anu.tokila@econ.jyu.fi; htervo@econ.jyu.fi,,"Tervo, Hannu/0000-0002-2979-994X",,,,,51,7,7,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The recent accidents in Chinese North-Western transmission network (in February-April, 2011) demonstrated the urgent need for a fundamental review of the Chinese renewable energy policy. Offshore wind has been identified as the most feasible alternative to onshore wind to help deliver electricity to Eastern China during the summer peak time. By investigating and summarizing first hand experiences of participation in the Chinese renewable market, the authors provide the economic figures of the first cohort of Chinese offshore wind schemes. Large state owned enterprises (SOE) are dominating the offshore wind development, repeating their previous practices on the land. While this paper acknowledges the critical role of offshore wind generation in meeting Chinese renewable energy targets, it envisages an installed offshore capacity of approximately 2000 MW by 2015, much less than the 10000 MW governmental estimation, which can be attributed to the lack of detailed energy policy, network constraints, offshore wind installation difficulties and quality issues in the manufacture of turbines.

Here we derive an energy account from local statistics, and compare them with an input output (10) analysis as applied to Melbourne, Australia. These approaches highlight different aspects of urban energy use and comparable outputs are presented together to assess consistency, to identify complementarities and discuss the insight each approach brings to understanding urban energy. The 10 method captures the direct and embodied primary energy requirements of local household expenditure (235.8 GJ/capita/year) while the regional assessment more directly accounts for local production activity (258.1 GJ/capita/year). The parity of these results is unexpected for a developed city with a strong tertiary sector. Sectoral detail reveals differences between the primary energy required by Melbourne's economic structure and that ultimately required through the full supply chain relating to household expenditure. This is accompanied by an 10 analysis of the geography of Melbourne's 'energy catchment'. It is suggested that the 10 consumption and regional production approaches have particular relevance to policies aimed at consumption behaviour and economic, (re)structuring, respectively. Their complementarity further suggests that a combined analysis would be valuable in understanding urban energy futures and economic transitions elsewhere.

In order to run, maintain and build capital energy is required to be distributed to geographically dispersed sites where investments are deemed profitable. We capture this aspect of physical reality by a network theory of electricity distribution. The model leads to a supply relation according to which feasible electricity consumption per capita rises with the size of the economy, as measured by capital per capita. Specifically, the relation is a simple power law with an exponent assigned to capital that is bounded between 1/2 and 3/4, depending on the efficiency of the network. Together with an energy conservation equation, capturing instantaneous aggregate demand for electricity, we are able to provide a metabolic-energetic founded law of motion for capital per capita that is mathematically isomorphic to the one emanating from the Solow growth model. Using data for the 50 US states 1960-2000, we examine the determination of growth in electricity consumption per capita and test the model structurally. The model fits the data well. The exponent in the power law connecting capital and electricity is 2/3. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, a novel approach for analyzing the impact of the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) with a dynamic recursive computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is employed. The model is benchmarked in an oil producing country with declining production, namely Cameroon. The results show that the PIH renders public finances less vulnerable during the post-oil transition. However, adopting the PIH is not associated with substantial improvements in growth and household welfare in Cameroon. Therefore, the PIH cannot be the only basis for better management of oil revenues in the country. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Toft, P",,,,"Toft, Peter",,,Intrastate conflict in oil producing states: A threat to global oil supply?,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Intrastate conflict; Energy security; Oil supply,CIVIL-WAR; NATURAL-RESOURCES,"In this paper I investigate how often and how much outbreaks of intrastate conflict in oil producing states translates into oil supply shortfalls. The Libyan conflict that broke out in February 2011 highlighted the fear that intrastate conflict in oil producing states may imply shortfalls and ensuing volatile global oil prices. I argue, however, that it is far from certain that shortfalls following conflict outbreak will occur, since both sides in a conflict face incentives simultaneously to protect and maintain oil installations and to strike and destroy these. Based on a quantitative analysis of 39 intrastate wars in oil producing countries (1965-2007) I conclude that outbreak of conflict does not translate into production decline with any certainty. In fact, likelihoods are less than 50% for reductions to occur. In many cases growing production actually followed conflict outbreak. I conclude by investigating four characteristics of intrastate conflict that may explain when oil production is at risk during conflict: (1) proximity of oil producing fields to key battle zones, (2) duration of conflict, (3) separatism and the location of oil in separatist territory, and (4) the relative size of oil production. While the first three factors did not prove important, oil producer size could be significant. But further research is needed to establish this with greater certainty. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the competitive equilibrium, selfish behavior and inefficient skills accumulation may prevent sustained growth. Implementing the utilitarian optimum likely induces sustainability via increased knowledge formation, but resource depletion may be faster or slower than under laissez-faire depending on the social discount rate. Heavy (modest) social discounting delays (anticipates) the achievement of net welfare gains for newborn agents and successors. The reason is that human capital accumulation magnifies the positive growth effects of policies that lower the rate of resource destruction, preserving the welfare of newborn agents. Resource-depleting policies, instead, hamper growth and reduce lifetime welfare of early-in-time generations the first loser being the currently young. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, we estimated two log-log demand equations for peak and off-peak electricity consumption using static and dynamic partial adjustment approaches. These demand functions were estimated using several econometric approaches for panel data, for example LSDV and RE for static models, and LSDV and corrected LSDV estimators for dynamic models. The attempt of this empirical analysis has been to highlight some of the characteristics of the Swiss residential electricity demand. The estimated short-run own price elasticities are lower than 1, whereas in the long-run these values are higher than 1. The estimated short-run and long-run cross-price elasticities are positive. This result shows that peak and off-peak electricity are substitutes. In this context, time differentiated prices should provide an economic incentive to customers so that they can modify consumption patterns by reducing peak demand and shifting electricity consumption from peak to off-peak periods.

A heteroskedasticity-robust joint test against a combination of the artificial alternatives used for autocorrelation and non-nested hypothesis tests is proposed.

In this paper we provide a detailed analysis of the iLUC effect, and further address the issues of deforestation, irrigation water use, and crop price increases due to expanding biofuel acreage. We use GLOBIOM - an economic partial equilibrium model of the global forest, agriculture, and biomass sectors with a bottom-up representation of agricultural and forestry management practices. The results indicate that second generation biofuel production fed by wood from sustainably managed existing forests would lead to a negative iLUC factor, meaning that overall emissions are 27% lower compared to the No biofuel scenario by 2030. The iLUC factor of first generation biofuels global expansion is generally positive, requiring some 25 years to be paid back by the GHG savings from the substitution of biofuels for conventional fuels. Second generation biofuels perform better also with respect to the other investigated criteria: on the condition that they are not sourced from dedicated plantations directly competing for agricultural land. If so, then efficient first generation systems are preferable. Since no clear technology champion for all situations exists, we would recommend targeting policy instruments directly at the positive and negative effects of biofuel production rather than at the production itself.

This paper argues that South Africa can build on the momentum surrounding its introduction of a feed-in tariff by enacting policies that may, if given adequate funding and political effort, allow the country to be a world leader in renewable energy. Given a variety of renewable energy policy options for moving forward, a majority of stakeholders consulted in this study strongly prefer the development of a renewable energy manufacturing cluster, in which government develops coordinated policy mechanisms that attract renewable energy manufacturers, over three other policies suggested by the authors. Interviews with key informants that play critical roles in this decision-making process suggest that there are reasons to remain cautiously optimistic about the country's renewable energy future while cognizant of the challenges that must still be overcome. Opportunities for a low carbon renewable energy transition in South Africa include the prevalence of broad stakeholder consultation, facilitated by civil society, and an innovative policy development context. Significant impediments also exist, however, and include pervasive social issues such as poverty and political inertia, along with the ongoing difficulties facing renewable energy technologies in reaching grid parity with inexpensive and abundant South African coal.

For example, corn ethanol plants produce distillers' grains and solubles. Soybean crushing plants produce soy meal and soy oil, which is used for biodiesel production. Electricity is generated in sugarcane ethanol plants both for internal consumption and export to the electric grid. Future cellulosic ethanol plants could be designed to co-produce electricity with ethanol. It is important to take co-products into account in the life-cycle analysis of biofuels and several methods are available to do so. Although the International Standard Organization's ISO 14040 advocates the system boundary expansion method (also known as the displacement method or the substitution method) for life-cycle analyses, application of the method has been limited because of the difficulty in identifying and quantifying potential products to be displaced by biofuel co-products. As a result, some LCA studies and policy-making processes have considered alternative methods. In this paper, we examine the available methods to deal with biofuel co-products, explore the strengths and weaknesses of each method, and present biofuel LCA results with different co-product methods within the U.S. context.

Here, new projections of atmospheric CO2 concentration and global-mean temperature change are presented, should fossil fuels be exploited at a rate limited by geological availability only. The present work starts from the projections of fossil energy use, as obtained from ten independent sources. From such projections an upper bound, a lower bound and an ensemble mean profile for fossil CO2 emissions until 2200 are derived. Using the coupled gas-cycle/climate model MAGICC, the corresponding climatic projections out to 2200 are obtained. We find that CO2 concentration might increase up to about 480 ppm (445-540 ppm), while the global-mean temperature increase w.r.t. 2000 might reach 1.2 degrees C (0.9-1.6 degrees C). However, future improvements of fossil fuels recovery and discoveries of new resources might lead to higher emissions; hence our climatic projections are likely to be underestimated. In the absence of actions of emissions reduction, a level of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system might be already experienced toward the middle of the 21st century, despite the constraints imposed by the exhaustion of fossil fuels.

There are widespread fallacies among potential cogeneration developers and concerned professionals that cogeneration is uncompetitive in Malaysia due to existing policies of subsidized gas prices and grid-connection charges. This paper exposes these fallacies through counterexamples of practical cogeneration system design and evaluation of some segments of the industrial and service sectors in Peninsular Malaysia. The electrical and thermal characteristics of the cogeneration were modeled based on heat rate characteristics at partial loading patterns. A hierarchical mathematical programming approach that uses mixed-integer nonlinear optimization and dynamic programming principle, if necessary, is employed to determine the optimal size of cogeneration and its related auxiliary equipment as well as the optimal operation schedule. Financial assessment is integrated at a later stage to assess the economic viability of the system. Analyses of the cogeneration potential for several facilities of miscellaneous activities were carried out using various gas and electricity prices. Results obtained consistently rebuff the perpetuated fallacies and confirm that there is no real barrier to cogeneration development in Malaysia under current policies of gas prices and electricity tariffs.

It is projected that the UK FIT will stimulate an unprecedented surge in building-mounted turbine installation. The tariff amount must stimulate incentive but mitigate the likelihood of distortions in the competitive electricity market. To analyse these issues, measured energy output from sites in the Warwick Wind Trials Project (WWTP) is converted into revenue in a net-present-value (NPV) framework for assessing commercial purchases of small wind systems. Variances in project variables are examined through NPV simulations using Monte Carlo analysis to capture permutations of small wind-project performance in the UK-with and without the UK FIT. Our research concludes that the proposed tariff amount of 30.5 p/kWh will not significantly boost the economic attractiveness of mildly selective (WWTP-based) sites in the UK. Furthermore, the fixed-tariff rate ((sic)/kWh generated) could cause inefficiencies applied across uneven wind-resource distribution. The results of this study suggest further examination of policy related to micro-generation, in particular decentralised small wind projects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We consider two generating technologies: (1) conventional fossil-fueled technology such as combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), and (2) sunshine-dependent renewable technology such as photovoltaic cells (PV). In the first stage of the model (game), when only the probability distribution functions of future daily electricity demand and sunshine are known, producers maximize their expected profits by determining the CCGT and PV capacity to be constructed. In the second stage, once daily demand and sunshine conditions become known, each producer selects the daily production by each technology, taking the capacities of both technologies as given, and subject to the availability of the PV capacity, which can be used only if the sun is shining. Using real-world data for Israel, we confirm that the introduction of PV technology amplifies price volatility. A large reduction in PV capacity cost increases PV adoption but may also raise the average price. Thus, when considering the promotion of renewable energy to reduce CO2 emissions, regulators should assess the behavior of the electricity market, particularly with respect to characteristics of renewable technologies and demand and supply uncertainties.

The contributions of economic, social, and environmental items were evaluated according to their financial effects in the delay of investments, reduction of production costs and decrement of environmental emissions. The case study is Baja California, Mexico; this system has a unique primary source: geothermal energy. Whether analyzing the planning as usual or planning from the supply side, the forecast for 2005-2025 indicates that 4500 MW additional installed capacity will be required (3-times current capacity), representing an investment that will emit 12.7 Mton per year of CO(2) to the atmosphere and will cost US$2.8 billion. Systemic planning that incorporates polices of energy savings and efficiency allows the reduction of investments and pollutant emissions. For example, a reduction of 20% in the growth trend of the electricity consumption in the industrial customers would save US$10.4 billion over the next 20 years, with a potential reduction of 1.6 Mton/year of CO(2). The increase in geothermal power generation is also attractive, and it can be combined with the reduction of use and energy losses of utilities, which would save US$13.5 billion and prevent the discharge of 8.5 Mton/year of CO(2).

Our field survey of 80 villages in 5 districts conducted in 2008-09 found that 48 villages (60%) are electrified when using the definition of electrification that a village is electrified if any one household in the village is connected to electricity. In the processes of electrification, approximately 40% of villages have been electrified in recent years. The econometric analyses demonstrate that location is the most important determinant of a village's electricity connection. Another important finding is that with the rapid progress of rural electrification under the recent government program and the tendency to connect the villages that are easily accessible, the collective bargaining power of the village, which used to significantly affect the process of electrification, has lost influence. This adversely affects remote villages. In order to extend electricity supplies to remote and geographically disadvantaged villages, the government needs to consider other options for sustainable electricity supply, such as decentralized distribution of electricity rather than the conventional connection through the national/local grids.

This poses another question on the sustainability of electricity supply to rural areas, where the agriculture sector and poor households enjoys subsidized tariffs, costing financial burdens on the government side (for example, World Bank, 2002). Furthermore, several studies indicate that rural electrification with subsidized tariffs unproportionally benefits medium and large farmers, rather than small and marginal farmers (World Bank, 2002: Bhattacharyya, 2006).",,33,51,54,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2011,39.0,6.0,,,,,3086,3095,,10.1016/j.enpol.2011.02.014,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,774UE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291411300009,0

Since 2004, as a result of a boom in energy demand and constrains in energy supply, Argentina has gone through an energy problem mainly related to natural gas and electricity, which derived in energy shutdowns. In this frame, this study explores the role of energy policy and institutions in Argentina, with the aim of discussing whether it has been properly used to contrast the observed lack of coordination between fossil energy reserves management and the demand of fuels in power generation. The results of the analysis enhance the relevance of regulatory and control authorities, as well as the active use of long run energy policy for the energy system performance in order to avoid coordination failures between subsectors of the system. The relevance of energy consumption for the development process, and the particular characteristics of energy systems require a wide planning perspective. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We conduct a study on the potential for reducing global energy-related CO(2) emissions from electricity production through simple benchmarking. This is performed based on the last four performance indicators and the construction of a cumulative curve for each of these indicators. It is found that global CO(2) emissions from electricity production would be reduced by 19% if all these indicators are benchmarked at the 50th percentile. Not surprisingly, the emission reduction potential measured in absolute terms is the highest for large countries such as China, India, Russia and the United States. When the potential is expressed as a percentage of a country's own emissions, few of these countries appear in the top-five list. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Ang, B. W.; Tay, L.

Diesel-generated electricity was substituted, causing electricity prices to increase 500% for 45 days. Electricity demand fell by 25% during the supply disruption. Most of the reduction occurred before the higher rates were implemented. Some conservation - about 8% of historic consumption - persisted after the transmission line was repaired and prices returned to normal. Consumers reduced energy use through a combination of new habits and technical improvements. A survey of residential consumers indicated that the average household undertook 10 conservation actions, with major changes in lighting, space heating, fuel switching, and water and appliance use. We propose a method for prioritizing conservation actions for promotion according to their impact in electricity savings (as a function of popularity, effectiveness, and persistence) and a dynamic framework for electricity use before, during, and after a supply disruption (i.e., both the magnitude and rates of change in electricity conservation).

This is a significant contribution because electricity forward premiums have been previously explained exclusively by the assumptions of perfect competition and risk-averse behavior while spot markups are generally the outcome of a body of literature assuming oligopolistic competition. Our theoretical framework indicates that a certain premium for forward contracting is required for efficient allocation of generation capacity. However, due to the uniqueness of electricity and the design of deregulated electricity markets this premium might be substantially higher than its optimal level. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we discuss methods of addressing the variability of WWS energy to ensure that power supply reliably matches demand (including interconnecting geographically dispersed resources, using hydroelectricity, using demand-response management, storing electric power on site, over-sizing peak generation capacity and producing hydrogen with the excess, storing electric power in vehicle batteries, and forecasting weather to project energy supplies), the economics of WWS generation and transmission, the economics of WWS use in transportation, and policy measures needed to enhance the viability of a WWS system. We find that the cost of energy in a 100% WWS will be similar to the cost today.

By 'critical needs' we mean products that are essential to the survival of the population, which can include, for example, vaccines, medicine, food, water, etc., depending upon the particular application. 'Critical' implies that the demand for the product should be met as nearly as possible since otherwise there may be additional loss of life. The model that we develop captures a single organization, such as the government or a major health organization or corporation that seeks to 'produce' the product at several possible manufacturing plants, have it stored, if needs be, and distributed to the demand points. We assume that the organization is aware of the total costs associated with the various operational supply chain network activities, knows the existing capacities of the links, and is interested in identifying the additional capacity outlays, the production amounts, and shipment values so that the demand is satisfied with associated penalties if the demand is not met (as well as penalties with oversupply, which are expected to be lower). In addition, the organization has the option of outsourcing the production/storage/delivery of the critical product at a fixed/negotiated price and with the capacities of those entities being fixed and known. The solution of the model provides the optimal capacity enhancements and volumes of product flows so as to minimize the total cost, which we assume to be a generalized cost, and can include time, subject to the demands being satisfied, as nearly as possible, under demand uncertainty.","[Nagurney, Anna; Yu, Min] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Finance & Operat Management, Isenberg Sch Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Qiang, Qiang] Penn State Univ, Management Div, Great Valley Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Nagurney, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Finance & Operat Management, Isenberg Sch Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",nagurney@gbfin.umass.edu; myu@som.umass.edu; qzq10@gv.psu.edu,,"Qiang, Qiang/0000-0002-9071-3236",,,,,39,44,51,0,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

However despite the fact that tradable permits' system is not a common regulatory measure but an instrument which provides also certain decision-making and action freedom to companies participating therein, tradable permits' systems mostly are considered only from the policy making perspective. The goal of this paper is to analyse the participation in the international tradable permits' system as an opportunity for company's development. Within this paper tradable permits' systems are viewed from the perspective of companies, exploring the mechanism of tradable permits' systems, identifying principal types of strategies for company's direct participation in the tradable permits' systems and describing tools for their implementation and factors for their selection as well as outlining tradable permits' systems' impact on companies' development. At the end of the paper it is concluded that participation in the tradable permits' system can be an opportunity for company's development however in order to ensure this positive effect in long-term perspective company must use an appropriate strategy.","[Pruse, Ilze] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, LV-2167 Marupe, Marupes Nov, Latvia",,,Ilze.Pruse@yahoo.com,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-363-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,394,403,,,,,,10,"Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BB5ET,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000343756100053,0

This paper reviews recent research efforts in the area of land reform in the developing world, and evaluates comparatively different planning approaches per country. The historical antecedents, socio-economic circumstances, legal framework, and different degrees of governmental intervention influencing access to land in the countryside are covered. A snapshot of the empirical findings in a group of developing countries highlights the need to adopt systematically regional planning strategies that are able to maximize the positive socio-economic impacts of the schemes. It is also concluded that a combination of market and non-market approaches to land reform could be beneficial for developmental purposes.","[Souza, Saulo S.; Silva, Elisabete A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Souza, Saulo S.] Univ Cambridge, Darwin Coll, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Silva, Elisabete A.] Univ Cambridge, Robinson Coll, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Souza, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",ssds2@cam.ac.uk; es424@cam.ac.uk,"Silva, Elisabete/C-8975-2011","Silva, Elisabete/0000-0002-5816-6447",,,,,45,2,4,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Energy productivity change is first decomposed into five components attributable to changes in capital-energy ratio, labor-energy ratio, output structure, and technical efficiency change and technological change. Then a nonparametric analysis is implemented to statistically test the relative contributions of the components and their roles in the distribution dynamics of energy productivity. It is found that (1) changes in capital-energy ratio, output structure, and technological change contribute to energy productivity growth in China, (2) increase in capital-energy ratio caused by capital accumulation is the primary driving force for energy productivity growth, and (3) capital accumulation contributes to energy productivity convergence between Chinese provinces over the time period of 1990-2005.

This area is made up of a system of built-up patches hierarchically organised around a city centre, and green areas arranged in an inverse hierarchical order (large open-spaces in the periphery). An analytical solution is obtained using a specific geographic coding system for computing distances. The values of the parameters used in the model are based on the French medium sized metropolitan areas; a realistic benchmark is proposed and comparative-statics simulations are performed. The results show that the French peri-urbanisation process (which took place from 1970 onward) can be explained by an increase in income and a reduction in transport costs. Nevertheless, changes in household preferences, in particular an increased taste for open spaces, can also contribute to urban sprawl by making the gradient of land rents less steep and by making peripheral household locations more desirable.","[Cavailhes, Jean] UMR INRA ENESAD CESAER, F-21079 Dijon, France; [Peeters, Dominique] Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Geog, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Peeters, Dominique] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Thomas, Isabelle] Catholic Univ Louvain, Belgium Natl Fund Sci Res, Dept Geog, Brussels, Belgium; [Thomas, Isabelle] Catholic Univ Louvain, Belgium Natl Fund Sci Res, CORE, Brussels, Belgium; [Frankhauser, Pierre] Univ Franche Comte, CNRS UMR TheMA 6049, F-25030 Besancon, France",INRAE; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite de Franche-Comte,"Cavailhès, J (通讯作者)，UMR INRA ENESAD CESAER, 26 Blvd Docteur,BP 87999, F-21079 Dijon, France.",Jean.Cavailhes@enesad.inra.fr,"Thomas, Ian S/B-8253-2011","Frankhauser, Pierre/0000-0001-6600-6972; THOMAS, Isabelle/0000-0003-3386-2427",,,,,50,13,14,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

A review of Spanish State legislation on renewable energies confirms that the success in installing renewable energy is attributable to public aid. Andalusia is one of the autonomous communities, which has simultaneously developed the legal framework and very successfully implemented the introduction of renewable power. When implementing the central government's policy, the Andalusian regional government prioritised increases in both surface cover by wind and solar plants (thermal and photovoltaic energy) and in the number of companies involved. However, this development of renewable energies took place without any proper integration into regional spatial and landscape planning. This paper explores renewable power implementation in Andalusia through regulatory measures put in place over the last decade to develop renewable energy systems and the way they can be managed alongside planning issues. The location of large-scale renewable plants has had consequences for territory in the socio-political context of renewable energy promotion. The main findings focus on renewable energy plant sprawl throughout rural areas in Andalusia with no clear effect on landscape management and no firm backing from the local population.

However, a number of recent publications indicate that emission reductions may also have been achieved because production has been shifted to other countries, and in particular China. If a consumption perspective is applied, emissions in industrialized countries are substantially higher, and may not have declined at all. Significantly, emissions from transports are omitted in consumption-based calculations. As all trade involves transport, mostly by cargo ship, but also by air, transports add considerably to overall emissions growth incurred in production shifts. Consequently, this article studies the role of transports in creating emissions of CO2, based on the example of exports from China.

It screens EU energy policies, EU regulatory policies and EU spending policies. Key questions addressed are as follows: to what extent is the current policy framework conducive to hydrogen and fuel cell development? What barriers and inconsistencies can be identified? How can policies potentially promote hydrogen and fuel cells in Europe, taking into account the complex evolution of such a potentially disruptive technology? How should the EU policy framework be reformed in view of a strengthened and more coherent approach towards full deployment, taking into account recent technology-support activities? This paper concludes that the current EU policy framework does not hinder hydrogen development. Yet it does not constitute a strong push factor either. EU energy policies have the strongest impact on hydrogen and fuel cell development even though their potential is still underexploited. Regulatory policies have a weak but positive impact on hydrogen. EU spending policies show some inconsistencies. However, the large-scale market development of hydrogen and fuel cells will require a new policy approach which comprises technology-specific support as well as a supportive policy framework with a special regional dimension.

Second, the circuit that perpetuates rentier logic is described, the main conclusion being that the Algerian economy does indeed offer the very conditions that guarantee the self-perpetuation of rentierism. However, this conclusion is jeopardized by uncertainties stemming from two potential changes in the national status of the hydrocarbons sector: a greater presence of foreign hydrocarbon companies in Algeria, and growing internationalization by Sonatrach.

Semantics explain a large stake of conflict between advocate and critical voices on peak oil. From a holistic sources-sinks perspective, limited carrying capacity of atmospheric sinks, not absolute scarcity in oil resources, will impose tight constraints on oil use. Eventually observed peaks in oil production in nearby years will result from politically imposed limits on carbon emissions, and not be caused by physical lack of oil resources. Peak-oil belief induces passive climate policy attitudes when suggesting carbon dioxide emissions will peak naturally linked to dwindling oil supplies. Active policies for reducing emissions and use of fossil fuels will also encompass higher energy end-use prices. Revenues obtained from higher levies on oil use can support financing energy efficiency and renewable energy options. But when oil producers charge the higher prices they can pump new oil for many decades, postponing peak oil to occur while extending carbon lock-in. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In Denmark, high renewable shares have been achieved without great difficulty, mainly due to the flexibility of the nearby Nordic hydro-power dominated system. Further increases in the share of renewable energy sources require that additional options are considered to facilitate integration with the lowest possible cost. With large shares of intermittent energy, the impact can be observed on wholesale prices, giving both lower prices and higher volatility. A lack of wind that causes high prices is rarely seen because long periods without wind are uncommon. Therefore we focus on the low price effects and the increased value of flexible demand options. On the supply side, there is an increase in the value of other flexible generation technologies and the attractiveness of additional interconnection capacity. This paper also analyses options for increasing the flexibility of heat generation involving large and decentralized CHP plants and heat generation based on electricity. The incentives that the market provides for shifting demand and using electricity for heat production are discussed based on the variability of prices observed from 2006 to 2008.

While competition can be promoted in the generation/production and supply side of the vertical integration, transmission and distribution segments remain natural monopolies that hinder market mechanisms. Vertical integration simply raises the possibility for incumbents to favor their own divisions and to block new entrants. As a result, non-discriminatory and equal access to the electricity and gas transmission and distribution networks, also LNG and storage facilities, is crucial to foster competition in politically delicate structures of the electricity and gas markets.

Four structural flaws associated with the RET which undermine its effectiveness as a catalyst for technological change in the electricity sector are discussed: (i) the inclusion of waste coal mine gas (WCMG) as an eligible fuel source which acts as an indirect coal industry subsidy, (ii) program duration which is too short and ill-structured, (iii) a multiplier that is well-intended to support small-scale renewable technologies but which creates phantom capacity, and (iv) the capped target of 45,000 GWh which will stymie long-term wind power market investment. The paper concludes with recommendations which stress the importance of passing effective Carbon Pollution Renewable Scheme (CPRS) legislation to offset the weaknesses associated with the RET. If an effective CPRS cannot be implemented, the paper recommends that amendments be made to the RET to (i) remove WCMG from the list of approved alternative energy sources, and (ii) extend the RET targets to reach 120,000 GWh by 2030.

Such expectations are likely to be overly optimistic. A realistic examination of grid parity suggests that the cost-effectiveness of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems may be further away than many are hoping for. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness may not guarantee commercial competitiveness. Solar hot water technology is currently far more cost-effective than photovoltaic technology and has already reached grid parity in many places. Nevertheless, the market penetration of solar water heaters remains limited for reasons including unfamiliarity with the technologies and high upfront costs. These same barriers will likely hinder the adoption of distributed solar photovoltaic systems as well. The rapid growth in PV deployment in recent years is largely policy-driven and such rapid growth would not be sustainable unless governments continue to expand financial incentives and policy mandates, as well as address regulatory and market barriers.

The approach is designed to take into account the characteristics of power production from both renewable and conventional sources, including the technological and economic characteristics of existing plants as well as those of future capacity expansion options. Beyond that, fuel supply structures are modelled, as well as the international markets for power and CO(2)-certificates with their restrictions. Thus, a profound evaluation of the exploitation of mid-term renewable potentials and an assessment of the market penetration of the various renewable power generation technologies under the (normative) premise of a cost-optimised evolution of the power system becomes possible. Results show that a promotion of renewable energies reduces the scarcity of CO(2)-emission allowances and thus lowers marginal costs of CO(2) reduction up to 30% in 2030. Despite the higher overall costs, a diversification of the energy resource base by RES-E use is observed, as primarily natural gas and nuclear fuels are replaced. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Focus groups were conducted in two separate phases: the first, involving nine groups, took place between June 2005 and March 2006; the second, involving seven groups, took place in the period October-November 2006, mainly with groups reconvened after the first phase. They presented to participants 'user-friendly' information about possible scenarios for a hydrogen economy, and helped the group to identify criteria that might be most salient for decision-makers. Public awareness of hydrogen in the three case study areas, both in general and in relation to local demonstration projects, proved minimal, with the exception of the few who had direct experience of the chemical industry (in Teesside and South West Wales). When engaged in an informed debate about hydrogen and its future possible developments, participants were willing to learn about the different options and expected to be fully informed on how these would impact on their everyday lives as consumers and citizens. Risk perception is important, but not the only factor in lay understanding of hydrogen. More relevant is the extent to which the different configurations of hydrogen systems align with the public's 'view of the world' (social and environmental values, needs and expectations) and how participants think hydrogen energy would be embedded in their daily routines. There is a lack of trust in political authorities, business and industry, and within and across different social groups; ambivalence in how trust is placed on information providers, role models and opinion formers; and public unease in dealing with, and making sense of, conflicting information coming from 'expert' sources. The evidence is useful to inform policy, both on national and local level. It is especially useful in addressing public engagement as a political strategy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The most important contributions of this paper are the clear description of the systematic process of energy utilization efficiency, the efficiency comparison between China and Taiwan, the remarkable demonstration of their outputs through two non-desirable outputs (CO2 emissions and SO2 emissions) in the data envelopment analysis framework, and the valuable results and insights gained from the application of economic development and environmental protection. Empirical results show that the Eastern region of China enjoy higher energy utilization efficiency than the Western region. Energy utilization efficiency in Taiwan is higher than that in the Eastern region of China. In China, CO2 emissions were 11.28% greater than they should be (from 2002 to 2007). By contrast, CO2 emissions in Taiwan were only 1.50% in excess of what they should be since Taiwan began conducting an uninterrupted energy-saving policy and a CO2 emission regulation policy (Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, 2009). Finally, this study employs the business strategy matrix constructed by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG Matrix) to illustrate individual evidence of the relationship between economic development efficiency and greenhouse gas efficiency.

The problem studied was a historic data set covering 1 week of operations involving 66 pilot assignments and 21 pilots. A column generation approach was adapted. It includes the solving of shortest path problems in time-space graphs. Postprocessing is applied to handle legality constraints, which involve maximum work time shifts and minimum rest times in between.

Just-in-Time manufacturing systems, subcontracting and geographic proximity, Regional Studies. The paper studies the spatial extent of subcontracting linkages for a sample of medium-sized and large Spanish manufacturing firms operating in the automotive and electronics industries. In particular, it analyses how Just-in-Time (JIT) organization of production is related to the spatial pattern of these sourcing relationships when contractors' structural and organizational characteristics, as well as contract characteristics, are taken into account. It is found that firms that implement new technologies and manufacturing systems at the plant level tend to prefer regional to extra-regional outsourcing. This is consistent with Just-in-Time's reliance on flexibility in ordering and quick and frequent deliveries, as well as reliable arrival times, to guarantee the disruption-free production which proximity can facilitate. The results support the view that Just-in-Time, in the context of production subcontracting, increases the importance of proximity.","[Holl, Adelheid] FEDEA, E-28001 Madrid, Spain; [Pardo, Rafael] Fdn BBVA, E-28001 Madrid, Spain; [Rama, Ruth] Spanish Natl Res Council, CCHS CSIC, Inst Econ & Geog, E-28037 Madrid, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC),"Holl, A (通讯作者)，FEDEA, C Jorge Juan 46, E-28001 Madrid, Spain.",a.holl@fedea.es; rpardo@stanford.edu; ruth.rama@cchs.csic.es,"Holl, Adelheid/GXH-7017-2022; Holl, Adelheid/E-9628-2016; Rama, Ruth/K-6688-2014","Holl, Adelheid/0000-0003-4045-9468; Rama, Ruth/0000-0003-0193-473X",,,,,69,13,17,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

Mildly favorable betting opportunities are revealed. More generally, the proposed methods offer a flexible approach to conditional density forecasting for a broad class of applications.

The target for 2020 is to produce 30% of the electricity from renewable energies. Wind power has been selected to be a major contributor to this change. Replacing old wind turbines by modern ones and building new turbines on land will be crucial in meeting this target. However, the expansion of onshore wind power is not universally accepted. In several regions of Germany residents are protesting against setting up new wind turbines. To determine the negative effects two choice experiments were applied in Westsachsen and Nordhessen, Germany. In both regions the externalities of wind power generation until 2020 based on today's state of technology were measured. The results show that negative landscape externalities would result from expanding wind power generation.

However, the CDM market has been increasingly criticised, resulting in a lively debate about how to reform, complement, or replace it. In order to increase transparency and assist policy-makers in better understanding the current market, we depart from the traditional project-level perspective on CDM and analyse commercial activities by utilising data from UNEP Risoe's CDM Bazaar. To this end, we first establish a seven-step value chain by conducting a factor analysis on the commercial activities indicated in the Bazaar and, second, identify nine prevalent business models with a cluster analysis of all 495 participating organisations. Based on these analyses. we discuss potential impacts on the value chain of different policy scenarios that rely on carbon credits as incentive. We find that the importance of specific regulatory CDM know-how and general business activities such as finance varies strongly with the different policy scenarios. Our analysis serves to sensitise policy-makers and business about implications of different regulatory designs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

M., Vinodrai T., Gertler M. S. and Wolfe D. A. Do clusters make a difference? Defining and assessing their economic performance, Regional Studies. This paper contributes to the literature on cluster dynamics by developing a new methodology for identifying clusters that is not dependent on United States-based definitions. This methodology is used to test if the geographical clustering of economic activities leads to superior industrial performance and regional competitiveness. The analysis produces two important findings. First, when industries locate in an urban region with a critical mass of related industries, they tend to generate both higher incomes and rates of employment growth. Second, the overall prevalence of clustering within a city-region is positively associated with income levels and employment growth.","[Spencer, Gregory M.; Gertler, Meric S.; Wolfe, David A.] Univ Toronto, Program Globalizat & Reg Innovat Syst, Munk Ctr Int Studies, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada; [Vinodrai, Tara] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Vinodrai, Tara] Univ Waterloo, Ctr Environm & Business, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Spencer, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Program Globalizat & Reg Innovat Syst, Munk Ctr Int Studies, 1 Devonshire Pl, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada.",greg.spencer@utoronto.ca; tvinodra@uwaterloo.ca; meric.gertler@utoronto.ca; david.wolfe@utoronto.ca,"Gertler, Meric S/E-5521-2013; Vinodrai, Tara/U-6026-2019; Wolfe, David A/A-9383-2008; Spencer, Gregory M/B-8179-2012; Vinodrai, Tara/AFK-0901-2022","Vinodrai, Tara/0000-0002-5734-7473; Vinodrai, Tara/0000-0002-5734-7473",,,,,57,114,132,3,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This work reviews the environmental, social and economic constraints on key feedstocks for UK heat, power and transport fuel. Key sustainability constraints include greenhouse gas savings achieved for different fuels, land availability, air quality impacts and facility siting. Applying those constraints, we estimate that existing technologies would facilitate a sustainability constrained level of medium-term bioenergy/biofuel supply to the UK of 4.9% of total energy demand, broken down into 4.3% of heat demands, 4.3% of electricity, and 5.8% of transport fuel. This suggests that attempts to increase the supply above these levels could have counterproductive sustainability impacts in the absence of compensating technology developments or identification of additional resources. The barriers that currently prevent this level of supply being achieved have been analysed and classified. This suggests that the biggest policy impacts would be in stimulating the market for heat demand in rural areas, supporting feedstock prices in a manner that incentivised efficient use/maximum greenhouse gas savings and targeting investment capital that improves yield and reduces land-take.

Despite having a huge comparative advantage in land, labour and good climatic conditions favourable for the growing of energy crops, few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have included biofuels strategies in their energy or national development policies. Further results show that while developed countries commit huge financial resources for research, technology development and the provision of tax-incentives to both producers and consumers, there is little government support for promoting biofuels in Africa. Although the consequences of biofuels on food supply remain uncertain, the mandatory blending of biofuels with fossil fuels by industrialized countries will create demand for land in Africa for the growing of energy crops for biofuels. This paper urgently calls upon national governments in Sub-Saharan Africa to develop appropriate strategies and regulatory frameworks to harness the potential economic opportunities from biofuels sector development, while protecting the environment and rural communities from the adverse effects of land alienation from the mainstream agriculture towards the growing of energy crops for biofuels at the expense of traditional food crops.

Growth in global goods movement not only translates into growth in commercial trucking activity but also into growth in the share of trucking compared to other modes of in-country freight transportation. These trends have a significant impact on the energy intensity of freight transport. Using a bottom-up approach relying on national data, this study compares the energy intensity of truck freight in Australia, France, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States from 1973 to the present. The analysis builds on previous work by Schipper et al. (1997) and Schipper and Marie-Lilliu (1999) decomposing energy use for freight. Intensity is expressed in terms of vehicle intensity (megajoules/vehicle-kilometer), modal energy intensity (megajoules/tonne-kilometer), and carbon intensity (grams/tonne-km). The cross-country comparison highlights in part the influence of geography, transportation infrastructure, and truck utilization patterns on energy and carbon intensity from this sector. While improving fuel economy of individual vehicles is very important, large reductions in trucking energy use and emissions will also come from better logistics and driving, higher load factors, and better matching of truck capacity to load.

However, with rapidly growing populations, sustained high productivity and yields through improving water productivity is critically important. Increasingly complex energy-agriculture relationships require an in-depth understanding of water and energy tradeoffs. This study contributes to energy and food policies by analysing the complex energy, water and economics dynamics across a selection of major rice growing countries. The results show that tradeoffs exist between yield and energy inputs with high yield attributed to higher levels of energy input. The selected developed countries show higher energy productivity, relative to all other energy inputs, compared to the selected developing counties, owing to enhanced mechanisation, on-farm technology and improved farm management. Among all countries, China has the highest water productivity due to water-saving irrigation practices. These practices offer opportunities for developed and developing countries to increase water productivity at the same time taking advantage of economic and energy benefits of reduced pumping. Sustained production from agriculture is vital to food security. Improved irrigation practices can offset environmental footprints in the short run but their large-scale implementation remains an issue. In the long run, investments are needed to buffer the negative impacts of food production on the environment. Investments to boost water productivity and improved energy use efficiency in crop production are two pathways to reduce energy dependency, enhanced natural resource sustainability and ensuring future food security.

We examine in- and out-flows of patent citations as a proxy of knowledge connections, while looking also at their dynamics through time. The econometric analysis is based on a model where the exchange of knowledge across regions is mainly affected by geographical distance together with a set of spatial variables. The main result is that knowledge flows decrease as the geographical distance between the origin and the destination region increase. Furthermore, knowledge flows tend to be higher among contiguous regions and areas within the same country. These results prove to be robust with respect to the inclusion of other characteristics of the origin and destination regions (production structure, economic conditions and technological efforts) as well as different estimation methods.","[Paci, Raffaele; Usai, Stefano] Univ Cagliari, CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Paci, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy.",paci@unica.it; stefanousai@unica.it,"Usai, Stefano/GPK-7547-2022","Usai, Stefano/0000-0001-5619-1350; PACI, RAFFAELE/0000-0003-0301-438X",,,,,36,59,60,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The objective considered in the design is economical to maximise the net present value (NPV) of the system. A control strategy has been applied so that hydrogen is only produced by the electrolyser when there is an excess of electrical energy that cannot be exported to the grid (intermittent production of hydrogen). Several optimisation studies based on different scenarios have been carried out. After studying the results - for systems with which the produced hydrogen would be sold for external consumption - it can be stated that the selling price of hydrogen should be about 10 (sic)/kg in areas with strong wind, in order to get economically viable systems. For the hydrogen-producing systems in which hydrogen is produced when there is an excess of electricity and then stored and later used in a fuel cell to produce electricity to be sold to the grid, even in areas with high wind speed rate, the price of electrical energy produced by the fuel cell should be very high for the system to be profitable.

By employing a techno-economic analysis approach, we demonstrate that the current BEE standard implemented in the Chinese cities should be tightened further in order to achieve a socially optimal level. Without considering the externality costs associated with carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, current BEE standards need to be upgraded to the equivalent level of French RT2005 standard coupled with a properly designed district coal-fired Combined Heat and Power (CHP). In contrast, the equivalent efficiency standard of Swedish building code is preferably to be implemented in the case of explicit carbon emission restriction as long as the marginal cost of carbon emission (carbon price) is sufficiently high. The fuel-switching policy (from coal to natural gas) in the urban district heating system would result in significant increase in overall costs if the BEE upgrade is not taken into account simultaneously. It is also found that BEE improvements in northern Chinese cities are more cost-effective than investing in low-carbon technologies such as wind power or Carbon Capture and storage in the EU and US with regard to CO2 emissions mitigation.

The latter is of particular importance in electricity sector given the continuously increasing use of gas for electricity generation. In order to properly tackle with the problem, concerted actions are required by the EU Member States in several levels, i.e. legislative, political, etc. Nevertheless, these actions will come at an additional cost paid by the society either through increased electricity bills or through public financing for energy security investments. Thus, such policies should be justified on the basis of cost-benefit analysis. Towards this direction, it may be necessary to take into account non-market costs and benefits, i.e. the value that consumers place on interruptions avoided. In order to explore households' perceptions and willingness to pay for securing gas supply for electricity production, an empirical study was conducted by means of the contingent valuation method. The results indicate that consumers are willing to pay a premium on their electricity bills in order to internalize the external costs of electricity production, in terms of energy security, which are caused from imported fuels.

The principal compliance options for power companies under the cap-and-trade include the application of direct CO2 emission abatement and the procurement of emission allowances. The objective of this paper is to provide an analytical framework for assessing the cost-effectiveness of these options. We attempt to derive the marginal abatement cost for CO2 using the output distance function and analyze the relative advantages of emission allowance procurement option as compared to direct abatement option. Real-option approach is adopted to incorporate emission allowance price uncertainty. Empirical result shows the marginal abatement cost with an average of (sic)14.04/ton CO2 for fossil-fueled power plants and confirms the existence of substantial cost heterogeneity among plants which is sufficient to achieve trading gains in allowance market. The comparison of two options enables us to identify the optimal position of the compliance for each plant. Sensitivity analyses are also presented with regard to several key parameters including the initial allowance prices and interest rate. The result of this paper may help Korean power plants to prepare for upcoming regulations targeted toward the reduction of domestic greenhouse gases. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is supported by the empirical results of a Delphi survey that we have conducted to investigate storage service provision and regulation in Italy, We argue that the Italian storage sector is at a crossroads. The policy-driven phase of liberalization is ending and the market-driven phase has just begun. The former phase has granted fair access to storage, narrowed the likelihood of strategic behaviour by the incumbent and secured residential users against supply disruptions, but it has proved dynamically inefficient. Cost-reflective tariffs and low penalties for unbalances have both lowered incentives to expand the range of flexibility tools and penalized industrial customers demand. The market-driven phase has just started. The expected increase in working capacity and the entry of newcomers in the authorization process for new facilities are a progress towards the commercial use of storage. To this end, however, a further change in gas market design is needed: the creation of a well functioning spot market. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The rapidly growing market for wind has been a double-edged sword, however, as the resulting supply-demand imbalance in wind turbines, along with the rising cost of materials and weakness in the US dollar, has put upward pressure on wind turbine costs, and ultimately, wind power prices. Two mitigating factors-reductions in the cost of equity provided to wind projects and improvements in project-level capacity factors-have helped to relieve some of the upward pressure on wind power prices over the last few years.

More originally, the paper assesses significant, though often overlooked, social barriers to the wider use of PHEVs (a likely precursor to V2G) and implementation of a V2G transition. The article disputes the idea that the only important barriers facing the greater use of PHEVs and V2G systems are technical. Instead, it provides a broader assessment situating such technical barriers alongside more subtle impediments relating to social and cultural values, business practices, and political interests. The history of other energy transitions, and more specifically the history of renewable energy technologies, implies that these socio-technical obstacles may be just as important to any V2G transition-and perhaps even more difficult to overcome. Analogously, the article illuminates the policy implications of such barriers, emphasizing what policymakers need to achieve a transition to a V2G and PHEV world. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The work follows the methodology described in Svensson et al. [Svensson, E., Berntsson, T., Stromberg, A.-B., Patriksson, M., 2008b. An optimization methodology for identifying robust process integration investments under uncertainty. Energy Policy, in press, doi:10.1016/j.enpol.2008.10.023] where a scenario-based approach is proposed for the modelling of uncertainties. The results show that the proposed methodology provides a way to handle the time dependence and the uncertainties of the parameters. For the analyzed case, a robust solution is found which turns out to be a combination of two opposing investment strategies. The difference between short-term and strategic views for the investment decision is analyzed and it is found that uncertainties are increasingly important to account for as a more strategic view is employed. Furthermore, the results imply that the obvious effect of policy instruments aimed at decreasing CO(2) emissions is, in applications like this, an increased profitability for all energy efficiency investments, and not as much a shift between different alternatives.

Turkey is a rapidly growing country; both its population and economy are expanding each year so its energy demand increases correspondingly and this increasing demand has to be met for keeping sustainable development in the economy and raising living conditions of mankind. Although Turkey has many energy sources, it is a big energy importer. Turkey has a lot of potential to supply its own energy, which could be put to use in order to avoid this energy dependence. Additionally, Turkey is a country that has an abundance of renewable energy sources and can essentially provide all energy requirements from indigenous energy sources. Biomass is one of the most promising energy sources considered to be alternative to conventional ones. This paper investigates the importance of biomass energy in Turkey. Additionally, the potential of biomass and its utilization in Turkey are presented in detail. Turkey has always been one of the major agricultural countries of the world. The importance of agriculture is increasing due to biomass energy being a major resource of Turkey. Like many developing countries, Turkey relies on biomass to satisfy much of its energy requirements. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus on two broad areas, namely regulatory issues related to the organisation/structuring of the activities and issues related to subsidy and tariffs. The paper looks into the alternative organisational arrangements being used by the programme and identifies problem areas through a responsibility mapping. The tariff principle being followed by the programme is then analysed considering the alternative organisational forms and issues related to such pricing policies are identified. Possible alternative pricing options are then suggested. The paper finds that while the franchisee model is an innovative idea, it raises issues that the regulators should be concerned with. The programme has so far relied on the simplest franchisee model because of its ease of implementation but a transition to more complex alternatives would require careful considerations.

Based on the reality that coal will remain the predominant fuel to generate electricity and conventional pulverized coal boiler power plants have serious impacts on environment degradation, development of clean coal technologies could be one alternative to meet China's fast growing demand of electricity as well as protect the already fragile environment. A multi-period market equilibrium model is applied and an electricity model of China is established to forecast changes in the electricity system up to 2030s. Three policy instruments: SO2 emission charge, CO2 emission charge and implementing subsidies are considered in this research. The results show that all instruments cause a significant shift in China's electricity structure, promote CCTs' competitiveness and lead China to gain great benefit in both resource saving and environment improvement. Since resource security and environment degradation are becoming primary concerns in China, policies that could help to gain generations' market share of advanced coal-based technologies such as CCs' is suitable for the current situation of China's electricity sector.

The bigger the technical disparity between the high potential enterprise and the low potential enterprise is, the quicker technology proliferation and knowledge overflow will occur; on the contrary, the smaller the technical disparity between the high potential enterprise and the low potential enterprise is, the slower technology proliferation and knowledge overflow will occur. Therefore, this kind of mechanism is helpful for enterprises in an industry cluster to learn from each other and to enable each enterprise close to the the average level of technology or knowledge.

Then we set up a BVAR-TVP (Time varying parameter) model to analyze dynamic impacts of core factors on oil price. The results show that: (1) oil prices became more sensitive to oil supply changes, and the influence delays became shorter; (2) the impact of oil inventories on oil prices with a time lag of two quarters but has a downward trend; (3) the impact of oil consumption on oil prices with a time lag of two quarters, and this effect is increasingly greater; (4) the US dollar index is always the important factor of oil price and its control power increases gradually, and the financial crisis (occurred in 2008) further strengthens the influence of US dollar.

This research attempts to analyze the traction energy cost and transport operation time per 10,000 passenger-kilometers of high-speed railway (HSR) trains with a range of target speeds on certain HSR lines in China through a simulation approach. Having considered the effect of inter-stop transport distances, traction characteristics of HSR trains and gradients, curvatures, etc. of the rail lines, this study has deduced that the target speed of a HSR train for an inter-stop transport distance shorter than 100 km should be below 190 km/h from the perspectives of traction energy saving and transport efficiency improvement. Moreover, the study results also indicate that, unlike the actual HSR operation, the target speed should be dynamically adjusted according to the transport distances between stops if the transport capacity of the rail line is not extensively used. The exact target speed for each inter-stop transport distance shorter than 100 km should be further determined according to the traction characteristics of the train and the track geometry of the rail line.

Besides the fundamental differences between different types of policies and abatement options which inherently result in different CEA outcomes, differences in methodological choices and assumptions are another important source of variation in CEA outcomes. Fourteen methodological issues clustered into six groups are identified on which thirty-three selected studies are systematically reviewed. The potential variation between lower and upper cost-effectiveness estimates for GHG mitigation measures in transport, resulting from different methodological choices and assumptions, lies in the order of $400 per tonne CO2-eq. The practise of using CEA for policy-making could improve considerably by clearly indicating the specific purpose of the CEA and its strengths and limitations for policy decisions. Another improvement is related to the dominant approach in transport GHG mitigation studies: the bottom-up financial technical approach which assesses isolated effects, implying considerable limitations for policy-making. A shift to welfare-economic approaches using a hybrid model has the potential to establish an improved assessment of transport GHG mitigation measures based on realistic market responses and behavioural change.

Energy consumers were segmented based on their energy-related behavioral characteristics. In addition to purchase- and curtailment-related energy-saving behavior, consumer classification was also based on acceptance of policy measures and energy-related psychosocial factors, so the used behavioral segmentation base was more comprehensive compared to other studies. Furthermore, differentiation between the energy-saving purchase of daily products, such as food, and of energy efficient appliances allowed a more differentiated characterization of the energy consumer segments. The cluster analysis revealed six energy consumer segments: the idealistic, the selfless inconsequent, the thrifty, the materialistic, the convenience-oriented indifferent, and the problem-aware well-being-oriented energy consumer. Findings emphasize that using a broader and more distinct behavioral base is crucial for an adequate and differentiated description of energy consumer types. The paper concludes by highlighting the most promising energy consumer segments and discussing possible segment-specific marketing and policy strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, what constitutes a subsidy is complex and controversial. The IEA in its last World Energy Outlook claimed that Saudi Arabia was second in the world in terms of its levels of subsidy on domestic energy prices. However, because Saudi Arabia is a price maker in the international oil market, the methodology used by the IEA is seriously flawed. This paper explains the problems with the methodology for computing subsidies and explains the correct method in the case of Saudi Arabia. It then attempts to measure the levels of subsidy in Saudi Arabia using this methodology.

We model an overlapping generations economy in which firms have access to a CES production technology combining the natural resource, physical capital and labor. Our results shed light on the interplay between the resource bequest motive and the substitutability/complementarity relationship between capital and the natural resource in the determination of the equilibrium propensity to use the resource. The mere existence of the bequest motive does not guarantee that the resource will be conserved in the long run. When the resource is highly substitutable with capital, the equilibrium actually never exhausts the resource stock whatever the intensity of the bequest motive. When the resource is a poor substitute for capital, the equilibrium preserves the resource only if the taste for bequeathing is strong enough. Be the economy in over-accumulation or in under-accumulation of the natural resource, it always increases aggregate consumption to run the stock of capital at a level lower than the efficiency level.

It examines the possible paths that future energy use and policy in Australia could take, including published projections based largely on a business as usual approach and projections based on a dramatic shift towards more efficient use of energy and renewable energy technologies. It also considers the various factors affecting future policy direction, including energy security, the advocacy in Australia for establishing nuclear electricity generation and other parts of the nuclear fuel-cycle, responses to climate change, and carbon sequestration. It concludes that while the Australian Government is currently reluctant to move away from a dependence on coal, and unlikely to adopt nuclear energy generation, a low-emissions future without waiting for the deployment of carbon capture and storage and without resorting to nuclear power is within reach. However, in the face of strong pressure from interest groups associated with energy intensive industry, making the necessary innovations will require further growth of community concern about climate change, and the development of greater understanding of the feasibility of employing low carbon-emissions options.

This technique entails injection of CO2 into mature oil fields in a manner that reduces the oil's viscosity, thereby enhancing the rate of extraction. As part of this process, significant quantities of CO2 remain sequestered in the reservoir. If CO2 emissions are regulated, oil producers using EOR should therefore be able to earn revenues from sequestration as well as from oil production. We develop a theoretical framework that analyzes the dynamic co-optimization of oil extraction and CO2 sequestration, through the producer's choice of the fraction of CO2 in the injection stream at each moment. We find that the optimal fraction of CO2 is likely to decline monotonically over time, and reach zero before the optimal termination time. Numerical simulations, based on an ongoing EOR project in Wyoming, confirm this result. We also find that cumulative sequestration is less responsive to the carbon tax than to the oil price. Only at very high taxes does a tradeoff between revenues from oil output and sequestration arise. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To better understand the impact of policy instruments and to provide insights into technology change, assessments of various kinds are needed. This study analyzes the introduction and development of energy efficient windows in Sweden and the policy incentives applied to support this process. The study focuses on the assessment of technology and market development of energy efficient windows in Sweden; and by applying the concept of learning, it assesses how conditions for learning-by-searching, learning-by-doing, learning-by-using and learning-by-interacting have been supported by different policies. The results show successful progress in technology development and an improvement in best available technology of Swedish windows from 1.8 W/m(2) K in the 1970s to 0.7 W/m(2) K in 2010; in the same time period the market share of energy efficient windows increased from 20% in 1970 (average U-value of 2.0 W/m(2) K) to 80-85% in 2010 (average U-value of 1.3-1.2 W/m(2) K).

The present study examines an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis analyzing annual panel data of 16 metropolitan regions in Korea over a 16-year time period. The analysis results show that there is no one-dominant shape of EKC for SO2 and NO2; each region has its own EKC. That is, although we find the potential existence of U-shaped and N-shaped curves, the region-specific coefficients are enormously heterogeneous across regions. For CO, on the other hand, the random coefficient model shows that there is a dominant U-shaped curve across regions. In addition, energy consumption appears to be the most significant variable in explaining air pollution. Based on these results, we assert that environmental policy should consider the different characteristics of each region and type of pollutant. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It can have positive impacts on the network, but also negative impacts if integration is not properly managed. This is especially true of photovoltaics, in part because it's output fluctuates significantly and in part because it is being rapidly deployed in many countries. Potential positive impacts on grid operation can include reduced network flows and hence reduced losses and voltage drops. Potential negative impacts at high penetrations include voltage fluctuations, voltage rise and reverse power flow, power fluctuations, power factor changes, frequency regulation and harmonics, unintentional islanding, fault currents and grounding issues. This paper firstly reviews each of these impacts in detail, along with the current technical approaches available to address them. The second section of this paper discusses key non-technical factors, such as appropriate policies and institutional frameworks, which are essential to effectively coordinate the development and deployment of the different technical solutions most appropriate for particular jurisdictions. These frameworks will be different for different jurisdictions, and so no single approach will be appropriate worldwide. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The conditions under which an agreement is profitable include the stringency of the agreement, the relative performance of the greener product, industry size and the number of participants. While an agreement can be profitable for all firms (both participants and non-participants), i.e., all firms can be better off with the agreement than without it, nonetheless, a free-rider incentive exists. Thus, despite the potential for a profitable agreement, absent an effective enforcement mechanism, the agreement is not part of a Nash equilibrium.

However, these methods do not take into account consumer behaviour, which may affect the actual consumption. The theoretical calculation methods are based on assumptions and use a number of standardized parameters. The difference between the actual and the theoretical energy consumption, and the impact of the residents' behaviour on energy consumption, is analysed by means of a literature study and a practical research. An energy advice procedure (EAP) audit is executed in five dwellings, as well as a survey regarding the energy related behaviour of the households. The theoretically calculated consumption is compared with the billed actual energy consumption of the families. The results show some problems with the current procedure and give some options to improve it.

This paper examines the twists and turns of the policy implementation at the provincial level, and seeks to elucidate the difficulties in its implementation. Local governments, concerned that following the central directives would hurt local interests, have tried to deviate from the central orders while the central revises the policy from time to time to ensure local compliance. Three difficulties are analyzed: (1) the current relations between the central and local energy regulatory institutions make these local institutions difficult to perform their duties, and affect incentives for local governments to respond to central directives; (2) financial reform puts a great burden on local governments to raise revenues to cover expenditures, making local governments focus mainly on economic development rather than serving merely as political agents of the central government; (3) the aggressive attitude of local governments in pursuing GDP growth is not necessarily driven by the central government, but by pressure from competition among localities and the need to win local support. Solving these difficulties is important for making national energy conservation polices effective and efficient. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper focuses on the most suitable policy mix for Greece in achieving or approaching the aforementioned target. For the evaluation of different policy mixes two research tools are used, the Green-X simulation model and the multi-criteria evaluation method AMS; the latter is the combination of the standard multi-criteria AHP, MAUT and SMART methods. The Green-X simulation model is used to create four different scenarios about Greece regarding policy mixes aiming to increase the percentage of electricity produced by renewable energy sources. Outcomes of the model along with information from official reports and research papers are used as inputs to the AMS method. The results of the AMS method concerning all scenarios show which scenario ensures a more effective policy framework for achieving or approaching the new target. The results show that none of the scenarios can exceed an average of 25% share of renewable energy sources-electricity production in mainland large-scale hydropower plants excluded. Sensitivity analysis is used to examine the robustness of the final results. As long as the electricity production of the non-interconnected islands represents 9% (average of the last decade) of country's total it is very difficult for Greece to achieve the 40% share of RES in electricity production by 2020.

Yet there are neither clear definitions for the scope of emissions that such a label would address on an urban scale, nor is there a process for qualifying the carbon reduction claims. This paper addresses the question of how to define a zero carbon, Low Carbon, or Carbon Neutral urban development by proposing hierarchical emissions categories with three levels: Internal Emissions based on the geographical boundary, external emissions directly caused by core municipal activities, and internal or external emissions due to non-core activities. Each level implies a different carbon management strategy (eliminating, balancing, and minimizing, respectively) needed to meet a Net Zero Carbon designation.

The focus is on uncertainties including the scale and cost of gas resources, the costs of competing technologies, the pattern of greenhouse gas mitigation, and the evolution of global natural gas markets. Results show that the outlook for gas over the next several decades is very favorable. In electric generation, given the unproven and relatively high cost of other low-carbon generation alternatives, gas is likely the preferred alternative to coal. A broad GHG pricing policy would increase gas use in generation but reduce use in other sectors, on balance increasing its role from present levels. The shale gas resource is a major contributor to this optimistic view of the future of gas. Gas can be an effective bridge to a lower emissions future, but investment in the development of still lower CO2 technologies remains an important priority. International gas resources may well prove to be less costly than those in the U.S., except for the lowest-cost domestic shale resources, and the emergence of an integrated global gas market could result in significant U.S. gas imports.

China's electricity system currently lacks the flexibility in planning, operations, and pricing to respond to conflicting pressures from demand growth, rising costs, and environmental mandates in a way that simultaneously maintains reliability, decarbonizes the system, and keeps prices within acceptable bounds. Greater flexibility crucially requires the ability to more systematically and transparently manage and allocate costs. This will require re-orientating sector institutions still rooted in central planning, and strengthening independent regulation. Some of the necessary changes require fundamental political and legal reforms beyond the scope of energy policy. However, the system's flexibility can still be increased through the development of traditional planning and regulatory tools and approaches, such as an avoided cost basis for energy efficiency investments, more integrated planning to improve the coordination of generation, transmission, and demand-side investments, and a transparent ratemaking process. The judicious application of OECD electricity sector experience and skills can support these developments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus on developing countries and use the case of the Medupi supercritical coal plant in South Africa. The justification for the plant's construction stemmed from an Integrated Resource Planning process informed by South Africa's national utility. Often, as in the case of South Africa, there are tensions not easily captured in quantitative algorithms between, inter alia, a lack of access to electricity by millions of people (and associated welfare losses) and greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation. It is difficult to identify any formal processes that have prioritised climate change considerations over those of energy access. Thus, it becomes imperative to have a clear understanding of the consequences of this reality when considering power system expansion. We find that the processes often employed do not provide an entirely satisfactory precedent for future planning analyses, and the justifications do not adequately reflect the complexity of the decision space. Finally, we highlight some options by which these tools might be enhanced in areas including explicit and formal consideration of risk. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Because the EU's ExternE methodology for estimating the external costs of air quality has been used in numerous studies aimed at formulating environmental, transport and energy policies, BH has consulted this methodology to help make decisions about restricting emissions from major combustion sources.

J,"Moore, A",,,,"Moore, Alvon",,,Demand elasticity of oil in Barbados,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Oil; Demand; Elasticity,COINTEGRATION; MODELS,"The importation of oil is a significant component of Barbados' imports, rising from 7% of imports in 1998 to over 20% in 2009. This increase has impacted greatly on the level of foreign reserves. As a price-taker, relying entirely on imported oil for our energy needs could prove a continuous drain on the economy. With a view to formulating an appropriate energy policy for Barbados, this paper analyses the demand for oil using monthly data from 1998 to 2009. The paper estimates the elasticities of demand for oil by employing PesAran (2001) single equation cointegration approach and comparing the results with countries that rely heavily on imported oil and whose policy objective are to alter their energy structure to rely less on imported oil. The results show that the demand for oil imports is price inelastic in the long run. The consumption of oil is responsive to past consumption, prices, income, electricity consumption and the number of appliances imported in the short-run. A policy framework to reduce the use of oil for electricity consumption via alternative energy sources should be considered and the taxation of oil imports given its elasticity is a good source of revenue.

The real world performance of horizontal axis turbines is compared with yield estimates based on site wind speed prediction. The distribution of UK agricultural farms is overlaid with wind resource mapping to estimate the number of potential agricultural farm sites for micro-wind. The yield performance of turbines during the monitoring period was observed to be very close to that predicted by NOABL-MCS wind speed estimates. Based on an installation criterion of a maximum 12 year payback time, with a 6% discount rate and micro-generation feed in tariffs available, there are similar to 87,000 farm sites for micro-wind in the UK. If 10% of these farms were to install micro-wind turbines (to a capacity of 48 kWp per farm) this would correspond to a capacity of 418 MWp, with an annual generation yield of 1025 GWh, comparable to that of a large, on shore wind farm in the UK. It should be noted that the feed in tariff considered in this paper is that available in the UK in 2011, which, at 26.7 p/kWh (similar to 30 Euro cents/kWh) represents a significant subsidy.

A major concern, however, is the large emissions of CO2 from the process, which would add to the burden of atmospheric greenhouse gases. To assess the options, impacts and costs of controlling CO2 emissions from a CTL plant, a comprehensive techno-economic assessment model of CTL plants has been developed, capable of incorporating technology options for carbon capture and storage (CCS). The model was used to study the performance and cost of a liquids-only plant as well as a co-production plant, which produces both liquids and electricity. The effect of uncertainty and variability of key parameters on the cost of liquids production was quantified, as were the effects of alternative carbon constraints such as choice of CCS technology and the effective price (or tax) on CO2 emissions imposed by a climate regulatory policy. The efficiency and CO2 emissions from a co-production plant also were compared to the separate production of liquid fuels and electricity. The results for a 50,000 barrels/day case study plant are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the process of industrial relocation, environmental externality and social cost could occur due to market failure and government failure. Little attention has been paid to this issue. In this paper, we address it with a theoretical analysis and an empirical investigation on the relationship between China's industrial relocation in the early 1990s and energy consumption which is the primary source of CO2 emission, an environmental externality that causes increasing concerns. The macro-policy analysis suggests that there would be a positive link between China's industrial relocation in the early 1990s and energy saving (and environmental externalities reduction). Using fixed-effect regression model and simulation method, we provide an empirical support to this argument. In order to further reduce environmental externalities and social cost in the process of industrial relocation, we provide policy suggestions as follows: First, strengthen the evaluation of environmental benefits/costs; Second, pay more attention to the coordinated social-economic development; Third, avoid long-lived investment in high-carbon infrastructure in areas with industries moved in; Fourth, address employment issue in the areas with industries moved out.

On one hand, customers usually have different expectations for service reliability and price. On the other hand, providing different level of reliability at load points is a challenge for system operators. In order to take reasonable decisions and obviate reliability implementation difficulties, market players need to know impacts of their assets on system and load-point reliabilities. One tool to specify reliability impacts of assets is the criticality or reliability importance measure by which system components can be ranked based on their effect on reliability. Conventional methods for determination of reliability importance are essentially on the basis of risk sensitivity analysis and hence, impose prohibitive calculation burden in large power systems. An approach is proposed in this paper to determine reliability importance of energy producers from perspective of consumers or distribution companies in a composite generation and transmission system. In the presented method, while avoiding immense computational burden, the energy producers are ranked based on their rating, unavailability and impact on power flows in the lines connecting to the considered load points. Study results on the IEEE reliability test system show successful application of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Firuzabad, M.

We consider the extent to which operational differences across generation technologies - particularly, nuclear, wind and solar photovoltaic - create differences in the incentives for new investment, which is measured by the operating profits of a potential entrant. First, astylized model of an electricity system demonstrates that the composition of the existing generation system may cause electricity prices to increase by different amounts over time when a carbon dioxide price is imposed. Differences in operation across technologies therefore translate to differences in the operating profits of a potential entrant. Then, a detailed simulation model is used to consider a hypothetical carbon dioxide price of $10-$50 per metric ton for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market. The simulations show that, for the range of prices considered, the increase in electricity prices is positively correlated with output from a typical wind unit, but the correlation is much weaker for nuclear and photovoltaic. Consequently, a carbon dioxide price creates much stronger investment incentives for wind than for nuclear or photovoltaic technologies in the Texas market. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

While less is known about how people will respond to offshore than onshore wind, there is now an emerging body of research. From this literature, several common factors which influence responses have emerged and are discussed here: the (continued) role of visual impact; place attachment to the local area; lack of tangible benefits; relationships with developers and outsiders; and the role of the planning and decision-making systems. The paper argues that, as with onshore developments, the public should be included in decision-making about offshore wind farms, and that they have a key role which should not be underestimated. The paper concludes with some thoughts about the means to involve people and how effected communities might be effectively acknowledged, identified and engaged. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Land parcels differ in their ability to produce returns for landowners and landowners may have private information about the value of the land to them. Land parcels also differ in the type and quality of habitat and the spatial pattern of land use across multiple landowners is important for determining the conservation value of parcels. This paper analyzes the relative efficiency of simple voluntary incentive-based policies in achieving biodiversity conservation objectives. This topic is important not just for biodiversity conservation but for any effort to provide a public good requiring coordination across multiple decision-makers who have some degree of private information. We develop a method that integrates spatially explicit data, an econometric model of private land-use decisions, landscape simulations, a biological model of biodiversity as a function of landscape pattern, and an algorithm that estimates the set of efficient solutions. These methods allow us to simulate landowner responses to policies, measure the consequences of these decisions for biodiversity conservation, and compare these outcomes to efficient outcomes to show the relative efficiency of various policy approaches. We find substantial differences in biodiversity conservation scores generated by simple voluntary incentive-based policies and efficient solutions. The performance of incentive-based policies is particularly poor at low levels of the conservation budget where spatial fragmentation of conserved parcels is a large concern. Performance can be improved by encouraging agglomeration of conserved habitat and by incorporating basic biological information, such as that on rare habitats, into the selection criteria.

Home-based businesses comprise a significant proportion of the small business sector. But because they are invisible, their economic significance is assumed to be minor. This paper challenges this view. The majority are full-time businesses. One in ten has achieved significant scale. They create jobs for more than just the owner(s). They are concentrated in computer-related, business, and professional service sectors. They also have a distinctive geography. Rural areas and non-metropolitan parts of Southern England have the highest proportion of home-based businesses. Urban-industrial regions have the lowest proportion.

Students of regional science have been preoccupied with economic drivers while at the same time implicitly assuming that increasing urban size and density raises local well-being. However, the geography of happiness may not mirror the geography of growth. Rather, there is a localization to the paradox of affluence mainly because raising population density in order to realize agglomeration economies can lower subjective well-being. This paper offers empirical support for this proposition by estimating city fixed-effects for three separate measures of subjective well-being while controlling for the characteristics of individuals as well as their perceptions of accessibility and social capital.","Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Morrison, PS (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",Philip.Morrison@vuw.ac.nz,,,,,,,83,92,99,7,60,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The basic tasks that foster the decision of controlling include: the ability to show managers the situation inside the company, that is, to reach the transparency of the business, to attain the increase of the effectiveness of the activity by means of search for internal reserves; to form an informative base for managerial decisions, to work out company's targets, in general, and its structural subdivisions and provide the fulfillment of these targets. This leads to the appearance of topical scientific task - to work out the methods of construction of the systems of controlling in enterprises, taking in account their specifics that can provide the requirement for the increase of the effectiveness of the company's activity. Controlling is a tool to support effectiveness of business management. For the development and implementation of the controlling system requires a series of interrelated consecutive projects to restructure the management system in the enterprise. Controlling is an integral aspect of management. Contemporary organizations more and more are confronted with changes in their business processes. As a result goals are not stable anymore. Organizations must be aware of the change processes that occur and must one important aim of the organizational control in contemporary organizations is to balance control and flexibility.

Aggregate productivity of manufacturing industries by urban, rural less sparse, and rural sparse locations in the UK is computed from firm-specific total factor productivities, which are estimated by a semi-parametric algorithm, within four-digit manufacturing industries, using the FAME data set over the period 1994-2001. The productivity differentials across location categories are analysed by decomposing them into industry productivity effect and industry composition effect. The analysis indicates that at the end of twentieth century, a rural-urban divide in manufacturing productivity still remains, but there is a tendency for convergence between rural and urban location categories, possibly due to increased competitive pressure. The industry composition effect is positively correlated with the industry productivity effect, suggesting that locations with high productivity are also characterized by industrial structure enhancing productivity.","[Rizov, Marian] Middlesex Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, Sch Business, London NW4 4BT, England; [Rizov, Marian] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Walsh, Patrick Paul] UCD SPIRe, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Walsh, Patrick Paul] Geary Inst, Dublin 4, Ireland",Middlesex University; Wageningen University & Research; University College Dublin,"Rizov, M (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, Sch Business, London NW4 4BT, England.",m.rizov@mdx.ac.uk; ppwalsh@ucd.ie,"Rizov, Marian/I-2597-2019; Walsh, Patrick Paul/AAG-5085-2019","Rizov, Marian/0000-0002-8895-1980; Walsh, Patrick Paul/0000-0003-0739-8835",,,,,44,15,17,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Innovation, regions and proximity: from neo-regionalism to spatial analysis, Regional Studies. There have recently been questions regarding how geographic proximity should be conceptualized in the study of regional innovation. This stems partly from different meanings of the term 'innovation' (incremental product and process innovation in this paper) and partly from the way space is usually conceptualized: regions are conceived as bounded territories with particular attributes (neo-regionalism). Drawing upon spatial analytical concepts, it is suggested in this paper that an alternative to neo-regionalism is to view space as a continuous field of opportunities, with accessibility to factors of innovation playing a key role for local innovativeness.

Specifically, it is the dynamic of power purchase agreement (PPA) negotiations in the face of PTC renewal uncertainty that drives Investment volatility.

Since the restructuring of the market, the fuel mix has been determined partly by investors and partly by the Basic Plan for Long-Term Electricity Supply and Demand (BPE). Both the system marginal price (SMP), and the capacity payment (CP). which has been based on the fixed cost of a specific gas turbine generator, were intended to provide an investment incentive in the market: however, they did not bring about an optimal fuel mix in Korea. Under the circumstances of a shortage of base load generators, these generators may garner excessive profits due to a high SMP level. However, the adjustment scheme of profit between KEPCO and Gencos left scant profit for generators. This paper suggests that a contract is needed to create the appropriate profit and tax levels for these base load generators. The redistribution of profit improves equality between consumers and generators, and the proper margin creates incentives for base load technology investment in Korea. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We start by performing an economic analysis of FTD produced from Norwegian forest biomass at a pioneer commercial plant in Norway, followed with a cost growth analysis to estimate production costs after uncertainty in early plant performance and capital cost estimates are considered. Results after the cost growth analysis imply that the initial production cost estimates for a pioneer producer may be underestimated by up to 30%. Using the revised estimate we then assess, through scenarios, how various financial support mechanisms designed to encourage near-term investment would affect production costs over a range of uncertain future oil prices. For all policy scenarios considered, we evaluate trade-offs between the levels of public expenditure, or subsidy, and private investor profitability. When considering the net present value of the subsidy required to incentivize commercial investment during a future of low oil prices, we find that GHG mitigation via wood-FTD is likely to be considered cost-ineffective. However, should the government expect that mean oil prices in the coming two decades will hover between $97 and 127/bbl, all the incentive policies considered would likely spur investment at net present values <= $-100/tonne-fossil-CO(2)-equivalent avoided.

Nuclear power results in low carbon emissions and is thus important to mitigating the adverse effects of global warming and climate change. However, the downside of nuclear power cannot be overlooked, and consequently nuclear power is a controversial issue in many countries around the world. Thus an important question concerns how people should support nuclear power. Do the climate and energy security benefits of nuclear power outweigh its risks and costs? Therefore, we use a modified double-bounded contingent valuation model to explore the attitudes and the willingness to pay (WTP) of a country in order to demonstrate its implications for policy. We confirm that supporters and opponents of nuclear power are balanced both in terms of their numbers and in terms of their WTP. The policy implication is that people do not support any dramatic increase or reduction in nuclear power, and that nuclear power should still be an important means of generating electricity in Taiwan. The current share of nuclear power in electricity generation of 20% should be maintained in the near future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a study on the use of photovoltaic and fuel cells for continuous supply of electric power. The paper outlines the technical and costs characteristics of a pilot project set up in an environmental protection area, located in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. The pilot project uses solar energy as the primary electric power production source. Surplus energy stored in the hydrogen produced by the electrolysis of water is later transformed into electric power by the fuel cells during periods when there is little or no sunlight. A comparative study between the technologies and potential configurations meeting the needs of isolated communities in the Amazon through simulations based on HOMER software are presented.

The aim is to reconcile generation adequacy with efficient energy purchase, correct risk allocation among investors and consumers, and the politico-economic environment of the country. In this paper, a generic proposal for a long-term electricity contracts approach is made, including practical design concepts for implementation. This proposal is empirically derived from the auctions implemented in Brazil and Chile during the last 6 years. The study is focused on practices and lessons which are especially useful for regulators and policy makers that want to facilitate the financing of new desirable power plants in risky environments and also efficiently allocate supply contracts among investors at competitive prices. Although this mechanism is generally seen as a significant improvement in market regulation, there are questions and concerns on auction performance that require careful design and which are identified in this paper. In addition, the experiences and proposal described can serve to derive further mechanisms in order to promote the entrance of particular generation technologies, e.g. renewables, in the developed world and therefore achieve a clean electricity supply.

From the literature and consulted stakeholders it was found that the complexity of the current consents process has adversely affected the rate of development and the achievement of renewable energy targets. Future projects will be subject to a different legal framework for consents, under the Planning Act 2008 and the Marine and Coastal Access Bill. From a comparison of process diagrams for the current and future consents processes, it is concluded that the future process should be an improvement. However, uncertainties remain about the detailed procedures and operation of the future consenting authorities. The capacity and capability of key stakeholders to meet their obligations have implications for the time frame for the processes of applying for, and the granting of, consents. Furthermore improved engagement from developers and clarity about the role of local authorities are essential if progress is to be made.

Ample unused land is critical for first generation biofuels production and an important feature to attract foreign direct investments that can contribute towards agricultural modernization and poverty reduction initiatives. Despite the economic justifications, the existing institutional and infrastructural capacities dictate the impacts of biofuels market penetrations. Furthermore, exogenous factors like global recessionary pressure depressed oil prices below the level at which biofuel production were profitable in 2007, making Tanzania's competitiveness and potential benefits questionable. This paper investigates the extent that first generation, jatropha-based biofuels industry development in Tanzania observed during fieldwork in Kisarawe and Bahi may fulfill policy objectives. This paper argues that without strong regulatory frameworks for land, investment management, and rural development, biofuel industrialization could further exacerbate poverty and food insecurity in Tanzania. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for first generation biofuel development while keeping in mind implications of second generation production. Since the topic is broad and multifaceted, a multidisciplinary approach is used that includes political, institutional, and agricultural economics to analyze and conceptualize biofuel industry development and food security.

Sectoral technical efficiency is obtained by the econometric estimation of a multilateral stochastic input distance function, while sectoral backward and forward linkage coefficients were computed using the noncomplete hypothetical extraction method suggested by Dietzenbacher and Van der Linden (J Reg Sci 37:235-257, 1997). The empirical results suggest that the relationship between industrial technical efficiency and sectoral interdependence is ambiguous. Although the majority of the countries, in the sample exhibit a negative relationship, for some countries, the opposite is revealed. This implies that policy makers should not be blindly based on sectoral interdependence in forming development plans, and they should take into consideration the efficiency of resource utilization of individual sectors. The combination of the information provided by both indices will assist in devising effective policy plans in stimulating internal economic growth.","[Tzouvelekas, Vangelis] Univ Crete, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ, Rethimnon 74100, Crete, Greece; [Karagiannis, Giannis] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Crete; University of Macedonia,"Tzouvelekas, V (通讯作者)，Univ Crete, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Rethimnon 74100, Crete, Greece.",vangelis@econ.soc.uoc.gr,,"Tzouvelekas, Vangelis/0000-0001-7097-9646",,,,,34,9,10,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Experiences from other countries show that government intervention in the form of regulations such as mandatory and voluntary approaches can save sizeable amount of energy along with the reduction in emissions associated with energy savings. This paper presents potential energy savings by introducing high-efficiency motors as a case study in Malaysian industrial sector. Emission reductions associated with the energy savings has been estimated and presented as well. It was also estimated that a cumulative amount of 1940 and 892 GWh of energy can be saved for 20 and 120 kW motors, respectively, in Malaysia relative to BAU over the next 10 years. Similarly, a cumulative amount of USD 100 million and USD 60 million can be saved as utility bills for the same motor categories. It has been found that the payback period of different capacities of motors are less than a year. Based on results, it was found that 1789 million kg of CO2 emission can be avoided by replacing standard motors with high-efficiency motors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A pertinent example of the political infeasibility of climate policy change in the 110th Congress is the case of tax credit extensions for production of renewable energy. While this issue in itself was uncontroversial, the extensions were only adopted in the 11th hour, after innumerable failed attempts. With an analytical point of departure in Krehbiel's theory of pivotal politics, this paper seeks to identify pivotal legislators in the case of the tax credit extensions and discusses how changes in the composition of pivotal legislators in the 111th Congress (2009-2010) may impact the prospects of moving climate legislation more generally. The analysis indicates that a majority of the legislative pivots in the case of tax credit extensions were Republican senators representing coal-producing states. In the case of climate change, however, the regional dimension is likely to be more significant for Democratic voting behaviour. Thus, the opportunity space for climate legislation in the 111th Congress remains narrow even with a reinforced Democratic majority in Congress. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Since both contracts are traded at the same exchange, there is no influence of, for example, different market microstructure and default risk when examining the effect of the marking-to-market of futures on the price differential. Although the prices of the futures portfolios are, on average, below the corresponding forward prices, these price differentials are, on average, not statistically significant and not economically significant when taking transaction costs into account. Given the characteristics of the electricity contracts under observation, this is consistent with the predictions of the Cox et al.

In this paper we discuss the issues that have arisen in designing market protocols that take account of these special characteristics of wind generation and survey the regulatory and market rules that have been developed in Texas. We discuss the perverse incentives some of the rules gave wind generators to overschedule generation in order to receive balancing energy payments, and steps that have been taken to mitigate those incentive effects.

This paper studies factors that influence the choice of heating system based on Norwegian households' perceptions. Electric heating, heat pump and wood pellet heating were compared, with a special focus on wood pellet heating. This study was conducted as a questionnaire survey on two independent samples. The first sample consisted of 188 randomly chosen Norwegian households, mainly using electric heating; the second sample consisted of 461 households using wood pellet heating. Our results show that socio-demographic factors, communication among households, the perceived importance of heating system attributes, and the applied decision strategy all influence the Norwegian homeowners. The significance of these factors differs between the two samples and the preferred type of anticipated future heating system.

A nuanced examination of woodfuel supply, demand, use, and markets illuminated options to turn stagnant policies based on charcoal 'bans' and fuel-substitution into proactive, realistic ones acknowledging woodfuel dominance and its socioeconomic importance. Findings revealed growing, spatially differentiated woodfuel deficits in southern and central Malawi and around Blantyre, Zomba and Lilongwe cities. Poverty, limited electricity access, reliability and generation exacerbated by tariff subsidies, and complex fuel-allocation decisions restricted energy-ladder transitions from woodfuels to electricity, producing an enduring urban-energy mix dominated by charcoal, thereby increasing wood consumption. Diverse socio-political interests prevented lifting of the charcoal 'ban' despite progressive forest laws. Despite implementation challenges, lessons already learnt, efficiency and poverty-reduction arguments, limited government capacity, growing illegal production of charcoal in forest reserves, and its staying power, make targeted community-based forest management (CBFM) approaches more practical for regulated, commercial production of woodfuels than the status quo. New differentiated policies should include commercial woodfuel production and licensing for revenue and ecological sustainability under CBFM or concessions within and outside selected reserves, an enterprise-based approaches for poverty reduction, smallholder/private tree-growing, woodfuel-energy conserving technologies, improved electricity supply and agricultural productivity.

We have developed a prototypical agent-based simulation model for energy technologies competing for demand at the consumer level. The model is specifically geared towards the competition between micro-CHP and incumbent condensing boilers. In the model, both technologies compete on purchase price and costs of usage, to which various (types of) consumers decide on the installation of either technology. Simulations with various gas and electricity prices show that micro-CHP diffusion could be seriously inhibited if demand for natural gas decreases, e.g. due to insulation measures. Further simulations explore various subsidy schemes. A subsidy for purchase is only found to be effective within a limited range of (sic)1400-3250. A subsidy based on decreasing price difference between the competing technologies is much more cost effective than fixed purchase subsidies. Simulations of a subsidy scheme for usage show that a fast market penetration can be reached, but this does not yet take full advantage of technological progress in terms of decreasing CO2 emissions. Selection of the most effective scheme thus depends on the policy criteria assumed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the peculiarities of these markets require a careful choice of the index, based on mathematical formulation and its statistical properties. Choosing a bad index may influence the financial policies of market players, since derivative pricing and hedging performance can be deeply affected. In this paper with an initial theoretical analysis, we intend to show that the most widely used indexes (simple arithmetic average and weighted average with current volumes) are poor representatives of the spot market. We will then perform an analysis of the hedging strategy on a derivative instrument (an Asian option) written on a reference index. The resulting simulations, applied to OMEL (Spain) and EEX (Germany), are sufficiently clear cut to suggest that the decision to adopt an index to represent properly a market must be taken very carefully. Finally we will propose a new index (FAST index) and, after comparing it with the previous indexes, will show that both theoretically and practically this index can be taken as a good electricity market synthetic indicator.

One potential answer involves large-scale development of concentrated solar power (CSP) in the North African region, transmitting the power to Europe. CSP is a relatively young and little utilized technology and is expensive when compared to other methods of generation. Feasibility studies have shown it is possible to generate enough power from CSP plants in Africa to spearhead the EUs climate goals. However, the costs of such a project are less well known. Currently, CSP must compete with low cost coal-fired electricity plants, severely hindering development. We examine the possible investment costs required for North African CSP levelized electricity cost to equal those of coal-fired plants and the potential subsidy costs needed to encourage growth until the technologies reach price parity. We also examine the sensitivity of investment and subsidies to changes in key factors. We find that estimates of subsidy amounts are reasonable for the EU and that sensitivity to such factors as perceived risk and learning rates would enable policy-makers to positively influence the cost of subsidies and time required for CSP to be competitive with coal.

A key challenge when designing payments for biodiversity in fragmented landscapes is to increase the spatial connectivity of habitats. Based on the idea of an agglomeration bonus we consider a scheme in which land-owners only receive payments if habitats are arranged in an ecologically favourable configuration. We compare the cost-effectiveness of agglomeration payments to spatially homogeneous payments on a conceptual level. Our results suggest that positive efficiency gains exist for agglomeration payments. We use Large Blue butterfly habitat in Germany as a specific case study, and find the agglomeration payments may lead to cost-savings of nearly 70% relative to homogenous payments.

The productive process of this industry relies on a forest-based renewable raw material: wood. This paper aims to demonstrate that the forest policies of the Estado Novo (New State) contributed to the development of the paper pulp industry through the expansion of the forested area in Portugal. It will be shown that the expansion of the forested area occupied by a fast-growing species - Eucalyptus as well as that occupied by a species already present in Portuguese forests - Pinus pinaster - was fundamental for the development of the paper pulp industry. Furthermore, a change in the composition of Portuguese forests enabled the pulp industry to respond to a national and international market featuring growing demand.

Decentralization and the composition of public expenditure in Spain, Regional Studies. This paper examines the effects of fiscal decentralization on the economic distribution of public expenditures. Using panel data from the seventeen Spanish regions (1984-2003), it is shown that fiscal decentralization is a crucial determinant of the share of the public budget devoted to capital. The estimation run is based on a model in which the utility of the representative agent from the current public expenditure depends on the distance to the level of the administration that provides it. That could be the cause why decentralized economies experience a higher share of current expenditure in the budget of the public administrations. [image omitted] Gonzalez Alegre J.

Fashioning a global city: global city brand channels in the fashion and design industries, Regional Studies. This paper approaches the ways in which fashion and design-based industrial actors contribute to creating images and myths that support global-city status. It is suggested that multi-channel systems of brand building and differentiation exist at regional and local levels, supportive of, and constituted by, cultural industries. The Italian city of Milan is used as a case study to show how the city is an arena where different brand channels are negotiated and formed to service fashion and design branding. For cultural industries, these systems are vital regional sources of advantage and necessary complements to other localized phenomena such as industrial agglomerations and clusters.","[Jansson, Johan; Power, Dominic] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Res Innovat & Ind Dynam CIND, Dept Social & Econ Geog, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Jansson, J (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Ctr Res Innovat & Ind Dynam CIND, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Box 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",johan.jansson@kultgeog.uu.se; dominic.power@kultgeog.uu.se,"Carretto, adriana/C-9953-2012; Power, Dominic/F-2273-2011","Power, Dominic/0000-0002-8341-0050",,,,,76,86,98,4,73,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

About half of the biomass will be used for motor fuel substitutes, whose share of the final energy in the transportation sector will increase to 10% in 2030. This gives rise to a nearly 9% drop in CO2 emissions in the transportation sector as compared to an emission balance where all real local emissions are fully counted. Despite a strong enhancement of biomass and biomass fuels and quite high prices for oil and gas up to 2030, BtL products like synthetic gasoline and diesel from biomass do not play an important part in the model results unless fairly high penalties are set for CO2 emissions. In the case of global CO2 penalties below (sic)300/t(CO2) the use of biomass will even shift away from vehicle fuel production to biomass power plants and CHP.

It is assumed that for an emerging technology to fruitfully develop, it should be fostered by a Technological Innovation System (TIS), which is the network of actors, institutions and technologies in which it is embedded. For an emerging technology a TIS has yet to be built up. This research focuses on the dynamics of this build-up process by mapping the development of seven key activities: so-called system functions. The main contribution revolves around the notion of cumulative causation, or the phenomenon that the build-up of a TIS accelerates due to system functions reinforcing each other over time. As an empirical basis, an analysis is provided of the historical development of the TIS around automotive natural gas technology in the Netherlands (1970-2007). The results show that this TIS undergoes a gradual build-up in the 1970s, followed by a breakdown in the 1980s and, again, a build-up from 2000 to 2007. It is shown that underlying these trends are different forms of cumulative causation, here called motors of innovation. The study provides strategic insights for practitioners that aspire to support such motors of innovation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Suurs, Roald A.

In this paper, the relations between Chinese energy consumption and energy prices are researched by cointegration equations, impulse response functions, granger causality and variance decomposition. The cointegration relations among energy prices, energy consumption and economic outputs show that higher energy price will decrease energy consumption in Chinese industrial sectors but will not reduce the economic output in the long run. The cointegration relation between energy price and household energy consumption shows that higher energy price will decrease household energy consumption in the long run and increase it in the short run. So Chinese government should deepen the reform of pricing mechanism for energy, and increase the energy prices reasonably to save energy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It discusses its origins and examines factors in the policy processes over time leading first to its development and then to its abandonment. A first analysis looks at the near-term policy-making process before and after the proposal on GO trading in January 2008, focusing on the European policy-making institutions and influences of interest groups and member state governments. It then takes a step back and looks over a longer time period at how competing policy frames have shaped the agendas underlying the debate. Results show how a strong internal market frame acted as a primary driving force in the Commission to promote the GO trading instrument. The rejection of the GO trading proposal in the Council and Parliament can be largely attributed to the lack of a strong lobby in favour of GO, the accumulated experience with and institutionalisation of national RES support policies such as feed-in tariffs, and growing general political concerns for supply security, innovation and competitiveness.

By 2008, large offshore wind farms had been built in Denmark, the UK, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Sweden with a total capacity of 1200 MW. Offshore wind farms have the potential to generate a significant fraction of US electrical consumption, but the US currently lacks offshore wind farms and is still developing a regulatory system. At the state level only Texas has a leasing system for offshore wind. Since all offshore land is the property of the state and cannot be legally developed without a lease from the government, these absences have stalled development. We review and compare regulatory and leasing systems developed in Europe and the US to inform a discussion of the major issues associated with the development of an offshore leasing and regulatory system. We focus on the tradeoffs between encouraging a sustainable energy source and ensuring environmental protection and public compensation. We conclude that there are likely multiple effective methods of regulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we present an up-to-date inventory of the exhaust emissions of ten species. This inventory has been calculated bottom-up from the vehicle mileage, differentiating by seven vehicle categories, four age/technology layers and three fuel types each, for the seven biggest cities as well as for the whole nation. The age composition of the rolling fleet has been carefully modelled, deducting about one quarter of vehicles still registered but actually out-of-service. The vehicle mileage is calibrated to the national fuel consumption which is essential to limit uncertainties. Sensitivity analyses reveal the primary impact of the emission factors and the secondary influence of vehicle mileage and stock composition on total emissions. Emission estimates since 1980 are reviewed and qualified. A more comprehensive inspection and maintenance is essential to limit pollutant emissions; this must properly include commercial vehicles. They are also the most important vehicle category to address when fuel consumption and CO2 emissions shall be contained. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The greater or lesser intensity of that growth will depend on the evolution of both production and internal consumption. From the production side, the pace of growth depends on the status of gas reserves and, more importantly, on the investment program pursued by the State-owned gas giant Gazprom. From the demand side, evolution depends on the way Russia's wide potential for gas savings is managed. Through this analysis, we find three likely scenarios for Russian gas exports. In the most positive, diversification of exports will be possible. In the most negative, Russia will have scant opportunity to develop an export diversification strategy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This research proposes an artificial neural network model (a structure with feed-forward multilayer perceptron, error back-propagation algorithm, momentum process, and scaled data) to efficiently estimate the energy demand for South Korea. The model has four independent variables, such as gross domestic product (GDP), population, import, and export amounts. The data are obtained from diverse local and international sources. The proposed model better estimated energy demand than a linear regression model (a structure with multiple linear variables and least square method) or an exponential model (a structure with mixed integer variables, branch and bound method, and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method) in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE). The model also forecasted better than the other two models in terms of RMSE without any over-fitting problem. Further testing with four scenarios based upon reliable source data showed unanticipated results. Instead of growing permanently, the energy demands peaked at certain points, and then decreased gradually. This trend is quite different from the results by regression or exponential model.

In this paper, the implications of transmission constraints on power markets are analyzed for the case of Germany. Market splitting is applied in the case of congestion in the grid. For this purpose, the agent-based modeling of electricity systems (AMES) market package developed by Sun and Tesfatsion is modified to fit the German context, including a detailed representation of the German high-voltage grid and its interconnections. Implications of transmission constraints on prices and social welfare are analyzed for scenarios that include strategic behavior of market participants and high wind power generation.

The large-scale oil crisis of 1973 coupled with various environmental protection issues, have led many countries to look for new, alternative energy sources. Biomass and fuelwood in particular, constitutes a major renewable energy source (RES) that can make a significant contribution, as a substitute for oil. This paper initially provides a description of the contribution of renewable energy sources to the production of electricity, and also examines the role of forests in the production of fuelwood in Greece. Following this, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, artificial neural networks (ANN) and a hybrid model are used to predict the future selling prices of the fuelwood (from broadleaved and coniferous species) produced by Greek state forest farms. The use of the ARIMA-ANN hybrid model provided the optimum prediction results, thus enabling decision-makers to proceed with a more rational planning for the production and fuelwood market.

The analysis is carried out at various disaggregation levels to highlight the specifics of each sub-sector and end-use according to their respective determinants. The results show that in this period the economic growth of the service sector was the main factor that led to the increase in total energy consumption. Structure, productivity, substitution and intensity effects restricted this growth, but with limited effect. By analyzing each end-use, this paper enables a more precise understanding of the impact of these factors. The activity effect was the main determinant of the increase in energy consumption for all end-uses except for air conditioning, for which the equipment rate effect was the main factor. Structural changes in the service sector primarily impacted energy consumption for space heating and cooking. Improvements in productivity limited the growth of energy consumption for all end-uses except for cooking. Finally, energy efficiency improvements mainly affected space-heating energy use.

A flexible autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model is used to take into account the stylized volatility facts such as clustering volatility, asymmetric news impact and long memory volatility among others. The empirical results indicate that the intensity of long-persistence volatility in the WTI is greater than in the Brent. It is also found that for the WTI, the appreciation and depreciation shocks of the WTI have similar impact on the resulting volatility. However, a leverage effect is found in Brent. Although both the estimation and diagnostic evaluations are in favor of an asymmetric long memory ARCH model, only the WTI models provide superior in the out-of-sample forecasts. On the other hand, from the empirical out-of-sample forecasts, it appears that the simplest parsimonious generalized ARCH provides the best forecasted evaluations for the Brent crude oil data.

To this end, the choice experiment methodology was employed in communities in two Greek Aegean Islands to assess the determinants of preferences towards different wind-farm projects. Unlike other studies, the willingness to accept welfare measure was adopted. The results of our analysis show that the conservation status of the area where the wind farms are to be installed, along with the governance characteristics of the planning procedure are the most important determinants of local community welfare in relation to wind farms. In contrast to other studies, we find that the physical attributes of wind farms appear to be of less relative importance from a local community welfare point of view.

The two types of approaches are characterized by a trade-off between environmental effectiveness and political feasibility, respectively, whereas their relative cost-effectiveness depends on implementation details. Bottom-up architectures constitute imperfect substitutes for top-down architectures in terms of environmental effectiveness, and thus remain mere fallback options. However, especially the 'formal linking' architecture can act as complement in terms of cost-effectiveness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Spanish economy has one of the highest unemployment rates in the EU and is characterised by severe regional disparities. We apply the chain reaction theory of unemployment according to which the evolution of unemployment is driven by the interplay of lagged adjustment processes and the spillover effects within the labour market system. Our model includes nationwide as well as region-specific variables, and takes into account the limited labour and firm mobility in Spain. We show that the degree of labour market flexibility differs between high and low unemployment regions, and find that investment has a major influence on the unemployment trajectory. In addition, we find that in bad times high unemployment regions are hit more severely than low unemployment regions, while in good times, high unemployment regions do not benefit as much as low unemployment regions.","[Bande, Roberto] Univ Santiago, Santiago De Compostela 15782, A Coruna, Spain; [Bande, Roberto] IDEGA, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; [Karanassou, Marika] Univ London, Dept Econ, London E1 4NS, England",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; University of London,"Bande, R (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago, Ave Burgo S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, A Coruna, Spain.",rbande@usc.es; m.karanassou@qmul.ac.uk,,"Bande Ramudo, Roberto/0000-0002-0780-6803",,,,,62,25,28,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

E., Fitzroy F. R. and Nolan M. A. Is there a North-South divide in self-employment in England?, Regional Studies. Using decomposition analysis, the paper investigates why Northern England has fewer but higher performing self-employed individuals than the South. It is found that the causes are mainly structural differences rather than regional variation in individual characteristics. There are more self-employed individuals in the South, but on average they create fewer jobs.

Control variables Such as oil reserves, oil price, population, political rights, and the Gini index were used to determine its contribution to the main EKC model. The empirical results fully support the existence of an EKC for oil exploitation. Furthermore, the result indicates that the proved oil reserves has a significant and positive role in oil production, but oil price and population do not significantly affect crude oil production. Also, increased freedoms and a better income distribution will reduce the rate of oil exploitation. Thus, policies aiming at enhancing democratic society and better income distribution would be more compatible with sustainability. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The emergence and evolution of three principal SNF approaches are analyzed: direct disposal, reprocessing and SNF export. Five broad explanatory factors are identified and discussed in relation to the observed differences in policy outcomes: military ambitions and non-proliferation, technological culture, political culture and civil society, geological conditions, and energy policy. SNF policy outcomes can generally be seen to result from a complex interaction between these broad factors, but it is also possible to discern a number of important patterns. To the extent that the five factors may undergo far-reaching changes in the future, the historical experience of how they have shaped SNF policies also give a hint of possible future directions in SNF policymaking around the world.

Labour productivity is 21% (13%) lower in sparse (less sparse) rural areas compared with urban areas. Labour productivity in less sparse and urban areas appears to depend on similar factors. Labour productivity in sparse areas strongly relates to a different industrial structure and plants in sparse areas gain less benefit from larger capital stocks.

Low DG/RES penetration levels do not have a major impact on electricity systems. However, several problems arise as DG shares increase. Smarter distribution grids are deemed necessary to facilitate DG/RES integration. This involves modifying the way distribution networks are currently planned and operated. Furthermore, DG and demand should also adopt a more active role. This paper reviews the current situation of DG/RES in Spain including penetration rates, support payments for DG/RES, level of market integration, economic regulation of Distribution System Operators (DSOs), smart metering implementation, grid operation and planning, and incentives for DSO innovation. This paper identifies several improvements that could be made to the treatment of DG/RES. Key aspects of an efficient DG/RES integration are identified and several regulatory changes specific to the Spanish situation are recommended. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparing the recent progress to the required growth for meeting the 2020 target, it appears that some countries largely exceed the interim targets of the RES Directive 2009/28/EC. Despite this, Europe will need additional policy effort to reach the 2020 target. Critical success factors include implementing effective and efficient policies that attract sufficient investments, reducing administrative and grid related barriers, especially in currently less advanced countries, upgrading the power grid infrastructure, dismantling financial barriers in the heat sector, realising sustainability standards for biomass, and lowering energy demand through increased energy efficiency efforts.

A dynamic panel analysis,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity; Competition; Restructuring,REGULATORY REFORMS; SUPPLY INDUSTRY; PRICES; MODELS; POWER; CONSUMERS,"A key selling point for the restructuring of electricity markets was the promise of lower prices. There is not much consensus in earlier studies on the effects of electricity deregulation in the U.S., particularly for residential customers. Part of the reason for not finding a consistent link with deregulation and lower prices was that the removal of transitional price caps led to higher prices. In addition, the timing of the removal of price caps coincided with rising fuel prices, which were passed on to consumers in a competitive market. Using a dynamic panel model, we analyze the effect of participation rates, fuel costs, market size, a rate cap and switch to competition for 16 states and the District of Columbia. We find that an increase in participation rates, price controls, a larger market, and high shares of hydro in electricity generation lower retail prices, while increases in natural gas and coal prices increase rates. We also find that retail competition makes the market more efficient by lowering the markup of retail prices over wholesale costs. The effects of a competitive retail electricity market are mixed across states, but generally appear to lower prices in states with high participation rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model-solving process of the two is expounded, and it provides the basis for an empirical analysis of the world's conventional oil production. The results for both show that the world's conventional oil (crude + NGLs) production will reach its peak in 2011 with a production of 30 billion barrels (Gb). In addition, the forecasting effects of these two models, given the same URR are compared, and the intrinsic characteristics of these two models are analyzed. This demonstrates that for specific criteria the multicyclic Generalized Weng model is an improvement on the multicyclic Hubbert model. Finally, based upon the resultant forecast for the world's conventional oil, some suggestions are proposed for China's policy makers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology is a multi-criteria decision analysis, which provides a flexible and easily understood way to analyze project risks. The external risks, which are partly under the control of companies, were considered in the model. A total of eleven classes of risk factors were determined based on the expert interviews, field studies and literature review as follows: site geology, land use, environmental issues, grid connection, social acceptance, macroeconomic, natural hazards, change of laws and regulations, terrorism, access to infrastructure and revenue. The relative importance of risk factors was determined from the survey results. The survey was conducted with the experts that have experience in the construction of river-type hydropower schemes. The survey results revealed that the site geology and environmental issues were considered as the most important risks. The new risk assessment method enabled a Risk Index (R) value to be calculated, establishing a 4-grade evaluation system. The proposed risk analysis will give investors a more rational basis to make decisions and it can prevent cost and schedule overruns. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Two major definitions emerge: regular or 'cheap' oil and non-conventional or 'heavy' oil. Peaking time in conventional oil production has been a recent focus of debate. For two decades, non-conventional oils have been mixed with regular crude oil. Peaking time estimation and the rate at which production may be expected to decline, following the peak, are more difficult to determine. We propose a two-wave model for world oil production pattern and forecasting, based on the diffusion of innovation theories: a sequential multi-Bass model. Historical well-known shocks are confirmed, and new peaking times for crude oil and mixed oil are determined with corresponding depletion rates. In the final section, possible ties between the dynamics of oil extraction and refining capacities are discussed as a predictive symptom of an imminent mixed oil peak in 2016. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Renewable portfolio standards with either capacity or sales requirements have a significant impact on the penetration of all types of renewables-however, this impact is variable depending on the type of renewable source: it is negative for combined renewables, wind, and biomass; and positive for geothermal and solar. Further, clean energy funds and required green power options mostly result in increasing the penetration of all types of renewables. On the other hand, voluntary renewable portfolio standards as well as state green power purchasing programs are found to be ineffective in increasing the penetration of any type of renewable source. Finally, economic variables, such as electricity price, natural gas price, and per capita GDP as well as structural variables, such as league of conservation voters rating and the share of coal-generated electricity are found to be generally insignificant, suggesting the crucial role of policy in increasing the penetration of renewables.

The main conclusion is that current interconnector and transmission investment decisions in Europe are unlikely to maximize social welfare. The arguments are as follows. (i) It is unclear how much demand for transmission capacity and interconnectors actually exists, and thus the benefits of investment are unclear. (ii) Both analyses underlying the investments studied are incorrect, to the point where, in one case, even the sign may be wrong. (iii) The main criticism concerns the fact that they do not take the resulting changes in generator investment plans into account and ignore the (potential) benefits of increased competition. (iv) Several smaller issues can be improved, such as the discount rate used. (v) Decisions at the European level are taken very differently, and approval may depend on which authority grants approval. (vi) Interconnector decisions receive the most attention, although most money goes to transmission investments. Two research recommendations for future improvements are formulated.

Household energy sources are interrelated, and energy price and household characteristics, such as income level and dwelling size, affect the usage. To supply energy consistently and achieve a balance between production and consumption, stakeholders must understand consumer energy-consumption behavior. Therefore, this study identifies household heating energy usage patterns and the substitutive and/or complementary relationships between electricity and gas. Based on a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value model, household utility structure is identified from data on gas-heating usage. Results show greater utility and the smallest satiation values for gas boilers than for electric heaters and electric heating beds. The effects of consumer socioeconomic and environmental characteristics on the choice of heating energy sources were analyzed. Also, for further comparison, the respondents were split into high and low categories for income, heating degree days, dwelling size, and gas usage. Gas was found to be the most economical heating choice for households. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Firm locations are examined on two geographical scales, the national and regional level. The final sample comprises 307 location choices in 27 countries and across 45 regions. Both, location- and firm-specific variables are used for analyzing investment strategies. The results show that higher market demand and cultural proximity to France increase the likelihood of a particular location to be chosen, whereas higher labour cost and a larger distance between a foreign location and the headquarters deter FDI investments. Manufacturing and older companies are more likely to establish their first subsidiary in Eastern Europe. Furthermore, this study examines the extent to which French investors choose foreign locations that already host a significant number of French firms. The results obtained from regressions with various absolute and relative agglomeration measures suggest that French investors are rather attracted by firm cluster in general, or by the unobserved factors that led to the agglomeration in the first place, than by any nation-specific firm cluster.","Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch Essen, Ruhr Grad Sch Econ RGS Econ, D-45128 Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Procher, V (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch Essen, Ruhr Grad Sch Econ RGS Econ, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",procher@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,33,14,13,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

International development organizations frequently cite energy-poverty alleviation as a necessary condition to reduce income poverty. Several approaches used to measure energy poverty over the past 20 years have defined the energy poverty line as the minimum quantity of physical energy needed to perform such basic tasks as cooking and lighting. This paper uses a demand-based approach to define the energy poverty line as the threshold point at which energy consumption begins to rise with increases in household income. At or below this threshold point, households consume a bare minimum level of energy and should be considered energy poor. This approach was applied using cross-sectional data from a comprehensive 2004 household survey representative of rural Bangladesh. The findings suggest that some 58 percent of rural households in Bangladesh are energy poor, versus 45 percent that are income poor. The findings also suggest that policies to support rural electrification and greater use of improved biomass stoves might play a significant role in reducing energy poverty. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Two subsidy programs were initiated by the government of Taiwan in 1986 (1986-1991) and 2000 (2000-present), respectively. Those long-term national programs are considered to be the driving force on local market expansion. In 2008, the regional subsidy programs for solar water heaters were announced by Kaohsiung city and Kiemen county, which resulted in the growth in sales. A revised subsidy was also initiated by the government of Taiwan in 2009. The subsidy is 50% more. However, the tremendous enlargement of market size with a high-level ratio of subsidy over total installation cost might result in a negative impact on a sustainable SWH industry and long-term development of the local market, which is associated with system design and post-installation service. This paper aims to address the relative efficiency and pitfalls of those national and regional programs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the food prices of seven major products: eggs, meat, milk, oilseeds, rice, sugar and wheat. The macroeconomic variables studied were crude oil prices, consumer price indexes, food production indexes and GDP around the world between 1961 and 2005. We use the Scree test and the proportion of variance method for determining the optimal number of common factors. The correlation coefficient between the extracted principal component and the macroeconomic index varies between 0.87 for the world GDP and 0.36 for the consumer price index. We find the food production index has the greatest influence on the macroeconomic index and that the oil price index has an influence on the food production index. Consequently, crude oil prices have an indirect effect on food prices. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The connection between fuel poverty, and electricity disconnection or 'self-disconnection' is analysed for four cities using prepayment metering to pay for electricity. A price comparison analysis on a government-sponsored website showed that prepayment metering was more expensive than other payment options. This website analysis was supplemented by qualitative data from older people with chronic respiratory disease expressing their views about electricity disconnection and prepayment metering. We show that prepayment metering for electricity is more expensive than other payment methods in New Zealand and that older people's insights provide valuable context to these issues. Under the present payment schedule, the use of prepayment metering to pay for electricity is not a suitable policy instrument to address fuel poverty, which remains problematic. The deregulated electricity market continues to lead to increases in the real price of residential electricity and in the number of people in fuel poverty.

(2009) have examined a synergy effect between electricity and gas services in the US electric utility industry. They have compared electricity-specialized firms with diversified utility firms in their financial performance and corporate value. A problem of their study is that it has not empirically measured the operational performance of the electric utility firms. As an extension of the preceding study, this research investigates the operational performance of 104 US electric utility firms (1990-2004) by fully utilizing DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis). This study finds the three new policy implications. First, the synergy effect has not existed in the operational performance of diversified utility firms before and after the deregulation on the US electricity markets. Thus, core business concentration is more effective for electric utility firms than corporate diversification to enhance their operational performance under the current US deregulation policy. Second, the operational performance has had an increasing trend until 1996 and a decreasing trend after 1996. Thus, the US deregulation policy has been influential on their operational performance. Third, the enhancement in operational performance of electric utility firms has improved their financial performance. The improvement in financial performance has increased their corporate value. Thus, this study finds the business causality among operational performance, financial performance and corporate value in the US electric utility industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that underlying a relatively stable distribution of national comparative advantages over time, there are wide variations in local performance: only a few provinces demonstrate any stability in their specialization over the last decade, with the majority showing decreased specialization.

An original flexy-energy concept of hybrid solar PV/diesel/biofuel power plant, without battery storage, is performed in this paper. This concept is developed in order to not only make access to energy possible for rural and pen-urban populations in Africa (by reducing the electricity generation cost) but also to make the electricity production sustainable in these areas.

Strategic value of thermonuclear fusion technology is estimated here based on the expected cash flows from construction and operation of fusion power plants and the real options value arising due to managerial flexibility and the underlying uncertainty. First, a basic investment option model of Black-Scholes type is being considered. Then, a fuzzy compound real R&D option model is elaborated, which reflects in a better way the multi-stage nature of the programme and takes into account the imprecision of information as one of the components of the overall programme uncertainty. Two different strategies are compared: Baseline corresponding to a relatively moderate pace of fusion research, development, demonstration and deployment activities vs. Accelerated strategy, which assumes a rapid demonstration and massive deployment of fusion. The conclusions are drawn from the model calculations regarding the strategic value of fusion energy R&D and the advantages of accelerated development path. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It is well known that using only binary variables, such as whether or not there was an exception, sacrifices too much information. However, most of the specification tests (also called backtests) available in the literature, such as Christoffersen (1998) and Engle and Manganelli (2004) are based on such variables. In this article we propose a new backtest that does not rely solely on binary variables. It is shown that the new backtest provides a sufficient condition to assess the finite sample performance of a quantile model whereas the existing ones do not. The proposed methodology allows us to identify periods of an increased risk exposure based on a quantile regression model (Koenker and Xiao 2002). Our theoretical findings are corroborated through a Monte Carlo simulation and an empirical exercise with daily S&P500 time series.","[Gaglianone, Wagner Piazza] Cent Bank Brazil, Res Dept, BR-70074900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Gaglianone, Wagner Piazza] Fucape Business Sch, BR-70074900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Lima, Luiz Renato] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Lima, Luiz Renato] EPGE FGV, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Linton, Oliver] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Smith, Daniel R.] Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Business Adm, Burnaby, BC V6P 2T8, Canada; [Smith, Daniel R.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Central Bank of Brazil; FUCAPE Business School; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Simon Fraser University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Gaglianone, WP (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Brazil, Res Dept, BR-70074900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",wagner.gaglianone@bcb.gov.br; llima@utk.edu; o.linton@lse.ac.uk; drsmith@sfu.ca,"Gaglianone, Wagner P/M-7586-2017","Gaglianone, Wagner P/0000-0003-0796-2117; Smith, Daniel/0000-0003-2649-6529",CAPES [BEX1142/06-2]; Programme Alban [E06D100111BR]; CNPq; University of Illinois; ESRC; Leverhulme foundations; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid-Banco Santander Chair of Excellence; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Programme Alban; CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); University of Illinois; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Leverhulme foundations(Leverhulme Trust); Universidad Carlos III de Madrid-Banco Santander Chair of Excellence; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors thank the joint editor Arthur Lewbel, an anonymous associate editor, two anonymous referees, and Ignacio Lobato, Richard Smith, Juan Carlos Escanciano, and Keith Knight for their helpful comments and suggestions.

The observed exploration and production (E&P) contracts foresee much of the characteristics of the optimal contract, with a remuneration structure that combines upfront with future payments to mitigate uncertainty and incentivize exploratory efforts. In Brazil, despite slow market deconcentration since 1997's liberalization, the current oil regulation is in general consistent with an optimal regulatory response. From an economic standpoint, the 2009's new regulatory proposal prompted by the major oil discoveries offshore in Brazil reduces the power of incentive schemes with respect to exploratory and cost-reducing efforts while the changes in the net risk of the E&P offshore activities are not so clear.

The data consist of high-and medium-technology firms and knowledge-intensive services categorized by subregions (proxy for geography), industrial sectors (proxy for technology), and firm size (proxy for organization). Configurational information along these three dimensions is used as an indicator of a reduction of uncertainty or, in other words, the synergy across the knowledge functions. The results indicate that three regimes have been created during the Hungarian transition with very different dynamics: (1) Budapest and its agglomeration emerge as a knowledge-based innovation system on every indicator; (2) the north-western part of the country, where foreign-owned companies have induced a shift in knowledge-organization; while (3) the system in the eastern and southern parts of the country seems to be organized as a response to government expenditure.

The dynamics of agglomeration externalities along the life cycle of industries, Regional Studies. This paper investigates the changing roles of agglomeration externalities along the industry life cycle. It is argued that industries have different agglomeration needs in different stages of their life cycles because their mode of competition, innovation intensity, and learning opportunities change over time. For twelve Swedish manufacturing industries, it is determined for each year between 1974 and 2004 whether the industry is in a young, intermediate, or mature stage. Whereas Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR) externalities steadily increase with the maturity of industries, the effects of local diversity (Jacobs' externalities) are positive for young industries, but decline and even become negative for more mature industries.

Cet article cherche a examiner l'evolution du role des effets externes d'agglomeration tout au long du cycle de vie des industries. On soutient que les atouts de l'agglomeration varient suivant la phase du cycle de vie parce que le mode de competition, l'intensite de l'innovation, et les possiblites d'apprentissage des industries evoluent dans le temps. On determine pour douze industries suedoises et pour chaque annee de 1974 a 2004 si, oui ou non, une industrie est a un niveau naissant, intermediaire ou avance. Tandis que les effets externes Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR) augmentent regulierement au fur et a mesure du developpement des industries, les effets de la diversite locale (effets externes Jacobs) s'averent positifs pour les industries naissantes mais diminuent, voire s'averent negatifs, pour ce qui est des industries plus avancees.

Wir stellen die These auf, dass die Branchen in verschiedenen Phasen ihrer Lebenszyklen verschiedene Agglomerationsbedurfnisse aufweisen, da sich die Art ihres Wettbewerbs, die Intensitat der Innovationen und die Chancen zum Lernen im Laufe der Zeit verandern. Anhand von zwolf produzierenden Branchen Schwedens wird fur jedes Jahr von 1974 bis 2004 festgestellt, ob sich die Branchen jeweils in einem jungen, mittleren oder reifen Stadium befinden. Wahrend die Marshall-Arrow-Romer-(MAR)-Externalitaten mit zunehmender Reife der Branchen gleichmassig zunehmen, fallen die Auswirkungen der lokalen Diversitat (Jacobs-Externalitaten) fur junge Branchen positiv aus, nehmen dann aber fur reifere Branchen ab und werden schliesslich sogar negativ.

This has been argued that cluster's companies become more competitive on local, as well as on international markets, because cluster development promotes exports and development of new products. The factor of competitiveness has been the most important one during the cluster research. Professor Porter from the Harvard University was the first who has identified processes which unite cluster elements and are very important for improving competitiveness. Business clusters include related industries which can be producers, suppliers of specialized parts of production, providers of production equipment and services. Clusters usually consist of similar products, similar employment skills and technologies or they can be related by common resources and inputs. There are clusters which involve public institutions, as well as higher education and research institutions, agencies, think tanks, professional education establishments, entrepreneurship support institutions and others organisations providing professional knowledge, education, information, research possibilities and technical support. Enterprises united by similar targets and interests can cooperate to some extent, but they also compete. Cooperation can exist even under conditions of a very strong competition, because these related companies simultaneously are connected with other target groups, client markets and they cooperate with different partners in the process of developing their products. The objective of this research is to evaluate the development and role of clusters in Latvia based on the experience of Latvian Information technology (IT) cluster by evaluating its competitiveness and innovation capacity, which could serve as a good example for promoting the competitiveness of other industries.

With an imminent global climate change threat, India will have difficulties in continuing with this rising energy use levels towards achieving high economic growth. It will have to follow an energy-efficient pathway in attaining this goal. In this context, an attempt is made to present India's achievements on the energy efficiency front by tracing the evolution of policies and their impacts. The results indicate that India has made substantial progress in improving energy efficiency which is evident from the reductions achieved in energy intensities of GDP to the tune of 88% during 1980-2007. Similar reductions have been observed both with respect to overall Indian economy and the major sectors of the economy. In terms of energy intensity of GDP, India occupies a relatively high position of nine among the top 30 energy consuming countries of the world. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It investigates the importance of the SME sector size measured by the share of the SME employment in total employment, and the level of human capital in the SME sector measured by the average years of schooling in SMEs. Furthermore, it examines how these aspects of SMEs influence growth in regions with dissimilar level of development. The empirical findings show that the presence of SMEs is not positively correlated with growth and SMEs' human capital is more important for growth in more developed regions.","Univ Loughborough, Dept Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Cravo, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Loughborough, Dept Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",t.antonio-cravo@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,60,13,15,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

For the empirical test, two methods, the space-time K-function and Kulldorff's scan statistic, were applied using the ES-202 data of the Columbus MSA. The study discovered that knowledge-based industries represent the agglomeration process due to the product life cycle and sudden change, and that restructuring of industries, from traditional manufacturing industries to knowledge-based industries, is taking place in the study area.

While CA is dynamic, the common measures of CA (such as Balassa's revealed comparative advantage index and its variants) are static and not comparable over time. This paper adopts an alternate measure to assess the dynamics of CA, utilizing the normalized revealed comparative advantage (NRCA) index. By applying Hawaii's agricultural exports to the US mainland market as a case study during the period of 1995-2005, this paper illustrates how the NRCA index can systematically assess CA from three perspectives: (1) the static CA patterns, identifying which Hawaii agricultural products have comparative advantage; (2) the changes in CA, identifying which Hawaii agricultural products gain or lose CA; and (3) the trends of CA, identifying which Hawaii agricultural products exhibit statistically significant trends in gaining or losing CA.","[Yu, Run; Leung, PingSun] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Coll Trop Agr & Human Resources, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Cai, Junning] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Chinese Acad Finance & Dev, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Loke, Matthew K.] Hawaii Dept Agr, Agr Dev Div, Honolulu, HI 96814 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Yu, R (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Coll Trop Agr & Human Resources, 3050 Maile Way,Gilmore 111, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",run@hawaii.edu; junning.cafd.cufe@gmail.com; Matthew.K.Loke@hawaii.gov; psleung@hawaii.edu,,,,,,,19,13,13,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

These parks would develop technologies to enhance renewable energy sources, nuclear, coal, and others, as well as technologies to manage the waste, and transmit the energy. A survey of 3200 United States residents assessed public reaction to the policy. Half of the samples were gathered at four locations each centered on a major DOE facility; 25% were obtained at two other regions; and 25% were a national sample. As a whole, respondents from the four DOE-centered sites were more supportive of the concept than their counterparts, especially those respondents who lived in counties within 20 miles of the DOE site. Their support is associated with knowledge of the existing DOE facilities, desire for greater reliance on renewable energy sources and nuclear power, and a belief that the environment will improve during the next 25 years. They disproportionately trust authorities responsible for managing major energy facilities and assess the economic impact of these facilities to be positive. The challenge to proponents of energy parks is to broaden the support among the 60% that had more lukewarm or neutral responses to the idea and to place the proposal in the larger national energy policy context.

Applying our approach to 18 western European countries shows that even there, where air quality is relatively high compared with other parts of the world, health-related damages caused by air pollution may be substantial. We estimate that as of 2005, Europe experienced an annual loss in consumption of about 220 billion Euro in year 2000 prices (about 3% of total consumption) with a range based on 95% high and low epidemiological response functions of 107-335 billion Euro and a total welfare loss of about 370 billion Euro (range of 209-550) including both consumption and broader welfare losses (around 2% of welfare level) due to the accumulated effects of three decades of air pollution in Europe. In addition, we estimate that a set of air quality improvement policy scenarios as proposed in the 2005 CAFE program would bring 18 European countries as a whole a welfare gain of 37-49 billion Euro (year 2000 prices) in year 2020 alone.

The main objective of INPRO is to help the world community to ensure that clean and safe nuclear energy is available to contribute in fulfilling the energy needs in the 21st century in a sustainable manner. This paper demonstrates a methodology as an application of INPRO assessment for constructing nuclear power development scenarios by the use of IAEA energy optimisation models MESSAGE and DESAE. The scenario for the overall growth of energy and electricity in India is considered as a case study since for several decades India is vigorously pursuing nuclear power development program to meet its growing energy needs. It is evident from this study that in order to develop a realistic nuclear power scenario, it is necessary to generate an overall energy and electricity scenario at first. Within the overall energy-electricity picture it can be envisaged how the nuclear power technology would contribute to supply the future energy needs. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The main goal of the study is to analyse whether differing settlement patterns across regions can explain the ability of regional labour markets to form new matches. The basic matching function is extended to account for spatial spillovers between regions. The paper finds that matching efficiency in regions with low average population density, but with few dense, urban settlements, is as high as in urbanized high-density areas. It is therefore important to take into account both population density and dispersion of population within a region when analysing matching in regional labour markets.","[Moilanen, Mikko] No Res Inst, N-9294 Tromso, Norway; [Moilanen, Mikko] Univ Tromso, Dept Econ & Management, N-9037 Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Moilanen, M (通讯作者)，No Res Inst, POB 6434,Tromso Sci Pk, N-9294 Tromso, Norway.",mikko.moilanen@norut.no,,,,,,,55,11,14,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Disaggregated data from each company have been used to determine which companies (refineries) are importing crude oil, how much oil each transnational company is produced abroad, and where this production goes to. The analysis show that American international oil production represents a small part of U.S. oil imports. Two conclusions are reached. The first is that U.S. refineries buy the majority of the crude oil they process on the international market and, as a result, are dependent on the unstable conditions of this market. The second is that the economic interests the large American oil companies have abroad are far greater than those they have within the United States and, as a result, these companies do not play a decisive role in a national strategy to guarantee foreign supply.

This paper examines the effectiveness of the principal existing policies that could potentially promote the expansion of renewable electricity (RElec) in Australia: the expanded Renewable Energy Target (RET); the proposed emissions trading scheme (ETS); and the state and territory-based feed-in tariffs. We find the effectiveness of RET is severely eroded by the inclusion of solar and heat pump hot water systems; by the inclusion of 'phantom' tradable certificates: and by high electricity consumption growth. We also find that the ETS will not produce a high enough carbon price to assist most RElec technologies before 2020: and that most of the feed-in tariffs exclude large-scale RElec and will give little assistance to small-scale RElec because they are mostly net tariffs. Unless there is a major revision of its RElec policy mechanisms, Australia will fail to reach its renewable electricity target and in particular will fail to build up its solar generation capacity which could be a major source of future deep cuts in the country's electricity generation emissions.

Using a linear programming model, the study determined the least-cost transportation network under various constraints on the volumes of CO2 captured from the sources and the injection rates at the sinks. Four scenarios were developed to gauge the sensitivity of the results to these and to the availability of fields for EOR and Permanent Storage. Depending on the scenario, the optimal transportation CAPEX was found to range between 3.5 pound and 5.2 pound billion in real terms. With higher minimum injection rates at the fields, accelerating CO2-EOR investments was found to reduce unit transportation CAPEX compared to waiting for their cessation of production dates. On the other hand a combination of the later availability of the CO2-EOR fields plus a lower minimum injection rate yielded the minimum transportation network CAPEX. The modelling also unveiled the problem of CO2 supply overflows in the longer term. The modelling approach has wide applicability beyond the UK. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, there is growing interest in strategies to reduce peak demand by eliminating electricity use, or shifting it to non-peak times. This strategy is commonly called demand response. In households, common strategies are time-varying pricing, which charge more for energy use on peak, or direct load control, which allows utilities to curtail certain loads during high demand periods. We reviewed recent North American studies of these strategies. The data suggest that the most effective strategy is a critical peak price (CPP) program with enabling technology to automatically curtail loads on event days. There is little evidence that this causes substantial hardship for occupants, particularly if they have input into which loads are controlled and how, and have an override option. In such cases, a peak load reduction of at least 30% is a reasonable expectation. It might be possible to attain such load reductions without enabling technology by focusing on household types more likely to respond, and providing them with excellent support. A simple time-of-use (TOU) program can only expect to realise on-peak reductions of 5%. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study analyzes the potential factors influencing the growth of electricity consumption in China's industrial sector over the past decade using a logarithmic mean Divisia index I decomposition method. Results show that activity effect and shift effect (caused by the change in the electricity's share of industrial energy use) are the major factors responsible for the rise in electricity consumption between 1998 and 2007. It is found that structural change also contributed to the increase in electricity consumption, it had only a small effect. In contrast, the technological effect is responsible for a decrease in electricity consumption during this period. The influences of technological effects and shift effects followed approximately an inverse-U-shaped and U-shaped curve, respectively. Furthermore, the results show that the main contributors to incremental electricity consumption among industrial subsectors were manufacturing of raw chemical material and products, manufacturing of non-metal mineral products, smelting and pressing of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and production and supply of electric power and heat power. These sectors should take priority for industrial restructuring in order to implement policies for energy and electricity savings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Thereby in a first step the market designs of the major European power markets in France, Germany, Scandinavia, Spain and UK are reviewed, with a particular focus on liquidity in the spot and intraday markets. Then some key features of the short-term adjustments required by wind energy are discussed and the necessity of sufficient liquidity in intraday markets is highlighted. For the example of the German market subsequently the discrepancy between the physical short-term adjustment needs and the traded volumes on the intraday market is analyzed. This leads to an evaluation of proposals for improving the liquidity on the short-term market, including the use of continuous spot trading like in UK or the use of intraday auctions like in Spain.

Although physical health effects on adults appear to be modest, caregivers and children perceive significant impacts on children's respiratory health. There also appear to be significant effects on the physical health of infants, particularly on weight gain and susceptibility to illness. Mental health effects on adults emerge as significant in most studies, as do mental health impacts on adolescents. Mental health effects on children have, as yet, never been systematically assessed. Whilst several studies are methodologically rigorous, with some also based on very large samples, methodological problems remain. In future evaluations of health impacts, clinical outcomes could be more comprehensively augmented with measures that extend beyond physical health. These include measures reflecting quality of life, changes in patterns of social engagement and daily routine, and their concomitant impacts on mental wellbeing, Such measures may provide more rounded insights into the potential health impacts of tackling fuel poverty and-equally as important for policy and practice-the processes by which these impacts become manifest.

J,"Mitchell, C; Woodman, B",,,,"Mitchell, Catherine; Woodman, Bridget",,,Towards trust in regulation-moving to a public value regulation,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Economic regulation; Trust; Sustainability,INNOVATION; SYSTEMS,"The UK Government has committed itself to reducing its carbon dioxide emissions. The challenge of successfully achieving a transition to a sustainable energy system, in the context of the UK's largely privately owned energy industry, rests on the ability of policy makers to encourage and enable the necessary changes or innovation at all levels of the energy system. This paper argues that the UK's current, dominant political paradigm or framework (the regulatory state paradigm (RSP)) and within it, the role of the economic regulator, Ofgem acts as a fundamental block to this challenge. The current economic regulatory system is based on trust in the market, or on predicted (albeit theoretical) known outcomes. To expand our regulatory system to one which can deliver a sustainable energy system requires innovation in a certain direction (as opposed to any innovation). That is the antithesis of the current process of regulation. Trust is required that Ofgem, the economic regulator, will develop rules and incentives which deliver an agreed sustainable energy goal, which is 'trusted' to be the 'right' goal. This requires Ofgem moving away from ex-ante regulation to a type of regulation where all costs, benefits and outcomes cannot be known beforehand and where they cannot necessarily be quantifiable. This has, very provisionally, been called Public Value Regulation (PVR).

Arguments in favor and against are abundant. Our position is that the issue should be empirically studied starting from an actual, non-optimal tax system structure and by way of checking the responsiveness of equilibria to revenue neutral tax regimes under alternate scenarios regarding technological substitution. With the use of a CGE model, we find that the most critical elasticity for achieving a double dividend is the substitution elasticity between labor and capital whereas the elasticity that would generate the highest reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is the substitution elasticity among energy goods.

The growing demand for cleaner fuel in the past ten years has encouraged domestic exploration and production of natural gas (NG) and the construction of long-haul pipelines linking upstream western regions of the country to downstream city-gas consumers in the eastern coastal areas. However, demand for NG in the cities is increasing so fast that recent winters have seen severe supply difficulties. This led to a government directive which set constraints on the domestic NG supplies and discouragement to gas power and petrochemical projects, and eventually to the Chinese government's willingness to accept the higher prices commanded by the international NG market. Nevertheless, the over demand situation has created a dominant market position for upstream NG producers and long-haul pipeline operators favouring their forward integration into downstream city-gas markets. Accordingly, pressures are building that may yet result in substantial pricing and regulatory reform in the city-gas industry. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper expresses the oil export dependency of each economy in terms of a multiplicative identity that captures effective export price, export to primary oil supply ratio, oil dependency and oil export intensity of the country. Using the data for 1980-2006, the evolution in these factors is investigated for seven MENA countries and the influence of the above factors is decomposed using the Laspeyres index. The analysis shows that energy price and increasing energy intensity in the MENA countries have influenced the overall oil export dependency. Reducing the energy intensity can improve oil export revenue share to GDP by 5-10% in most of the countries while Iran can gain significantly by increasing its export volume. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the BAU scenario, the electrical energy requirement will raise up to 5000 bKwh units per year or 752 GW of installed capacity with major consumers being in the industry, domestic and service sectors. This demand can be met by a mix of coal, hydro, nuclear and wind technologies. Other reneawbles i.e. solar and biomass will start contributing from the year 2040 onwards. By full exploitation of energy saving potential, the annual electrical energy demand gets reduced to 3061 bKwh (or 458 GW), a reduction of 38.9%.The green house gas emissions reduce correspondingly.

Presently, electricity is generated using a diesel generator by Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) for a limited time and location. Due to its remote location, the fuel cost in Kutubdia is very expensive. In the present study one-year recorded wind by Bangladesh Centre of Advanced Studies (BCAS) location and other three potential locations for hybrid system analysis is discussed. The system configuration of the hybrid is achieved based on a theoretical domestic load at the island. The sizing of the hybrid power systems is discussed with 0% and 5% annual capacity of shortage. This feasibility study indicates that wind-PV-diesel system is feasible with 0% capacity of shortage and wind-diesel system is feasible with 5% annual capacity of shortage at all locations. As 5% annual capacity of shortage can be considered, the wind-diesel hybrid system will reduce net present cost as well as cost of energy to about 20% and the diesel consumption on the island can be reduced to about 50% of its present annual consumption. Such a hybrid system will reduce about 44% green house gases (GHG) from the local atmosphere. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In April 2009, the State of California adopted the Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), a groundbreaking policy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. This paper reviews the major elements of a LCFS, focusing on California's implementation, and discusses the key open issues of a LCFS. This paper also summarizes the major elements of the cap-and-trade and carbon tax concepts, the two principal alternative approaches to regulating greenhouse gases emissions. Analytical issues associated with the LCFS are highlighted, including land-use change effects associated with certain biofuels. If electricity becomes a significant transportation fuel, a number of regulatory issues will need to be addressed. Beyond California, the LCFS approach appears to be favored by several other US states and the European Union.

A focus is set on Swedish municipalities. The demand for heat is visualized in terms of load curves and duration diagrams. A standard diagram is chosen in order to analyze the dimensioning of a CHP plant. Two main alternative dimensions are analyzed in depth, namely to operate a plant with full capacity during eight months or alternatively during six months of the year. For each alternative, a CHP plant is compared to a heat water plant (a boiler) and a biological fuel is compared to the one of natural gas. Then, further expansions are analyzed in a parametric way. The outcome is that it is efficient to choose the dimension so large that it will only be operating at full scale during three months of the year. It is also shown that CHP plant based on biological fuel is profitable and outstanding. These theoretical findings are then illustrated by data taken from 10 large Swedish municipalities - Goteborg, Helsingborg, Linkoping, Lund, Malmo, Norrkoping, Stockholm, Uppsala, Vasteras, and Orebro. However, even if cogeneration is an energy efficient way to supply electricity and heat in these municipalities, there are constraints to invest. Examples are contracted deliveries of heat from outside, existing old plants, average cost pricing, and uncertainties in terms of future taxation principles.","[Bergendahl, Goran] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,,goran.bergendahl@handels.gu.se,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1867-8998,,978-3-642-12066-4,ENERG SYST,,,2010,,,,,,,247,266,,10.1007/978-3-642-12067-1_15,0.0,,,20,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BVS65,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292659100015,0

Furthermore, biomass gasification could also be used for the efficient production of biofuels for transport. In this study, different applications of biomass gasification in connection to district heating (DH) are analysed and contrasted to conventional technology options. An application of the cost-optimizing energy system model MARKAL with a detailed description of the DH sector in a southwestern region of Sweden was developed within the study and used in the analysis. Policy measures for CO(2) reduction and for promotion of green electricity are assumed, and required subsidy levels for large-scale production of transport biofuels are calculated. The model also operates with different supplies of biomass: a local supply at a lower cost and an international supply of refined biomass at a slightly higher cost. The study shows that investments in BIGCC CHP are often cost-efficient in cases with low ambitions regarding transport biofuels. However, due to limitations in heat demand and in local, lower cost, supply of biomass, investment in biofuel production means less investment in BICCC CHP and, thereby, a smaller electricity production.

This paper focuses on the impacts of financial intermediation development on the urban-rural income disparity (URID) in China. Using a twenty-year province-level panel data set from 1978 to 1998, it is found that the change of URID may be explained by fiscal policy during the early reform period (1978-1989) and financial intermediates during the later reform period (1990-1998). In addition, it is shown that the direction the Kuznets effect, an inverted 'U'-shaped relationship between per-capita gross domestic product and URID, is sensitive to changes in government development policies. This study adds to the spatial economic inequality literature by clarifying the effects of urban-biased financial intermediation policy on the underlying dynamics of convergent and divergent effects on urban-rural inequality.","[Chen, Yiu Por] Depaul Univ, Sch Publ Serv, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Liu, Mingxing] Peking Univ, China Inst Educ Finance Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qi] Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",DePaul University; Peking University; Northwestern University,"Chen, YP (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, Sch Publ Serv, 25 E Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",ychen16@depaul.edu; mxliu@ccer.pku.edu.cn; qi-zhang@Northwestern.edu,,"CHEN, Yiu Por/0000-0001-5921-1310",,,,,53,20,23,2,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Energycane may be grown for more ratoon crops, on marginal land, in cooler environments, and with fewer inputs than sugarcane. Economic sustainability will depend on biofuel yields from the conversion of feedstocks such as sugarcane and energycane via multiple techniques such as combustion and cellulosic conversion.

This paper presents Chinese research and application on GSHP followed by descriptions of patents. The policies related to GSHP are also introduced and analyzed. With the support of Chinese government, several new heat transfer models and two new GSHP systems (named pumping and recharging well (PRW) and integrated soil cold storage and ground-source heat pump (ISCS&GSHP) system) have been developed by Chinese researchers. The applications of GSHP systems have been growing rapidly since the beginning of the 21st century with financial incentives and supportive government policies. However, there are still several challenges for the application of GSHP systems in large scale. This paper raises relevant suggestions for overcoming the existing and potential obstacles. in addition, the developing and applying prospects of GSHP systems in China are also discussed.

The paper starts with a discussion of energy security, and breaks it down into four main categories of threat. These include threats due to fossil fuel scarcity and external disruptions, problems due to a lack of investment in infrastructure, threats due to technology or infrastructure failure, and risks due to domestic activism or terrorism. The paper then discusses one of the most common strategies put forward to improve security-the promotion of diversity within energy systems. Following this, the paper assesses the potential for new nuclear investment to ameliorate security threats in each of the four categories introduced earlier in the paper. The paper concludes that whilst nuclear investment can help to mitigate some threats to UK energy security, the government's case for supporting this investment ignores some equally important security issues. As a result, the energy security case for nuclear power has not yet been made. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We also formalize the relationship between the Laspeyres index method and the Shapley value in the IDA context. Similarly, such a relationship can be extended to cover other IDA methods linked to the Laspeyres index through defining the characteristic function in the Shapley value.

This paper explains the re-emergence of concerns about energy insecurity in recent years as well as the reasons for their subsequent overshadowing. It describes and explains the steps that have been taken during this period to promote German energy security and analyzes their adequacy. The paper identifies a number of reasons to be skeptical about how much the agreed policies will improve Germany's energy security, but it concludes that there are nevertheless good reasons to expect the issue to regain the attention of policy-makers in the future.

However, price elasticity has seldom been estimated in Japan; instead, it has been assumed to be as small as 0.1 or 0 without proper examination of the empirical validity of such a prior! assumptions. We estimated the regional power demand functions for nine regions, in order to quantify the elasticity, and found the short-run price elasticity to be 0.09-0.30 and the long-run price elasticity to be 0.12-0.56. Inter-regional comparison of our estimation results suggests that price elasticity in rural regions is larger than that in urban regions. Popular assumptions of small elasticity of 0.1, for example, could be suitable for examining Japan's aggregate power demand but not power demand functions that focus on respective regions. Furthermore, assumptions about smaller elasticity values such as 0.01 and 0 could not be supported statistically by this study. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the most debated issues prior to this compromise was the design of target flexibility mechanisms, which should allow member states with low or expensive renewable energy potential to partly fulfil their national renewable energy target in other countries. This article traces back the political discussion that has led to the evolution of the different flexibility options. It then evaluates the most prominent flexibility mechanisms against a set of qualitative criteria. It concludes that free or restricted certificate trade based on guarantees of origin (GOs) - as proposed earlier by the European Commission - is not a viable option due to some knockout criteria, despite other potential advantages. The mechanisms that have replaced GO trade in the final compromise - joint projects, joint support schemes and statistical transfer between member states - provide less flexibility. but score better against a number of other important criteria. The crucial question for the coming years is how their utilisation can be facilitated. One first step might be that proactive member states define open design issues for implementing the mechanisms.

We study the structure (in terms of density, centralisation, clustering, assortativity, centre-periphery and resilience) of these international knowledge flows through network analysis techniques and we test the influence of geographical distance as opposed to sectoral (based on the industrial distribution of innovative activity) and functional (based on the value of the European technological index) distances in shaping the strength of knowledge relations through a gravitational model. Network Analysis techniques applied to the configuration of international knowledge flows between European regions highlight the existence of a polarised hierarchical structure. By estimating a gravity equation model we demonstrate that, far from the claim of the death of distance, geographic distance is still relevant for determining the structure of inter-regional knowledge flows. Functional and, above all, sectoral distances play also a relevant role suggesting that knowledge flows easier between similar regions (according to their technological level and the industrial distribution of their innovation system).","[Maggioni, Mario A.; Uberti, Teodora Erika] Catholic Univ, Dept Int Econ Dev & Inst DISEIS, Fac Polit Sci, Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Maggioni, MA (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ, Dept Int Econ Dev & Inst DISEIS, Fac Polit Sci, Milan, Italy.",mario.maggioni@unicatt.it; erika.uberti@unicatt.it,"Maggioni, Mario A./AGL-3270-2022","MAGGIONI, Mario A./0000-0002-2449-8275",,,,,59,115,124,5,74,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

This paper models the future demand for gas in India from the electricity sector under alternative scenarios for the period 2005-2025, using bottom-up ANSWER MARKAL model. The scenarios are differentiated by alternate economic growth projections and policies related to coal reforms, infrastructure choices and local environment. The results across scenarios show that gas competes with coal as a base-load option if price difference is below US S 4 per MBtu. At higher price difference gas penetrates only the peak power market. Gas demand is lower in the high economic growth scenario, since electricity sector is more flexible in substitution of primary energy. Gas demand reduces also in cases when coal supply curve shifts rightwards such as under coal reforms and coal-by-wire scenarios. Local environmental (SO2 emissions) control promotes end of pipe solutions flue gas desulfurisation (FGD) initially, though in the longer term mitigation happens by fuel substitution (coal by gas) and introduction of clean coal technologies integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC).

On the other hand, our results are more similar to those obtained from models where the level of employment is directly influenced by the energy price. Confirming the findings of Bosquet [2000. Environmental tax reform: does it work? A survey of the empirical evidence. Ecological Economics 34, 19-32] and OECD [2004. Environment and Employment: An Assessment Working Party on National Environmental Policy OECD, Paris], we conclude that environmental tax reforms can deliver substantial reductions in energy consumption while having small effects on the level of employment, effect which can be positive, depending on the size of the reduction in the labour costs and the value of cross-price elasticities.

One key controversy concerns the magnitude of the expected impacts of climate change. Stern's estimates, based on results from the PAGE2002 model, Sounded substantially greater than those produced by many other models, leading several critics to suggest that Stern had inflated his damage figures. We reached the opposite conclusion in a recent application of PAGE2002 in a study of the costs to the US economy of inaction on climate change. This article describes our revisions to the PAGE estimates, and explains our conclusion that the model runs used in the Stern Review may well underestimate US and global damages. Stern's estimates from PAGE2002 implied that mean business-as-usual damages in 2100 would represent just 0.4 percent of GDP for the United States and 2.2 percent of GDP for the world.

Further the process of evaluation gains interest especially by endogenous treatment of energy technologies under uncertainty in learning rates with technology gap across the regions in global regional cluster learning approach. This work devised, implemented, and examined new methodologies on technology gaps (a practical problem), using two broad concepts of knowledge deficit and time lag approaches in global learning, applying the floor cost approach methodology. The study was executed in a multi-regional, technology-rich and long horizon bottom-up linear energy system model on The Integrated MARKAL EFOM System (TIMES) framework. Global learning selects highest learning technologies in maximum uncertainty of learning rate scenario, whereas any form of technology gap retards the global learning process and discourages the technologies deployment. Time lag notions of technology gaps prefer heavy utilization of learning technologies in developed economies for early reduction of specific cost. Technology gaps of any kind should be reduced among economies through the promotion and enactment of various policies by governments, in order to utilize the technological resources by mass deployment to combat ongoing climate change.

These S-curves can be used to gain insight into the relative payoff of investment in competing technologies, as well as providing some insight into when and why some technologies overtake others in the race for dominance. Analyzing renewable energies from such a technology S-curve perspective reveals some surprising and important implications for both government and industry. Using data on government R&D investment and technological improvement (in the form of cost reductions), we show that both wind energy and geothermal energy are poised to become more economical than fossil fuels within a relatively short time frame. The evidence further suggests that R&D for wind and geothermal technologies has been under-funded by national governments relative to funding for solar technologies, and government funding of fossil fuel technologies might be excessive given the diminishing performance of those technologies.

Of particular interest has been comparing the driving forces of increasing efficiency and economic structural change. Input-output analysis (IOA) and decomposition analysis have become critical tools for performing such analyses. This study analyzes aggregate energy use in the United States in 1997 and 2002 to discover the Causes of changing energy usage and flows. Results show that rising population and household consumption acted to drive up energy demand, but this driving force was offset by considerable structural change within the economy, particularly related to a quickly increasing trade deficit in manufacturing goods. Thus, while total energy intensity, the ratio of energy use to economic output, declined by approximately 12% between 1997 and 2002, changes in the structure of the economy explain this drop more than increased energy efficiency. The level of aggregation at which decomposition analyses are run was identified as a crucially sensitive parameter for the determination of structural change, and future Studies should specifically address the amount of detail necessary to adequately measure changes in economic structure.

Very fuel-efficient (A) cars receive a cash incentive, highly inefficient (G) cars pay additional fees. Consumers have different price elasticities and behavioral options to react to feebates. They can switch to a smaller sized car, but as energy-efficiency varies widely within size segments, they can also stick to the preferred size class and choose a more efficient (smaller) engine. In addition, previously owned cars influence the next car to be chosen, We use an agent-based microsimulation approach particularly suited to predict environmental and market effects of feebates. Heteorogenous agents choose from a choice set drawn from a detailed fleet of new cars. Incentives of (sic)2000 for A-labeled cars induce an additional rated CO2 emission decrease of new car registrations between 3.4% and 4.3%, with CO2 abatement costs between (sic)6 and (sic)13 per ton, and otherwise little undesired market disturbance. The risk of rebound effects is estimated to be low. After adopting the frequencies of consumer segments to a given country, the model presented is applicable to all European car markets.

The production of energy from renewable sources, however, greatly depends on climatic conditions, which may be impacted in the future due to global climate change (GCC). This paper analyzes the vulnerabilities of renewable energy production in Brazil for the cases of hydropower generation and liquid biofuels production, given a set of long-term climate projections for the A2 and B2 IPCC emission scenarios. The most important result found in this study is the increasing energy vulnerability of the poorest regions of Brazil to GCC. Both biofuels production (particularly biodiesel) and electricity generation (particularly hydropower) may negatively suffer from changes in the climate of those regions. Other renewable energy sources-such as wind power generation-may also be vulnerable, raising the need for further research. However, the results found are fundamentally dependent on the climate projections which, in turn, are still highly uncertain with respect to the future evolution of greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and GCC. Therefore, in such long-term scenario analyses, the trends and directions derived are the ones to be emphasized rather than the precise results one arrives. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We apply the recent unit-root test of the panel seemingly unrelated regressions augmented Dickey-Fuller (SURADF) test developed by Breuer et al. [2001. Misleading inferences from panel unit-root tests with an illustration from purchasing power parity. Review of International Economics 9, 482-493; 2002. Series-specific unit-root tests with panel data, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics 64, 527-546]. The panel SURADF test accounts for the presence of cross-country correlations in the data, and the parameters in the panel specification vary across countries. More importantly, this test allows us to identify how many and which members of the panel contain a unit root. Overall, our empirical results illustrate that real GDP and CO2 emissions in these countries are a mixture of l(0) and l(1) processes, and that the traditional panel unit-root tests could lead to misleading inferences as well as the conduct of cointegration analysis being perhaps inappropriate. The results of our analysis carry critical implications for the modeling of CO2 emissions and GDP because of the different orders of integration for the two variables. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The recent developments since 2001 including the setting up of a regulatory agency to undertake the regulation of the sector and increasing participation of private investors in the field of electricity generation are of special interest. This paper estimates cost functions and investigates the degree of scale economies, overinvestment, and technological progress in the Turkish electricity generation sector for the period 1984-2006 using long-run and short-run translog cost functions. Estimations were done for six groups of firms, public and private. The results indicate existence of scale economies throughout the period of analysis, hence declining long-run average costs. The paper finds empirical support for the Averch-Johnson effect until 2001, i.e., firms overinvested in an environment where there are excess returns to capital. But this effect was reduced largely after 2002. Technological progress deteriorated slightly from 1984-1993 to 1994-2001 but improved after 2002. Overall, the paper found that regulation of the market under the newly established regulating agency after 2002 was effective and there are potential gains from such regulation.

This paper examines the relationship between income polarization and economic growth in the regions of the European Union over the period 1993-2003. The results indicate that the level of income polarization is negatively associated with regional growth. This finding is in fact robust to various alternative specifications including a number of additional explanatory variables, such as initial per capita gross domestic product, industry mix, human capital stock, population density, or market potential. Furthermore, it should be noted that the observed negative correlation between polarization and economic performance does not depend on the number of groups used to analyse the degree of income stratification within the sample regions.

In this paper, Beijing's informatization level was first measured using related statistical data of Beijing (1998-2006). Second, the correlation between the urban informatization level and the economic growth level was analyzed by the Regression Analysis Method. The result shows that the development of informatization had greatly promoted economic growth. Third, each factor contributing to Beijing's economic growth was analyzed by the improved C-D Model; this analysis indicates that information had become the first major production factor affecting the economic development of Beijing; the quality of laborers should be given attention in labor's input; and the influence of other factors except labor, capital and information can not be ignored.","[Jiang, Guorui; Li, Hui] Beijing Univ Technol, BJUT, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Technology,,jianggr@bjut.edu.cn; lihui1985@emails.bjut.edu.cn,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,465,468,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.102,0.0,,,4,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BLA43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269752000114,0

How useful is the concept of social exclusion when applied to rural older people in the United Kingdom and the United States?, Regional Studies. This paper explores the now widespread use of the concept 'social exclusion' in the United Kingdom and examines why discourses of social exclusion have not been used in the United States. The relationship between social exclusion and poverty is critically applied to rural older people, a group only recently appearing in debates about social exclusion in the UK. Despite extensive debates about social exclusion in the UK, it is shown that state-provided income programmes are crucial to reducing poverty among older people and that data to indicate progress on addressing any of the more relational aspects of social exclusion are largely insufficient.","[Moffatt, Suzanne] Newcastle Univ, Sch Med, Inst Hlth & Soc, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Glasgow, Nina] Cornell Univ, Dept Dev Sociol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Newcastle University - UK; Cornell University,"Moffatt, S (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Med, Inst Hlth & Soc, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.",s.m.moffatt@ncl.ac.uk; ng14@cornell.edu,,"Moffatt, Suzanne/0000-0002-8553-249X",,,,,71,33,40,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Best estimates of future energy availability are derived as an Energy Reference Case (ERC). An explicit economic growth model is used to interpret the impact of the ERC on economic growth. The model predicts a divergence from 20th century equilibrium conditions in economic growth and socioeconomic welfare is only stabilised under optimistic assumptions that demands a paradigm shift in contemporary economic thought and focused attention from policy makers. Fossil fuel depletion also constrains the maximum extent of Global Warming. Carbon emissions from the ERC comply nominally with the B1 scenario, which is the lowest emissions case considered by the IPCC. The IPCC predicts a temperature response within acceptance limits of the Global Warming debate for the B1 scenario. The carbon feedback cycle, used in the IPCC models, is shown as invalid for low-emissions scenarios and an alternative carbon cycle reduces the temperature response for the ERC considerably compared to the IPCC predictions. Our analysis proposes that the extent of Global Warming may be acceptable and preferable compared to the socio-economic consequences of not exploiting fossil fuel reserves to their full technical potential.

From 1979 to 2004, the average TFP growth rate of China was 1.8%. At the initial stage of reform and opening up, the average TFP growth rate of China was 1%, and its contribution to economic growth was about 7%; in the period of deepening reform, the two above-mentioned numbers were 2.7% and 25% respectively; and at the further deepening new stage, they were 2.1% and 24% respectively.

The TFP growth peaked in 1992 and then began to decline before it became stable after 1995.","[Yu Jie; Liu Runsheng; Cao Yan] Inst Sci & Tech Informat China, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",,,,,,,,,,20,1,1,1,6,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806057-7-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,17,24,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences; Mathematics,BOE48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276383800004,0

Growth poles theory or core periphery pattern suggests that different spatial interactions between a region and it s neighbors can enlarge or lessen regional disparities. Unfortunately, the traditional approaches to regional disparities suppose that each region is independent from others, so they just evaluate the regional disparity variations of isolated regions and cannot tell the dynamics of interrelated regions. This paper firstly explores the feasibility of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) in analyzing regional economic disparities. Unlike traditional statistical methods, such as coefficient s of variation, ESDA can incorporate spatial effects into the analysis of regional disparities, identifying global and local disparities at the regional scale and visualizing the spatial distribution and patterns through Moran scatter plots or maps. By means of global and local spatial autocorrelation analyses, this paper then investigates the spatial dynamics of regional disparities at the county level in Poyang Lake Area by analyzing increasing value of primary industry data, 2001-2007. Empirical results show that after more than seven years of reforms and opening up, the overall county level spatial disparities of regional economy in Poyang Lake Area have been greatly decreased over time.","[Xie Hualin] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Resource & Environm Management, Nanchang 330032, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,,xiehl_2000@163.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806057-7-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,120,124,,,,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences; Mathematics,BOE48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276383800022,0

How to use expression data to classify the multi-classification cancer samples becomes an urgent problem. Partial least squares (PLS) method has been proved to be a useful tool. Objective: Two multi-classification methods based on PLS were introduced and a comparative study was conducted. Methods: Four different significant gene selection methods were performed on four real tumor microarray gene expression datasets, and then two classification methods were carried out. Incomplete cross validation was used to assess the gene selection methods. The best gene selection method entered the following step. Under the best gene select method, total cross validation was used to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of two classification methods. Result: Two multi-classification methods can reach a good accuracy. Evaluated by incomplete cross validation, variable importance in projection (VIP) value was the best differentially expressed genes selection method. With the top 200 genes collected by VIP value and 4 components level, PLS-LDA and PLS-DA had quite good results. The average error rate and the difference between t-LOOCV and t-2-fold CV showed that PLS-DA outperformed PLS-LDA on accuracy and reliability.","[Jin Zhichao; Gao Qingbin; He Jia] Second Mil Med Univ, Dept Hlth Stat, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Naval Medical University,,,"Jin, Zhichao/AAF-7234-2019; Gao, Qing-Bin/G-9825-2011",,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806057-7-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,1212,1222,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences; Mathematics,BOE48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276383800206,0

Firstly, the development levels of service industry in all regions are evaluated by factor analysis in 2007 from scale, speed and structure aspects. Secondly, the vertical disparities of all regions are studied by comparative analysis of the factor scores' mean deviation in 2003 and 2007. Then, the horizontal disparities of all regions are studied by cluster analysis based on the factor scores in 2007. The conclusion is that there are obvious regional disparities of service industry in Shaanxi Province. From the development level aspect, there are mainly disparities of speed level and structure level, and the disparities of scale level relatively low. From the time aspect, the trends of the disparities of scale level, speed level and structure level are decreasing while the trends of overall level is increasing slowly. Form the space aspect, there is mainly disparities among the central Shaanxi area, the southern Shaanxi area and the northern Shaanxi area.

We apply this model to the smoking cessation decision made by individuals diagnosed with a cardiovascular disease using data from the 1998,2003 and 2006 waves of the Health Survey of England. Prescription of lipid-lowering drugs, which increased substantially over this period, is used as the measure of State investment. Using bivariate and trivariate probit models, we allow for the endogeneity of the doctor's decision to prescribe and offer smoking cessation advice. We find that unobservable characteristics affecting the prescription of drugs are positively correlated with those affecting smoking advice and negatively correlated with those affecting the propensity to quit. Our results indicate that prescription of lipid-lowering drugs to individuals with cardiovascular disease increases the probability of smoking cessation by 20-28 percentage points.

Different HRQoL instruments produce different scores for the same patient, and thus also a different number of QALYs. We examined the effect of these factors on the number of QALYs gained and the cost per QALY in the critical care setting. Methods: In 937 patients having been treated in the critical care setting in the Helsinki University Central Hospital the HRQoL scores were measured by the EQ-5D and 15D 6 and 12 months after start of treatment, and QALYs were calculated using four different sets of assumptions regarding recovery from disease. Results: The mean number of QALYs gained during the first year after treatment ranged from 0.178 +/- 0.206 to 0.550 +/- 0.508 and the consequent cost per QALY from (sic)38,405 to (sic)118,668 depending on HRQoL instrument and assumptions used in the calculations regarding recovery from disease. Conclusions: The HRQoL instrument and the assumptions employed regarding recovery from disease have a great influence on the results of cost-utility analyses and should, therefore, be explicitly described in studies reporting QALYs.

However, if some control variate is available, it is known that the control variate method reduces the variance of the sample mean. The control variate method often assumes that the variable of interest and the control variable are i.i.d. Here we assume that these variables are stationary processes with spectral density matrices, i.e. dependent. Then we propose an estimator of the mean of the stationary process of interest by using control variate method based on nonparametric spectral estimator. It is shown that this estimator improves the sample mean in the sense of mean square error. Also this analysis is extended to the case when the mean dynamics is of the form of regression. Then we propose a control variate estimator for the regression coefficients which improves the least squares estimator (LSE). Numerical studies will be given to see how our estimator improves the LSE. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

I argue that criticisms of the normalization I proposed in an earlier paper, and of the use of the binary variable for inequality analysis, stem from a misrepresentation of the properties of the binary variable, as well as a switch of focus away from relative inequality to absolute inequality.

Numerous studies have evaluated the uptake and impact of HDHPs on health-care utilization. Most studies have employed the standard difference-in-differences (DID) methodology. In this paper, we employ three alternative methodologies to evaluate a natural experiment in which a traditional health plan was fully replaced by a HDHP. We implement the standard DID and the quantile difference-in-differences (QDID) estimators to evaluate the impact of the HDHP on following six outcomes: overall cost, medical cost, pharmacy cost, outpatient visit count, inpatient visit count and emergency room visit count. We compare these results to a changes-in-changes (CIC) estimator, a generalized version of the standard (DID) estimator. We find that both the DID and CIC models yielded similar results, while the QDID model provided additional insights on the HDHP impact across different parts of the outcome distributions. Overall, introduction of HDHP had no impact on health-care costs, positive impact on the number of outpatient visits and mixed impacts on the inpatient and emergency room visit counts. The QDID estimates suggest HDHP introduction generally impacted subjects in upper percentiles (50th, 75th and 90th).

We use nine waves of the US Health and Retirement Study to compare lifestyles before and after 65 of those insured and not insured pre 65. The double-robust approach, which combines propensity score and regression, is used to compare trends in lifestyle (physical activity, smoking, drinking) of the two groups before and after receiving Medicare, using both difference-in-differences and difference-in-differences-in-differences. There is no clear effect of the receipt of Medicare or its anticipation on alcohol consumption nor smoking behaviour, but the previously uninsured do reduce physical activity just before receiving Medicare.

Bortezomib, indicated for multiple myeloma (MM) treatment, is available in 3.5-mg vials, a quantity higher than the average dose commonly prescribed. This analysis aimed to demonstrate, through real-world data, which would be the optimal vial presentation for bortezomib in Brazil and quantify the reduction in medication waste related to this option. Methods: From November 2007 to October 2009 all patients with MM treated with bortezomib were identified via the Evidencias database. Analysis of prescribed, dispensed, and wasted doses, their costs and projections of the ideal vial size were performed. Results: Thirty-five patients (mean body surface area of 1.73 m(2)) received 509 infusions in 131 cycles of treatment (average of 3.77 cycles per patient). The average dose prescribed was 2.1 mg per infusion (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.97-2.26) with average waste of 39.5% of the vial content (95% CI 35.35-43.76). The mean waste per patient per day was 1.38 mg (95% CI 1.24-1.52). If a 3-mg vial were available, the average drug waste per patient per day would be 0.88 mg (95% CI 0.74-1.03) or 36.2% less. With a 2.5-mg vial the waste would be 1.05 mg (95% CI 0.81-1.29) or 23.9% less. If two presentations were available (2.5 mg and 0.5 mg), the waste would be 0.52 mg (95% CI 0.4-0.63) or 62.5% less. Considering the price of the different vials to be proportional to the original 3.5-mg vial, the cost would be also reduced by the same rates described above. Conclusions: A simple adjustment in vial size may reduce the waste of bortezomib by 36% to 62% and can also reduce the cost of treatment.","[Clark, Luciana; Castro, Ana Paula; Fortes, Anna Flavia; Santos, Fabio; Clark, Otavio; Engel, Tobias; Pegoretti, Bruna; Puty, Fabiola] Evidencias, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Teich, Vanessa; Vianna, Denizar] MedInsight, Sao Paulo, Brazil",,"Clark, L (通讯作者)，Rua Tranquillo Prosperi 143,Bairro Santa Genebra, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",luciana.clark@evidencias.com.br,"Garcia-Fraile, Paula/N-8193-2014; Clark, Otavio/HTR-4776-2023; Iats, Inct/K-2300-2013","Clark, Otavio/0000-0003-1607-2589;",,,,,23,19,20,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5.0,,S,,,S82,S84,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.013,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BE,21839906.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081000018,0

We measure health-aid flows over 1995-2006 for 109 aid recipients, matching aid data with measures of different dimensions of governance and a range of country-specific economic and health characteristics. Everything else being equal, countries with more political rights receive significantly more aid, but so do countries with higher corruption levels. The dependence of aid on political rights, even when we control for other governance indicators, suggests that health aid is sometimes used as an incentive to reward political reforms.

The average per diem decreased under the PPS, but because per diems increased for greater therapy minutes, the ability of the PPS to deter the use of high-intensity services was questionable. In this study, we assess how the PPS affected the volume and intensity of Medicare services. By volume we mean the product of the number of Medicare residents in a facility and the average length-of-stay, by intensity we mean the time per week devoted to rehabilitation therapy. Our results indicate that the number of Medicare residents decreased under PPS, but rehabilitative services and therapy minutes increased while length-of-stay remained relatively constant. Not surprisingly, when subsequent Medicare policy changes increased payment rates, Medicare volume far surpassed the levels seen in the pre-PPS period. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Beta regression is used in various disciplines to address the specific features of bounded outcome variables such as heteroscedasticity, but has rarely been used in the context of health-related quality of life measures. We aimed to examine if beta regression is appropriate for analyzing the relationship between subject characteristics and SF-6D index scores. Methods: We used data from the population-based German KORA F4 study. Besides classical beta regression, we also fitted extended beta regression models by allowing a regression structure on the precision parameter. Regression coefficients and predictive accuracy of the models were compared to those from a linear regression model with model-based and robust standard errors. Results: The beta distribution fitted the empirical distribution of the SF-6D index better than the normal distribution. Extended beta regression performed best in terms of predictive accuracy but confidence intervals of the fit measures suggested that no model was superior to the others. Age had a significant negative effect on the precision parameter indicating higher variation of health utilities in older age groups. The observations reporting perfect health had a high influence on model results. Conclusions: Beta regression, especially with precision covariates is a possible supplement to the methods currently used in the analysis of health utility data. In particular, it accounted for the boundedness and heteroscedasticity of the SF-6D index. A pitfall of the beta regression is that it does not work well in handling one-valued observations.","[Hunger, Matthias; Holle, Rolf] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Baumert, Jens] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Epidemiol 2, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"Hunger, M (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",matthias.hunger@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Holle, Rolf/D-9333-2013",,Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; State of Bavaria,Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health(Helmholtz Association); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); State of Bavaria,"Source of financial support: The KORA research platform (KORA, Cooperative Research in the Region of Augsburg) was initiated and financed by the Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and by the State of Bavaria.",,41,48,50,1,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5.0,,,,,759,767,,10.1016/j.jval.2010.12.009,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BG,21839416.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081300019,0

Methods: A time series analysis was performed using data from British Columbia's centralized administrative health-care databases. Linear regression on data from a stable 3-year prepolicy period was used to predict future use of inhaled anticholinergic (IAC) medications, visits to physicians, emergency hospitalizations, and costs. For each use measure, we estimated the policy effect as the difference between observed use in the postpolicy period and predicted use obtained from the prepolicy period. Results: In total, over the 2.5-year period after public coverage, tiotropium use increased by 24.4% more than predicted (95% confidence interval [CI] 23.9%-24.8%). Visits to physicians were unchanged, but there were between 596 and 948 more emergency admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and between 582 and 1940 more hospital admissions of any kind than were predicted from prepolicy data. Total cost of inhaled IAC medications increased slightly more than predicted, by between an additional CDN$1.30 million and CDN$1.71 million, but total out-of-pocket spending by patients on IAC medications was reduced by between CDN$2.83 million and CDN$3.11 million because of public coverage. Hospital costs were between CDN$3.88 million and CDN$12.93 million greater than anticipated based on prepolicy data. Conclusions: Public drug plan coverage for tiotropium in British Columbia reduced out-of-pocket costs for patients and their private insurers. Before versus after time series analysis did not show a reduction in hospitalizations or physician visits, or costs associated with those services.","[Dormuth, Colin R.; Morrow, Richard L.; Carney, Greg] Univ British Columbia, Dept Anesthesiol Pharmacol & Therapeut, Victoria, BC V8W 1Y2, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Dormuth, CR (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Anesthesiol Pharmacol & Therapeut, 1110 Govt St,Suite 210, Victoria, BC V8W 1Y2, Canada.",colin.dormuth@ti.ubc.ca,"Carney, Greg/T-5180-2019","Morrow, Richard/0000-0002-5869-5197; Dormuth, Colin/0000-0001-8577-8783",British Columbia Ministry of Health Services; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,British Columbia Ministry of Health Services; Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),The study was funded by a contribution from the British Columbia Ministry of Health Services.

Methods: Seven descriptive health states incorporating the physical and emotional aspects of medical treatment, recovery, and prognosis were developed. Forty-five female volunteers valuated each health state using the visual analogue score (VAS) and time trade off (TTO) methods. Treatment options were ranked by mean and median TTO scores. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine the statistical significance of ranking preferences. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare central tendencies related to age, race, parity, and subject history of abnormal cervical cytology. Results: VAS and TTO scores were highly correlated. Volunteers ranked minimally invasive radical hysterectomy with low-risk features as most preferred (mean TTO = 0.96; median TTO = 1.00) and aborted radical hysterectomy followed by chemoradiation as least preferred (mean TTO = 0.69; median TTO = 0.83). Health states that included radical surgery were ranked higher than those that included chemoradiation, either in the adjuvant or primary setting. When survival was comparable, volunteers rated radical hysterectomy with high-risk pathology followed by adjuvant chemoradiation (mean TTO = 0.78; median TTO = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.69-0.87) similarly to chemoradiation alone (mean TTO = 0.76; median TTO 0.90; 95% CI: 0.66-0.86; p = NS). Utility scores for the majority of health states were not significantly associated with age, race, parity, or subject history of abnormal cervical cytology. Conclusion: Subjects consistently preferred surgical excision to treat early-stage, high-risk cervical cancer and chose a minimally invasive approach. Such utility scores can be used to incorporate quality-of-life effects into comparative-effectiveness models for cervical cancer.","[Jewell, Elizabeth L.; Smrtka, Michael; Valea, Fidel; Davis, Debra M.; Nolte, Kimberly C.; Valea, Renea; Myers, Evan R.; Havrilesky, Laura J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Jewell, Elizabeth L.; Valea, Fidel; Davis, Debra M.; Nolte, Kimberly C.; Valea, Renea; Havrilesky, Laura J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Div Gynecol Oncol, Durham, NC USA; [Jewell, Elizabeth L.; Valea, Fidel; Myers, Evan R.; Havrilesky, Laura J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Duke Comprehens Canc Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Broadwater, Gloria] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Cancer Ctr Biostat, Durham, NC USA; [Myers, Evan R.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Div Clin & Epidemiol Res, Durham, NC USA; [Myers, Evan R.; Samsa, Gregory] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Duke Ctr Clin Hlth Policy Res, Durham, NC USA",Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Duke University,"Jewell, EL (通讯作者)，Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, Gynecol Serv, New York, NY 10065 USA.",jewelle@mskcc.org,"Valea, Fidel/HTP-6661-2023",,Charles Hammond Research Fund,Charles Hammond Research Fund,Financial support for this study was provided entirely by a grant from the Charles Hammond Research Fund.,,35,26,28,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2011,14.0,4.0,,,,,582,586,,10.1016/j.jval.2010.11.017,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BC,21669383.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299080800024,0

This paper examines the effects of ASC competition on revenues, costs, and profit margins of hospitals that also provided these services as a subset of their general services in Arizona, California, and Texas during the period 1997-2004. We identified all ASCs operating during the period in the 49 Dartmouth Hospital Referral Regions in the three states. The results of fixed effects models suggested that ASCs are meaningful competitors to general hospitals. We found downward pressure on revenues, costs, and profits in general hospitals associated with ASC presence.

We note that there is heterogeneity in behaviour between individuals and within individuals. By 'heterogeneity between individuals' we mean that people are different, in terms of both their preference functionals and their parameters for these functionals. By 'heterogeneity within individuals' we mean that the behaviour may be different even by the same individual for the same choice problem. We propose methods of taking into account all forms of heterogeneity, concentrating particularly on using a Mixture Model to capture the heterogeneity of preference functionals.

We define the notion of rationalizability in mixed-strategies to capture such a situation. Our approach allows to derive different contest success functions depending on the aims and attitudes of the decider. We derive contest success functions which are closely related to commonly used functions providing new support for them. By taking into account social welfare considerations our approach bridges the contest literature and the recent literature on political economy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical applications typically rely on some process of discretization so that the system may be estimated with discrete data. This paper introduces a framework for discretizing linear multivariate continuous time systems that includes the commonly used Euler and trapezoidal approximations as special cases and leads to a general class of estimators for the mean reversion matrix. Asymptotic distributions and bias formulae are obtained for estimates of the mean reversion parameter. Explicit expressions are given for the discretization bias and its relationship to estimation bias in both multivariate and in univariate settings. in the univariate context, we compare the performance of the two approximation methods relative to exact maximum likelihood (ML) in terms of bias and variance for the Vasicek process. The bias and the variance of the Euler method are found to be smaller than the trapezoidal method, which are in turn smaller than those of exact ML. Simulations suggest that when the mean reversion is slow, the approximation methods work better than ML, the bias formulae are accurate, and for scalar models the estimates obtained from the two approximate methods have smaller bias and variance than exact ML For the square root process, the Euler method outperforms the Nowman method in terms of both bias and variance. Simulation evidence indicates that the Euler method has smaller bias and variance than exact ML, Nowman's method and the Milstein method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A variance decomposition indicates that characteristics at the level of the chains (as opposed to individual stores) explain a large fraction of the total variation in price dynamics. Thus, retailer characteristics are found to be crucial determinants of heterogeneity in pricing dynamics, in addition to product characteristics. We empirically explore how the price dynamics we document affect price index measures. Keywords: (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

My identification strategy uses variation in pre-FMLA maternity leave policies across states and variation in which firms are covered by FMLA provisions. Using Vital Statistics data and difference-in-difference-in-difference methodology, I find that maternity leave led to small increases in birth weight, decreases in the likelihood of a premature birth, and substantial decreases in infant mortality for children of college-educated and married mothers, who were most able to take advantage of unpaid leave. My results are robust to the inclusion of numerous controls for maternal, child, and county characteristics, state, year, and month fixed effects, and state-year interactions, as well as across several different specifications.

[Baltagi, B.H., Bresson, G., Pirotte, A., 2006. Joint LM test for homoskedasticity in a one-way error component model. Journal of Econometrics 134, 401-417]. Our tests have two additional robustness properties. First, standard tests for heteroskedasticity in the individual component are shown to be negatively affected by heteroskedasticity in the remainder component. We derive modified tests that are insensitive to heteroskedasticity in the component not being checked, and hence help identify the source of heteroskedasticity. Second, Gaussian-based LM tests are shown to reject too often in the presence of heavy-tailed (e.g. t-Student) distributions. By using a conditional moment framework, we derive distribution-free tests that are robust to non-normalities. Our tests are computationally convenient since they are based on simple artificial regressions after pooled OLS estimation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To capture the dynamic aspect of trade in such markets, we study a dynamic recontracting process similar to the one introduced by Serrano and Volij (2008). First, we analyze the set of recurrent classes of this process as a (non-empty) solution concept. We show that each core allocation always constitutes a singleton recurrent class and provide examples of non-singleton recurrent classes consisting of blocking-cycles of individually rational allocations. For multiple-type housing markets stochastic stability never serves as a selection device among recurrent classes. Next, we propose a method to compute the limit invariant distribution of the dynamic recontracting process. Furthermore, we discuss how the limit invariant distribution is influenced by the relative coalitional stability and accessibility of the different stochastically stable allocations. We illustrate our findings with several examples. In particular, we demonstrate that some core allocations are less likely to be final allocations of the dynamic process than cycles composed of non-core allocations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Models of statistical discrimination show that benevolent doctors treat expert patients better, since experts are better at communicating with the doctor. Agency theory suggests that doctors have an incentive to limit hospital costs by distorting information to non-expert patients, but not to expert patients. The hypotheses were tested on a large set of data, which contained information about the highest education of the parents, and detailed medical information about all births in Norway during the period 1967-2005 (Medical Birth Registry). The empirical analyses show that expert parents have a higher rate of Caesarean section than non-expert parents. The educational disparities were considerable 40 years ago, but have become markedly less over time. The analyses provide support for statistical discrimination theory, though agency theory cannot be totally excluded. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental works were done in the area of Salatin in Western Tatras region in these variations: control, also in variations with nitrogen load simulation and in variation with higher input of phosphorus. The availability and movement of mineral nitrogen was monitored in situ method using ion exchangers. Nitrogen was taken by ion exchangers applied in probes without added nitrogen and in probes with added nitrogen in the form of cellulose. By this method we could presume indirectly the disposition and intensity of microbial processes connected with mineralization and immobilization of nitrogenous substances depending on the availability of added nitrogen. Higher offer of nitrogenous substances lead to decrease in mineral nitrogen in soil, more in the ammonium form. Higher plant production and with it related higher offer of organic carbon in soil could then inhibit effectively the movement of nitrogen through the soil. From above mentioned we can deduce that present primary plant production does not allow life constituent of ecosystem absorb higher amount of nitrogen coming from the atmosphere.

The consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator are provided in the presence of both finite and infinite activity (finite variation) jumps. Our results rely on kernel estimation, using the properties of the local time of the data generating process, and the fact that it is possible to disentangle the discontinuous part of the state variable through those squared increments between observations not exceeding a suitable threshold function. We also reconstruct the drift and the jump intensity coefficients when they are level-dependent and jumps have finite activity, through consistent and asymptotically normal estimators. Simulated experiments show that the newly proposed estimators perform better in finite samples than alternative estimators, and this allows us to reexamine the estimation of a univariate model for the short term interest rate, for which we find fewer jumps and more variance due to the diffusion part than previous studies.

Model estimates provide convincing evidence that wage bargaining process is determined mainly by the power of the unions and that the institutional changes of the Czech labour market in the last fifteen years had only little real impact on the matching effectiveness.,"[Nemec, Daniel] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,nemecd@econ.muni.cz,"Němec, Daniel/H-2909-2013","Němec, Daniel/0000-0003-3065-8287",,,,,6,5,5,0,1,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,504,510,,,,,,7,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600083,0

Stem sap-flow measured on 8 poplar trees by Granier heat dissipation method was put in relation with biomass increments measured both with automated dendrometers so with manual measurements with caliper gauge. Transpiration totals ranged between 28.3-175.6 liters per tree in executed period 3.8.-31.8.2011. Above-ground biomass increments in this period varied between 30.07-519.28 g per tree and mean value of water use efficiency of all monitored trees reached 2.76 g.kg(-1). Mean diurnal sap-flow total of all sampled trees was 3.25 liters. Results show that it is possible to establish relationship between transpiration totals and biomass increments (coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.90) and also relationship between transpiration totals and stem diameter (R-2 = 0.81). These results (especially after obtaining experimental data from spring growth conditions) can be further used for calculations of biomass increments and transpiration as scaling factors from tree level to whole stand level.,"[Orsag, M.; Trnka, M.] Mendel Univ Brno, Inst Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Orság, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Inst Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",orsag.matej@gmail.com,"Trnka, Miroslav/F-9428-2014; Fischer, Milan/H-3996-2014; Orsag, Matej/G-9765-2014","Trnka, Miroslav/0000-0003-4727-8379; Orsag, Matej/0000-0003-4289-5933",,,,,10,2,2,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,688,693,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400084,0

The analyzed materials were milled grape seeds, stalks and leaves of two vine cultivars - Veltl Veltlinske zelene and Zweigeltrebe. In sample pretreatment, solid-phase extraction (SPE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and/or liquid-liquid extraction (L-L) in dependence on the sample nature were used. The goal of this work was to compare the inherency and content of selected polyphenolic compounds in different plant samples of white and red vine cultivars. Comparison of individual analysis indicated that the highest content of the polyphenolic compounds was in grape seeds and the lowest in leaves. In case of milled grape seeds, coarser milling resulted in higher amount of identified analytes while in analysis of fine grinding seeds we observed lower analyte representation. These observations could relate with SPE column efficiency and unsuffient matrix removing. Also, higher amount of polyphenols was found in Zweigeltrebe samples, it means in the red vine cultivar than in white Veltlinske zelene cultivar. This fact was observed in both stalks and leaves samples. Finally, it was found that the amount of studied polyphenols in stalks and leaves also increased in relation with grape maturing.","[Roblova, V; Bittova, M.; Kuban, V] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Roblova, V (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Kotlarska 5, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic.",roblovavendula@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,1051,1059,,,,,,9,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400129,0

Analyze the economic cycles means to deal with the identification of individual phases of the economy and to detect factors that cause them. One of them is the output gap which is the main indicator of inflationary pressures in the economy. Determination of the output gap is important from a macroeconomic perspective, particularly for the creation of fiscal and monetary policies. The output gap is defined as the difference between the actual and potential output. Since potential output value is immeasurable as the output gap, we can say that its quantification is based on several assumptions that can have an economic or statistical aspect. In literature we can meet with a number of methods that enable its detection. This paper discusses the possible ways to estimate the output gap, showing their shortcomings.

Therefore, the VaR is estimated at 99.5% confidence level over one year risk horizon. We evaluate both risk measures analytically under assumption of traditional distributions, i.e. exponential, gamma and Weibull's, and also using Extreme Value Theory to respect the fat tail of empirical distribution. We give the evidence that the both risk measures are highly underestimated when the traditional distributions are assumed. First and foremost, we describe VaR and CVaR and then we focus on Extreme Value Theory. Subsequently, we estimate both risk measures under all mentioned probability distribution conditions.

It is difficult to say, however, whether this relationship is truly causal. Both health status and portfolio choice are influenced by unobserved characteristics such as risk attitudes, impatience, information, and motivation, and these unobserved factors, if not adequately controlled for, can induce significant bias in the estimates of asset demand equations. Using the 1992-2006 waves of the Health and Retirement Study, we investigate how much of the connection between health and portfolio choice is causal and how much is due to the effects of unobserved heterogeneity. Accounting for unobserved heterogeneity with fixed effects and correlated random effects models, we find that health does not appear to significantly affect portfolio choice among single households. For married households, we find a small effect (about 2-3 percentage points) from being in the lowest of five self-reported health categories.

We suggest various kernel-based estimation procedures for the parametric and nonparametric components, and derive the asymptotic properties thereof. For the parametric part of the model, we obtain the semiparametric efficiency bound. Our method is applied to a bivariate stock index series. We find that the univariate model of Engle and Rangel (2008) appears to be violated in the data whereas our multivariate model is more consistent with the data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

An individual is myopic if, at each date, he plans consumption only for that date and few periods that immediately follow; that is, his planning horizon, n, is finite. Equilibria with myopia can display real indeterminacy and allow for monetary as well as non-monetary steady states; thus, they share some of the features of equilibria in economies of overlapping generation. The equilibrium price dynamics (but not the consumption dynamics) of an exchange economy with extreme myopia, n =1, are identical to the dynamics of an overlapping generation economy with two-period lives.

The penalty serves to shrink a vector of individual specific effects toward a common value. The degree of this shrinkage is controlled by a tuning parameter X. It is shown that the class of estimators is asymptotically unbiased and Gaussian, when the individual effects are drawn from a class of zero-median distribution functions. The tuning parameter, X. can thus be selected to minimize estimated asymptotic variance. Monte Carlo evidence reveals that the estimator can significantly reduce the variability of the fixed-effect version of the estimator without introducing bias. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This article addresses three equity-efficiency trade-off methods proposed in the literature. Moreover, it demonstrates their impact on cost-effectiveness analyses in current breast cancer control options for women of different age groups. Methods: We adapted an existing breast cancer model to estimate cost-effectiveness and equity effects of breast cancer interventions. We applied three methods to quantify the equity-efficiency trade-offs: 1) targeting specific groups, comparing disparities at baseline and in different intervention scenarios; 2) equity weighting, valuing low and high health gains differently; and 3) multicriteria decision analysis, weighing multiple equity and efficiency criteria. We compared the resulting composite league tables of all approaches. Results: The approaches show that a comprehensive breast cancer program, including screening, for women below 75 years of age was most attractive in both the group targeting approach and the equity weighting approach. Such control programs would reduce disparities with 56% and at 1908 per equity quality-adjusted life-year gained. In the multicriteria approach, a comprehensive treatment program for women below 75 years of age and treatment in stage III breast cancer were most attractive, with both an 82% selection probability, followed by screening programs for the two age groups. Conclusion: In the three equity weighing approaches, targeting women below 75 years of age was more cost-effective and led to more equitable distributions of health. This likely is similar in other fatal diseases with similar age distributions. The approaches may lead to different outcomes in nonfatal disease.","[Baeten, Stefan A.; Uyl-de Groot, Carin A.; Niessen, Louis W.] Erasmus MC, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Baeten, Stefan A.; Uyl-de Groot, Carin A.; Niessen, Louis W.] Erasmus MC, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Baltussen, Rob M.

It distinguishes risk types with high and low profit potential and estimates long-run profits associated with risk selection in four scenarios (no risk adjustment, demographic only, including prior hospitalization, and including prior hospitalization and Pharmaceutical Cost Groups). The database covers 180,000 Swiss individuals over 8 years, 3 of which are used for model building and 5, to estimate insurers' profits due to risk selection in the four scenarios. While these profits prove to be very high without risk adjustment and still substantial with demographic risk adjustment, they become surprisingly low when the crude morbidity indicator 'prior hospitalization' is included in the formula. These results clearly indicate the need for health status-related risk adjustment in insurance markets with community rating, taking into account insurers' planning horizon. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Second, this is the first paper in the literature to control for sibling-fixed effects in examining the relationship between adolescent depressive symptoms and human capital accumulation. Importantly, this eliminates omitted factors such as family and neighborhood characteristics common to siblings that affect both depressive symptoms and educational attainments (e.g. neighborhood crime. and family resources). Third, this paper examines the effects of both an indicator and scale of depressive symptoms and finds important associations with these depressive symptoms and human capital accumulation. Though the results cannot be given a causal interpretation, the findings show a negative relationship between depressive symptoms and years of schooling. The relationship appears to be driven primarily through increasing the chances of dropping out but may have small impacts on the likelihood of college attendance (conditional on high school graduation). In particular, preferred estimates suggest that a standard deviation increase in depressive symptoms is associated with a 25-30% increase in the likelihood of dropping out.

Most of the existing works on asymptotic distributions of a nonparametric/semiparametric estimator or a test statistic are based on some deterministic smoothing parameters, while in practice it is important to use data-driven methods to select the smoothing parameters. In this paper we give a simple sufficient condition that can be used to establish the first order asymptotic equivalence of a nonparametric estimator or a test statistic with stochastic smoothing parameters to those using deterministic smoothing parameters. We also allow for general weakly dependent data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One aim of this study is to determine its intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. Nosocomial infection also increases the duration of hospital stay. We quantify, in relative terms, the increased duration of the hospital stay when a patient has the infection. Methods: We propose the use of logistic regression models with an asymmetric link to estimate the probability of a patient suffering a nosocomial infection. We use Poisson-Gamma regression models as a multivariate technique to detect the factors that really influence the average hospital stay of infected and noninfected patients. For both models, frequentist and Bayesian estimations were carried out and compared. Results: The models are applied to data from 1039 patients operated on in a Spanish hospital. Length of stay, the existance of a preoperative stay and obesity were found the main risk factors for a nosomial infection. The existence of a nosocomial infection multiplies the length of stay in the hospital by a factor of 2.87. Conclusion: The results show that the asymmetric logic improves the predictive capacity of conventional logistic regressions","[Negrin Hernandez, Miguel Angel] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Management, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Jose Saez-Castillo, Antonio; Jose Olmo-Jimenez, Maria] Univ Jaen, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Jaen, Spain; [Perez Sanchez, Jose Maria] Univ Granada, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Arcos-Navarro, Angel; Diaz-Oller, Juan] San Agustin Hosp, Dept Gen & Digest Surg, Linares, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad de Jaen; University of Granada,"Hernández, MAN (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Management, Campus Tafira, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",mnegrin@dmc.ulpgc.es,"Sáez-Castillo, Antonio José/B-5948-2015; Martínez-Sánchez, Jose M/ABH-3093-2020; Hernández, MIguel Ángel Villacorta/AAB-8810-2019; HERNANDEZ, MIGUEL/HKD-9144-2023; Negrin, Miguel Angel/K-8293-2017; , Olmo-Jimenez, M.J./E-1282-2015","Sáez-Castillo, Antonio José/0000-0001-9795-9610; Martínez-Sánchez, Jose M/0000-0002-9632-5701; Negrin, Miguel Angel/0000-0002-7074-6268; Perez Sanchez, Jose Maria/0000-0002-7491-4345; , Olmo-Jimenez, M.J./0000-0003-3527-3239","Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia (MEC), Spain [SEJ2006-12685]","Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia (MEC), Spain(Spanish Government)","This research has been partially support by the grant SEJ2006-12685 (Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia (MEC), Spain).",,31,25,27,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN-JUL,2010,13.0,4.0,,,,,431,439,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00680.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,625DD,20070640.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279872300015,0

We suggest that this view of distributive fairness has a counterpart in personal valuations of gains in health. Such valuations may be influenced by psychological reference points and diminishing marginal utility such that the individual utility of care in patient groups with different potentials may be more similar than what conventional QALY estimates suggest. In interviews in three convenience samples, there is some support for the hypothesis. Most respondents do not think that desire for treatment is significantly less in those who stand to gain only moderately compared with those who stand to gain much even when the treatment is associated with a mortality risk. When stating insurance preferences, a majority of subjects express a greater concern for avoiding the worst states in question than for maximising expected value for money in terms of treatment effects. The tendency applies to outcomes in terms of both quality and quantity of life. Choices between prefixed response options fit well with oral explanations of these choices.

We study this link using three measures of temporal dependence: rho-mixing, beta-mixing and alpha-mixing. Stationary diffusions that are rho-mixing have mixing coefficients that decay exponentially to zero. When they fail to be rho-mixing, they are still beta-mixing and alpha-mixing; but coefficient decay is slower than exponential. For such processes we find transformations of the Markov states that have finite variances but infinite spectral densities at frequency zero. The resulting spectral densities behave like those of stochastic processes with long memory. Finally we show how state dependent, Poisson sampling alters the temporal dependence.

Testing that is driven by a desire to prevent the spread of the disease often has an indirect effect on others. These external effects need to be identified, quantified and included as part of the benefits and costs of testing. Pioneering analyses of HIV testing by Philipson and Posner have introduced the, economic calculus Of individual expected benefits and costs of activities into an understanding of the HIV epidemic. What is required for social evaluations is an extension of the analysis to ensure that external effects are included. Objectives: The objective of this paper is two-fold. First we seek to formulate cost-benefit criteria that incorporate fully the external effects in the evaluation of Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT). We achieve this by recasting the individual calculus of benefits and costs to a Couple setting. We can then compare an individual's cost-benefit analysis of being tested with social criteria that look at outcomes from a couple's perspective for both separate and dual/joint testing. Second we aim to apply our social criteria to VCT programs as they currently operate in Tanzania and how these programs might operate in the future when they are scaled up to relate to the general population. Methodology: We develop social criteria for evaluating separate and dual VCT using a couple's perspective with and without altruism. Therefore, the welfare function is based on two individual expected utility functions viewed as a couple, either married or regular partners. The benefits are the averted lives lost whenever discordant couples are revealed. The costs of VCT are the benefits of unprotected sex that the couple foregoes and the costs of the testing and counseling. The cost-benefit criteria are applied to VCT programs in Tanzania. The four main ingredients estimated are: the foregone benefit of unprotected sex (measured by the compensated wage differentials charged by commercial sex workers); the probability of infection; the cost of an infection (measured by both the value of a statistical life and the human capital approaches) and the cost of a single test (which includes behavior-modifying counseling). Conclusions: We find separate testing in existing VCT programs to be only marginally worthwhile. However, in scaled-up programs the benefit-cost ratio is over three. Dual testing is always more beneficial than separate testing. However, this advantage is reduced in scaled-up programs. VCT should be greatly expanded throughout Tanzania as future returns would be even higher for both separate and joint counseling and HIV testing.

It liberates free zeatin from its transport and/or storage form zeatin-O-glucoside. Using an adapted site specific non-saturated random mutagenesis approach, it were prepared five multi-site mutants surrounding the active site (W373K/M376L, W373K/P372S/M376L, W373K/P372T/M376L, W373K/P372S and W373K/P372T) derived from the single mutant W373K to study the effect(s) of amino-acid changes on substrate specificity towards natural (trans-zeatin-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and cis-zeatin-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) and artificial (4-nitorophenyl-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 4-methylumbellyferyl O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) substrates. Kinetic and substrate specificity studies confirmed large differences among set of mutated enzymes. All enzymes surprisingly preferred cis-zeatin-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside over trans-zeatin-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, whereas differences in hydrolytic efficiencies are considerable. Quantitative TLC confirmed the best cZOG/tZOG hydrolysis ratio toward cis-zeatin-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside in the triple mutant W373K/P372T/M376L. Moreover, it was also confirmed that only wild-type hydrolyzed trans-zeatin-N9-beta-D-glucopyranoside. No known plant beta-glucosidase hydrolyzes this substrate. Hydrolysis of trans-zeatin-N7-beta-D-glucopyranoside was not observed at all.","[Filipi, T.; Mazura, P.; Kiran, N.

Not only do they provide an evocative link to the beliefs of our ancestors, but also they are iconic to Britain and have major economic and tourism value. However, despite their past immutability, ASMs are under increasing pressure from human-agro-industrial activity and changing climatic conditions, and are growing in disrepair at accelerating rates. Although some scientific information on stone resilience exists, most does not readily apply to ASMs because of bias towards built environments; therefore, critical gaps exist in our understanding of what regulates their deterioration in rural landscapes. As such, an urgent need exists to understand better the decay of ASMs and to develop proactive safeguarding strategies. This paper will evaluate the current information relating to the decay of ancient stone monuments in rural settings and place this in the context of climate change. The paper will conclude with a recommendation regarding the development of a Condition Assessment and Risk Evaluation (CARE) scheme to formalise condition assessments, prioritise management interventions, and predict the resilience of ASMs.","[Giesen, M.

Furthermore, it is part of popular culture: for example, the nursery story 'The Three Little Pigs' asserts the superiority of brick to other materials, as well as the wisdom of choosing to build with brick. But largely as a result of its ubiquity, brick has been taken for granted. Even the brick industry in Australia has largely ignored the craft of brick making and bricklaying, as well as the design possibilities of this very versatile material. If this situation continues, then traditional knowledge and skills of brick construction could eventually be lost. Over the last few years the presenter has been exploring these aspects of brick, and working closely with architects, architecture students, artists, brick makers, bricklayers, and apprentice bricklayers, in order to preserve, encourage and develop brick construction in Australia.

It looks at aspects, apart from productive ones, like quality of life of the population, local economic development, and biodiversity. The concept first appeared at the Rio Conference in 1992 with a first attempt to define SFM principles. Then, forest certification systems led the application of SFM (forest certification is the voluntary process to label forest products coming from SFM). But SFM should be implemented in every management unit, promoted by governments through forest legislation and instruments. The objective of this research is to check the current promotion of SFM from governments. The revision of laws and instruments is made in Spain. It is also intended to define ways so that current forest management becomes more sustainable.","[Jakesova, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Valls, P.; Valles, M.; Galiana, F.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Rural & Agrifood Engn, E-46022 Valencia, Spain",Mendel University in Brno; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Jakesová, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",lenka.jakesova@uake.cz; pabvaldo@upvnet.upv.es; convalpl@agf.upv.es; fgaliana@agf.upv.es,"Galiana, Francisco/N-6530-2016",,Polytechnic University of Valencia,Polytechnic University of Valencia,This research project was generously supported by Polytechnic University of Valencia.

Experiment was under integrated (IS) and ecological (ES) farming system. In both farming systems were two variants: fertilized and non fertilized. Crop rotation was within six-field. We used subsequent crops in the experiment: winter wheat, spring barley, lucerne, pea, silage corn and faba bean. Fertilization was performed on the basis of soil and plant analyses using balance method. In both farming systems was applied farm yard manure (40 t. ha(-1)). In integrated system were applied except organic manorial also industrial fertilizers: LAV 27, superphosphate and potassium salt. Inputs of nutrient included nutrients from seed, organic and industrial fertilizers, by nitrogen symbiotic fixation, asymbiotic fixation and precipitation. Outputs of nutrients were represented by off-take by crop yield, off-take by by-product. Other outputs of nitrogen were also calculated with leaching, volatilization and denitrification. Then balance was calculated as difference of total inputs and outputs. Percentage nutrient substitution was calculated as total intputs divided total outputs and multiple handrid. In integrated farming system the percentage of nitrogen substitution on non fertilized variant and on fertilized variant was 60.31% and 98.22% respectively. Percentage of nitrogen substitution on ecological farming system reached on the level of 68.05% on non fertilized variant and 84.40% on fertilized variant. Percentage of magnesium substitution amounted on I/0, I/OR, E/0, E/OR was 2.54%; 34.54%; 1.98%; 30.94% respectively.","[Kajanovicova, L.; Lozek, O.] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Agrochem & Plant Nutr, Fac Agrobiol & Food Resources, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Kajanovicová, L (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Agrochem & Plant Nutr, Fac Agrobiol & Food Resources, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",ivana.kajanovicova@zoznam.sk; Otto.Lozek@uniag.sk,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,67,72,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800007,0

The experiment was founded in 2003 in the permanent alluvial meadow in Vatin (49 degrees 30'57N, 15 degrees 58'10E). There were two terms of harvest, early (15th June, 15th September) and late term (30th June, 30th September). Four levels of fertilisation were applied: no fertilisation, 30 kg P/ha + 60kg K/ha, 90 kg N/ha + PK and 180 kg N/ha + PK. Sward composition was analysed immediately before the first harvest by cover estimation method. Dominance (% D) of agro-botanical groups (grasses, legumes and other herbs) as well as D of each species was assessed. The changes in number of species and their dominance were expressed using Klimes' stand composition change index (ZPS). Experimental data from 2004, 2008 and 2009 were analysed to assess both long-term and inter-annual changes. Botanical composition was influenced mainly by fertilisation. The term of harvest was not significant. Under used doses of nitrogen (90 and 180 kg/ha) the portion of grasses was higher than 52% (in average from three years) compared to 45 % in non-fertilised and PK-fertilised variants. In the same time the portion of legumes and other herbs was decreased. Value of ZPS was about 30 % in long term period and 9 - 15% in 2008-2009 period. These values are optimal for stabile meadow stand.","[Raus, J.; Hrabe, F.; Knot, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Raus, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",jraus@seznam.cz,"Knot, Pavel/L-6197-2018",,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,122,130,,,,,,9,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800014,0

It is mostly important in companies, where the waste paper is entering the process of creating paper packaging material, like corrugated and solid cardboard, where the proportional share of the waste mass is at the present time unsubstitutable. During the recyclation of the waste mass, for the future use in paper production is paper sludge generated, this sludge is generic term for the residue that results from pulp and papermaking. To better understand its properties, it is necessary to review how it is formed. Generally, it is the solid residue recovered from the wastewater stream of the pulping and papermaking process, but the composition of this paper sludge can be different in the relation to the source of the waste material. On the average 35% of the content mass entering the paper production ends like waste, which includes the wastewater sludge, woodyard waste, mill trash, such as shipping material demolition debris and causticizing wastes. Additionally, the increase of the recycling in the last decades and the paper mass production, has also increased the amount of material that needs to be disposed of. Currently the residue is commonly sent to landfills. Recently concern has risen over the amount and quality of future landfill space. Landfills are becoming difficult to site and costly to construct and operate because of more stringent regulations, diminishing land availability, and public opposition, which is manifested in the environmental impact assesment. The widely used solution is in the last years the burning, which shifts some of the residue back to the air discharge stream with its resulting costs and problems. Some alternatives are more environmentally friendly.","[Sklenar, M.; Kotovicova, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Fac Agron, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Sklenár, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Fac Agron, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",milan.sklenar@post.cz; kotovicj@mendelu.cz,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,9,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,621,624,,,,,,4,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800076,0

Moreover, provider responses were larger on those indicators for which more stringent standards were set and greater rewards offered. We conclude that the incentives induced providers to improve targeted quality and make investments ill quality that extended beyond the scheme.

Country-specific data included population mortality, fracture costs, and annual drug costs, using a German social insurance perspective. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. A differential hip fracture relative risk reduction of 43% was applied to risedronate vs. alendronate. Results: The model predicted that treatment with risedronate would result in fewer hip fractures and more QALYs at a reduced cost (savings of (sic)278 per treated woman) compared to treatment with generic alendronate. Sensitivity analysis assuming 2 years of treatment and equivalence of effect after 1 year show cost savings as well ((sic)106 per treated woman). Discussion: Whereas previous economic evaluations involving bisphosphonates have mainly relied on efficacy data from noncomparative clinical trials, this study's strength is in the use of comparative effectiveness data from one data source. The magnitude of the cost savings observed were sensitive to alternative assumptions regarding treatment duration, therapy discontinuation and cost of generic alendronate. Conclusions: Based on real world data the analysis supports the first line use of risedronate for the treatment of osteoporotic women in Germany.","[Thompson, Melissa; Grima, Daniel] Cornerstone Res Grp Inc, Burlington, ON L7L 5Y6, Canada; [Pasquale, Margaret] Procter & Gamble Pharmaceut, Mason, OH USA; [Moehrke, Werner] Procter & Gamble Pharmaceut Germany GmbH, Weiterstadt, Germany; [Kruse, Hans Peter] Osteoporosezentrum Hamburg Neuer Wall, Hamburg, Germany",Cornerstone Research Group; Procter & Gamble; Procter & Gamble,"Thompson, M (通讯作者)，Cornerstone Res Grp Inc, 6-4380 S Serv Rd, Burlington, ON L7L 5Y6, Canada.",mthompson@cornerstone-research.com,,,"Alliance for Better Bone Health (P&G Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sanofi-Aventis)","Alliance for Better Bone Health (P&G Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sanofi-Aventis)","Funding for this study was provided by the Alliance for Better Bone Health (P&G Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sanofi-Aventis).

We compared native samples (N) with samples to which a commercial egg yolk medium and medias with different BSA concentrations were added. The analysis was carried out during three time periods (time 0, time 1 hour and time 24 hours) using Sperm Vision CASA system. Our experimental study shows an obvious time-dependent decrease of the spermatozoa motility in all experimental groups cultured for 24 hours. The highest inhibition of spermatozoa motility was detected in the native group (28.86 +/- 9.087%), followed by groups B (42.89 +/- 13.17%) and A (52.28 +/- 16.12%) containing a.o. 10% BSA. The highest motility value was found in group D (20% BSA and 5% glucose; 66.46 +/- 9.986%) and group R (egg yolk medium; 62.81 +/- 8.044%).

Study was carried during the period from 1st July 2007 to 31st July 2007. The observed cows were of Holstein breed. There were housed research 45 of dairy cows, in the research pen - they were on different lactation phase (30th days and more) and different number of lactation (from 1st to 8th). Temperature was measured in the course of month - constantly in 15 minutes intervals. There were six data loggers HOBO used, which were placed in living space of animals. One data logger was placed outside the barn, for measuring of outside air temperature. Milk yield was monitored daily (two times - in the morning and in the evening). Average values for daily milk yield were calculated every day from all cows. For statistical analysis of the acquired data, it was used programme UNISTAT version 5.1. We found a negative correlation between air temperatures in the barn (maximum, minimum and average) and daily milk yield. The highest correlation was found in minimal air temperature (r = -0.4424), lower in average air temperature (r = -0.3907), and the lowest in maximal air temperature (r = -0.3251). By contrast, height of difference between maximal and minimal air temperature had very low influence on daily milk yield (r = 0.0479). This result suggests that the negative influence of air temperature on milk production is bigger in the days with high valuation of minimal air temperatures, rather than in days when the maximal values of the air temperature are on the highest level.","[Zejdova, P.; Walterova, L.; Falta, D.; Chladek, G.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Zejdová, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",PetraZejdova@seznam.cz,"Falta, Daniel/J-5001-2018; Falta, Daniel/AAT-9509-2020; Chládek, Gustav/K-3994-2018","Falta, Daniel/0000-0002-7679-923X; Falta, Daniel/0000-0002-7679-923X; Chládek, Gustav/0000-0002-4223-0934",,,,,9,1,1,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,362,368,,,,,,7,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800049,0

The spatial pillage game introduces a spatial feature into the pillage game. Players are located in regions and can travel from one region to another. The players can form a coalition and combine their power only within their destination regions, which limits the exertion of the power of each coalition. Under this spatial restriction, a coalition can pillage less powerful coalitions with-out any cost. The feasibility of pillages between coalitions determines the dominance relation that defines stable states in which powers among the players are endogenously balanced. With the spatial restriction, the set of stable states changes. However, if the players have forecasting ability, then the set of stable states does not change with the spatial restriction. Core, stable set, and farsighted core are adopted as alternative solution concepts. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Those who satisfied the waiting period, and then left welfare and began working full time within the following year, were entitled to receive payments for up to 36 months whenever they were off welfare and working full time. A simple optimizing model suggests that the program rules created an unusual sequence of incentives: (1) to prolong the initial spell on welfare for at least 12 months to become eligible for the subsidy offer; (2) to lock in subsidy entitlement by finding full time work and leaving welfare in the 12-24 month period after initial entry; and (3) to choose work over welfare during the three years that Subsidies were available. Consistent with these implications, comparisons between the experimental treatment group and a randomly assigned control group show that the program increased welfare participation in the first year after initial entry and lowered it over the following 5 years. We develop an econometric model of welfare participation and program eligibility status that allows us to separately identify the behavioral effects associated with the program rules. We find important responses to all three incentives, and that the program impact persisted after subsidy payments ended, although the effect decayed over time. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A published and validated diabetes computer simulation model (the IMS CORE Diabetes Model) was used to evaluate the long-term clinical and economic outcomes associated with switching to BIAsp 30, using treatment effects from the South Korean subgroup of the Physician's Routine Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of NovoMix (R) 30 Therapy study and cost data collected through primary research. Outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, incidence of complications, direct medical costs, and cost-effectiveness. Analyses were performed from a third-party payer perspective over a 30-year time horizon. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 5% per annum. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Switching patients uncontrolled on HI to BIAsp 30 was projected to increase discounted mean life expectancy by 0.15 +/- 0.18 years per patient (8.62 +/- 0.13 years vs. 8.47 +/- 0.13 years) and improve discounted mean quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.30 +/- 0.12 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient (5.68 +/- 0.09 QALYs vs. 5.38 +/- 0.09 QALYs). Conversion to BIAsp 30 was associated with a mean increase in direct costs of South Korean Won (KRW) 1,777,323 +/- 359,209 over patient lifetimes. BIAsp 30 was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of KRW5,916,758 per QALY gained versus HI. Conclusion: Switching patients uncontrolled on HI to BIAsp 30 was projected to improve life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy. This analysis suggests that BIAsp 30 could be a cost-effective treatment option in type 2 diabetes patients poorly controlled on HI in South Korea.","[White, Jeremy] Novo Nordisk Int Operat AS, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Smith-Palmer, Jayne; Palmer, James L.; Valentine, William J.] IMS Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Lee, Kyoung Hee; Seo, Se Jin] IMS Hlth, Seoul, South Korea",Novo Nordisk,"White, J (通讯作者)，Novo Nordisk Int Operat AS, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",jwht@novonordisk.com,,,Novo Nordisk International Operations A/S,Novo Nordisk International Operations A/S(Novo Nordisk),"Source of financial support: This study was supported by an unrestricted grant from Novo Nordisk International Operations A/S.

Methods: A total of 512 questionnaires were completed on women aged 20 to 55 years with at least one daughter, during March through May 2007. The respondents' WTP for the vaccines was elicited by double-bounded binary-choice questions under two scenarios: one was to protect themselves from cervical cancer (CC) and the other was for their daughter(s). The WTP was modeled as a function of the respondents' knowledge score, attitudes toward CC and HPV vaccine, the vaccination outcome scenarios, and individual characteristics. A log-normal survival model was constructed and the maximum-likelihood method was used for estimation. Results: The median regression-adjusted WTP was estimated at US$1098 to US$1233 (US$913-1004) for vaccinating the daughter (mother); and the VSL was estimated at approximately US$0.65 to US$4.09 (US$0.56-3.16) million for vaccinating the daughter (mother).

Methods: Total direct health-care costs of alcohol drinking were the summation of the costs of alcohol drinking in inpatient and outpatient departments due to chronic diseases and acute conditions using prevalence-based approach. The alcohol-attributable fractions, defined as the proportion of a disease or acute condition in a population attributable to alcohol drinking, were calculated to obtain the number of patients in each disease or acute condition attributable to alcohol drinking. Health-care costs of alcohol drinking were estimated by multiplying the number of patients in each disease category attributable to alcohol drinking with the unit cost of treatment. Results: Total health-care costs attributed to alcohol in this research were 5491 million baht (i.e., outpatient department [2488 million baht] and inpatient department [3003 million baht]). Cost derived from inpatient department accounted for 55% of the total health-care cost attributed to alcohol. Conclusions: The result of this study suggested that alcohol drinking was significantly associated with a large number of health-care costs in Thailand.

It also proposes the probable solutions to overcome these barriers. Results: Potential uses of economic evaluation include the development of public reimbursement lists, price negotiation, the development of clinical practice guidelines, and communicating with prescribers. Two types of barriers to using economic evaluation, namely barriers relating to the production of economic evaluation data and decision context-related barriers, are identified. For the first sort of barrier, the development of the national guidelines, the development of economic evaluation database, planning and use of economic evaluation in a systematic manner, and prioritization of topics for assessment are recommended. Furthermore, educating potential users and the public, making the economic evaluation process transparent and participatory, and incorporating other health preferences into the decision-making framework have been promoted to conquer decision context-related barriers. Conclusions: It seems practically impossible to adopt other countries' approaches using economic evaluation for priority setting because of several constraints specifically related to the context of each setting. Nevertheless, given a better understanding of its resistance, and proper policies and strategies to overcome the barriers applied, it is more than probable that a method with system/mechanisms specifically designed to fit particular settings will be used.","[Yothasamut, Jomkwan] Minist Publ Hlth, HITAP, Dept Hlth, Nonthaburi 11000, Thailand; [Tantivess, Sripen] Minist Publ Hlth, IHPP, Nonthaburi 11000, Thailand",Ministry of Public Health - Thailand; Ministry of Public Health - Thailand,"Yothasamut, J (通讯作者)，Minist Publ Hlth, HITAP, Dept Hlth, 6th Floor,6th Bldg,Tiwanon Rd, Nonthaburi 11000, Thailand.",jomkwan@ihpp.thaigov.net,,"Yothasamut, Jomkwan/0000-0001-6101-1756; Teerawattananon, Yot/0000-0003-2217-2930",Thai Health Promotion Foundation; Health System Research Institute; Bureau of Health Policy and Strategy; Ministry of Public Health; Thai Health-Global Link Initiative Project,Thai Health Promotion Foundation; Health System Research Institute; Bureau of Health Policy and Strategy; Ministry of Public Health; Thai Health-Global Link Initiative Project,"This article was developed as part of work under the Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP).

Background: Although the CHARISMA trial did not find a benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin in its overall study cohort, a benefit was suggested in a prespecified subgroup of patients with established cardiovascular (CV) disease. The cost-effectiveness of dual antiplatelet therapy in this population is unknown. Methods: Medical resource utilization was assessed prospectively, and costs for hospitalizations, physician services, outpatient care, and medications were assigned using 2007 US dollars. Life expectancy was estimated contingent on fatal and nonfatal CV events using statistical models of long-term survival from the Saskatchewan Health database. Results: C + A was associated with a 12.5% relative reduction in CV death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared with A alone (6.9% vs. 7.9%, P = 0.048) over a median 28 months of follow-up. Severe or moderate bleeding events were higher in patients receiving C + A versus A alone (3.6% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.001). Mean cost/patient was $2607 higher for C + A, while projected life expectancy increased by an average of 0.072 years due to fewer in-trial events. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for C + A was $36,343/year of life gained. Findings were insensitive to discount rate, life expectancy projections, post-event costs, and indirect costs from lost productivity; the ICER was most sensitive to the cost of clopidogrel. Bootstrap analysis demonstrated that the ICER for C + A remained <$50,000/life-year gained in 70.6% of bootstrap replicates and <$100,000/life-year gained in 87.4%. Conclusions: Among patients with established CV disease, adding clopidogrel to aspirin appears to increase life expectancy modestly at a cost generally considered acceptable within the US health-care system.","[Cohen, David J.] Univ Missouri, Sch Med, St Lukes Mid Amer Heart Inst, Kansas City, MO 64111 USA; [Chen, Jersey] Yale Univ, Sch Med, New Haven, CT USA; [Bhatt, Deepak L.] Cleveland Clin, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Dunn, Elizabeth Schneider] Harvard Clin Res Inst, Boston, MA USA; [Shi, Chunxue] I3 I3 Statprobe Ingenix, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Caro, J.

Objective: The aim of this study was to finalize the item-scale structure of the instruments and perform psychometric validation in adults with self-reported oily facial skin. Methods: The OSSAS and OSIS were administered to 202 adult subjects with oily facial skin in the United States. A subgroup of 152 subjects returned, 4 to 10 days later, for test-retest reliability evaluation. Results: Of the 202 participants, 72.8% were female; 64.4% had self-reported nonsevere acne. Item reduction resulted in a 14-item OSSAS with Sensation (five items), Tactile (four items) and Visual (four items) domains, a single blotting item, and an overall oiliness item. The OSIS was reduced to two three-item domains assessing Annoyance and Self-Image. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the construct validity of the final item-scale structures. The OSSAS and OSIS scales had acceptable item convergent validity (item-scale correlations > 0.40) and floor and ceiling effects (< 20%). Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.83 to 0.89 for the OSSAS and 0.82 to 0.87 for the OSIS, demonstrating excellent internal consistency. The a priori test-retest reliability criterion (intraclass correlation [ICC] >= 0.7) was met for one of the three OSSAS domains and one of the two OSIS domains. OSSAS and OSIS domains distinguished among groups that differed in patient-reported facial oily skin severity (P < 0.0001), and bother associated with oily skin (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The OSSAS and OSIS versions tested in this study have been found to have strong psychometric properties in this patient sample (adults with self-reported oily facial skin), as assessments of self-reported oily facial skin severity and its emotional impact, respectively.","[Arbuckle, Robert] Mapi Values Ltd, Patient Reported Outcomes, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England; [Clark, Marci; Copley-Merriman, Kati] RTI HS, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Harness, Jane] Pfizer Inc, New London, CT USA; [Draelos, Zoe] Clin Dermatol Ctr, High Point, NC USA; [Rizer, Ronald] Stephens & Associates, Colorado Springs, CO USA; [Yeh, Yating] Mapi Values, Boston, MA USA",Research Triangle Institute; Pfizer,"Arbuckle, R (通讯作者)，Mapi Values Ltd, Patient Reported Outcomes, Adelphi Mill,Grimshaw Lane, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England.",rob.arbuckle@mapivalues.com,,"Copley-Merriman, Catherine/0000-0002-8032-7219",Pfizer,Pfizer(Pfizer),"Source of financial support: This study was supported by Pfizer.

This study aims to test Welte's model with the help of a case study. Methods: In this study, foreign studies were transferred to The Netherlands and then compared with a Dutch reference study. In the case study, the cost-effectiveness of physiotherapy was compared with a multidisciplinary treatment. With the help of a systematic search, several foreign studies could be identified. Based on these foreign studies, two different predictions were produced for The Netherlands. In the all studies prediction, all foreign studies were used. In the Welte's model prediction, only the foreign studies were used, which passed the general and specific knockout criteria. Both predictions were compared with the Dutch reference case. Results: A total of 14 non-Dutch studies were identified. Seven studies did not pass the general knockout criteria and one study did not pass the specific knockout criteria. As a result, 14 studies were included in the all studies prediction and 6 studies in the Welte's model prediction. The predictions yielded different results and the Welte's model prediction proved better on costs than the all studies prediction. Discussion: The application of Welte's model does influence cost and effects estimates when transferring economic data between countries. However, more cases should be subjected to the Welte transferability model before a final conclusion can be drawn.","[Knies, Saskia] Maastricht Univ, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care Innovat CAPHRI, Dept Hlth Org Policy & Econ HOPE, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Severens, Johan L.] Univ Hosp Maastricht, Dept Clin Epidemiol, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Severens, Johan L.] Univ Hosp Maastricht, MTA KEMTA, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC),"Knies, S (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care Innovat CAPHRI, Dept Hlth Org Policy & Econ HOPE, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",s.knies@beoz.unimaas.nl,"Evers, Silvia/ABG-2128-2020","Evers, Silvia/0000-0003-1026-570X",,,,,53,20,23,1,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5.0,,,,,730,738,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00525.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19490559.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267130200014,0

It argues that this research has enhanced Our understanding of the system prior to 2003, in some cases reinforcing conclusions (e.g. the demand-inducement associated with perverse incentives) while in other cases suggesting a slightly less clear storyline (e.g. the link between insurance and out-of-pocket spending). It also concludes that the research to date points to the importance of careful evaluation of the Current reforms, and its potential to modify policies as the rollout proceeds. Finally, it argues that the research on the pre-2003 system suggests that while the recently announced further reforms are a step in the right direction, the hoped-for improvements in China's health system will far more likely Occur if the reforms become less timid in certain key areas, namely provider payments and intergovernmental fiscal relations.

To provide fair and valid assessments, they should be equally relevant to major subsets of respondents. Furthermore, disease-specific measures are assumed to be perceived as more relevant than generic ones. This study assessed these assumptions among people with Parkinson's disease. Cross-sectional data from 202 people with Parkinson's disease (54% men; mean age, 70) were analyzed regarding patient-rated relevance and predictors of patient-rated poor relevance of two generic [the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Nottingham Health Profile (NHP)] and one disease-specific [Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39)] health status questionnaire. There were no differences in relevance ratings across the questionnaires. Poorer overall quality of life [odds ratio (OR), 2.459] and mental health (OR, 1.023) were associated with poorer patient-rated relevance of the SF-36, and higher age was associated with poorer patient-rated relevance of the PDQ-39 (OR, 1.040). No significant predictors were found for the NHP. The PDQ-39 failed to meet the assumption that disease-specific scales are more relevant than generic ones. Nevertheless, the most important implication of this study is an ethical one. Because the relevance of the SF-36 and PDQ-39 is perceived as poorer by those who fare least well and by older people, these scales may not reflect the perspectives of these groups. This challenges bioethical principles and threatens scientific validity. Perceived relevance of patient-centered outcomes needs to be considered, or the voice of vulnerable groups may be silenced, fair inferences prohibited, and opportunities for improved care lost.","[Hagell, Peter; Nyberg, Per] Lund Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Hagell, Peter; Reimer, Jan] Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Skane University Hospital,"Hagell, P (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, POB 157, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Peter.Hagell@med.lu.se,"Hagell, Peter/F-5915-2010; Hagell, Peter/G-9559-2014","Hagell, Peter/0000-0003-2174-372X; Hagell, Peter/0000-0003-2174-372X",Swedish Research Council; Skane County Council Research and Development Foundation; hAlso-och sjukvardsforskning (HSF); Lund University Hospital; Department of Nursing at Lund University,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Skane County Council Research and Development Foundation; hAlso-och sjukvardsforskning (HSF); Lund University Hospital; Department of Nursing at Lund University,"The authors wish to thank all participating patients for their cooperation.; Source of financial support: The study was supported by the Swedish Research Council, the Skane County Council Research and Development Foundation, Radet for hAlso-och sjukvardsforskning (HSF), Lund University Hospital, and the Department of Nursing at Lund University.",,36,20,21,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4.0,,,,,613,617,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00488.x,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,19900259.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266467800030,0

Some results emerging from this theory are directly applicable in the wider context of M-estimation. This includes an extension of work by Wooldridge [Wooldridge,J.M., 1994. Estimation and Inference for Dependent Processes. In: Engle, R.F., McFadden, D.L. (Eds.).

It is shown that the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is consistent without an incidental parameters problem and has a limit theory with a fast rate of convergence N(1/2)T(3/4) (in the stationary case, the rate is N(1/2)T(1/2)) for the regression coefficients and thresholds, and a normal limit distribution. In contrast, the limit distribution is known to be mixed normal in time series modeling, as shown in [Park, J.Y., Phillips, P.C.B., 2000, Nonstationary binary choice.

Calibration involves two challenges: 1) defining a total goodness-of-fit (GOF) score for multiple targets if simultaneous fitting is required, and 2) searching for the optimal parameter set that minimizes the total GOF score (i.e., yields the best fit). To address these two prominent challenges, we have applied an engineering approach to calibrate a microsimulation model, the Lung Cancer Policy Model (LCPM). First, 11 targets derived from clinical and epidemiologic data were combined into a total GOF score by a weighted-sum approach, accounting for the user-defined relative importance of the calibration targets. Second, two automated parameter search algorithms, simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA), were independently applied to a simultaneous search of 28 natural history parameters to minimize the total GOF score. Algorithm performance metrics were defined for speed and model fit. Both search algorithms obtained total GOF scores below 95 within 1000 search iterations. Our results show that SA outperformed GA in locating a lower GOF. After calibrating our LCPM, the predicted natural history of lung cancer was consistent with other mathematical models of lung cancer development. An engineering-based calibration method was able to simultaneously fit LCPM output to multiple calibration targets, with the benefits of fast computational speed and reduced the need for human input and its potential bias.","[Kong, Chung Yin; McMahon, Pamela M.; Gazelle, G.

The current paper studies estimation, inference and financial applications of quantile regression with cointegrated time series. In addition, a new cointegration model with quantile-varying coefficients is proposed. In the proposed model, the value of cointegrating coefficients may be affected by the shocks and thus may vary over the innovation quantile. The proposed model may be viewed as a stochastic cointegration model which includes the conventional cointegration model as a special case. It also provides a useful complement to cointegration models with (G)ARCH effects. Asymptotic properties of the proposed model and limiting distribution of the cointegrating regression quantiles are derived. In the presence of endogenous regressors, fully-modified quantile regression estimators and augmented quantile cointegrating regression are proposed to remove the second order bias and nuisance parameters. Regression Wald tests are constructed based on the fully modified quantile regression estimators. An empirical application to stock index data highlights the potential of the proposed method.

When there is no Condorcet winner, i.e., a candidate preferred to any other candidate by a majority of voters, it is not always easy to decide who is the winner of the election. Different methods, called tournament solutions, have been proposed for defining the winners. They differ in their properties and usually lead to different winners. Among these properties, we consider in this survey the algorithmic complexity of the most usual tournament solutions: some are polynomial, some are NP-hard, while the complexity status of others remains unknown.

We directly compare survey responses of a self-reported measure of health that is commonly used in nationally representative surveys with objective measures of the same health condition. We focus oil hypertension. We find no evidence of an income/health gradient using self-reported hypertension but a sizeable gradient when using objectively measured hypertension. We also find that the probability of false negative reporting is significantly income graded. Our results suggest that using commonly available self-reported chronic health measures might underestimate true income-related inequalities in health. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
