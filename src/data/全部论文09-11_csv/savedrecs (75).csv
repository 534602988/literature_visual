We propose two iterative procedures that jointly estimate the slope parameters and the stochastic trends. The resulting estimators are referred to respectively as CupBC (continuously-updated and bias-corrected) and the CupFM (continuously-updated and fully-modified) estimators. We establish their consistency and derive their limiting distributions. Both are asymptotically unbiased and (mixed) normal and permit inference to be conducted using standard test statistics. The estimators are also valid when there are mixed stationary and non-stationary factors, as well as when the factors are all stationary. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Anthropometric indicators are relatively precise, readily available for most countries, reflect the preferences and concerns of many poor people, consistent. with reckoning the phenomenon directly in the space of functionings, intuitive, easy to use for advocacy, and consistent over time and across subgroups. Anthropometric indicators can therefore complement (but not replace) standard indicators of income/consumption poverty, especially for comparisons across subgroups, within households, across countries, and in the long run. In addition, the paper analyses spells of change in malnutrition over time, finding that the association between economic growth and chronic child malnutrition is very small (but statistically significant) and much lower than the elasticity of growth on poverty. The policy implication of this finding is that direct interventions aimed at reducing infant malnutrition are required.

We see a great variability in the values obtained from different studies. The source of this variability needs to be understood, in order to offer public decision-makers better guidance in choosing a value and to set clearer guidelines for future research on the topic. This article presents a meta-analysis based on 39 observations obtained from 37 studies (from nine different countries) which all use a hedonic wage method to calculate the VSL. Our meta-analysis is innovative in that it is the first to use the mixed effects regression model [Raudenbush, S.W., 1994, Random effects models. In: Cooper, H., Hedges, L.V. (Eds.).

To avoid misleading conclusions in multi-center economic evaluations the center effect needs to be taken into adequate consideration. The aim of this article is to compare several models, which make use of a different amount of information about the enrolling center. To model the association of total medical costs with the levels of two sets of covariates, one at patient and one at center level, we considered four statistical models, based on the Gamma model in the class of the Generalized Linear Models with a log link, which use different amount of information on the enrolling centers. Models were applied to Cost of Strategies after Myocardial Infarction data, an international randomized trial on costs of uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The simple center effect adjustment based on a single random effect results in a more conservative estimation of the parameters as compared with approaches which make use of deeper information on the centers characteristics. This study shows, with reference to a real multicenter trial, that center information cannot be neglected and should be collected and inserted in the analysis, better in combination with one or more random effect, taking into account in this way also the heterogeneity among centers because of unobserved centers characteristics.","[Petrinco, Michele; Gregori, Dario] Univ Turin, Dept Publ Hlth & Microbiol, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Petrinco, Michele] Univ Turin, Dept Stat & Appl Maths Diego de Castro, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Pagano, Eva; Ferrando, Alberto; Merletti, Franco] Univ Turin, Canc Epidemiol Unit, CERMS & CPO Piemonte, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Desideri, Alessandro] San Giacomo Hosp, Cardiovasc Res Fdn, Veneto, Italy; [Bigi, Riccardo] Ctr Diagnost Italiano Milan, Milan, Italy; [Ghidina, Marco] Osped S Maria Misericordia, Dept Cardiopulm Sci, Udine, Italy; [Cortigiani, Lauro] Campo Marte Hosp, Cardiovasc Unit, Lucca, Italy",University of Turin; University of Turin; University of Turin; Hospital Santa Maria della Misericordia,"Petrinco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Publ Hlth & Microbiol, Via Santena 7, I-10126 Turin, Italy.",mpetrinco@yahoo.it,"Gregori, Dario/F-9974-2012; Pagano, Eva/K-3980-2016","Gregori, Dario/0000-0001-7906-0580; Pagano, Eva/0000-0001-7552-2901; Ghidina, Marco/0000-0003-3111-162X","Compagnia di San Paolo; Ricerca Sanitaria Finalizzata 2006, Regione Piemonte","Compagnia di San Paolo(Compagnia di San Paolo); Ricerca Sanitaria Finalizzata 2006, Regione Piemonte(Regione Piemonte)",Source of financial support: This study was supported by the Compagnia di San Paolo.,,23,6,8,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,325,330,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00420.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,18647254.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000263467500019,0

Four pilot land consolidation projects were accomplished during 2000 - 2003. These projects estimated situation in Lithuania, showed specific features of country and required legal base for land consolidation. The article analyses what means of rural development can be implemented during land consolidation projects and reveal main problems and benefits of accomplished land consolidation projects, Only 28% of land owners took participation in the pilot land consolidation projects. Means of rural development were implemented partly only in Pabaiskas and Puskelniai projects, although owners asked for these means in all projects. One of the main reasons for this is separate financing for land consolidation projects and rural development measures. Recently accomplished 14 land consolidation projects differed by their size and results. Totally in all land consolidation projects the number of land plots reduced by 30% from 731 to 512. Accomplished multiple regression analysis showed that both area of project and number of land plots have a great impact on costs of land consolidation projects (correlation coefficient R = 0.86). The analysis showed that there is a great demand for other rural development means. However cost of project implementation can be twice higher by implementing these means.","[Aleknavicius, Audrius] Lithuanian Univ Agr, Water & Land Management Fac, Land Management Dept, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno Raj, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,audrius.aleknavicius@lzuu.lt,"Aleknavicius, Audrius/HOC-4516-2023",,,,,,17,0,0,1,7,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,99,105,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Engineering, Environmental; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Engineering; Public Administration,BNL17,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845700017,0

This study examined the cost-effectiveness of specific CHD treatments in Ireland. Irish epidemiological data on patient numbers and median survival in specific groups, plus the uptake, effectiveness, and costs of specific interventions, all stratified by age and sex, were incorporated into a previously validated CHD mortality model, the IMPACT model. This model calculates the number of life-years gained (LYGs) by specific cardiology interventions to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per LYG for each intervention. In 2000, medical and surgical treatments together prevented or postponed approximately 1885 CHD deaths in patients aged 25 to 84 years, and thus generated approximately 14,505 extra life-years (minimum 7270, maximum 22,475). In general, all the cardiac interventions investigated were highly cost-effective in the Irish setting. Aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, spironolactone, and warfarin for specific conditions were the most cost-effective interventions (< 3000/LYG), followed by the statins for secondary prevention (< 6500/LYG). Revascularization for chronic angina and primary angioplasty for myocardial infarction, although still cost-effective, had the highest ICER (between 12,000 and 20,000/LYG). Using a comprehensive standardized methodology, cost-effectiveness ratios in this study clearly favored simple medical treatments for myocardial infarction, secondary prevention, angina, and heart failure.","[Bennett, Kathleen] St James Hosp, Trinity Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Kabir, Zubair] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Publ Hlth Practice, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Barry, Michael; Tilson, Lesley] St James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Fidan, Dogan] Global Hlth Outcomes & Market Access Sanofi Avent, Paris, France; [Shelley, Emer] HSE Populat Hlth Stewarts Hosp, Dublin, Ireland; [Capewell, Simon] Univ Liverpool, Dept Publ Hlth, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",Trinity College Dublin; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Circular sample plots were located and measured in the forest using conventional geodetic survey and dendrometric methods. Higher laser scanning point density was found to result in significantly lower bias of altitude of digital terrain model than the lower laser scanning point density. The bias of the altitude of digital terrain model was less on the sample plots located in coniferous forest than in mixed or deciduous forests. Presence of the 2(nd) storey and undergrowth was not found to have significant influence on the bias of altitude of digital terrain model, no matter the laser scanning characteristics. A constrained linear ordination method (redundancy analysis) indicated that the biases of altitude of digital terrain model were negatively related with the magnitude of major volumetric characteristics of the 1(st) storey of the stand and share of coniferous trees but positively with the one of the 2nd storey.","[Bikuviene, Ina; Mozgeris, Gintautas] Lithuanian Univ Agr, Inst Environm, GIS Educ & Res Ctr, Studentu 13, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas R, Lithuania; [Zalkauskas, Remigijus] Lithuanian Univ Agr, Fac Forestry & Ecol, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas R, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Bikuviene, I (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Univ Agr, Inst Environm, GIS Educ & Res Ctr, Studentu 13, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas R, Lithuania.",ina_b@lvmi.lt; gintautas.mozgeris@gmail.com; remigijus.zalkauskas@lzuu.lt,"Mozgeris, Gintautas/W-2850-2019","Mozgeris, Gintautas/0000-0002-8480-6006; Zalkauskas, Remigijus/0000-0001-6451-4420",,,,,15,3,3,0,4,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,217,221,,,,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Engineering, Environmental; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Engineering; Public Administration,BNL17,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845700038,0

These uncertainties are, in part, related to climate models and their inability to resolve aspects of the global circulation and internal oscillations. These problems can be exaggerated at the regional scale due to model resolution - adding further to the uncertainty as spatial scales decrease. For example, El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a direct impact on Florida's temperature, precipitation, and tropical cyclone numbers but is not well reproduced. The need for higher model resolution has led to the development of Regional Climate Models (RCMs). These models continue to undergo evaluation. In what appears to be a limited area of research, Florida's recent climate (i.e., the past 15 Ky) does not seem to have undergone significant changes in either temperature or precipitation but does indicate sea level fluctuations (rise) associated with events such as the Medieval Warm Period. Assuming that the precipitation and temperature forecasts are reliable, sea level rise is likely the most serious threat for the region.","[Lazarus, Steven M.] Florida Inst Technol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",Florida Institute of Technology,,slazarus@fit.edu,,"Lazarus, Steven/0000-0002-5918-1059",,,,,21,2,2,1,11,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-0694-0,AIP CONF PROC,,,2009,1157.0,,,,,,32,38,,,,,,7,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BLH26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000270167600005,0

Methods: Forty-eight trained individuals successfully conducted interviews with a representative sample of 1409 respondents in 2007. A total of 12 sets of health states were used with one set allocated to each respondent. A respondent was requested to assign values for 11 states using the ranking and visual analogue scale methods and 10 states using the time trade-off method. The variables from the three existing models were used in model specifications and the best model was chosen on the basis of the extent of logical inconsistency in the estimated scores, predictive performance, parsimony, and sensitivity to changes in health. Results: Eighty-six health states were valued. The mean age of respondents was 44.6 years old. The highly consistent respondents tend to give higher scores for mild states and lower scores for severe states, compared with those given by the highly inconsistent respondents. The best model used variables from the Dolan 1997 study and estimated from the scores given by the respondents with fewer than 11 inconsistencies. The estimated scores are completely consistent, R(2) is 0.448. The second highest score was 0.766 given to state 11112 and the lowest score was -0.454 for state 33333. Conclusion: Values for EQ-5D health states were estimated from the Thai general population. This is the first Thai generic health state value results to be used in evaluating health interventions in Thailand.","[Tongsiri, Sirinart] Mahasarakham Univ, Fac Med, Muang 44000, Mahasarakham, Thailand; [Cairns, John] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England",Mahasarakham University; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Tongsiri, S (通讯作者)，Mahasarakham Univ, Fac Med, Muang 44000, Mahasarakham, Thailand.",stongsiri@yahoo.co.uk,"Cairns, John/AAD-1168-2020","Tongsiri, Sirinart/0000-0002-4039-5727","Ministry of Public Health, Thailand","Ministry of Public Health, Thailand","Source of financial support: Sirinart Tongsiri received funds from International Health Policy Program (IHPP), Burden of Disease Program (BOD), and Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP), Ministry of Public Health, Thailand.",,36,98,99,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2011,14.0,8,,,,,1142,1145,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.06.005,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BM,22152185.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081900022,0

We investigate whether the distribution of subsequent prime-age adult deaths as measured by concentration indices depends on the measure of living standards used. We compare the performance of three measures: (1) per capita expenditure; (2) a modern wealth asset index replicating the asset index included in the 2004 Tanzanian AIDS Indicator Survey data file; and (3) a traditional wealth asset index, which includes only measures of traditional wealth. We find no evidence that economic status is linked to prime-age adult deaths, for both men and women, regardless of the measure of economic status used. This finding suggests both that more generally the measure of economic status used does not appear to be crucial, and specifically that relationships using traditional measures of wealth do not seem to differ from those using conventional measures.

As a consequence, the methods employed by economic analysts are increasingly subject to close scrutiny. One such area of methodology concerns the instruments used to elicit preferences for various health states for use in the construction of quality-adjusted life years. There are a number of techniques which may be used to elicit preferences and different techniques produce different results. The objective of this study was to explore the test-retest reliability of two techniques: Time Trade Off (TTO) and Person Trade Off (PTO) valuations were collected by a general population postal survey. A total of 798 respondents returned questionnaires. The intra class correlation coefficients ranged from 0.40 to 0.88 for TTO and, -0.17 to 0.82 for PTO, with the majority of coefficients being >0.50. The reliability coefficients varied between techniques and health states, with the TTO technique tending to produce higher coefficients. While the reliability results for TTO were generally positive, the reliability results for PTO are less clear.

We overcome this conservativeness by introducing a new projection-based test that is more powerful than the traditional projection-based tests. The new test is even asymptotically equivalent to the related plug-in-based tests when all the parameters are identified. Extension to models with weakly identified parameters shows that the new test is not dominated by the related plug-in-based tests. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We allow for the treatment to have an effect on the participation or the sample selection rule and on the main outcome. Applications of this model are frequent in - but no limited to - health economics. We show an application of the model using data from Kenkel and Terza (2001), who investigate the effect of physician advice on the amount of alcohol consumption. Our estimates suggest that in these data (i) neglecting treatment endogeneity leads to a wrongly signed effect of physician advice on drinking intensity, (ii) accounting for treatment endogeneity but neglecting endogenous participation leads to an upward biased estimate of the treatment effect and (iii) advice affects only the drinking intensive margin but not drinking prevalence.

Simulated patient A is instructed to ask a question that showcases his/her knowledge of appropriate antibiotic use, whereas patient B is instructed to say nothing beyond describing his/her symptoms. We find that a patient who displays knowledge of appropriate antibiotics use reduces both antibiotic prescription rates and drug expenditures. Such knowledge also increases physicians' information provision about possible side effects, but has a negative impact on the quality of the physician-patient interactions.

The underlying rationale for the heavy-metal approach to insurance regulation is that heterogeneity in demand for health care is not only due to health status (sick demand more than the healthy) but also to other, taste related factors (rich demand more than the poor). This paper models managed competition with demand heterogeneity to consider plan payment and enrollee premium policies in relation to efficiency (net consumer benefit) and fairness (the European concept of solidarity). Specifically, this paper studies how to implement a Silver and Gold health plan efficiently and fairly in a managed competition context. We show that there are sharp tradeoffs between efficiency and fairness. When health plans cannot or may not (because of regulation) base premiums on any factors affecting demand, enrollees do not choose the efficient plan. When taste (e.g., income) can be used as a basis of payment, a simple tax can achieve both efficiency and fairness. When only health status (and not taste) can be used as a basis of payment, health status-based taxes and subsidies are required and efficiency can only be achieved with a modified version of fairness we refer to as weak solidarity. An overriding conclusion is that the regulation of premiums for both the basic and the higher level plans is necessary for efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Improving on prior research, the estimated models in this paper disentangle physician director selection effects from the causal impact of these financial interests. The data suggest that even prior to their financial interest, physician directors had larger procedure volumes than non-directors. Physician directors also referred more lower-risk patients. On average, ASC board membership led to a 27% increase in a physician's procedure volume and a 16% increase in a physician's colonoscopy volume. Simulations suggest that 5% of the colonoscopies performed in Florida between 1997 and 2004 may have been due to physician ASC board membership. The evidence also suggests that physician directors steered patients from hospitals to their affiliate ASCs. In addition, they referred and/or treated more lower-risk patients as a result of board membership. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Ideas and growth. Economica 76, 1-19), a continuum of people interact in a random manner and copy each other's productive ideas when it is economically beneficial to do so. This paper extends the Lucas model by assuming that each person's productivity also experiences random shocks due to individual discovery. A nonlinear partial differential equation is derived for the distribution of income, which admits a traveling wave solution representing a growing economy. The growth rate is an increasing function of the rate of imitation. The growth rate is also an increasing but concave function of population size and reaches a plateau in the continuum limit. Hence the scale effect is bounded. The model is extended to account for a nonzero cost of imitation, with similar results. The mathematical tools presented in this paper should prove useful in developing idea-based models of growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Seven of these general models are statistical models predicting progression of AD using a measure of cognitive function. The main concerns with models are on model structure, around the limited characterization of disease progression, and on the use of a limited number of health states to capture events related to disease progression over time. None of the available models have been able to present a comprehensive model of the natural history of AD. Conclusions: Although helpful, there are serious limitations in the methods available to model progression of AD over time. Advances are needed to better model the progression of AD and the effects of the disease on peoples' lives. Recent evidence supports the need for a multivariable approach to the modelling of AD progression, and indicates that a latent variable analytic approach to characterising AD progression is a promising avenue for advances in the statistical development of modelling methods.","[Green, Colin] Univ Exeter, Hlth Econ Grp, Peninsula Med Sch, Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England; [Green, Colin] Univ Exeter, Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, PenCLAHRC, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England; [Ritchie, Craig W.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Neurosci & Mental Hlth, London, England; [Zajicek, John P.] Univ Plymouth, Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, Clin Neurosci Res Grp, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Plymouth; University of Plymouth; University of Exeter; Imperial College London; University of Plymouth,"Green, C (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Hlth Econ Grp, Peninsula Med Sch, Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, Veysey Bldg,Salmon Pool Lane, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England.",colin.green@pms.ac.uk,"Shearer, James/B-4933-2013","Murray, Dianna/0000-0003-3481-825X; Shearer, James/0000-0002-1658-9767",UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [RP-PG-0707-10124]; NIHR; National Institute for Health Research [RP-PG-0707-10124] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [RP-PG-0707-10124] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"Source of financial support: This report/article presents independent research commissioned by the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research scheme (RP-PG-0707-10124).

The peculiarity of the Italian electoral system is that a party can present the same candidate in different constituencies. There are several seats at stake in each constituency; these seats are allocated to the parties proportionally to the total number of votes they get. If the blocked list mechanism - which assigns the seats obtained by a party in a constituency to the first candidates of the corresponding ordered list - causes some candidates to win in more than one constituency, they may retain only one of the seats, giving up all the remaining ones. Thus, the problem arises for a party to find a suitable schedule of give-ups that produces the final set of winners for that party. in order to do this, we assume that such decision is centralized and based on some models of global (inter-regional) preferences over the set of candidates. In this paper, we introduce two classes of models to formulate the give-up problem, i.e., utility and ordinal models, and we show that for both of them some natural formulations of the problem can be efficiently solved by network flows techniques.

This paper studies the predictors of nursing home ownership conversions and closure in a common framework after the implementation of the Prospective Payment System in Medicare skilled nursing facilities. The switch in reimbursement regimes impacted facilities with greater exposure to Medicare and lower efficiency. Facilities that faced greater financial difficulty were more likely to be involved in an ownership conversion or closure, but after controlling for other factors the effect of exposure to Medicare is small. Further, factors that predict conversion were found to vary between not-for-profit and for-profit facilities, while factors that predict closure were the same for each ownership type.

A wider acceptance of these methods is limited by an absence of consensus-based methodological standards. Objective: The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Good Research Practices for Conjoint Analysis Task Force was established to identify good research practices for conjoint-analysis applications in health. Methods: The task force met regularly to identify the important steps in a conjoint analysis, to discuss good research practices for conjoint analysis, and to develop and refine the key criteria for identifying good research practices. ISPOR members contributed to this process through an extensive consultation process. A final consensus meeting was held to revise the article using these comments, and those of a number of international reviewers. Results: Task force findings are presented as a 10-item checklist covering: 1) research question; 2) attributes and levels; 3) construction of tasks; 4) experimental design; 5) preference elicitation; 6) instrument design; 7) data-collection plan; 8) statistical analyses; 9) results and conclusions; and 10) study presentation. A primary question relating to each of the 10 items is posed, and three sub-questions examine finer issues within items. Conclusions: Although the checklist should not be interpreted as endorsing any specific methodological approach to conjoint analysis, it can facilitate future training activities and discussions of good research practices for the application of conjoint-analysis methods in health care studies.","[Bridges, John F.

Here we address their major criticism, that the model is in general unable to explain the degree of serial correlation observed in the prices of twelve major commodities. First, we present a simple numerical version of their model which, contrary to Deaton and Laroque (1992), can generate the high levels of serial correlation observed in commodity prices, if it is parameterized to generate realistic levels of price variation. Then, after estimating the Deaton and Laroque (1995, 1996) model using their data set, model specification and econometric approach, we show that the use of a much finer grid to approximate the equilibrium price function yields quite different estimates for most commodities. Results are obtained for coffee, copper, jute, maize, palm oil, sugar and tin that support the specifications of the storage model with positive constant marginal storage cost and no deterioration as in Gustafson (1958a). Consumption demand has a low response to price and, except for sugar, stockouts are infrequent. The observed magnitudes of serial correlation of price match those implied by the estimated model.

This leads to the time-dependent bias, which biases multiplicative hazard ratios. We demonstrate the time-dependent bias on the additive scale of extra length of stay. Methods: To estimate the extra length of stay due to infection, we used a multistate model that accounted for the time of infection. For comparison we used a generalized linear model assuming a gamma distribution, a commonly used model that ignores the time of infection. We applied these two methods to a large prospective cohort of hospital admissions from Argentina, and compared the methods' performance using a simulation study. Results: For the Argentina data the extra length of stay due to nosocomial infection was 11.23 days when ignoring time dependence and only 1.35 days after accounting for the time of infection. The simulations showed that ignoring time dependence consistently overestimated the extra length of stay. This overestimation was similar for different rates of infection and even when an infection prolonged or shortened stay. We show examples where the time-dependent bias remains unchanged for the true discharge hazard ratios, but the bias for the extra length of stay is doubled because length of stay depends on the infection hazard. Conclusions: Ignoring the timing of nosocomial infection gives estimates that greatly overestimate its effect on the extra length of hospital stay.

J,"Wang, YT",,,,"Wang, Yuntong",,,Trading water along a river,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Efficient allocation of water; Water trading; Core,MARKETS,"A set of agents is located along a river. Each agent consumes certain amount of water he receives from his part of the river basin and may sell certain amount to his downstream agent if it is mutually beneficial. Water trading is restricted to two neighboring agents and an agent can only pass water to his downstream agent. We ask if this restricted trade to neighboring agents can implement an efficient allocation of water. We show that the efficient allocation of water can be achieved through the process of downstream bilateral trading. Specifically, we show that this one way downstream trading process implements the unique efficient allocation as well as a welfare distribution. We also show that the welfare distribution is in the core of the associated game of the problem. Moreover, we show that the coalition of agents upstream any agent obtains more welfare with the bilateral trading than with the downstream incremental distribution proposed by Ambec and Sprumont (2002) and less than with the upstream incremental distribution proposed by Ambec and Ehlers (2008a,b).

A comparison between bare metal and drug-eluting stents,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Coronary heart disease; Costs; Drug-eluting stent; Selection bias,PRACTICAL CLINICAL-TRIALS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; PROPENSITY SCORE; CARE,"Objective: In this article we investigate the possibility to account for selection bias in observational data by using econometric techniques. Methods: One-year costs of 15,237 patients who received a drug-eluting stent (DES) or a bare metal stent (BMS) in Belgium in 2004 were compared. The treatment choice between DES and BMS could be influenced by patient characteristics; therefore, cost estimates could be biased by overt and/or hidden selection bias. Overt bias was addressed by regression adjustment and propensity score matching. Hidden selection bias was dealt with by using an instrumental variable (IV) approach. Results: Due to the higher purchase price DES patients incur higher (unadjusted) costs in the short-term; these costs are, however, compensated in the long-term due to less in-stent restenosis and hospitalizations. Analyses indicated that, for the diabetic population, the null hypothesis of similar average 1-year costs of patients receiving a BMS or DES cannot be rejected. For the non-diabetic patients a significant cost difference between BMS and DES patients was found. It cannot be ruled out that the treatment-effect model does not correct for all observable or unobservable characteristics and that the estimated treatment effect is biased, possibly due to weak instruments. Conclusion: It is interesting and necessary to explore the use of econometric tools in cost and cost effectiveness analysis to investigate the effect of a technology in everyday practice and to take into account patient and disease characteristics and uncertainty. Further research is however necessary to investigate how we can fully correct for selection bias when using observational data.

Many of these so-called externalities are, moreover, cumulative. Accounting for the damages conservatively doubles to triples the price of electricity from coal per kWh generated, making wind, solar, and other forms of nonfossil fuel power generation, along with investments in efficiency and electricity conservation methods, economically competitive.

All important constructions have to go through the process, prescribing obligatory the judgement of a series of factors that influence the environment and population health, grouped into several categories. Outputs of the EIA process are usually a set of recommendations and obligations to the investors and building companies in order to compensate the negative impacts of the constructions by additional arrangements. In modelling phase, several uncertain parameters (e.g. future transport intensities) enter into the problem. Also many criteria of the EIA process are of subjective character,so modelling through utility functions (again not well defined) is proposed. In our contribution we develop an innovative approach to model the expenses devoted to obey the EIA rules by stochastic programming tools: especially, we represent uncertainty in parameters by their probabilistic distributions, and subjective utility function representing the ecological demands is modelled via so-called indicators of ecological stability. The model takes into account budget limitations,several legislative obligations (as pollution limits), and other ecological aspects influencing costs of transport constructions; the goal is to help choose, among possible compensating constructions and arrangements, the optimal ones. The resulting stochastic programming model could be seen as parallel to the usual V@R problem - type of problems used in finance.","[Houda, Michal] ASCR, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,,houda@ef.jcu.cz,"Houda, Michal/D-8708-2016","Houda, Michal/0000-0002-2825-2846",,,,,4,1,1,0,0,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,279,283,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309074600046,0

The milk records and samplings were carried out three times during the lactation on average 75th, 132th and 190th day of lactation. During the experiment all ewes were reared on permanent pasture. The determination of somatic cell count (SCC) was made using fluoro-opto-electronic apparatus. Milk was analyzed using standard plate count methods for total bacteria count (TBC), psychrotrophic bacteria count (PBC) and total coliform count (TCC). The analysis involved a total of 60 milk samples. The collected data were statistically analysed using the mathematical-statistical program STATISTICA 9.0. The PA had a significant effect only on SCC, but on the other hand the PA had not significant effect on chosen groups of mircoorganisms. The results of this study indicate that significant effect of the SL was found on SCC and also on all chosen microbiological indicators (TBC, PBC, TCC). The interaction of PA x SL had a significant effect on PBC. The milk of PA3 ewes had a significantly greater amount of somatic cells than the PA2 ewes. SCC significantly decreased with advanced lactation. Among SCC and all chosen groups of microorganisms were found positive and significant correlations, also among particular groups of microorganisms were found positive and significant correlations.","[Kralickova, S.; Kuchtik, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Králícková, S (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xlcralic0@node.mendelu.cz,"Kuchtik, Jan/K-6393-2018","Kuchtik, Jan/0000-0002-1602-2699",,,,,22,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,253,260,,,,,,8,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341783400028,0

On the contrary, the supply of nitrogen led to a lower utilization rate by microorganisms, which were then no longer able to respond by higher intensity of respiration even if easily degradable organic matter was suppied. It was also proved that the microorganisms are able to utilize available nitrogen by immobilization in their biomass and thus prevent its leaching potential if the phosphorous is added.","[Nawrath, A.; Skladanka, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Tuma, I] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Mikrobiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Nawrath, A (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xnawrath@node.mendelu.cz,"Skladanka, Jiri/I-6115-2018",,,,,,7,0,0,1,9,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,679,686,,,,,,8,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341783400082,0

In proteome maps, significant differences were reproducibly observed for 49 and 35 protein spots in light and dark cultivated seeds, respectively.

In particular, if this effect is more prominent in the upper tail than elsewhere in the distribution of children's alcohol consumption, conventional regression analyses that focus on the mean effect may substantially underrate parental drinking as a risk factor for children's later alcohol abuse. In our empirical application, we address this issue by applying censored quantile regression methods to German survey data. The supposed pattern of heterogeneity is indeed found in the data, at least for daily parental drinking. In addition, the intergenerational transmission of alcohol consumption exhibits gender-specific heterogeneity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A decision tree was constructed and parameterized using data from published sources. The economic evaluation was conducted from the perspective of government health care payer. Benefits (disability adjusted life years [DALYs]) and costs were discounted at 3%. Costs were assessed in 2008 US dollars. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the stability of the base-case results. The uncertainty surrounding the estimates of cost effectiveness was illustrated through a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and cost-effectiveness plane. Results: In the base-case analysis, AMC can be regarded as cost saving because it is associated with higher DALYs gained and lower costs than no AMC. The probability that AMC is cost effective is above 0.96 at a threshold value of $150 and remains high over a wide range of threshold values. Thus, there is very little uncertainty surrounding the decision to adopt AMC for prevention of heterosexual acquisition of HIV in men. The results were found to be sensitive to varying any of the following parameters: DALYs averted, discount, and circumcision efficacy. Conclusions: AMC is found to be cost saving. AMC may be seen as a promising new form of strategy for prevention of heterosexual acquisition of HIV in men, but should never replace other known methods of HIV prevention and should always be considered as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package.

The thesis itself is based on a literature research, on an analysis of statistical data, on a detailed survey of the region and on results of a questionnaire. The whole microregion currently ranks among economically weak regions with poor transport infrastructure and low business activity. The location on the border of three administrative regions, the necessity of commute to workplaces, a poor condition of roads and an underdeveloped tourism infrastructure - all these belong to the weaknesses in this area. The location in Mal Han, environment without heavy industry, the nature of soils suitable for agriculture and connection to the IDS JMK (an integrated transport system of the South Moravian region) - these things can strongly support the future development of the region Jevicko. The threats are especially aging population, migration of young people to cities and growing unemployment. With such a high unemployment rate this region represents a good business opportunities because it is a source of cheap labour. The region also has good preconditions for the development of small businesses and agrotourism. A long time ago suggested construction of the road R43 is a source of conflicts in this region. The construction could create new jobs but it could also harm a valuable part of this territory.","[Zitnakova, J.; Vaishar, A.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Zitnáková, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",janazitnakova@seznam.cz,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,539,547,,,,,,9,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341783400063,0

These laws vary within states over time and across venues such as schools, government buildings, and bars. Few studies, however, have evaluated whether the effects of SCIALs are plausibly concentrated among workers who should have been directly affected because they worked at locations covered by the venue-specific restrictions. We fill this gap in the literature using data on private sector workers, government employees, school workers, eating and drinking place workers, and bartenders from the 1992-2007 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey. Our quasiexperimental models indicate robust effects of SCIALs restricting smoking in bars: these laws significantly increased the presence of workplace smoking restrictions as reported by bartenders and reduced the fraction of bartenders who smoke. We do not, however, find that SCIALs in private workplaces, government workplaces, schools, or restaurants increased the presence of workplace smoking restrictions among groups of workers working in venues covered by these laws. This suggests that the smoking reductions associated with SCIALs in previous research are unlikely to have been directly caused by effects of workplace smoking restrictions on workers.

It was developed in the UK and has been shown to have excellent psychometric properties. This study describes the adaptation of eight language versions for Canadian English, Canadian French, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, and US English. Methods: The PRIMUS was translated using the dual-panel process. Cognitive debriefing interviews conducted with MS patients assessed face and content validity. Psychometric and scaling properties were assessed via a two-administration postal survey conducted in each country involving the PRIMUS, the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the Unidimensional Fatigue Impact Scale (U-FIS), and demographic questions. Results: Cognitive debriefing interviews demonstrated the acceptability of the new language versions. Analysis of survey data showed that the new language versions of the three PRIMUS scales were unidimensional (as indicated by fit to the Rasch model) and that they had good internal consistency and reproducibility. PRIMUS scale scores correlated as expected with those on the NHP and the U-FIS. The scales in all countries were able to discriminate between groups of patients on the basis of their self-reported MS severity, general health, and employment status. Conclusions: The PRIMUS was successfully adapted into eight new languages. Most of the tests showed the PRIMUS to have good unidimensionality and to have good internal consistency, reproducibility, and construct validity. The measure is now available for use in clinical studies and trials involving these countries and the UK. Further work is required to assess the measure's responsiveness.","[McKenna, Stephen P.; Doward, Lynda C.; Twiss, James; Meads, David M.] Galen Res Ltd, Manchester M15 6SE, Lancs, England; [Hagell, Peter] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Oprandi, Nadia C.] Univ Verona, I-37100 Verona, Italy; [Fisk, John; Bhan, Virender] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Grand'Maison, Francois] Univ Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Arbizu, Txomin] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Brassat, David] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse, France; [Kohlmann, Thomas] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Greisfwald, Germany; [Eckert, Benjamin J.] Novartis Pharmaceut, Princeton, NJ USA",Lund University; University of Verona; Dalhousie University; University of Sherbrooke; University of Barcelona; Universite de Toulouse; Universitat Greifswald; Novartis,"McKenna, SP (通讯作者)，Galen Res Ltd, Enterprise House,Manchester Sci Pk,Lloyd St N, Manchester M15 6SE, Lancs, England.",smckenna@galen-research.com,"Hagell, Peter/F-5915-2010; Doward, Lynda/IXD-2462-2023; Brassat, David/L-2173-2014; Hagell, Peter/G-9559-2014; Fisk, John/N-7796-2015","Hagell, Peter/0000-0003-2174-372X; Doward, Lynda/0000-0002-6236-469X; Hagell, Peter/0000-0003-2174-372X; Fisk, John/0000-0003-3512-8015",Novartis Pharmaceuticals,Novartis Pharmaceuticals(Novartis),The study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.,,17,18,18,0,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,946,951,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00767.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20667058.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000285066200012,0

Methods: A consecutive sample of patients (n = 258) diagnosed with knee OA completed both the WOMAC and the EQ-5D. Regression models with the ordinary least squares (OLS) or the censored least absolute deviations as the estimator were used to establish the mapping function. The WOMAC was represented as explanatory variables in four ways: 1) total score; 2) domain scores (i.e., pain, stiffness, and physical function); 3) domain scores plus pair-wise interaction terms to account for possible nonlinearities; and 4) individual item scores. Goodness-of-fit criteria included the mean absolute error (the primary criterion) and the root mean squared error, and were obtained using an iterative random sampling procedure. Prediction precision was evaluated at individual patient level and at the group level. Results: The model using the OLS estimator and the WOMAC domain scores as explanatory variables had the best fit and was chosen as the preferred mapping model. The prediction error at the individual level exceeded the maximal tolerance value (i.e., the minimally important difference of the EQ-5D) in about 16% of the patients. At the group level, the width of the 95% confidence interval of prediction errors varied from 0.0176 at a sample size of 400 to 0.0359 at a sample size of 100. Conclusions: EQ-5D scores can be predicted using WOMAC domain scores with an acceptable precision at both individual and group levels in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.","[Xie, Feng] McMaster Univ, Programs Assessment Technol Hlth, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Fac Hlth Sci, Hamilton, ON L8P 1H1, Canada; [Xie, Feng; Hopkins, Robert] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Programs Assessment Technol Hlth, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Pullenayegum, Eleanor M.] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Ctr Evaluat Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Li, Shu-Chuen] Univ Newcastle, Discipline Pharm & Expt Pharmacol, Sch Biomed Sci, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia; [Thumboo, Julian] Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, Singapore 0316, Singapore; [Lo, Ngai-Nung] Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Singapore 0316, Singapore",McMaster University; McMaster University; McMaster University; University of Newcastle; Singapore General Hospital; Singapore General Hospital,"Xie, F (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Programs Assessment Technol Hlth, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Fac Hlth Sci, 25 Main St W,Suite 2000, Hamilton, ON L8P 1H1, Canada.",fengxie@mcmaster.ca,"LI, SHU CHUEN/G-7911-2013; Pullenayegum, Eleanor/AAT-1712-2020","Pullenayegum, Eleanor/0000-0003-4265-1330",,,,,40,44,47,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,873,878,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00770.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20667055.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000285066200004,0

Showing the existence of steady states where only the most patient households hold capital, we argue that working could not be optimal for them. Dynamics are addressed through a local analysis. In contrast to many contributions, progressive tax rules can promote expectation-driven fluctuations and endogenous cycles. Hence, progressivity can be an inopportune device to stabilize macroeconomic volatility. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This fact enhanced studies of the determinants of patents and the impact of patents on innovation and competitive advantage. Sustaining competitive advantages is as important as creating them. Patents help sustaining competitive advantages by increasing the production cost of competitors, by signaling a better quality of products and by serving as barriers to entry. If patents are rewards for innovation, more R&D should be reflected in more patent applications but this is not the end of the story. There is empirical evidence showing that patents through time are becoming easier to get and more valuable to the firm due to increasing damage awards from infringers. These facts question the constant and static nature of the relationship between R&D and patents. Furthermore, innovation creates important knowledge spillovers due to its imperfect appropriability. Our paper investigates these dynamic effects using US patent data from 1979 to 2000 with alternative model specifications for patent counts. We introduce a general dynamic count panel data model with dynamic observable and unobservable spillovers, which encompasses previous models, is able to control for the endogeneity of R&D and therefore can be consistently estimated by maximum likelihood. Apart from allowing for firm specific fixed and random effects, we introduce a common unobserved component, or secret stock of knowledge, that affects differently the propensity to patent of each firm across sectors due to their different absorptive capacity.

Objective: We sought to use willingness-to-pay (WTP) to value the time required and the discomfort associated with screening colonoscopy. In addition, we aimed to explore some of the differences between and potential uses of the WTP and the human capital methods. Methods: Subjects completed a diary recording time and a questionnaire including WTP questions to value the time and discomfort associated with colonoscopy. We also valued the elapsed time reported in the diaries (but not the discomfort) using the human capital method. Results: 110 subjects completed the study. Mean WTP to avoid the time and discomfort was $263. Human capital values for elapsed time were greater. Linear regressions showed that WTP was influenced most by the difficulty of the preparation, which added $147 to WTP (p = 0.03). Conclusions: WTP values to avoid the time and discomfort associated with the screening colonoscopy process were substantially lower than most of the human capital values for elapsed time alone. The human capital method may overestimate the value of time in situations that involve an irregular, episodic series of time intervals, such as preparation for or recovery after colonoscopy.

Bierens (1990) defines the test hypothesis in terms of a conditional moment condition. Under the null hypothesis, the moment condition holds with probability one. The probability measure used is that induced by the variables in the model, that are assumed to be strictly stationary. Our framework is nonstationary and this approach is not always applicable. We show that the Lebesgue measure can be used instead in a meaningful way. The resultant test is consistent against all I-regular alternatives. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Its interest lies in the fact that it has been an instrumental result to prove key results on matching. For instance, the fact that in the college admissions problem the workers-optimal stable mechanism is group strategy-proof for the workers and the strong stability theorem in the marriage model follow directly from the Blocking Lemma. However, it is known that the Blocking Lemma and its consequences do not hold in the general many-to-one matching model in which firms have substitutable preference relations.

Sunitinib is a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, indicated for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (MRCC) of clear cell histology. Canadian decision-makers evaluated sunitinib funding in the presence of important data limitations (including interim analysis of a surrogate outcome) and in the context of a high ICER. Methods: First, a description was presented of the cost-effectiveness analysis submitted for sunitinib reimbursement decision-making in Canada before conclusive survival evidence had been available. Second, sunitinib access decisions and the oncology drug reimbursement literature were reviewed to explore the interpretation of sunitinib perceived value in the context of the decision-making framework in Canada. Results: The economic evaluation yielded an ICER of $144K/quality-adjusted life-year gained for sunitinib compared with interferon-alfa. This high ratio was not an insurmountable barrier to access in Canada because all provinces now reimburse sunitinib for first-line treatment of MRCC. In this particular instance, payers were receptive to immature survival data but substantial progression-free gains, for patients with a relatively rare cancer and few treatment options. Conclusion: This demonstrates that the cost-effectiveness ratio is only one of many factors that affect an access decision in oncology.","[Chabot, Isabelle] Pfizer Canada, Div Med, Dept Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rocchi, Angela] Axia Res, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Pfizer,"Chabot, I (通讯作者)，Pfizer Canada Inc, TransCanada Highway, Kirkland, PQ H9J 2M5, Canada.",isabelle.chabot@pfizer.com,,,Pfizer Canada Inc.,Pfizer Canada Inc.,"The economic evaluation was funded by Pfizer Canada Inc.

The health states need to be distinct and comprehensible to those who appraise them. The objective of this study was to describe a novel application of Rasch and cluster analyses in the development of three rheumatoid arthritis health states. Methods: The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) was subjected to Rasch analysis to select the items that best represent disability. K-means cluster analysis produced health states with the levels of the selected items. The pain and discomfort dimension from the EuroQol-5D was also incorporated. Results: The results demonstrate a methodology for reducing a dataset containing individual disease-specific scores to generate health states. The four selected HAQ items were bending down, climbing steps, lifting a cup to your mouth, and standing up from a chair. Conclusions: The combined use of Rasch and k-means cluster analysis has proved to be an effective technique for identifying the most important items and levels for the construction of health states.","[McTaggart-Cowan, Helen M.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"McTaggart-Cowan, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",h.m.cowan@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Tsuchiya, Aki/A-2167-2010","Tsuchiya, Aki/0000-0003-4245-5399; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"The authors would like to thank Fred Wolfe for generously allowing access to the dataset from the National Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases and for input during the health state development, and Tracey Young for her invaluable input during the development of the health states and comments during the manuscript preparation stage.

Using a Hotelling framework, we derive the open-loop solution (health care providers set the optimal investment plan at the initial period) and the feedback closed-loop solution (providers move investments in response to the dynamics of the states). Under the closed-loop solution competition is more intense in the sense that providers observe quality in each period and base their investment on this information. If the marginal provision cost is constant, the open-loop and closed-loop solutions coincide, and the results are similar to the ones obtained by static models. If the marginal provision cost is increasing, investment and quality are lower in the closed-loop solution (when competition is more intense). In this case, static models tend to exaggerate the positive effect of competition on quality. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The nonparametric transfer function is estimated jointly with the ARMA parameters. By modeling the correlation in the noise, the transfer function can be estimated more efficiently. The parsimonious ARMA structure improves the estimation efficiency in finite samples. The asymptotic properties of the estimators are investigated.

At the heart of such models is the need to balance the trade off between attaining asymptotic efficiency, which requires more instruments, and minimizing bias, which is adversely affected by the addition of instruments. Two questions are of central concern: (1) What is the optimal number of instruments to use? (2) Should the instruments receive different weights? This paper contains the following contributions toward resolving these issues. First, I propose a kernel weighted generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator that uses a trapezoidal kernel. This kernel turns out to be attractive to select and weight the number of moments. Second, I derive the higher order mean squared error of the kernel weighted GMM estimator and show that the trapezoidal kernel generates a lower asymptotic variance than regular kernels. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations show that in finite samples the kernel weighted GMM estimator performs on par with other estimators that choose optimal instruments and improves upon a GMM estimator that uses all instruments.

Methods: A validated Markov microsimulation model with a Belgian health-care payer perspective and a lifetime horizon was used to assess the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of the screening/treatment strategy compared with no intervention. Real-world adherence to alendronate therapy and full adherence over 5 years were both investigated. The real-world adherence scenario employed adherence data front published observational studies, and medication adherence was divided into persistence, compliance, and primary adherence. Uncertainty seas investigated using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: At 65 years of age, the costs per QALY gained because of the screening/treatment strategy versus no intervention are (sic)32,008 and (sic)16,918 in the real-world adherence and full adherence scenarios, respectively. The equivalent values are (sic)80,836 and (sic)40,462 at the age of 55 years, and they decrease to 10,600 and (sic)1229 at the age of 75 years. Sensitivity analyses show that the presence of the upfront cost of case finding has a substantial role in the impact of medication adherence on cost effectiveness. Conclusion: This study indicates that nonadherence with osteoporosis medications substantially increases the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of osteoporosis screening strategies. All aspects of medication adherence (i.e., compliance, persistence, and primary adherence) should therefore be reported and included in pharmacoeconomic analyses, and especially in the presence of the upfront cost of case finding (such as screening cost).","[Hiligsmann, Mickael; Gathon, Henry-Jean] Univ Liege, HEC ULg Management Sch, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Hiligsmann, Mickael; Bruyere, Olivier; Ethgen, Olivier; Rabenda, Veronique; Reginster, Jean-Yves] Univ Liege, Dept Publ Hlth Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, B-4000 Liege, Belgium",University of Liege; University of Liege,"Hiligsmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Liege, HEC ULg Management Sch, Blvd Rectorat 7,Bat B31, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",m.hiligsmann@ulg.ac.be,"Reginster, Jean-Yves/AGC-6097-2022; Bruyere, Olivier/H-8302-2019","Bruyere, Olivier/0000-0003-4269-9393",ESCEO-Amgen,ESCEO-Amgen(Amgen),This study was performed as part of the PhD of Mickael Hiligsmann.

MODELLING THE CHOICE OF PUBLIC VS PRIVATE DENTIST IN A CHOICE EXPERIMENT,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,dental care; discrete choice experiment; modelling,,"This study concerns the choice of primary dental service provider by consumers. If the health service delivery system allows individuals to choose between public-care providers or if complementary private services are available, it is typically assumed that utilisation is a three-stage decision process. The patient first makes a decision to seek care, and then chooses the service provider. The final stage, involving decisions over the amount and form of treatment, is not considered here. The paper reports a discrete choice experiment (DCE) designed to evaluate attributes affecting individuals choice of dental-care provider. The feasibility of the DCE approach in modelling consumers' choice in the context of non-acute need for dental care is assessed. The aim is to test whether a separate two-stage logit, a multinomial logit, or a nested logit best fits the choice process of consumers. A nested logit model of indirect utility functions is estimated and inclusive value (IV) constraints are tested for modelling implications. The results show that non-trading behaviour has an impact on the choice of appropriate modelling technique, but is to some extent dependent on the choice of scenarios offered. It is concluded that for traders multinomial logit is appropriate, whereas for non-traders and on average the nested logit is the method supported by the analyses. The consistent finding in all subgroup analyses is that the traditional two-stage decision process is found to be implausible in the context of consumer's choice of dental-care provider.

Methods: A prospective study. The subjects were members of Internet panels in the United States (US) and Germany. 10,816 individuals (United States: n = 5410; Germany: n = 5406) aged 30-70 years with BMI scores between 20 and 35 kg/m(2) were recruited and grouped by category: healthy weight (BMI 20-24.9 kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2)), and obese (BMI 30-35 kg/m(2)). Within the overweight and obese categories, the individuals were stratified by sex and within those subgroups, characterized as above or below the median WC. The subjects self-reported weight, WC, and health-care resource use at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months using online questionnaires. Over 65% of the recruited subjects completed all surveys. Resource utilization was translated into health-care costs by multiplying unit costs from national sources in each country. Annualized health costs were summarized for subjects with low and high WC within the overweight and obese categories. A two-part model generated predicted annual costs because of the WC difference controlling for BMI, demographic, and lifestyle variables among the overweight and obese subjects. Results: When BMI and other characteristics are constant, annual healthcare costs are 16% to 18% higher in Germany and 20% to 30% higher in the United States for the subjects with a high WC compared with subjects with a low WC. Conclusions: Targeting people with a high waist circumference for weight management whether they are overweight or obese may maximize cost-efficacy.","[Wolf, Anne] Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Pendergast, Karen; Sherrill, Beth; Zhou, Xiaolei] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Aronne, Louis J.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY USA; [Caterson, Ian] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Finer, Nicholas] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Hauner, Hans] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Hill, James] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Denver, CO USA; [Van Gaal, Luc] Univ Antwerp Hosp, Antwerp, Belgium; [Coste, Florence] Sanofi Aventis Rech & Dev, Paris, France; [Despres, Jean-Pierre] Hosp Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",University of Virginia; Research Triangle Institute; Columbia University; University of Sydney; University of Cambridge; Technical University of Munich; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Colorado Denver; University of Antwerp; Sanofi-Aventis; Sanofi France; Laval University,"Wolf, A (通讯作者)，5030 Rutherford Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22901 USA.",amw6n@virginia.edu,"Aronne, Louis/ABC-8865-2020; Sriwisit, Sukhumaphorn/G-1405-2011; Finer, Nicholas/JMQ-1560-2023; Finer, Nick/B-9981-2009","Finer, Nick/0000-0003-2468-6804; Zhou, Xiaolei/0000-0002-7992-637X; Hill, James/0000-0003-4690-2264",Sanofi-aventis Recherche et Development,Sanofi-aventis Recherche et Development,Sanofi-aventis Recherche et Development.,,43,13,18,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN-JUL,2010,13.0,4,,,,,402,410,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00690.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,625DD,20113460.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000279872300011,0

Asset prices are endogenously determined by market clearing. We derive results on the asymptotic dynamics of the wealth distribution and asset prices for constant proportions investment strategies. This study is the first step towards a theory of continuous-time asset pricing that combines concepts from mathematical finance and economics by drawing on evolutionary ideas.

We examine the relationship between treatment progress and patient compliance. We hypothesize that patients balance expected benefits and costs during a treatment episode when deciding on compliance; a patient is more likely to comply if doing so results in an expected gain in health benefit. We use a unique data set of outpatient alcohol abuse treatment to identify a relationship between treatment progress and compliance. Treatment progress is measured by the clinician's comments after each attended visit. Compliance is measured by a client attending a scheduled appointment, and continuing with treatment.

Past work largely used self-reported Current income as the core determinant, whereas the theoretically correct concept of household resource constraint is permanent or long-run income (a la Milton Friedman). This paper strives to rectify the theoretical oversight of using current income by augmenting the model with household asset. Using longitudinal data, We constructed 'wealth index' as a distinct covariate to capture the households' tendency to liquidate assets when defraying necessary healthcare liabilities after exhausting cash incomes. (Current income and assets together capture the household expanded resource base). Using 98 632 household observations from Thailand Socio-Economic Surveys (1994-2000 biennial data cycles) we found, using a double-hurdle model with dependent errors, that Out-of-pocket healthcare spending behaves as a technical necessity across income quintiles and household sizes. Pre-1997 economic shock income elasticities are smaller than the post-shock estimates across income quintiles for large and small households. Proximity to death, median age, and assets are also among other significant determinants. Our novel findings extend the theoretical consistency of a multi-level decision model in household healthcare expenditure in the developing Asian country context.

Unfortunately this development is not sustainable. Albania faces transformations which, in a compressed time of 20 years, moved the country from a pre-modern medieval condition to a post atomic condition of only apparent democracy. People have lost the sense of civic respect for collective ideals, for public space and for common rules; they seek improvements but do not have the knowledge to comprehend the consequences of development. Most of the action is left to individual initiative.

The paper draws on an analysis of in-depth interview data collected amongst individuals engaging with heritage in the rural northern uplands of the UK. The paper identifies a framework for investigating sense of place within the environmental psychology literature; this is then used to analyse the interview data. Cultural heritage is found to contribute to sense of place as a source of pride, and by supporting feelings of distinctiveness and senses of continuity across time. The paper concludes that as a process of 'memory talk', as an expression of cultural distinctiveness, or in its built or natural physical form, heritage contributes to sense of place by providing a network of references helping individuals to place themselves in the past and the present.","[Hawke, S.

In a more detailed analysis we examined how the concentration or toxic doses of copper (62.5; 125; 250; 500; 1000 mu M.ml(-1)) chosen by us affects the parameters during different time periods of in vitro cultivation. We compared the control group (physiological solution without copper) with the experimental groups (exposed to different concentrations of CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O). The motility was determined using the Sperm VisionTM CASA system. At time 0hrs, the highest motility 90.30 +/- 4.22% was detected in the control group. In the experimental groups the bovine sperm motility decreased significantly (P<0.001) in comparison with the control. All chosen concentrations of copper inhibited the monitored indicator during all time periods. The second analysed parameter was the cell viability, which was determined by MTT Cell Proliferation Assay. After a 48-hour-cultivation with CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O we proved that the cell viability decreased proportionally to the increasing concentration of this essential trace element. All concentrations reduced significantly (P<0.001) the survival of these cells. The decrease in the viability was already found at the minimal copper concentration of 62.5 mu M Cu.ml(-1) and it was 73.96 +/- 10.39%. The lowest cell viability was detected at the highest concentrations of copper (500 mu M.ml(-1) and 1000 mu M.ml(-1)), which was probably caused by the high toxicity of these concentrations and the cell was no longer able to resist them. These concentrations may lead to reproductive toxicity, which can be strongly reflected in the process of spermatogenesis.","[Knazicka, Z.; Tvrda, E.; Lukac, N.; Forgacs, Z.; Kerti, A.] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Biotechnol & Food Sci, Dept Anim Physiol, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak Agricultural Research Center; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Knazická, Z (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Biotechnol & Food Sci, Dept Anim Physiol, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",zuzanaknazicka25@gmail.com,"Lukac, Norbert/J-1427-2019; Tvrda, Eva/AAC-5711-2019","Lukac, Norbert/0000-0002-4565-2083; Tvrda, Eva/0000-0003-2895-1249",,,,,24,2,2,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,888,898,,,,,,11,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341786800117,0

This paper adds to the literature by examining the effect of MLDA evasion across states with different alcohol restrictions. Using state-of-the-art GIS software and micro-data on fatal vehicle accidents from 1977 to 2002, we find that in counties within 25 miles of a lower-MLDA jurisdiction, a legal restriction on drinking does not reduce youth involvement in fatal accidents and, for 18 and 19-year-old drivers, fatal accident involvement actually increases. Farther from such a border, we find results consistent with the previous literature that MLDA restrictions are effective in reducing accident fatalities. The estimates imply that, of the total reduction in teenager-involved fatalities due to the equalization of state MLDAs at 21 in the 1970s and 1980s, for 18-year olds between a quarter and a third and for 19-year olds over 15 percent was due to equalization. Furthermore, the effect of changes in the MLDA is quite heterogeneous with respect to the fraction of a state's population that need not travel far to cross a border to evade its MLDA. Our results imply the effect of lowering the MLDA in select states, such as has been proposed in Vermont, could lead to sizeable increases in teenage involvement in fatal accidents due to evasion of local alcohol restrictions.

Each household faces an individual constraint on its participation in the asset market. In related literature, the constraint is described by a function whose sole argument is the asset portfolio. On the contrary, in our analysis the constraint depends not only on the asset portfolio, but also on asset and good prices-hence the reference to endogenous (in contrast to exogenous) in the title. Economies are described by endowments of commodities, utility functions, asset yield matt-ices, and restriction functions. We study two specifications of the constraint function. The first one is homogeneous of degree zero with respect to spot prices. The second one does not exhibit that property. We then consistently distinguish between homogeneous and nonhomogeneous economies. After having established existence of equilibria for both types of economies, we study indeterminacy for each of them and show the following results. For an open and dense subset of the set of homogeneous economies, equilibria are finite and regular, up to innocuous price normalizations. There exists an open and nonempty set of nonhomogeneous economies, whose associated equilibria exhibit real indeterminacy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using data on the universe of deliveries in Florida and New York over a 15-year period, we examine why treatment styles differ across obstetricians at a point in time and why styles change over time. We find that variation in c-section rates across physicians within a market is about twice as large as variation between markets. Surprisingly, residency programs explain no more than four percent of the variation in physicians' risk-adjusted c-section rates, even among newly trained physicians. Although we find evidence that physicians learn from their peers, they do not substantially revise their prior beliefs regarding treatment due to the local exchange of information. Our results indicate that physicians are not likely to converge over time to a community standard; thus, within-market variation in treatment styles is likely to persist. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

FDA's draft guidance on patient reported outcome (PRO) measures states that a clear description of the conceptual framework of an instrument is useful for evaluating its adequacy to support a treatment benefit claim for use in product labeling the draft guidance, however does not propose tools for establishing or evaluationg a PRO instrument's conceptual framework. Methods: We draw from our review of PRO concepts and instruments that appear in prescription drug labeling approved in the United States from 1997 to 2007. Results: We propose taxonomy terms that define relationships between PRO concepts, including family, compound concept, and singular concept. Based on the range of complexity represented by the concepts, as defined by the taxonomy, we propose nine instrument orders for PRO measurement. The nine orders range from individual event counts to multiitem, multiscale instruments. Conclusion: This analysis of PRO concepts and instruments illustrates that the taxonomy and hierarchy are applicable to PRO concepts across a wide range of therapeutic areas and provide a basis for defining the instrument conceptual framework complexity. Although the utility of these tools in the drug development, review, and approval processes has not yet been demonstrated, these tools could be useful to improve communication and enhance efficiency in the instrument development and review process.","[Erickson, Pennifer] OLGA, State Coll, PA USA; [Willke, Richard] Pfizer Inc, Global Outcomes Res, Peapack, NJ USA; [Burke, Laurie] US FDA, Study Endpoints & Labeling, Off New Drugs, Ctr Drug Evaluat & Res, Silver Spring, MD USA",Pfizer; US Food & Drug Administration (FDA),"Erickson, P (通讯作者)，Penn State Coll Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, 1316 Deerfield Dr, State Coll, PA 16803 USA.",pae6@psu.edu,,,,,,,46,13,14,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,8,,,,,1158,1167,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00609.x,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,515TH,19744289.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271495300017,0

This study tests empirically this claim using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The sample includes nine European countries: Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. For specialist consultation, we find that individuals with high education experience a reduction in waiting times of 68% in Spain, 67% in Italy and 34%. in France (compared with individuals with low education). Individuals With intermediate education report a waiting-time reduction of 74% in Greece (compared with individuals with low education). There is also evidence of a negative and significant association between education and waiting times for non-emergency surgery in Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden. High education reduces waits by 66, 32 and 48%, respectively. We also find income effects, although generally modest. An increase in income of 10 000 Euro reduces waiting times for specialist consultation by 8% in Germany and waiting times for non-emergency surgery by 26% in Greece. Surprisingly, all increase in income of 10 000 Euro increases waits by 11% in Sweden.

Methods: An existing Markov model was adapted to Korea to predict long-term outcomes over a 5-year time horizon and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of galantamine for the treatment of AD. The model structure is informed by a review of national and international literature oil the clinical and cost-effectiveness of galantamine and oil the costs and outcomes associated with treatment for AD. The main Outcome measure used was the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. All costs were indexed to US$ (2007 value). Multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis were undertaken to assess uncertainty in the results. Results: The study findings indicate that the clinical benefits on AD progression from galantamine treatment resulted in all incremental Cost per QALY gained of US$4939 over 5 years (vs. usual care). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and cost-effectiveness acceptability curve suggest that the probability of galantamine treatment having an incremental cost per QALY over US$6740 is zero. Incremental cost per QALY gained according to scenario analyses ranged from US$2271 to US$833S. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the use of galantamine may be a cost-effective use of Korean national health-care resources, considering the gross domestic product per capita of US$21,695 in 2007.","[Suh, Guk-Hee] Hallym Univ, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Seoul 150030, South Korea",Hallym University,"Suh, GH (通讯作者)，Hallym Univ, Med Ctr, Hangang Sacred Heart Hosp, 94-200 Yeongdeungpo Dong, Seoul 150030, South Korea.",suhgh@chol.com,,,,,,,43,10,11,0,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,,,,,,S49,S54,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00627.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,524KG,20586982.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000272141600010,0

Narrowing of the no-trade price zone depends critically on the rectangularity of the belief structure, which, in the context of an MEU model, is a requirement of dynamic consistency in Machina's sense. Another important factor affecting the size of the no-trade price zone is the relative contribution of ambiguity in signals and ambiguity in posterior beliefs to the degree of prior ambiguity over market events.

Using many instruments leads to high asymptotic asymptotic efficiency but can cause high bias and/or variance in small samples. In this paper we develop and implement asymptotic mean square error (MSE) based criteria for instrument selection in estimation of conditional moment restriction models. The models we consider include various nonlinear simultaneous equations models with unknown heteroskedasticity. We develop moment selection criteria for the familiar two-step optimal GMM estimator (GMM), a bias corrected version, and generalized empirical likelihood estimators (GEL), that include the continuous updating estimator (CUE) as a special case. We also find that the CUE has lower higher-order variance than the bias-corrected GMM estimator, and that the higher-order efficiency of other GEL estimators depends on conditional kurtosis of the moments.

This paper presents new Australian evidence on the child health-income gradient. We use data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC), which involved two waves of data collection for children born between March 2003 and February 2004 (B-Cohort: 0-3 years), and between March 1999 and February 2000 (K-Cohort: 4-7 years). This data set allows us to test the robustness of some of the findings of the influential studies of Case et al. [Case, A., Lubotsky, D., Paxson, C., 2002. Economic status and health in childhood: the origins of the gradient. The American Economic Review 92 (5) 1308-1344] and Currie and Stabile [Currie, J., Stabile, M., 2003. Socioeconomic status and child health: why is the relationship stronger for older children. The American Economic Review 93 (5) 1813-1823], and a recent study by Currie et al. [Currie, A., Shields, M.A., Price, S.W., 2007. The child health/family income gradient: evidence from England. Journal of Health Economics 26 (2) 213-232]. The richness of the LSAC data set also allows us to conduct further exploration of the determinants of child health. Our results reveal an increasing income gradient by child age using similar covariates to Case et al. [Case, A., Lubotsky, D., Paxson, C., 2002. Economic status and health in childhood: the origins of the gradient. The American Economic Review 92 (5) 1308-1344]. However, the income gradient disappears if we include a rich set of controls. Our results indicate that parental health and, in particular, the mother's health plays a significant role, reducing the income coefficient to zero; suggesting an underlying mechanism that can explain the observed relationship between child health and family income. Overall, our results for Australian children are similar to those produced by Propper et al. [Propper, C., Rigg,J., Burgess, S., 2007. Child health: evidence on the roles of family income and maternal mental health from a UK birth cohort. Health Economics 16 (11) 1245-1269] on their British child cohort. (C) 2009 Elsevier BY.

A stated preference discrete-choice experiment was conducted among 1198 women with a confirmed pregnancy of less than 13 weeks gestation, who had been diagnosed with either an incomplete miscarriage or missed miscarriage/early fetal demise and who had been recruited as part of a randomized controlled trial (miscarriage treatment [MIST] trial) comparing expectant, medical, and surgical miscarriage. Six attributes, each with three or four levels, were used in the statistical design. An orthogonal main effects design was generated (i.e., a design where the attributes are independent of each other) and the choice sets devised according to the principles of minimum overlap and level balance. A cost attribute was included to allow estimation of willingness to pay (WTP) values. Three different questionnaires were designed such that women were asked their preferences for attributes of the two management options they had not been allocated to in the trial. A total of 630 women completed the stated preference discrete-choice survey questionnaires: 189 out of 398 women (47.5%) allocated to expectant management, 223 out of 398 women (56.0%) allocated to medical management, and 218 out of 402 women (54.2%) allocated to surgical management. For each of the three discrete-choice survey questionnaires, women expressed a clear preference for decreased levels of all six attributes (time spent at the hospital receiving treatment, level of pain experienced, number of days of bleeding after treatment, time taken to return to normal activities after treatment, cost of treatment to women, and chance of complications requiring more time or readmission to hospital). For each of the three discrete-choice survey questionnaires, the highest valued attribute in terms of WTP was for a reduction in pain levels followed by time taken to return to normal activities after treatment. On aggregate, surgical management was valued more highly than expectant and medical management by women allocated to medical and expectant management, respectively, and medical management was valued more highly than expectant management by women allocated to surgical management. This held true regardless of the application of either hypothetical data for each attribute generated by the pretrial-designed discrete-choice experiment questionnaires or actual data for each attribute observed in the MIST trial. The preference results generated by this study suggest that many women undergoing management of first-trimester miscarriage would value being offered alternatives to expectant management. The data from this study should be considered by decision-makers in conjunction with the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence base in this area as well as consideration of the budgets available to them for such services.","[Petrou, Stavros; McIntosh, Emma] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Dept Publ Hlth, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Petrou, Stavros] Univ Oxford, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Dept Publ Hlth, Oxford OX3 7LF, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Petrou, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Dept Publ Hlth, Old Rd Campus,Old Rd, Oxford OX3 7LF, England.",stavros.petrou@dphpc.ox.ac.uk,"McIntosh, Emma J/AAC-7255-2019; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021","McIntosh, Emma J/0000-0003-2552-9173; Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; McIntosh, Emma/0000-0001-6340-3083",Medical Research Council [G0501681] Funding Source: Medline; Department of Health Funding Source: Medline; MRC [G0501681] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0501681] Funding Source: researchfish,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Department of Health; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,38,30,31,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4,,,,,551,559,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00459.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,18798807.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000266467800022,0

Second, the obesity gradient widens over the lifecycle, consistent with research oil other health Outcomes. Third, a Substantial portion of the effect of early life conditions operates through race/ethnicity and the translation of advantaged Family backgrounds during Childhood into higher levels of subsequent education. By contrast, little of the SES gap appears to propagate through household composition, family income or health behaviors.

To account for the endogeneity of health outcomes and their interactions with risky behaviors we exploit natural variation within a set of genetic markers across individuals. We present evidence that specific genetic markers have good statistical properties to identify the impacts of ADHD, depression and obesity. These markers help reveal a new dynamism from poor health to lower academic achievement with substantial heterogeneity in their impacts across genders. Our investigation further exposes the considerable challenges in identifying health impacts due to the prevalence of comorbid health conditions, with clear implications for the health economics literature.

Even though there are many partial answers to this question, an answer that stands comparison to the rigor by which the first and second welfare theorems are derived is lacking. We first prove a Folk Theorem on the generic suboptimality of equilibria at non-competitive prices, The more interesting problem is whether equilibria are constrained optimal, i.e. efficient relative to all allocations that are consistent with prices at which trade takes place. We discuss an optimality notion due to Benassy, and argue that this notion admits no general conclusions. We then turn to the notion of p-optimality and give a necessary condition, called the separating property, for constrained optimality: each constrained household should be constrained in each constrained market. If the number of commodities is less than or equal to two, the case usually treated in the textbook, then this necessary condition is also sufficient. In that case equilibria are constrained optimal. When there are three or more commodities, two or more constrained households, and two or more constrained markets, this necessary condition is typically not sufficient and equilibria are generically constrained suboptimal.

In contrast to most previous attempts to do so, it uses a P risk-free method that corresponds well to the risk-free properties of the TTO-method. In addition, the method is robust to several biases that Occur under methods that incorporate risk. Our results show a significant degree of curvature in utility of life duration and therefore a clear bias in TTO-scores. The risk-free method seems to be useful to correct TTO-scores for this influence and leads to significantly higher quality-adjustment factors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Sustainability primarily refers to a bio-physical environment that is not a risk, which can provide the necessary support system for both plant and human habitat involving the earth's lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere. However, that alone will not provide the necessary protection, since our human habitat must also be safe and secure. A more operable term should be resilient, rather than sustainable, since a climate positive community, with an on-site CO2 emission near zero, does not mean the population is protected from both natural and manmade disasters. Effective neoteric planning of our biosphere is necessary as it involves spatial, temporal, and sensory aspects of the community habitat. Two-dimensional planning that addresses just the surface (e.g., land), fails to be comprehensive, since both aerial and subsurface features are omitted. Effective neoteric planning of our biosphere is necessary as it involves spatial, temporal, and sensory aspects of the community habitat. Two-dimensional planning that addresses just the surface (e.g., land), is not comprehensive, since aerial and subsurface features are omitted. A three dimensional approach is needed, which involves the combination of the x, y and z axis, in order to be spatially accurate. Our personal transportation based mobility systems, along with its accompanying infrastructure, has resulted in a drive-thru society that is becoming supersized. Urban obesity in terms of modes of transport and today's living environment has resulted in McMansions and mega-vehicles have created an energy demand that if unchecked could create a carhenge by the year 3000. Infrastructure gridlock besides global warming is costing the world's economy, approximately 6% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Impaired global mobility which threatens our biosphere is costing approximately $2.5-$4.0 trillion dollars annually. There are solutions that can insure resilience only if society collectively addresses natural disasters, human disasters, and smart sustainable resilient infrastructure. A Global Center for Preparedness (GCP) can be a potential construct that can be collectively used to address the problem, providing necessary integrated solutions. Computer simulation can be a tool to envision the problem and the optional approaches. Both the Fusion Theater and the DREAMS Suite are facilitating technologies to assist in providing solutions. Where this is no vision the people perish, so a reliable integrated systems approach offers considerable promise. The ultimate goal is to preserve and enhance the physical, economic, and social integrity of the United States and the global community by air, land, sea, and space.","[Bragdon, Clifford R.] Florida Inst Technol, Strateg Initiat, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",Florida Institute of Technology,,cbragdon@fit.edu,,,,,,,9,2,2,1,31,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-0694-0,AIP CONF PROC,,,2009,1157.0,,,,,,184,200,,,,,,17,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BLH26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000270167600022,0

We focused on the effect of household enrollment in SP on pregnant women's access to obstetrical services, an important outcome measure of both maternal and infant health. Data: We relied upon data from the cross-sectional 2006 National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT) in Mexico. We analyzed the responses of 3890 women who delivered babies during 2001-2006 and whose households lacked employer-based health care coverage. Methods: We formulated a multinominal probit model that distinguished between three mutually exclusive sites for delivering a baby: a health unit specifically accredited by SP: a non-SP-accredited clinic run by the Department of Health (Secretaria de Salud, or SSA); and private obstetrical Care. Our model accounted for the endogeneity of the household's binary decision to enroll in the SP program. Results: Women in households that participated in the SP program had a much stronger preference for having a baby in a SP-sponsored unit rather than paying out of pocket for a private delivery. At the same time, participation in SP was associated with a stronger preference for delivering in the private sector rather than at a state-run SSA clinic. On balance, L the Seguro Popular program reduced pregnant women's attendance at an SSA clinic much more than it reduced the probability of delivering a baby in the private sector. The quantitative impact of the SP program varied with the woman's education and health, as well as the assets and location (rural vs. urban) of the household. Conclusions: The SP program had a robust, significantly positive impact on access to obstetrical services. Our finding that women enrolled in SP switched from non-SP state-run facilities, rather than from out-of-pocket private services, is important for public policy and requires further exploration.

For enhancing the bit security of the shared secret in the standard model, a cryptographic hash function is used to derive a symmetric key from the sum of all the elliptic curve points in a block triangular matrix. Oriented to real-time network applications, the sender can encrypt bulk data prior to agreeing upon a shared key with the receiver. Analysis indicates that besides several desirable security properties against active attacks specific to general elliptic curve cryptosystems, this system can get larger key spaces flexibly without having to increase the underlying elliptic curve and save the computational requirements inherent to the regeneration and revalidation of elliptic curves.","[Yang, Jun] SW Univ Nationalities, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China",Southwest Minzu University,,junyang898@163.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,ALFRED UNIV,ALFRED,"ONE SAXON DR, ALFRED, NY 14802 USA",,,978-0-9800510-2-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2987,2992,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJZ06,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267479301148,0

The existing researches mainly focus on task and contextual performance of employees. Little attention has been paid to their learning and innovative performance. As a result, it is difficult to measure the job performance for an individual in a systematic way. A structural model of evaluating the job performance of managers of the resource-rich enterprises is proposed in this paper, which integrates task performance, contextual performance, learning performance and innovative performance and combines the theories of organizational citizenship behavior, extra-role behavior performance, task and contextual performance, Campbell high sequence performance, as well as learning and innovative performance. The job performance scale of managers is also developed. They are used to evaluate the job performance of managers for the Thirteen Mine of Pingdingshan Tianan Coal Mining Co., LTD.

Our parametrization provides an interpretable role for each parameter. We derive moments and moment-based measures: skewness, kurtosis, expected shortfall. It is demonstrated that a maximum entropy property holds for the AEPD distributions. We establish consistency, asymptotic normality and efficiency of the maximum likelihood estimators over a large part of the parameter space by dealing with the problems created by non-smooth likelihood function and derive explicit analytical expressions of the asymptotic covariance matrix; where the results apply to the SEPD class they enlarge on the current literature. Also we give a convenient stochastic representation of the distribution; our Monte Carlo study illustrates the theoretical results.

The Preference and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) was developed to assess preference, satisfaction, and bother with a weekly oral tablet versus a once every 6 months subcutaneous injection for treatment of postmenopausal bone loss. Methods: Questions were developed based on literature review and expert input. Content validity of the PSQ in this patient population was assessed among current or previous bisphosphonate users in group interviews, and item comprehension and readability were also evaluated. Reliability, validity, and structure of the questionnaire were assessed in two phase 3 randomized clinical trials. Results: Twenty-four women participated in cognitive interviews and found the PSQ understandable and acceptable. Subsequently, 1583 trial participants took the PSQ. Interitem correlations, ranging from 0.50 to 0.97 for preference items, 0.85 to 0.94 for pill-satisfaction items, and 0.84 to 0.92 for injection-satisfaction items, and a well-fitting confirmatory factor analysis (root mean square error of approximation 0.04, nonnormed fit index 0.99, and root mean square residual 0.08) supported the structure of the instrument. Cronbach's alpha reliability values for pill satisfaction, injection satisfaction, pill bother, and injection bother were 0.93, 0.89, 0.82, and 0.61, respectively. Discriminative validity was indicated with better satisfaction and bother scores being related to adherence and the absence of adverse events. Conclusions: The PSQ is a valid and reliable measure and may be a valuable tool to assess patient preference and satisfaction with a weekly oral tablet and 6-month subcutaneous injection for postmenopausal bone loss.","[Gold, Deborah T.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Study Aging & Human Dev, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Horne, Rob] Univ London, Sch Pharm, London WC1N 1AX, England; [Coon, Cheryl D.; Price, Mark A.] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Borenstein, Jeff; Satram-Hoang, Sacha; Macarios, David] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Varon, Sepideh F.] ALLERGAN, Irvine, CA USA",Duke University; University of London; University College London; University of London School of Pharmacy; Research Triangle Institute; Amgen; AbbVie; Allergan,"Gold, DT (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Study Aging & Human Dev, Box 3003, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",dtg@geri.duke.edu,"Horne, Rob/C-6000-2009","Horne, Robert/0000-0002-3068-8438; Satram, Sacha/0000-0002-6169-7855; Price, Mark/0000-0002-9831-4328","Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA; Amgen; Sanofi-aventis; Roche Diagnostics; Eli Lilly; Novartis; Procter Gamble; Gilead Life Sciences; Hayward Medical Communications/Shire Pharmaceuticals; Berlex Laboratories, Inc.; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0510-10197] Funding Source: researchfish","Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA(Amgen); Amgen(Amgen); Sanofi-aventis(Sanofi-Aventis); Roche Diagnostics; Eli Lilly(Eli Lilly); Novartis(Novartis); Procter Gamble(Procter & Gamble); Gilead Life Sciences(Gilead Sciences); Hayward Medical Communications/Shire Pharmaceuticals; Berlex Laboratories, Inc.; National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR))","Source of financial support: Funding for this research was provided by Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.

Methods: We tested a two-step method. In the first, a longitudinal mixed-effects model was estimated on blood pressures abstracted from medical charts. In the second, the patient-specific fitted values from this model at follow-up were used to impute blood pressures missing at follow-up in the trial. Simulations that imposed alternative missing data mechanisms on observed trial data were used to compare this approach to imputation approaches that do not incorporate data from charts. Results: For data that are missing at random, incorporating the fitted values from chart-based longitudinal models leads to estimates of the trial-based blood pressures that are unbiased and have lower mean squared deviation than do blood pressures imputed without the chart-based data. For data that are missing not at random, incorporating fitted values ameliorates but does not eliminate the inherent missing data bias. Conclusions: Incorporating chart data into an imputation algorithm via the use of longitudinal mixed-effects model is an efficient way to impute longitudinal data that are missing from a randomized trial.","[Hebert, Paul L.; Taylor, Leslie T.; Bergman, Margo A.] NW Ctr Outcomes Res Older Adults, VA Puget Sound Hlth Care Syst, Dept Vet Affairs, Seattle, WA USA; [Wang, Jason J.] Primary Care Informat Project, Dept Hlth & Mental Hyg, New York, NY USA; [Hebert, Paul L.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Hlth Policy, New York, NY USA",US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Vet Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"Hebert, PL (通讯作者)，1100 Olive Way,Suite 1400, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",Paul.Hebert2@va.gov,"Bergman, Margo/AAQ-5143-2021; Bergman, Margo/AAR-6917-2021","Bergman, Margo/0000-0003-4768-4588; Bergman, Margo/0000-0003-4768-4588","National Institutes of Health, National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities [1P60MD000270-01]","National Institutes of Health, National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD))","Source of financial support: This work was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities (1P60MD000270-01).

The aim of this paper is to examine the mechanisms that might account for observed intergenerational associations in health outcomes. Using data from Vietnam, this study analyzes intergenerational correlations in height, a measure of long-run health status, between parents and their children. Insights from biology and economics are used to motivate several strategies that collectively provide insight on the role and importance of different mechanisms. The results illustrate strong intergenerational associations in height, which remain stable with the inclusion of controls for parent and household characteristics. Maternal height is more strongly associated with the heights of boys than girls, while the associations with paternal height are similar across genders. The use of conditions faced by parents early in life as instruments for their height yields significantly larger estimates of the mother-child height association relative to OLS, while the estimated father-child associations move to zero. These results, in conjunction with those from several other tests, illustrate that non-genetic factors are important in determining parent-child associations in height, and more speculatively, that epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role. These findings illustrate the value of investments in early childhood, as these may confer intergenerational benefits.

Methods: The following four treatment pathways are compared in a Markov model: tamoxifen treatment; CYP2D6 test and treat homozygous and heterozygous wild type patients (wt/wt; wt/*4) with tamoxifen and *4/*4 patients with anastrozole (HetTam); CYP2D6 test and treat homozygous wild type patients with tamoxifen and others with anastrozole (HomTam); and anastrozole treatment. Pharmacogenetic testing efficacy is estimated by synthesizing randomized controlled trial data comparing tamoxifen to anastrozole with observational data linking CYP2D6 genotype to tamoxifen outcomes. Results: In order of increasing effectiveness the comparators are tamoxifen, HetTam, HomTam, anastrozole. Health outcomes for test and treatment strategies are highly uncertain. Differences in comparator costs depend on assumptions made regarding anastrozole patent expiry. The expected value of a decision taken with perfect information is 69 pound to 106 pound million (pound sterling) for the United Kingdom depending on patent expiry assumptions and the acceptable cost-effectiveness threshold. The most valuable research (VOI 53- pound 82 pound million) elucidates the relationship between CYP2D6 genotype and tamoxifen effectiveness. It is uncertain whether values of other research designs would exceed their costs. Conclusions: Retrospective analysis of one of the large adjuvant aromatase inhibitor trials is warranted to better understand any association between CYP2D6 genotype and tamoxifen outcomes. VOI approaches may be helpful for prioritising evidence needs and structuring coverage with evidence development agreements for pharmacogenetics.","[Woods, Beth; Hawkins, Neil] Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Oxford OX2 0JJ, England; [Veenstra, David] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hawkins, Neil] Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of York - UK,"Woods, B (通讯作者)，Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Seacourt Tower,West Way, Oxford OX2 0JJ, England.",beth.woods@oxfordoutcomes.com,,"Hawkins, Neil/0000-0003-3199-221X; Woods, Bethan Sarah/0000-0002-7669-9415",Roche Diagnostics; Center for Genomics and Healthcare Equality at the University of Washington (NIH) [P50HG003374],Roche Diagnostics; Center for Genomics and Healthcare Equality at the University of Washington (NIH),"Source of financial support: Funding for developing the initial decision model was provided by Roche Diagnostics.

Using quality-of-care indicators, special emphasis is put on the measurement and the impact of physician quality. We find that age, health status, lifestyle, labour-force status, and the family structure are important determinants of the decision to get a flu shot. Physician quality, as measured by four indicators, also positively affects the probability of getting a flu shot.

Options may contain valuable information about this risk premium because their prices are sensitive to the underlying interest rates. We use the joint time series of swap rates and interest rate option prices to estimate dynamic term structure models. The risk premiums that we estimate using option prices are better able to predict excess returns for long-term swaps over short-term swaps. Moreover, in contrast to the previous literature, the most successful models for predicting excess returns have risk factors with stochastic volatility. We also show that the stochastic volatility models we estimate using option prices match the failure of the expectations hypothesis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We employ methods proposed in Altonji et al. (2005a) which use selection on observable traits to provide information regarding selection along unobservable factors. Among males, disorder is associated with reductions in labor force participation and employment. When selection on observed characteristics is set equal to selection on unobserved characteristics, the magnitudes of these effects for males are 9 and 14 percentage point reductions for participation and employment, respectively. Among females, we find negative associations between disorder and labor force participation and employment, but these estimates are more sensitive to assumptions about selection. There are no effects of disorder on earnings or hours worked among employed individuals. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We uncover robust evidence that educational expansion contributed to a decline in smoking prevalence of 2.9 points of percentage for men and 3.2 points for women at the turn of the 21st century. Our results also suggest that the persistence of the schooling-smoking gradient is better explained by differences in the education-related opportunity costs of smoking than by differences in information about smoking dangers.

The use of inappropriate baselines such as assuming the value of perfect health (EQ-5D = 1) for not having a condition may overestimate the benefits of some treatment and thus distort policy decisions informed by cost per quality adjusted life years thresholds. Objective: The primary objective was to determine if data from the general population are appropriate for baseline health state utility values (HSUVs) when condition specific data are not available. Methods: Data from four consecutive Health Surveys for England were pooled. Self-reported health status and EQ-5D data were extracted and used to generate mean HSUVs for cohorts with or without prevalent health conditions. These were compared with mean HSUVs from all respondents irrespective of health status. Results: More than 45% of respondents (n = 41,174) reported at least one condition and almost 20% reported at least two. Our results suggest that data from the general population could be used to approximate baseline HSUVs in some analyses, but not all. In particular, HSUVs from the general population would not be an appropriate baseline for cohorts who have just one condition. In these instances, if condition specific data are not available, data from respondents who report they do not have any prevalent health condition may be more appropriate. Exploratory analyses suggest the decrement on health-related quality of life may not be constant across ages for all conditions and these relationships may be condition specific. Additional research is required to validate our findings.","[Ara, Roberta; Brazier, John E.] Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Ara, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",r.m.ara@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",,,,,10,82,85,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2011,14.0,4,,,,,539,545,,10.1016/j.jval.2010.10.029,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BC,21669378.0,"Green Submitted, Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299080800019,0

We consider the controversy from the perspective of health inequalities and the assimilation of information, focusing on whether and how vaccine uptake behavior in the wake of the controversy differed among groups of parents by education and income. Using panel data on the variation in the uptake of the MMR, and other childhood immunizations, across local Health Authority areas we find that the uptake rate of the MMR declined faster in areas where a larger fraction of parents had stayed in education past the age of 18 than in areas with less educated parents. We also find that the same areas reduced their relative uptake of other uncontroversial childhood immunizations, suggesting a spillover effect. Using a supplementary data source we find evidence of a corresponding positive income effect, indicating that wealthier parents avoided the MMR dilemma by purchasing single vaccines.

Questions have been raised about whether simultaneous relationships between volume and mortality might have biased these analyses. We use two-stage least squares with Hospital Quality Alliance scores and estimated market size as instruments for mortality and volume to control for possible simultaneity. After this adjustment, it is still the case that specialty hospitals do not have an advantage over general hospitals in mortality rates after cardiac revascularization. We find evidence of simultaneity in the relationship between volume and mortality.

We propose that choice of frequently purchased food commodities, ceteris paribus, is based on a single dimension taste. We develop a set of hypotheses regarding the type of choice process to be employed in various information types and empirically test them in a field experiment design. Our results indicate that a single-dimension choice process is employed under a nonsevere message and a multidimensional process under high-intensity negative information. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Yaniv, G",,,,"Yaniv, Gideon",,,Workaholism and marital estrangement: A rational-choice perspective,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Workaholism; Marital estrangement; Marital breakdown; Marital capital; Rational addiction; Optimal control,ADDICTION,"Workaholism is an addiction to work. It is a major source of marital estrangement and breakdown as well as a severe threat to physical and psychological health. While addiction to harmful goods has gained considerable attention in the economic literature, addiction to work, with one recent exception, has totally escaped economists' notice, despite the growing concern with its devastating consequences. The present paper makes a second step in applying economic reasoning to this problem, developing a dynamic model of rational workaholism. The model demonstrates that it is not necessary for work to be addictive per se in order to exhibit an addictive pattern throughout which work intensity monotonically increases with time. Marital estrangement alone may inflame the desire for work, which in turn further exacerbates estrangement. The model determines the optimal intensity of work and quality of marriage for the workaholic over time, showing that even a happily married, forward-looking individual might be swept into an addictive course of excessive work that leads to marital breakdown.

The results show that the intervention into the feeding ration of mares resulted in a highly significant increase (P < 0.01) of copper content excreted in the dry matter of faeces and highly significant increase (P < 0.01) of copper content deposited in the dry matter of hair in mares receiving inorganic form of copper. The same results were achieved in the mares receiving the organic form of copper but in the significance level of 0.05. There was the difference (P < 0.05) in the content of copper in the blood plasma between the mares supplemented with different sources of copper.

We assume discrete distribution of monthly returns. As the basic assets, we consider ten representative US industry portfolios and a risk free asset.

Ecological regression technique [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] gives an opportunity to obtain quantitative description of electoral behaviour from aggregated data under homogeneity assumption. Aggregated data available from public statistics contains the information about individual voting behaviour indirectly only. Data aggregation bases usually on geographic units such as counties and constituencies. Regional decomposition is an estimation process, used for the description of a voter's behaviour. It extends ecological regression to larger regions or even for the whole country. For the case 2x2 (two consecutive elections, two parties) the results of econometric approach are almost obvious. For the case nx2 (two consecutive elections, n parties) the statistical approach is necessary. We suggest that in order to estimate the parameters of ecological regression, the combined regional decomposition of transition matrix and the maximum likelihood function can be used. Moreover, the assumption of random distribution of residuals is tested too.

But main papers in which this practice is advocated have missed a distinction between two quite different evaluation problems: (1) How much does the time of program occurrence matter for value and (2) how much do delays in health benefits from programs implemented at a given time matter? The papers have furthermore focused on logical and arithmetic arguments rather than on real value considerations. These 'consistency arguments' are at best trivial, at worst logically flawed. At the end of the day, there is a sensible argument for equal discounting of costs and benefits rooted in microeconomic theory of rational, utility maximising consumers' saving behaviour. But even this argument is problematic, first because the model is not clearly supported by empirical observations of individuals' time preferences for health, second because it relates only to evaluation in terms of overall individual utility. It does not provide grounds for claiming that decision makers with a wider societal perspective, which may include concerns for fair distribution, need to discount health benefits and costs equally. This applies even if health benefits are measured in monetary terms.

No studies have addressed changes in utility in patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP). This study sought to assess the health utilities of patients with chronic ITP and to evaluate the association of change in health utility with changes in other variables, including platelet response status and bleeding events. Methods: We analyzed EQ-5D data from two international, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 24-week trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of romiplostim in adult patients with chronic ITP. Results: A total of 125 subjects participated. Mean change, adjusted for age, gender, splenectomy status, and baseline score using multiple linear regression models was greater for romiplostim versus placebo for the EQ-5D index score (0.05 vs. -0.03, P = 0.015) and the VAS score (6.42 vs. 0.48, P = 0.066); similar for durable platelet responders versus nonresponders; and greater for EQ-5D index scores for subjects who did not have a bleeding event during the study (n = 29) compared to subjects who did have a bleeding event (n = 47) (0.06 vs. 0.005; P = 0.066). Conclusions: Using romiplostim in cases of chronic ITP was associated with improvement in health-related quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D index score. Health utility scores derived using the EQ-5D in this study may be useful for determining quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in economic evaluations of romiplostim for treatment of chronic ITP.

There exist several possible approaches. One oft hem is the analysis of sequence of block maxima. As we assume that the series has a trend, we first select a proper regression model for the block maxima development. From it, a Markov chain of the sequence of extremes is derived. As the transition probabilities of the chain are not tractable analytically, we use the Monte Carlo generation of the chain behavior. Then, from the sample representing the series of block maxima development we obtain a representation of corresponding predictive distribution. Finally, we shall apply such a method to real data.","[Volf, Petr] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, CR-18208 Prague 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,,volf@utia.cas.cz,"Volf, Petr/AAL-7007-2021; Volf, Petr/E-8320-2013","Volf, Petr/0000-0001-5673-6066;",,,,,7,0,0,0,2,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRUHONICE,"NA SIDLISTI 152, PRUHONICE, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,751,756,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309074600125,0

For each observed database of cases the decision maker predicts a set of priors expressing his beliefs about the underlying probability distribution. We impose a version of the concatenation axiom introduced in Billot et al. (2005) which ensures that the sets of priors can be represented as a weighted sum of the observed frequencies of cases. The weights are the uniquely determined similarities between the observed cases and the case under investigation. The predicted probabilities, however, may vary with the number of observations. This generalization of Billot et al. (2005) allows one to model learning processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We show that firms' incentives to share this type of information are aligned with social welfare. Whenever revealing information is the dominant strategy (such as for Cournot firms revealing costs or Cournot and Bertrand firms revealing demand), it is socially beneficial. Only cost information in Bertrand competition will not be revealed but this is socially desirable, too. These findings are independent of distributional assumptions on random shocks and signals and hold for general asymmetric oligopoly with any mixture of substitute, complementary and independent goods.

These measures can be decomposed into the sum of the usual within-group and a between-group term which is based on the inequality between all pairs of individuals belonging to the groups involved. The measures therefore depend on the inequality index for two-person distributions and are proportional to the total sum of the inequality values between all pairs of individuals. Extending Gini's mean difference, the Gini coefficient, and the variance of logarithms we characterize three families of measures. By choosing other basic measures further (families of) weakly decomposable measures can be defined. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The conditions are necessary and sufficient for p = 1 and sufficient for p >= 2 and emerge as natural extensions of the inequality constraints derived in Nelson and Cao (1992) and Tsai and Chan (2008) for the GARCH model and in Conrad and Haag (2006) for the FIGARCH model. As a by-product we obtain a representation of the ARCH(infinity) coefficients which allows computationally efficient multi-step-ahead forecasting of the conditional variance of a HYGARCH process. We also relate the necessary and sufficient parameter set of the HYGARCH to the necessary and sufficient parameter sets of its GARCH and FIGARCH components. Finally, we analyze the effects of erroneously fitting a FIGARCH model to a data sample which was truly generated by a HYGARCH process. Empirical applications of the HYGARCH( 1, d, 1) model to daily NYSE and DAX30 data illustrate the importance of our results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The aim is to investigate whether even for narrowly defined health measures a divergence exists in the impacts of health on retirement between self-reported health and objective physician-reported health. Our sample consists of older workers and retirees drawn from a Danish panel survey from 1997 and 2002, merged to longitudinal register data. Estimation of measurement error-reduced and selection-corrected pooled OLS and fixed effects models of retirement show that receiving a medical diagnosis is an important determinant of retirement planning for both men and women, in fact more important than economic factors. The type of diagnosis matters, however. For men, the largest reduction in planned retirement age occurs for a diagnosis of lung disease while for women it occurs for musculo-skeletal disease. Except for cardiovascular disease, diagnosed disease is more influential in men's retirement planning than in women's. Our study provides evidence that men's self-report of myalgia and back problems and women's self-report of osteoarthritis possibly yield biased estimates of the impact on planned retirement age, and that this bias ranges between 1.5 and 2 years, suggesting that users of survey data should be wary of applying self-reports of health conditions with diffuse symptoms to the study of labor market outcomes. On the other hand, self-reported cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure does not appear to bias the estimated impact on planned retirement.

In practice, such decisions are often made by applying a fixed cutoff to the maximum likelihood estimate of a parametric model of the default probability. Following (Elliott and Lieli, 2007), we argue that this practice might contradict the lender's economic objective and, using German loan data, we illustrate the use of context-specific cutoffs and an estimation method derived directly from the lender's problem. We also provide a brief discussion of how to incorporate legal constraints, such as the prohibition of disparate treatment of potential borrowers, into the lender's problem. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The theoretical foundation of this practice is being debated and appropriate discount rates for costs and health effects are sought. Here, we have derived social discount rates for health, money, and environmental benefits by means of a choice experiment. Methods: All choices were framed from a social perspective. We investigated differences in time preference by domain (health, monetary benefits, environmental benefits), time delay (5, 10, and 40 years), and respondent characteristics. Respondents were 173 health-care professionals and 34 health policymakers. Choice titration was used to determine when the respondent was indifferent between future and present benefits. Results: At least two-thirds of respondents preferred an intervention with immediate benefits to delayed benefits in the different domains. The median (mean) yearly discount rates for health benefits were 2.7% (10.7%), 1.3% (3.5%), and 1.1% (2.3%) assuming a 5, 10, and 40 years delay, respectively. Social time preference for monetary benefits was significantly stronger, with median (mean) yearly discount rates of 6.6% (18.7%) and 4.8% (11.2%) assuming a 5 and 10 years delay, respectively. The social time preference with regard to environmental benefits was similar to the monetary benefits. Social time preference for the different domains was significantly correlated at the individual level. Conclusions: The empirically derived social time preference is in line with current theoretical arguments for a lower discount rate for health benefits than for monetary benefits. Moreover, the implied median discount rates for health were lower than those commonly used or advocated in guidelines.","[Meerding, Willem Jan; Stuifbergen, Marja C.; Essink-Bot, Marie-Louise] Erasmus MC, Dept Publ Hlth, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bonsel, Gouke J.; Brouwer, Werner B.

Muslims nevertheless exhibit substantially higher child survival rates, and have done for decades. This paper analyses this seeming puzzle. A decomposition of the survival differential confirms that some compositional effects favour Muslims but that, overall, differences in characteristics and especially the Muslim deficit in parental education predict a Muslim disadvantage. The results of this study contribute to a recent literature that debates the importance of socioeconomic status (SES) in determining health and survival. They augment a growing literature on the role of religion or culture as encapsulating important unobservable behaviours or endowments that influence health, indeed, enough to reverse the SES gradient that is commonly observed.

Hypertension and, in particular diabetes, are significant contributors to the global burden of chronic kidney disease. Although it might increase costs, screening for, and improved management of, persons at increased risk of progressive kidney disease could improve health outcomes. We therefore sought to estimate the costs and health outcomes of alternative strategies to prevent end-stage kidney disease, compared with usual care. Methods: A Markov model comparing: 1) intensive management versus usual care for patients with suboptimally managed diabetes and hypertension; and 2) screening for and intensive treatment of diabetes, hypertension, and proteinuria versus usual care was developed. Intervention effectiveness was based on published meta-analyses and randomized controlled trial data; costs were measured from a central health-care funder perspective in 2008 Australian dollars ($A), and outcomes were reported in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: Intensive treatment of inadequately controlled diabetes was both less costly (an average lifetime saving of $A133) and more effective (with an additional 0.075 QALYs per patients) than conventional management. Intensive management of hypertension had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) $A2588 per QALY gained. Treating all known diabetics with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was both less costly (an average lifetime saving of $A825 per patient) and more effective than current treatment (resulting in 0.124 additional QALYs per patient). Primary care screening for 50- to 69-year-olds plus intensive treatment of diabetes had an ICER of $A13,781 per QALY gained. Primary care screening for hypertension (between ages 50 and 69 years) plus intensive blood pressure management had an ICER of $A491 per QALY gained. Primary care screening for proteinuria (between ages 50 and 69 years) combined with prescription of an ACE inhibitor for all persons showing proteinuria and all known diabetics had an ICER of $A4793 per QALY gained. Conclusions: Strategies combining primary care screening of 50- to 69-year-olds for proteinuria, diabetes, and hypertension followed by the routine use of ACE inhibitors, and optimal treatment of diabetes and hypertension, respectively, have the potential to reduce death and end-stage kidney disease and are likely to represent good value for money.","[Howard, Kirsten; Salkeld, Glenn; Craig, Jonathan C.] Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [White, Sarah; Cass, Alan] George Inst Int Hlth, Camperdown, NSW, Australia; [White, Sarah; Craig, Jonathan C.; Chadban, Steven; Cass, Alan] NHMRC Ctr Clin Res Excellence Renal Med, Westmead, NSW, Australia; [McDonald, Stephen; Chadban, Steven] Australia & New Zealand Dialysis & Transplant Reg, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [McDonald, Stephen] Queen Elizabeth Hosp, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Chadban, Steven] Royal Prince Alfred Hosp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Chadban, Steven] Univ Sydney, Cent Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Cass, Alan] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Poche Ctr Indigenous Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney; NSW Health; Royal Prince Alfred Hospital; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Howard, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Edward Ford Bldg,A27, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",kirstenh@health.usyd.edu.au,"Craig, Jonathan/E-2813-2013; McDonald, Stephen/G-4010-2013","Craig, Jonathan/0000-0002-2548-4035; McDonald, Stephen/0000-0001-6103-1386; Howard, Kirsten/0000-0002-0918-7540; Cass, Alan/0000-0002-3923-3173",NHMRC; Kidney Health Australia,NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Kidney Health Australia,"Special thanks to the ANZDATA Registry staff, in particular to Victoria Shtangey for her prompt and generous responses to data requests.

Methods: We reviewed the conceptual and empirical literature related to the valuing of diagnostic tests, and used this information to create a framework for characterizing their value. We then made inferences about the impact of this framework on health insurance coverage, health technology assessment, physician-patient relationships, and public health policy. Results: Three dimensions can effectively classify the potential value created by diagnostic tests: 1) medical value (impact on treatment decisions); 2) planning value (affect on patients' ability to make better life decisions); and 3) psychic value (how test information affects patients' sense of self). This comprehensive framework for valuing diagnostics suggests that existing health technology assessments may systematically under- or overvalue diagnostics, leading to potentially incorrect conclusions about cost-effectiveness. Further, failure to account for all value dimensions may lead to distorted payments under a value-based health-care system. Conclusions: The potential value created by medical diagnostics incorporates medical value as well as value associated with well-being and planning. Consideration of all three dimensions has important implications for technology assessment and value-based payment.","[Lee, David W.] GE Healthcare, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Waukesha, WI 53188 USA; [Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Ctr Hlth Serv & Outcomes Res, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",General Electric; Tufts University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Lee, DW (通讯作者)，GE Healthcare, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 3000 N Grandview Blvd,W-460, Waukesha, WI 53188 USA.",david.w.lee@ge.com,,,GE Healthcare,GE Healthcare(General ElectricGE Healthcare),Source of financial support: Research supported by GE Healthcare.

Two alternative non-parametric methods for estimating INB are to apply the central limit theorem (CLT) or to use the non-parametric bootstrap method, although it is unclear which method is preferable. This paper describes the statistical rationale underlying each of these methods and illustrates their application with a trial-based CEA. It compares the sampling uncertainty from using either technique in a Monte Carlo simulation. The experiments are repeated varying the sample size and the skewness of costs in the population. The results showed that, even when data were highly skewed, both methods accurately estimated the true standard errors (SEs) when sample sizes were moderate to large (n>50), and also gave good estimates for small data sets with low skewness. However, when sample sizes were relatively small and the data highly skewed, using the CLT rather than the bootstrap led to slightly more accurate SEs. We conclude that while in general using either method is appropriate, the CLT is easier to implement, and provides SEs that are at least as accurate as the bootstrap.

Despite its widespread use in developing countries, limited data exist on its cost-effectiveness in these settings. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ICD in CHF patients under the perspective of the Brazilian Public Healthcare System (PHS). Methods: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ICD compared with conventional therapy in patients with CHF and New York Heart Association class II and III. Effectiveness was evaluated in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and time horizon was 20 years. We searched MEDLINE for clinical trials and cohort studies to estimate data from effectiveness, complications, mortality, and utilities. Costs from the PHS were retrieved from national administrative databases. The model's robustness was assessed through Monte Carlo simulation and one-way sensitivity analysis. Costs were expressed as international dollars, applying the purchasing power parity conversion rate (PPP US$). Results: ICD therapy was more costly and more effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness estimates of PPP US$ 50,345/QALY. Results were more sensitive to costs related to the device, generator replacement frequency and ICD effectiveness. In a simulation resembling the MADIT-I population survival and ICD benefit, the ICER was PPP US$ 17,494/QALY and PPP US$ 15,394/life years. Conclusions: In a Brazilian scenario, where ICD cost is proportionally more elevated than in developed countries, ICD therapy was associated with a high cost-effectiveness ratio. The results were more favorable for a patient subgroup at increased risk of sudden death.","[Ribeiro, Rodrigo Antonini; Camey, Suzi Alves; Polanczyk, Carisi Anne] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Grad Program Epidemiol, BR-90035007 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Stella, Steffan Frosi; Zimerman, Leandro Ioschpe; Rohde, Luis Eduardo; Polanczyk, Carisi Anne] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Grad Program Cardiol, BR-90035007 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Polanczyk, Carisi Anne] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Natl Inst Hlth Technol Assessment IATS, Div Cardiol, BR-90035007 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Polanczyk, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Natl Inst Hlth Technol Assessment IATS, Div Cardiol, Rua Ramiro Barcelos 2350,Sala 2225, BR-90035007 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",cpolanczyk@hcpa.ufrgs.br,"Camey, Suzi Alves/Y-2756-2019; Ribeiro, Rodrigo Antonini/E-8352-2013; Pimentel, Mauricio/X-1303-2019; Rohde, Luis Eduardo/I-4216-2013; Polanczyk, Carisi CAP/D-6208-2013","Camey, Suzi Alves/0000-0002-5564-081X; Ribeiro, Rodrigo Antonini/0000-0003-3080-3704; Polanczyk, Carisi/0000-0002-2447-2577",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq),Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),Source of financial support: This project received financial support from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq).,,53,15,16,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2010,13.0,2,,,,,160,168,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00608.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,557KP,19725912.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274668300002,0

We recognize that there is a major gap between the use of statins in actual practice and treatment guidelines for dyslipidemia. Low adherence to statins may have a significant impact on clinical issues and health-care costs. The objective is to evaluate the impact of low Adherence to statins on clinical issues and direct health-care costs. Methods: A cohort of 55,134 patients newly treated with statins was reconstructed from the Regie de l'Assurance Maladie do Quebec and Med-Echo databases. Subjects included were aged between 45 and 85, initially free of cardiovascular disease, newly treated with statins between 1999 and 2002, and followed-up for a minimum of 3 years. Adherence to statins was measured in terms of the proportion of days' supply of medication dispensed over a defined period, and categorized as >= 80% or <80%. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of cardiovascular events between the two adherence groups was estimated using a polytomous logistic analysis. The mean costs of direct health-care services were evaluated. A two-part model was applied for hospitalization costs. Results: The mean high adherence level to statins was around to 96% during follow-tip; and this value was at 42% for the low adherence level. The patients with low adherence to statins were more likely to have coronary artery disease (OR 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.13), cerebrovascular disease (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.03-1.25), and chronic heart failure within 3-year period of follow-up (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.01-1.26). Low adherence to statins was also associated with an increased risk of hospitalization by 4% (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.09). Among patients who were hospitalized, low adherence to statins was significantly associated with increase of hospitalization costs by approximately $1060/patient for a 3-year period. Conclusion: Low adherence to statins was correlated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, hospitalization rate, and hospitalization costs. An increased level of adherence to statins agents should provide a better health status for individuals and a net economic gain.","[Dragomir, Alice; Lalonde, Lyne; Blais, Lucie; Berard, Anick; Perreault, Sylvie] Univ Montreal, Fac Pharm, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Cote, Robert] McGill Univ, Fac Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [White, Michel] Univ Montreal, Fac Med, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; McGill University; Universite de Montreal,"Perreault, S (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Fac Pharm, Case Postale 6128,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",sylvie.perreault@umontreal.ca,"Perreault, Sylvie/AAM-8009-2020","Perreault, Sylvie/0000-0002-0066-0127",Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"Financial support was received from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, but there are no relationships that might lead to conflicts of interest regarding this article.",,53,57,64,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2010,13.0,1,,,,,87,94,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00583.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,541PI,19695008.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000273429000016,0

This insect is a consumer of biological municipal waste (kitchen residues, food waste, peel the potatoes, grass,...). It was confirmed that breeding Hermetia illucens is possible in our conditions, and the setting of appropriate temperature and light conditions. Use of this insect is particularly suitable in terms of reducing the proportion of biodegradable municipal waste material. Reducing the proportion of biodegradable waste that can be applied to waste from the maintenance of public green spaces or where the agricultural and food production. Potential use of insect Hermetia illucens is high not only in waste management, but also in sectors where they try to prevent waste.","[Kalova, M.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agr Food & Environm Engn, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Borkovcova, M.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Zool Fisheries Hydrobiol & Apiculture, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Kalová, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agr Food & Environm Engn, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xkalova@node.mendelu.cz; borkov@mendelu.cz,,,,,,,6,1,2,2,13,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,524,527,,,,,,4,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341786800066,0

Today, few physical monuments remain of the 500 year existence of the Sephardic Jews in the Eastern Mediterranean. Istanbul, Turkey, is perhaps the city with the most numerous and well maintained Ottoman Jewish historical sites in the twenty-first century. But even there, the physical remains are fragmentaly in comparison to the contribution and longevity of the Jewish minority in the life of the quintessential Ottoman city. In Thessaloniki, the city called Salonika by the Jews, a city that once had the largest and most important Jewish presence in modern World History for over four centuries, Jewish heritage today largely remains hidden. Political upheavals and wars spawned by Balkan nationalisms, particularly in the past 100 years have in most cases obliterated any sign of Jewish existence save for a few communal buildings, some relocated cemetery stones, and performances staged to revitalize heritage for cultural tourists. Whereas the Ottoman political and social structure, viz., the millet system, provided a framework for the continuity and cultural survival of the Jews as Ottoman subjects, modern nationalisms excluded the contributions of minorities who did not easily fit into the homogeneous imaginary of each, dominant, political group's constructions of national identity. But heritage is not a static concept and the two case studies illustrate the contested space which it currently occupies.","[Sezgin, P.

Whether in debates around multiculturalism, dissonant heritage or the representation of traumatic memories, cultural heritage practitioners and scholars have argued for a practice of representation based on the representation of multiple voices. However, events such as 9/11, increasing ethnic tensions within Western countries and attempts to address 'difficult' pasts in war torn or post-colonial societies are beginning to lead to a different understanding of what might be entailed in building sustainable communities through cultural heritage. Taking recent critiques of multiculturalism and new work on theories of citizenship, I argue that the increasing governmental desire to build sustainable communities underpinned by a social cohesion agenda is slowly resulting in a cultural heritage practice which privileges matters of process rather than representation. This means that rather than focusing on the representation of cultural diversity through the rubric of identity, some museums and heritage sites are engaging with the problem of sustainable community building through a cross-cultural heritage practice. In this paper, I will look at two examples from Australia and analyze their implications for theories of citizenship.","[Witcomb, A.] Deakin Univ, Cultural Heritage Ctr Asia & Pacific, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Deakin University,,,"Witcomb, Andrea/P-3714-2016",,,,,,32,1,1,0,3,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,1247,1254,,,,,,8,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291664400137,0

An empirical application involving the conditional second moments of 69 selected stocks from the NASDAQ100 shows how the new procedure results in strikingly accurate measures of the conditional correlations.

IV models gained popularity in outcomes research because of their ability to consistently estimate the average causal effects even in the presence of unmeasured confounding. However, in order for this consistent estimation to be achieved, several conditions must hold. In this article, we provide an overview of the IV approach, examine possible tests to check the prerequisite conditions, and illustrate how weak instruments may produce inconsistent and inefficient results. Methods: We use two IVs and apply Shea's partial R-square method, the Anderson canonical correlation, and Cragg-Donald tests to check for weak instruments. Hall-Peixe tests are applied to see if any of these instruments are redundant in the analysis. Results: A total of 14,952 asthma patients from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database were examined in this study. Patient health care was provided under a variety of fee-for-service, fully capitated, and partially capitated health plans, including preferred provider organizations, point of service plans, indemnity plans, and health maintenance organizations. We used controller-reliever copay ratio and physician practice/prescribing patterns as an instrument. We demonstrated that the former was a weak and redundant instrument producing inconsistent and inefficient estimates of the effect of treatment. The results were worse than the results from standard regression analysis. Conclusion: Despite the obvious benefit of IV models, the method should not be used blindly. Several strong conditions are required for these models to work, and each of them should be tested. Otherwise, bias and precision of the results will be statistically worse than the results achieved by simply using standard OLS.","[Baser, Onur] STATinMED Res LLC, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Baser, Onur] Univ Michigan, Dept Surg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Baser, O (通讯作者)，STATinMED Res LLC, 218 N 4th Ave,Suite 205, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.",obaser@statinmed.com,,,,,,,56,18,24,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,8,,,,,1201,1209,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00567.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,515TH,19497084.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271495300023,0

Risk aversion with many commodities. journal of Economic Theory 8, 361-388; Kihlstrom, R., Mirman, L., 1981. Constant, increasing and decreasing risk aversion with many commodities. Review of Economic Studies 48, 271-280], we propose a dynamic consumption-savings-portfolio choice model in which the consumer-investor maximizes the expected value of a non-additively separable utility function of current and future consumption. Preferences for consumption streams are CES and the elasticity of substitution can be chosen independently of the risk aversion measure. The additively separable case is a special case. Because choices are not dynamically consistent, we follow the consistent planning approach of Strotz [Strotz, R., 1956. Myopia and inconsistency in dynamic utility maximization. Review of Economic Studies 23, 165-180] and also interpret our analysis from the game theoretic perspective taken by Peleg and Yaari [Peleg, B., Yaari, M., 1973. On the existence of a consistent course of action when tastes are changing. Review of Economic Studies 40, 391-401]. The equilibrium of the Lucas asset pricing model with i.i.d. consumption growth is obtained and the equity premium is shown to depend on the elasticity of substitution as well as the risk aversion measure. The nature of the dependence is examined. Our results are contrasted with those of the non-expected utility recursive approach of Epstein-Zin and Weil. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The benefits of collecting additional information on health economic outcomes before deciding on a preferred policy when evaluating alternative strategies with uncertain outcomes are quantified in a VOI analysis. In general, costs and effects are combined into one single dimension to determine the expected monetary VOI. Separate information on costs and effects is lost. This information, however, remains relevant to the decision-maker. The concept of the attributable VOI (AVOI) is introduced which enables separate presentation of expected changes in health outcomes and costs. Results: The use of the attributable expected value of perfect information is illustrated with a few examples. These examples demonstrate the benefits of the new approach, as well as its calculation. The benefits are: 1) insight into the expected costs and expected effects gained as a result of carrying out further research to reduce or eliminate decision uncertainty; and 2) the likelihood that the outcome of additional research will result in a change in preferred policy. Conclusions: Decision-making may be enhanced and clarified by adding results from AVOI analyses. Obtaining these results is straightforward and requires only a minimal computational effort. Therefore, use of the AVOI extension is recommended for all future VOI analyses.","[Janssen, Mart P.; Koffijberg, Hendrik] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Julius Ctr Hlth Sci & Primary Care, NL-3508 GA Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Utrecht University Medical Center,"Janssen, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Julius Ctr Hlth Sci & Primary Care, Str 6-131,POB 85-500, NL-3508 GA Utrecht, Netherlands.",m.p.janssen@umcutrecht.nl,"Janssen, Mart P/AFS-8628-2022","Janssen, Mart P/0000-0002-1682-7817; Koffijberg, Hendrik/0000-0002-1753-0652",NMB framework,NMB framework,"We would like to thank Ben van Hout for his strong views on the information loss within the NMB framework which was the seed for the work presented in this article.

Methods: The HEALTH model (Health Economic Assessment of Life with Teveten((R)) for Hypertension) is an object-oriented probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation model. It combines a Framingham-based risk calculation with a systolic blood pressure approach to estimate the relative risk reduction of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events based on recent meta-analyses. In secondary prevention, an additional risk reduction is modeled for eprosartan according to the results of the MOSES study (Morbidity and Mortality after Stroke-Eprosartan Compared to Nitrendipine for Secondary Prevention). Costs and utilities were derived from published estimates considering European country-specific health-care payer perspectives. Results: Comparing eprosartan to enalapril in a primary prevention setting the mean costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained were highest in Germany (24,036) followed by Belgium (17,863), the UK (16,364), Norway ( 13,834), Sweden ( 11,691) and Spain ( 7918). In a secondary prevention setting (eprosartan vs. nitrendipine) the highest costs per QALY gained have been observed in Germany (9136) followed by the UK (6008), Norway (1695), Sweden (907), Spain (-2054) and Belgium (-5767). Conclusions: Considering a 30,000 willingness-to-pay threshold per QALY gained, eprosartan is cost-effective as compared to enalapril in primary prevention (patients >= 50 years old and a systolic blood pressure >= 160 mm Hg) and cost-effective as compared to nitrendipine in secondary prevention (all investigated patients).","[Schwander, Bjoern] Analyt Int, Lorrach, Germany; [Gradl, Birgit; Zoellner, York] Solvay Pharmaceut, Hannover, Germany; [Lindgren, Peter] I3innovus, Stockholm, Sweden; [Diener, Hans-Christoph] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Neurol, Duisburg, Germany; [Lueders, Stephan; Schrader, Joachim] St Josefs Hosp, Cloppenburg, Germany; [Antonanzas Villar, Fernando] Univ la Rioja, La Rioja, Spain; [Greiner, Wolfgang] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; [Jonsson, Bengt] Stockholm Sch Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Solvay SA; University of Duisburg Essen; Universidad de La Rioja; University of Bielefeld; Stockholm School of Economics,"Gradl, B (通讯作者)，Solvay Pharmaceut Marketing & Licensing AG, Hegenheimermattweg 127, CH-4123 Allschwil, Switzerland.",birgit.gradl@solvay.com,"Diener, Hans-Christoph/AAF-7275-2019; Lindgren, Peter/AID-5379-2022; Antonanzas, Fernando/F-4610-2016","Lindgren, Peter/0000-0002-8238-8189; Luders, Stephan/0000-0003-3007-9015; Antonanzas, Fernando/0000-0001-6122-9130",,,,,112,11,13,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2009,12.0,6,,,,,857,871,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00507.x,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,474SP,19508663.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000268304600002,0

Methods: We conducted telephone interviews with 1745 parents whose children were between 2 and 18 years old and enrolled in the Florida KidCare program and Children's Medical Services Network in 2006. Two anchors, the Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) Screener and the Clinical Risk Groups (CRGs), were used to identify children with special health-care needs or chronic conditions. We established cutoff scores for the PedsQL's physical, emotional, social, school, and total functioning using the areas under the curves (AUCs) to determine the discriminative property of the PedsQL referring to the anchors. Results: The discriminative property of the PedsQL was superior, especially in total functioning (AUC > 0.7), between children with special health-care needs (based on the CSHCN Screener) and with moderate and major chronic conditions (based on the CRGs) as compared to healthy children. For children < 8 years, the recommended cutoff scores for using total functioning to identify CSHCN were 83, 79 for moderate, and 77 for major chronic conditions. For children >= 8 years, the cutoff scores were 78, 76, and 70, respectively. Conclusions: Pediatric HRQOL varied with health conditions. Establishing cutoff scores for the PedsQL's total functioning is a valid and convenient means to potentially identify children with special health-care needs or chronic conditions. The cutoff scores can help clinicians to conduct further in-depth clinical assessments.","[Huang, I-Chan; Thompson, Lindsay A.; Chi, Yueh-Yun; Knapp, Caprice A.; Shenkman, Elizabeth A.] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Thompson, Lindsay A.] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Revicki, Dennis A.] United BioSource Corp, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Res, Bethesda, MD USA; [Seid, Michael] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp, Med Ctr, Div Hlth Policy & Clin Effectiveness, Ctr Hlth Care Qual, Cincinnati, OH USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; United Biosource Corporation; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center,"Huang, IC (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Epidemiol & Hlth Policy Res, POB 100147, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",ichuang@ufl.edu,"Chi, Yueh-Yun/AAL-6234-2020","Shenkman, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4903-1804",,,,,53,75,83,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,773,781,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00487.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19508660.0,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267130200019,0

Using a Difference in Differences design, this Study empirically examines the impact of changing from fee-for-service to per-diem reimbursement in a large psychiatric hospital in Beijing. Results show that the LOS did not increase but daily expenditure in fact increased.

In the first phase, we have considered the objective factors (critical and non-critical) to derive a general transferability index, which can be used to measure this internal property of the studies of economic evaluation applied to health technologies. In the second phase, with a more specific index, we have measured the degree of applicability of the results of a given study to a different setting. Both indices have been combined (arithmetic and geometric mean) to obtain a global transferability index. We have applied the global index to a sample of 27 Spanish studies on infections diseases. We have obtained an average value for the index of 0.54, quite far from the maximum theoretical value of 1. We also found that I I Studies lacked some critical factor and were directly deemed as not transferable.

We analyze the effect short-selling restrictions have on the market price and the subsequent effect generated on the market for corporate control. More precisely, we argue that short-selling restrictions may lead to exclusion of pessimistic beliefs and may therefore inflate prices. Thus, if a company is poorly managed and has a stock with strong short-selling restrictions, a profitable takeover will not emerge because of the high stock price. The raider may not have the incentives to acquire the company as its price will be above its fundamental value, conditional on takeover, even accounting for the potential benefits of takeover. We then argue that such effects are detrimental to long-run shareholders and that a value-maximizing strategy is to have a stock with no short-selling restrictions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, I characterize the leading term of a large-T expansion of the bias of the MLE and estimators of average marginal effects in parametric fixed effects panel binary choice models. For probit index coefficients, the former term is proportional to the true value of the coefficients being estimated. This result allows me to derive a lower bound for the bias of the MLE. I then show that the resulting fixed effects estimates of ratios of coefficients and average marginal effects exhibit no bias in the absence of heterogeneity and negligible bias for a wide variety of distributions of regressors and individual effects in the presence of heterogeneity. I subsequently propose new bias-corrected estimators of index coefficients and marginal effects with improved finite sample properties for linear and nonlinear models with predetermined regressors.

Consumer surplus losses from reduced consumption of addictive goods that are measured relative to market demand schedules overestimate the social cost of cessation interventions. This article seeks to show that consumer surplus losses measured using using a non-addicted demand schedule provide a better assessment of social cost. Specifically, (1) it develops an addiction model that permits an estimate of the smoker's compensating variation for the elimination of addiction; (2) it employs a contingent valuation survey of current smokers to estimate their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a treatment that would eliminate addiction: (3) it uses the estimate of WTP from the survey to calculate the fraction of consumer surplus that should be viewed as consumer value and (4) it provides an estimate of this fraction. The exercise suggests that, as a tentative first and rough rule-of-thumb only about 75% of the loss of the conventionally measured consumer surplus should be counted as social cost for policies that reduce the consumption of cigarettes. Additional research to estimate this important rule-of-thumb is desirable to address the various caveats relevant to this study.

As a tool in optimization modeling, conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) has superior properties in many respects. It maintains consistency with VaR by yielding the same results in the limited settings where VaR computations are tractable, i.e., for normal distributions. Because many practical risk problems are multiobjective in loan portfolios of bank, supply electricity plan of Electricity Board and so on, it is important question to develop multiobjective risk model. This paper proposes a general multiobjective average conditional value-at-risk model with multiple losses and period. We introduce the concept of average alpha-CVaR for the case of multiple losses with random variable under the multiple confidence level vector alpha at period. The average alpha-CVaR indicates the conditional expected losses corresponding to the alpha-VaR. The problem of solving the minimal alpha-CVaR results in a nonlinear optimal problem, which another optimal problem based on weight is shown that its optimal solutions is the solutions. Finally, we build multiobjective average CVaR model to find out the robust period and portfolios for supplying electricity plan. The numerical results means that supplying electricity plan may be regulated with price and quantity to evade loss of risk.","[Meng, Zhiqing; Jiang, Min] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Business & Adm, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Technology,,net-mzq@126.com,"Meng, Zhiqing/G-4969-2011",,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,ALFRED UNIV,ALFRED,"ONE SAXON DR, ALFRED, NY 14802 USA",,,978-0-9800510-2-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2622,2627,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJZ06,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267479301092,0

But the theoretic research did not agree with the positive analysis. As a transitioning developing country, China displays an unbalanced situation both in financial development and inhabitant income distribution. The relationship between them is a realistic question which is absolutely worth being researched. In this paper, Financial Interrelations Ratio and Deposit to Loan ratio are respectively used to measure the scale and the efficiency of financial development, Urban-rural Income Gap is used to measure inhabitant income distribution. Based on the vector autoregression (VAR) model, we use ganger causality test, co-integration test and impulse response function to describe the dynamic influence of financial development to urban-rural income distribution of China from 1978. The experience research shows: Financial scale development granger causes urban-rural income gap, and there are mutual granger causality relationship between financial efficiency development and urban-rural income gap. The expansion of financial scale enlarged urban-rural income gap, and financial efficiency development reduced urban-rural income gap. In order to reduce the urban-rural income gap, powerful efforts should be done to change the status of the urban-rural unbalance of financing development, accelerate the development of rural financial market, and establish a diverse, reasonably divided and perfect competition rural financial system. In this way, the financial resources can be distributed reasonably, the rural capital out -flowing and hardness of getting loans for the rural citizens can be eased. What's more, it will highly increase the income of rural citizens. At the same time, irregular finance can be controlled, which is beneficial to the ease of the hardness of rural people financing in this way.

Our approach makes no assumption on the distribution of health state values, accommodates covariates in a flexible way, eschews parametric assumptions on the relationship between the outcome and the covariates, allows for an undetermined amount of heterogeneity in the estimates and it formally tests and corrects for sample selection biases. The proposed model is semi-parametrically estimated and it is illustrated with health state valuation data collected for Spain using the SF-6D descriptive system. Estimation results indicate that the standard regression model underestimates the utility loss that the Spanish general population assigns to departures from full health, particularly so for severe departures.

Methods: A standardized questionnaire was used to guide comprehensive DRG system descriptions. Researchers from each country reviewed relevant materials to complete the questionnaire and drafted standardized country reports. Two characteristics of DRG-based hospital payment systems were identified as particularly important: the existence of short-term payment instruments encouraging technological innovation in different countries, and the characteristics of long-term updating mechanisms that assure technological innovation is ultimately incorporated into DRG-based hospital payment systems. Results: Short-term payment instruments and long-term updating mechanisms differ greatly among the 12 European countries included in this study. Some countries operate generous short-term payment instruments that provide additional payments to hospitals for making use of technological innovation (e. g., France). Other countries update their DRG-based hospital payment systems very frequently and use more recent data for updates. Conclusions: Generous short-term payment instruments to promote technological innovation should be applied carefully as they may imply rapidly increasing health-care expenditures. In general, they should be granted only if rigorous analyses have demonstrated their benefits. If the evidence remains uncertain, coverage with evidence development frameworks or frequent updates of the DRG-based hospital systems may provide policy alternatives. Once the data and evidence base is substantially improved, future research should empirically investigate how different policy arrangements affect the adoption and use of technological innovation and health-care expenditures.","[Scheller-Kreinsen, David; Quentin, Wilm; Busse, Reinhard] Berlin Univ Technol, Dept Hlth Care Management, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Scheller-Kreinsen, D (通讯作者)，Berlin Univ Technol, Dept Hlth Care Management, Str 17 Juni 135 H80, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",David.Scheller-Kreinsen@tu-berlin.de,"Quentin, Wilm/AAD-1355-2019; Quentin, Wilm/AGN-0489-2022","Quentin, Wilm/0000-0002-1705-6524",European Commission [223300],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),Source of financial support: The findings and results presented in this article were generated in the framework of the project Diagnosis-Related Groups in Europe: Towards Efficiency and Quality (EuroDRG).

This paper examines the effect of the patient reimbursement method of health insurance (immediate reimbursement or later reimbursement) on individuals' health-care utilization decisions. We find that immediate reimbursement significantly increases the likelihood of patients seeking outpatient treatment in China. We also empirically explore the channels through which immediate reimbursement affects individual's incentives on health-care demand.

It focuses on gatekeeping GPs and it specifically recognizes GPs heterogeneity in both ability and altruism. It also allows inappropriate care by GPs to lead to more serious illnesses. The results are as follows. Capitation is the payment mechanism that induces the most referrals to expensive specialty care. Fundholding may induce almost as much referrals as capitation when the expected costs of GPs care are high relative to those of specialty care. Although driven by financial incentives of different nature, the strategic behaviors associated with fundholding and FFS are very much alike. Finally, whether a regulator should use one or another payment mechanism for GPs will depend on (i) his priorities (either cost-containment or quality enhancement) which, in turn, depend on the expected cost difference between GPs care and specialty care, and (ii) the distribution of profiles (diagnostic ability and altruism levels) among GPs.

We define situations in which a priori unions and hypergraphs coexist simultaneously and mutually depend on each other. We call such structures two-layered hypergraphs. Using a two-step approach, we define a value of the games with two-layered hypergraphs. The value is characterized by Owen's coalitional value of hypergraph-restricted games and in terms of weighted Myerson value. Further, our value is axiomatically characterized by component efficiency and a coalition size normalized balanced contributions property. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Decision makers frequently make informal judgments about evidence, uncertainty, and the assumptions that underpin these models. Objectives: Transparent interactive decision interrogator (TIDI) facilitates more formal critique of decision models by decision makers such as members of appraisal committees of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK. By allowing them to run advanced statistical models under different scenarios in real time, TIDI can make the decision process more efficient and transparent, while avoiding limitations on pre-prepared analysis. Methods: TIDI, programmed in Visual Basic for applications within Excel, provides an interface for controlling all components of a decision model developed in the appropriate software (e. g., meta-analysis in Win-BUGS and the decision model in R) by linking software packages using RExcel and R2WinBUGS. TIDI's graphical controls allow the user to modify assumptions and to run the decision model, and results are returned to an Excel spreadsheet. A tool displaying tornado plots helps to evaluate the influence of individual parameters on the model outcomes, and an interactive meta-analysis module allows the user to select any combination of available studies, explore the impact of bias adjustment, and view results using forest plots. We demonstrate TIDI using an example of a decision model in antenatal care. Conclusion: Use of TIDI during the NICE appraisal of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (in psoriatic arthritis) successfully demonstrated its ability to facilitate critiques of the decision models by decision makers.","[Bujkiewicz, Sylwia; Lai, Monica C.

The scenarios typically involve trade-offs in time (time trade-off (TTO)), risk (standard gamble (SG)), or number of persons affected (person trade-off (PTO)). This paper revisits the QALY assumptions and provides a coherent health econometric approach that unites TTO, SG, and PTO techniques under a common estimator. The proposed approach avoids the use of ratio statistics in QALY estimation and the common convention of arbitrarily changing trade-off responses. As an example, 34% of the TTO responses from the seminal Measurement and Valuation of Health study were changed in the original UK analysis, which led to substantially lower QALY estimates. As a general rule, if the original estimate is less than 0.5 QALYs, add 0.25 QALYs to get the new estimates.

The goals incorporate both an efficiency and equity dimension. While inequalities in population health and health care finance have motivated two important strands of research, inequalities in responsiveness have received less attention in health economics. This paper examines inequality and polarisation in responsiveness, bridging this gap in the literature and contributing towards an integrated analysis of health systems performance. It uses data from the World Health Survey to measure and compare inequalities in responsiveness across 25 European countries. In order to respect the inherently ordinal nature of the responsiveness data, median-based measures of inequality and polarisation are employed. The results suggest that, in the face of wide differences in the health systems analysed, there exists large variability in inequality in responsiveness across countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Five-year cumulative measures of these job characteristics are used to reflect findings in the biological and physiological literature that indicate that cumulative exposure to hazards and stresses harms health. To create our analytic sample, we merge job characteristics from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles with the PSID data set. We control for early and also lagged health measures and a set of pre-determined characteristics to try to address concerns that individuals self-select into jobs. Our results indicate that individuals who work in jobs with the 'worst' conditions experience declines in their health, though this effect varies by demographic group. We also find some evidence that job characteristics are more detrimental to the health of females and older workers. Finally, we report suggestive evidence that earned income, a job characteristic, partially cushions the health impact of physical demands and harsh environmental conditions for workers. These results are robust to inclusion of occupation fixed effects.

This question represents much more than academic curiosity. In a normative sense, at stake are the fundamental underpinnings of the bulk of the last half-century's models of choice under uncertainty. From a positive perspective, the ubiquitous use of benefit-cost analysis across government agencies renders the expected utility maximization paradigm literally the only game in town. In this study, we advance the literature by exploring CEO's preferences over small probability, high loss lotteries. Using undergraduate students as our experimental control group, we find that both our CEO and student subject pools exhibit frequent and large departures from expected utility theory. In addition, as the extreme payoffs become more likely CEOs exhibit greater aversion to risk. Our results suggest that use of the expected utility paradigm in decision making substantially underestimates society's willingness to pay to reduce risk in small probability, high loss events.

Given the short duration of the famine, we can separately identify the famine effects for cohorts exposed in utero, during infancy and at 1 year of age. We find that adverse outcomes due to the famine are largest for infants. Further, in our regression analysis we exploit the fact that the famine was more severe in urban than in rural areas. Consistent with our prediction, we find that urban-born cohorts show larger negative impacts on educational outcomes than rural-born cohorts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A decision-analysis model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intranasal fentanyl spray (INFS) compared with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) and fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT) for the treatment of BTCP. Methods: The model was parameterized for Sweden to estimate the costs and benefits associated with treatments. Expected reductions in pain intensity (PI; measured on a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10) per BTCP episodes were translated into resource use and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Relative analgesic efficacy of interventions was derived from a mixed treatment comparison of six randomized controlled trials. The relationship between PI and utility was obtained from a time-trade off study in the general population. Resource use and unit cost data were obtained from the literature and validated by Swedish clinical experts. The base case scenario assumed three BTCP episodes/day, a background PI of 2, and a time horizon of 180 days. Prices of INFS and OTFC were assumed to be equal with FBT similar to 14% less. Uncertainty in the source data was incorporated by probabilistic sensitivity analyses and different scenario analyses. Results: With INFS, 55% of BTCP (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 46-68%) was avoided, which is greater than expected with OTFC (29%; UI 22-38%) or FBT (31%; UI 25-39%). INFS was dominating OTFC (resulting in 0.046 QALY gain and saving 174 Euros with a time horizon of 180 days) and cost-effective versus FBT (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 12203 Euros/QALY). Despite uncertainty in the source data, there is a >99% probability that INFS is the most cost-effective intervention. Conclusion: Given inherent limitations of modelling studies, the greater efficacy of INFS translates to cost and QALY advantages over competing interventions in the treatment for BTCP in Sweden.

In addition to traditional realized volatility measures and the role of the underlying sampling frequencies, we also explore the forecasting performance of several alternative volatility measures designed to mitigate the impact of the microstructure noise. Our analysis is facilitated by a simple unified quadratic form representation for all these estimators. Our results suggest that the detrimental impact of the noise on forecast accuracy can be substantial. Moreover, the linear forecasts based on a simple-to-implement 'average' (or 'subsampled') estimator obtained by averaging standard sparsely sampled realized volatility measures generally perform on par with the best alternative robust measures.

For the comparison two exemplary small towns representing the peripheral area (Mikulov a Velke Opatovice) and two exemplary small towns (Kurim a Rajhrad) representing the metropolitan region were chosen. The main presumption of this choice was the number of population, their proper, opposite location in the Region and the typical representativeness of the given countryside types based on typology of small towns according to Vaishar (2008). Five parameters were chosen: Land-use, nature conservation, unemployment and job opportunities, civic amenities and traffic connection. Small towns were compared using these criteria. The information was gained from relevant literary sources and spatial plans. A field survey of the cadastral territories of studied small towns was carried out, where the photo-documentation was provided. For comparison, small towns the peripheral and metropolitan countryside of South Moravian region, Brno is the most important parameter of size and distance from the regional city of Brno. In terms of comparing peripheral small towns is the most important position in the region. It should be noted that the comparison sample, only two small towns as the representatives of selected types of rural South Moravian Region can not formulate a generally valid conclusions, which should apply to a particular type of countryside. For the formulation of generally valid conclusions about similarities and differences in land use small rural towns monitored types would be appropriate to carry out follow-up analysis of other small towns of rural types, the best comparison set of the small towns of the metropolitan and rural peripheral type.","[Kniezkova, T.; Pakozdiova, M.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kniezková, T (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xkniezko@node.mendelu.cz; 1Mary1@seznam.cz,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,482,494,,,,,,13,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341783400058,0

While some observers agree with the necessity of the steady-state economy, they are nonetheless critical of the suggestion made by ecological economists in particular, Herman Daly-that a steady-state economy is compatible with a capitalist system. First, they believe that steady-state capitalism is based on the untenable assumption that growth is an optional rather than in-built element of capitalism. Second, they argue that capitalist notions of efficient resource allocation are too restrictive to facilitate the transition to an ecological or steady-state economy. I believe these observers are outright wrong with their first criticism and, because they misunderstand Daly's vision of a steady-state economy, are misplaced with their second criticism. The nature of a capitalist system depends upon the institutional framework that supports and shapes it. Hence, a capitalist system can exist in a wide variety of forms. Unfortunately, many observers fail to recognize that the current growth imperative is the result of capitalist systems everywhere being institutionally designed to grow. They need not be designed this way to survive and thrive. Indeed, because continued growth is both existentially undesirable and ecologically unsustainable, redesigning capitalist systems through the introduction of Daly-like institutions would prove to be capitalism's savior. What's more, it would constitute humankind's best hope of achieving sustainable development.","Flinders Univ S Australia, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Lawn, P (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Fac Social & Behav Sci, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",phil.lawn@flinders.edu.au,,,,,,,42,41,42,8,38,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER STREET, HOBOKEN, NJ, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-57331-820-4,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2011,1219.0,,,,,,1,25,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.05966.x,0.0,,,25,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Book Citation Index– Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index– Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BUD51,21332490.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000288933600001,0

A possible synthesis of energy-based and mainstream models is presented. This shows that when energy is scarce it imposes a strong constraint on the growth of the economy; however, when energy is abundant, its effect on economic growth is much reduced. The industrial revolution released the constraints on economic growth by the development of new methods of using coal and the discovery of new fossil fuel resources. Time-series analysis shows that energy and GDP cointegrate, and energy use Granger causes GDP when capital and other production inputs are included in the vector autoregression model. However, various mechanisms can weaken the links between energy and growth. Energy used per unit of economic output has declined in developed and some developing countries, owing to both technological change and a shift from poorer quality fuels, such as coal, to the use of higher quality fuels, especially electricity. Substitution of other inputs for energy and sectoral shifts in economic activity play smaller roles.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Stern, DI (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",sterndavidi@yahoo.com,"Stern, David I/B-4700-2009","Stern, David I/0000-0001-6595-4268",,,,,189,218,239,3,108,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER STREET, HOBOKEN, NJ, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-57331-820-4,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2011,1219.0,,,,,,26,51,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05921.x,0.0,,,26,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Book Citation Index– Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index– Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BUD51,21332491.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000288933600002,0

The neoclassical growth theory predicts that a lower level of real GDP per person would match up with a higher subsequent growth rate of real GDP per person. The data for EU27 countries are used to estimate a relation of the growth rates of real GDP per person against levels of real GDP per person. If there is a convergence process, the relation will be negative. Finally we use dummy regional variables to identify the clubs of countries with the different steady state level assuming that their technology level is the same. We find that there has been a stronger unconditional (absolute) convergence of EU27 countries in the period 2003-2009 than it was in the period 1996-2002. The average yearly convergence rate has been about 1.3% for last seven years. Italy, Hungary, Portugal and Spain converge towards the lower steady state level than European average, while Luxembourg converges towards the higher level.

For measure were selected two tractors with the same engine, but with a different transmission. It was a NH T7050 tractor AutoCommand with variable hydromechanical transmission and NH T7050 tractor PowerCommand with full powershift transmission. Measured circuit measuring 21.8 km. For tractor AutoCommand was chosen 10 measurement modes with different speeds and with two degrees of aggressiveness changes the gear ratio. The tractor was selected PowerCommad automatic mode. The final evaluation was performed sets of traffic from all over the track. From the measured values it was found that tractor AutoCommand reached a lower average of consumption, in the rev range 1700 min(-1) to 1770 min(-1) to 1.5 l.h(-1), which represents fuel savings of 6.5% for the combination with the T7050 tractor geared AutoCommand. Similar results were also observed at 1814 min(-1) to 1830 min(-1), where fuel economy was 2.8 l.h(-1), i.e. 11.5% for the combination with a tractor with the transmission T 7050 AutoCommand.","[Vykydal, P.; Zak, M.] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Engn & Automobile Transport, Fac Agron, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Vykydal, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Engn & Automobile Transport, Fac Agron, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",petr.vykydal@centrum.cz,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,986,992,,,,,,7,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341783400121,0

The latter two procedures are introduced in Andrews and Guggenberger (2009a). The models are non-regular in the sense that the test statistics of interest exhibit a discontinuity in their limit distribution as a function of a parameter in the model. The first model is a linear instrumental variables (IV) model with possibly weak IVs estimated using two-stage least squares (2SLS). In this case, the discontinuity occurs when the concentration parameter is zero. The second model is a linear regression model in which the parameter of interest may be near a boundary. In this case, the discontinuity occurs when the parameter is on the boundary. The paper shows that in the IV model one-sided and equal-tailed two-sided subsampling tests and confidence intervals (CIs) based on the 2SLS t statistic do not have correct asymptotic size. This holds for both fully- and partially-studentized t statistics. But, subsampling procedures based on the partially-studentized t statistic can be size-corrected. On the other hand, symmetric two-sided subsampling tests and CIs are shown to have (essentially) correct asymptotic size when based on a partially-studentized t statistic. Furthermore, all types of hybrid subsampling tests and CIs are shown to have correct asymptotic size in this model. The above results are consistent with impossibility results of Dufour (1997) because subsampling and hybrid subsampling CIs are shown to have infinite length with positive probability. Subsampling CIs for a parameter that may be near a lower boundary are shown to have incorrect asymptotic size for upper one-sided and equal-tailed and symmetric two-sided CIs. Again, size-correction is possible. In this model as well, all types of hybrid subsampling CIs are found to have correct asymptotic size. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this paper is to argue that these model selection procedures invariably give rise to unreliable inferences, primarily because their choice within a prespecifled family of models (a) assumes away the problem of model validation, and (b) ignores the relevant error probabilities. This paper argues for a return to the original statistical model specification problem, as envisaged by Fisher (1922), where the task is understood as one of selecting a statistical model in such a way as to render the particular data a truly typical realization of the stochastic process specified by the model in question. The key to addressing this problem is to replace trading goodness-offit against parsimony with statistical adequacy as the sole criterion for when a fitted model accounts for the regularities in the data.

Fractional differencing involves infinitely many past values and because we are interested in nonstationary processes we model the data X-1, ..., X-T given the initial values X-n = 0, 1, ..., as is usually done. The initial values are not modeled but assumed to be bounded. This represents a considerable generalization relative to previous work where it is assumed that initial values are zero. For the statistical analysis we assume the conditional Gaussian likelihood and for the probability analysis we also condition on initial values but assume that the errors in the autoregressive model are i.i.d. with suitable moment conditions. We analyze the conditional likelihood and its derivatives as stochastic processes in the parameters, including d and b, and prove that they converge in distribution. We use these results to prove consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator ford. b in a large compact subset of {1/2 < b < d < infinity}, and to find the asymptotic distribution of the estimators and the likelihood ratio test of the associated fractional unit root hypothesis. The limit distributions contain the fractional Brownian motion of type II. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

When the number of patients per health worker grows sufficiently high, there will be insufficient time to diagnose and treat all patients adequately. This paper tests the hypothesis that high caseload reduces the level of effort per patient in the diagnostic process. We observed 159 clinicians in 2095 outpatient consultations at 126 health facilities in rural Tanzania. Surprisingly, we find no association between caseload and the level of effort per patient. Clinicians appear to have ample amounts of idle time. We conclude that health workers are not overworked and that scaling up the number of health workers is unlikely to raise the quality of health services. Training has a positive effect on quality but is not in itself sufficient to raise quality to adequate levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Exploiting results from the recent econometric literature on models with misclassification error, we develop a nonparametric procedure for recovering the distribution of bids conditional on the unknown N*. Monte Carlo results illustrate that the procedure works well in practice. We present illustrative evidence from a dataset of procurement auctions, which shows that accounting for the unobservability of N* can lead to economically meaningful differences in the estimates of bidders' profit margins.

Meaningful measurements are represented by operators that obey a non-commutative algebra. Thus, the order in which information is extracted matters. In addition, responses to questions about an attribute depend on whether information about another attribute has previously been extracted. Measurement forces the subject to obtain one value of the attribute, the one measured by the observer. An uncertainty principle imposes a fundamental limit on the ability to extract detailed information about two distinct attributes within a short period of time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate that in the presence of persisting trade imbalances, in a Nash equilibrium, the trade-deficit country maintains perfect competition while the trade-surplus country restricts competition. This shows it highly difficult to harmonize their policies to achieve the first best state under the current international trade regime, which is centered around the principle of reciprocity.

The aim of the current study was to examine the possible existence of non-linear utility for short life extensions. A representative sample of the Norwegian population, aged 40-59 years (n = 2402), was asked to imagine that they had a limited remaining lifetime (1 year or 10 years) and were offered a treatment that would increase lifetime by a specified amount of time from I week to 1 year. In all scenarios, the price per week of life extension was held constant. The proportion of respondents that accepted the treatment increased with increasing extensions, indicating a convex utility function. The result suggests increasing marginal utility for life extensions up to 1 year. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Given the availability of a rich subsample of individuals for which normative expenditures. Y-NORM, can be accurately determined, we make two contributions: (a) any risk equalization scheme applied to the entire population, Y-REF, should be evaluated through its performance in the subsample, by comparing Y-REF with Y-NORM (not by comparing Y-REF with observed expenditures, Y, in the entire population, as commonly done); (b) conventional risk equalization schemes can be improved by the subsample regression of Y-NORM. rather than Y, on the risk adjusters that are observable in the entire population. This new method is illustrated by an application to the 2004 Dutch risk equalization model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Stam, Pieter J. A.; van Vliet, Rene C. J.

Labeled choice sets are less abstract and may increase the validity of the results. We empirically compared the feasibility, respondents' trading behavior, and convergent validity between a labeled and an unlabeled DCE for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs in The Netherlands. Methods: A labeled DCE version presented CRC screening test alternatives as fecal occult blood test, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy, whereas the unlabeled DCE version presented them as screening test A and screening test B. Questionnaires were sent to participants and nonparticipants in CRC screening. Results: Total response rate was 276 (39%) out of 712 and 1033 (46%) out of 2267 for unlabeled and labeled DCEs, respectively (P < 0.001). The labels played a significant role in individual choices; approximately 22% of subjects had dominant preferences for screening test labels. The convergent validity was modest to low (participants in CRC screening: r = 0.54; P = 0.01; nonparticipants: r = 0.17; P = 0.45) largely because of different preferences for screening frequency. Conclusion: This study provides important insights in the feasibility and difference in results from labeled and unlabeled DCEs. The inclusion of labels appeared to play a significant role in individual choices but reduced the attention respondents give to the attributes. As a result, unlabeled DCEs may be more suitable to investigate trade-offs between attributes and for respondents who do not have familiarity with the alternative labels, whereas labeled DCEs may be more suitable to explain real-life choices such as uptake of cancer screening.","[de Bekker-Grob, Esther W.; Habbema, J.

For this reason these components are substituted by soja lecithin. In this work we compared four extenders: two without egg yolk (AndroMed (R), Bioxcell (R)) and two egg yolk based diluents (Triladyl (R), Optidyl (R)). We used 80 samples of ejaculate, collected from 4 bulls of the same age, frequency of collecting and reared on one Artificial Insemination Centre (A. I. Centre). Semen with demand quality were used for producing A. I. doses by standard methodology of A. I. Centre. We monitored sperm activity of these A. I. doses after thawing by a heat test (38 C, 120 minutes). The results were evaluated by the SAS GLM procedure. Higher activity of sperm after thawing (48.4-51.6%, P<0.05-0.001) was detected in extenders with egg yolk than in extenders without egg yolk (41.5-47.4%). Sperm activity declined unevenly to (25.5%-31.4%) in egg yolk extenders compared to ones without egg yolk (18.9-23.3%) after 120 minutes of the survival test. Significant differences in sperm survival among individual sires were determined. We can recomended the use of diluents based on egg yolk.","[Beran, J.; Stadnik, L.; Duchacek, J.; Louda, F.] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Anim Husb, Suchdol 16521, Praha Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Beran, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Anim Husb, Suchdol 16521, Praha Suchdol, Czech Republic.",beranj@af.czu.cz,"Stádník, Ludek/I-5837-2013; Beran, Jan/D-6139-2016","Beran, Jan/0000-0001-5052-7757",,,,,7,2,2,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,204,210,,,,,,7,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341786800024,0

The paper examines two conservation programs in the district of Islamic-Cairo. 'The open-air museum' is undertaken by the Ministry of Culture and the second is 'Rehabilitation of Darb Shoughlan' which is undertaken by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture.

What, then, can be called Goan foodways and for whom they should be preserved? In Goan recipes which many of local and national chefs have tried to showcase, we can see Christian culinary ways are mostly emphasized.

The objective of the thesis was to identify and to point at more or less visible changes in landscape under the pressure of human activities in Diakovce cadastral territory. This paper shows an attempt of historical analysis of Diakovce landscape structure changes with use of data available and its comparison with the recent state of studied area landscape. The analysis of the historical maps and other materials shows the changes in land use and landscape of the studied area through more than 200 years. Except that, a terrain landscape exploration was realized. To the one of the most important results belong the digitalized versions of land use maps from the past, which were created with the aid of historical map legend signs analysis of historical military maps. Except this output, the results of the terrain landscape exploration such as geobiocenological characteristics of the studied area, the presence of protected plant species, the own photographs were presented as well. A set of measures needed to improve or at least conserve the current landscape state of the studied area were proposed. Since agriculture has played an important role in history and development of the whole region, this has reflected in the current condition of the landscape. The landscape has been destroyed for a very long time since the first village settlements. The human impact is extremely huge in this area. We should learn from the past and avoid mistakes of our ancestors and take the future of the face of the landscape of a place where we live and want our offspring to live into the consideration in terms of how is our village and its landscape going to be used - it is our task now what our village will look like and how it will be!","[Pakozdiova, M.; Trnka, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Pákozdiová, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",1Meryl@seznam.cz,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,453,468,,,,,,16,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341786800058,0

This paper, having a background on the big picture of globalisation issues, develops into a debate on ways to overcome the gap between communitarian and cosmopolitan approaches to governance, by putting forward a concept of governance as a political-cultural construct, i.e. a concept in the making and a valuable tool for projective political-cultural identities, rather than a minimalist regulatory tool.","[Ramos, C.

This paper presents the formulation and estimation of a family of discrete choice models that enables to treat two main elements: (i) the relative values of the modal attributes, as usual, and (ii) the shock resulting from the introduction of this radical new policy. We also analyse the influence of socioeconomic variables in these two forces. We found that introducing this drastic new policy may even modify the perception of attribute values; in fact, the changes can be different among individuals, as socioeconomic characteristics act as either enhancers or softeners of the shock effects generated by the new policy.","[Yanez, Maria Francisca] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [de Dios Ortuzar, Juan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Transport Engn, Santiago, Chile",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,,,"Ortúzar, Juan de Dios/F-8277-2013","Ortúzar, Juan de Dios/0000-0003-3452-3574",,,,,12,2,4,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,445,460,,,,,,16,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366173200021,0

Because measurement of bone density by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is quite expensive, there has been increasing interest to estimate fracture risk by CRFs. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening of CRFs with and without DXA compared with no screening in postmenopausal women in Germany. Methods: A cost-utility analysis and a budget-impact analysis were performed from the perspective of the statutory health insurance. A Markov model simulated costs and benefits discounted at 3% over lifetime. Results: Cost-effectiveness of CRFs compared with no screening is 4607, 21,181, and 10,171 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for 60-, 70-, and 80-year-old women, respectively. Cost-effectiveness of DXA plus CRFs compared with CRFs alone is 20,235 for 60-year-old women. In women above the age of 70, DXA plus CRFs dominates CRFs alone. DXA plus CRFs results in annual costs of 175 million, or 0.4% of the statutory health insurance's annual budget. Conclusion: Funders should be careful in adopting a strategy based on CRFs alone instead of DXA plus CRFs. Only if DXA is not available, assessing CRFs only is an acceptable option in predicting a woman's risk of fracture.","[Mueller, Dirk] Univ Cologne, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Cologne, Germany; [Gandjour, Afschin] Rice Univ, James A Baker Inst Publ Policy 3, Houston, TX USA",University of Cologne; Rice University,"Mueller, D (通讯作者)，Inst Res Operat Med, IFOM, Ostmerheimer Str 200, D-51109 Cologne, Germany.",dirkwmueller@gmx.de,"Gandjour, Afschin/I-8963-2019",,,,,,80,20,21,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,8,,,,,1106,1117,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00577.x,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,515TH,19706151.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271495300011,0
