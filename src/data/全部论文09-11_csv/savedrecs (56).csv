A robust scaling method is considered to take into account the sensitiveness of estimates to abnormal data. A genetic algorithm is developed to these purposes. Two examples are presented where models are designed to produce short-term forecasts for the excess returns of the MSCI Europe Energy sector on the MSCI Europe index and a recursive estimation-window is used to shed light on their predictability performances. In the first application the data-set is obtained by a reduction procedure from a very large number of leading macro indicators and financial variables stacked at various lags, while in the second the complete set of 1-month lagged variables is considered. Results show a promising capability to predict excess sector returns through the selection, using the proposed methodology, of most valuable predictors.","Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Econ & Tecn Aziendale, I-34127 Trieste, Italy",University of Trieste,"Kaucic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Econ & Tecn Aziendale, Piazzale Europa 1, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.",massimilianokaucic@gmail.com,,"Kaucic, Massimiliano/0000-0002-6565-0771",,,,,43,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Both static and dynamic fixed effects panel data models are adopted to estimate the impacts of this infectious disease. The empirical results from static and dynamic fixed effects panel data models are consistent and indicate that the number of affected poultry outbreaks has significant impacts on the international tourism of global and Asian affected countries. The high mortality rate among humans, the potential of a global flu pandemic and some media frenzy with hype and speculation might adversely affect the images of these infected destinations as a safe tourist destination. Moreover, it was found that the average damage to Asian tourism was more serious, which might have been induced by an ineffective suppression in numerous Asian infected countries. In addition, Asia was the earliest affected region and the area infected most seriously by avian flu, both in humans and in poultry. Since the potential risks and damage arising from avian flu and the subsequent pandemic influenza are much greater than for previous diseases, the need to take necessary precautions in the event of an outbreak of avian flu and pandemic influenza warrants further attention and action in modelling and managing International tourism demand and risk.","[Kuo, Hsiao-I] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Chia-Lin; Huang, Bing-Wen; Chen, Chi-Chung; McAleer, Michael] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Chaoyang University of Technology; National Chung Hsing University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Kuo, HI (通讯作者)，Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan.",changchialin@nchu.edu.tw,"huang, bingwen/HHN-0640-2022; McAleer, Michael/B-2978-2010; CHEN, CHEN/HDM-6657-2022; Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; chen, chen/GRY-7085-2022","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X;",,,,,18,45,48,1,18,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Of central interest is the extent to which workers receive higher wages to compensate for differences in the cost of living. According to the spatial equilibrium hypothesis, the utility of homogenous workers should be equal across labor markets. This implies that controlling for amenity differences across areas, the elasticity between wages and the general price level across areas should equal one, at least under certain conditions. I test this hypothesis and find that the predicted relationship holds when housing prices are measured by rents and the general price level is instrumented to account for measurement error. When housing prices are measured by housing values, however, the wage-price elasticity is significantly less than one, even using instrumental variables. Rents reflect the price paid for housing per unit of time and are arguably the superior measure. Thus, findings in this essay provide support for the full compensation hypothesis. These findings also have important implications for researchers estimating the implicit prices of amenities or ranking the quality of life across areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We use Hotelling's model of product differentiation to characterize a situation where an incumbent firm produces the old technology, compatible with the existing network of filling stations, and an entrant, who cannot use this network. The oil companies myopically support the use of the original technology based on fossil fuel by following Hotelling's pricing rule. This encourages the entrant to invest in compatibility. The entrant with the new technology is a Stackelberg leader while the old-technology firm is the follower. In the first stage, the entrant invests in the network of filling stations and in the second stage both compete in prices, given the network situation. These two-step models are repeated until the network is compatible or the oil is exhausted. The main positive result is that the fossil fuel powered cars see their market share and profitability decline over time, while the hydrogen firm increasingly prospers. These trends are stronger the stronger are the consumers' environmental concerns. On the normative side, the privately optimal pace of investment is slower than the socially optimal pace of investment, suggesting policies that would foster the introduction of the hydrogen technology.","Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Conrad, K (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",kconrad@rumms.uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,9,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

However, for more than 50 years numerous studies in more than 10 countries all over the world have shown low price-quality correlation coefficients, mostly close to 0.2. These results have been interpreted twofold: (a) consumers cannot use prices as valid indicators of quality and (b) markets do not function well. In contrast to the second interpretation, this paper argues that, according to the economic theory of price formation, prices are not an indicator of quality, but an indicator of scarcity. This allows the conclusion that workable consumer goods markets, as seen from a welfare point of view, should be characterized by low or even negative correlations between price and objective quality rather than by strong positive coefficients. All the more it is the availability of valid information about product quality which is necessary to enable consumers to avoid inefficient product choices.","Univ Hohenheim, Inst Haushalts & Konsumokonom 530, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Imkamp, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Haushalts & Konsumokonom 530, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",imkamp@uni-hohenheim.de,,,,,,,39,5,5,0,2,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We adopt a different empirical approach and test its goodness of fit using a parametric bootstrap and several powerful test statistics. Just like the discrete Pareto distribution, it is overwhelmingly rejected: it is a fairly accurate approximation of the lower quantiles of the superstar distribution but overestimates the snowball effect that makes consumers purchase records of the most successful artists. In other words, the Yule distribution captures stardom, but not superstardom.

Contrary to the literature, a higher LS not only incurs a higher cost, but also benefits workers and induces them to work harder. Because of these links, Northern intervention, via import taxes or minimum LS regulation, may often have perverse effects on Southern countries. Specifically, imposing an unconditional tariff against a certain Southern country to force up its LS does not work. Further, the unconditional tariff would shift production to another country. These shed light on why developing countries oppose including LS in WTO negotiations. However, a LS-contingent tariff, or a minimum LS regulation is effective in raising LS in Southern countries, but the utility of the Northern labour union may fall. Incorporating altruism and humanitarian concerns mitigates the effects of unconditional tariff policies. Finally, as the empirical evidence shows, we demonstrate that multinational enterprises choose to locate in those developing countries whose LS is relatively higher.","Kobe Univ, RIEB, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Kobe University,"Zhao, LX (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, RIEB, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",,,,,,,,23,1,2,0,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2009,32.0,7,,,,,1091.0,1114,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01195.x,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,468PZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267833300007,0

A theoretical analysis discusses the implications for the spatial structure of the economy and shows that while the wages in the countryside will be affected positively, wages will decline in the city, where employment and population rise. Workers in the city will further suffer from an increase in housing costs.

A drop in the valuation of the marginal bidder in a sequence of player auctions also drops the path of winning bids.

The definition of coalitional strategy-proofness is given on the basis of a max-min criterion. We show that the Pareto rule is coalitionally strategy-proof in this sense. Moreover, we prove that given an arbitrary social choice correspondence satisfying the coalitional strategy-proofness and nonimposition, all alternatives selected by the correspondence are Pareto optimal. These two results imply that the Pareto rule is the maximal correspondence in the class of coalitionally strategy-proof and nonimposed social choice correspondences.","Daito Bunka Univ, Fac Business Adm, Itabashi Ku, Tokyo 1758571, Japan",,"Umezawa, M (通讯作者)，Daito Bunka Univ, Fac Business Adm, Itabashi Ku, 1-9-1 Takashimadaira, Tokyo 1758571, Japan.",mumezawa@ic.daito.ac.jp,"Umezawa, Masashi/JJG-2840-2023",,,,,,30,6,6,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2009,33.0,1,,,,,151.0,158,,10.1007/s00355-008-0351-7,0.0,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,434XV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265308500008,0

In contrast to traditional approaches this algorithm is able to handle spillover externalities. We focus on technological spillovers which are due to capital trade. The algorithm of finding a pareto-optimal solution in an intertemporal framework is embedded in a decomposed optimization process. The paper analyzes convergence and equilibrium properties of this algorithm. In the final part of the paper, we apply the algorithm to investigate possible impacts of technological spillovers. While benefits of technological spillovers are significant for the capital-importing region, benefits for the capital-exporting region depend on the type of regional disparities and the resulting specialization and terms-of-trade effects.","[Leimbach, Marian] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, PIK, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Eisenack, Klaus] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ & Stat, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Leimbach, M (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",leimbach@pik-potsdam.de; klaus.eisenack@uni-oldenburg.de,,,,,,,22,8,8,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Following a stage-setting overview of trends and patterns of China's export performance, it probes China competition in third country markets and emerging patterns of imports. The East Asian export experience is examined in a wider global context against the backdrop of the ongoing process of global production sharing. The findings indicate that the 'China threat' has been vastly exaggerated in the contemporary policy debate. China's rapid market penetration in traditional labour-intensive manufactured goods has occurred mostly at the expense of the high-wage East Asian countries, without crowding-out the export opportunities of low-wage countries in the region. More importantly, China's rapid integration into global production networks as a major assembly centre has created new opportunities for the other East Asian countries to engage in various segments of the value chain in line with their comparative advantage.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Athukorala, PC (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,47,94,102,1,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2009,32.0,2,,,,,234.0,266,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2008.01151.x,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,408WX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467400003,0

This paper uses monthly panel data to determine the impact that these regulations have had on the disparity between California's finished gasoline rack prices and that in other regions of the country. The findings suggest that large refiner compliance to Phase II increased the rack price of finished gasoline in California as compared with other regions. This relative price increase, which was likely triggered by the increased production costs associated with Phase II, is consistent with similar results found throughout the literature. However, as small refiners were required to comply with these regulations, this analysis finds that the premium paid for finished gasoline in California increased significantly. This additional increase in the rack price differential, along with trends in industry concentration, suggests that Phase II may have disproportionately disadvantaged California's small refiners, causing increased profits and market share for larger competitors.","Eastern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Econ, Willimantic, CT 06226 USA",Connecticut State University System; Eastern Connecticut State University,"Brown, JL (通讯作者)，Eastern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Econ, 83Windham St, Willimantic, CT 06226 USA.",brownje@easternct.edu,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,7,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,30.0,3,,,,,115.0,127,,,,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,464NN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267511900006,0

According to the reaction of the managers of the destination in stagnation, various scenarios are possible, including the decline, the stabilisation, the rejuvenating and the reinvention. Within the consolidation and the stagnation stages, the managers must intervene and act in order to avoid the unwanted decline of the respective tourist destination.

In real estate markets, heterogeneous properties trade in illiquid, highly segmented and informationally inefficient local markets. Moreover, the inability to short sell private real estate restricts the ability of sophisticated traders to enter the market and eliminate mispricing. These characteristics would seem to render private real estate markets highly susceptible to sentiment-induced mispricing. Using error correction models to carefully model potential lags in the adjustment process, this paper extends previous work on cap rate dynamics by examining the extent to which fundamentals and investor sentiment help to explain the time-series variation in national-level cap rates. We find evidence that investor sentiment impacts pricing, even after controlling for changes in expected rental growth, equity risk premiums, T-bond yields, and lagged adjustments from long run equilibrium.","[Ling, David C.; Naranjo, Andy] Univ Florida, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Hough Grad Sch Business, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Clayton, Jim] Pens Real Estate Assoc, Hartford, CT 06103 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ling, D (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Hough Grad Sch Business, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jim@prea.org; ling@ufl.edu; andy.naranjo@cba.ufl.edu,,,,,,,54,118,129,4,84,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Another issue is whether pro-poor judgements should put relatively more emphasis on the impact of growth upon the poorer of the poor.

The first stage of the model consists in assessment of weights of input and outputs by means of the interval AHP model, i.e. the AHP model with interval judgments. The results of this stage are interval weights derived by optimization approach on the one hand and simulation on the other hand. The second stage of the model uses a DEA model with weight restrictions for evaluation of efficiency. The problem is that the DEA models with direct weight restrictions are often infeasible. That is why we use models with virtual weights restrictions where the infeasibility does not occur so often. The DEA model with virtual weight restrictions splits the evaluated units into two subsets - efficient and inefficient ones. Then, the super-efficiency models and the AMP model with interval weights are used for ranking of efficient units. The results of both models are compared and discussed.

To do so, we develop an unobserved components model of inflation with Markov-switching parameters and we measure persistence using impulse response functions based on the model. An important feature of our model is its allowance for multiple regime shifts in parameters related to the size and propagation of shocks. Inflation persistence depends on the configuration of these parameters, although it need not change even if the parameters change. Using the GDP deflator for the sample period of 1959-2006, we find that U.S. inflation underwent two sudden permanent regime shifts, both of which corresponded to changes in persistence. The first regime shift occurred around the collapse of the Bretton Woods system at the beginning of the 1970's and produced an increase in inflation persistence, while the second regime shift occurred immediately after the Volcker disinflation in the early 1980's and produced a decrease in inflation persistence. Meanwhile, consistent with the New Keynesian Phillips Curve, the gap between inflation and its long-run trend displayed little or no persistence throughout the entire sample period.","[Kang, Kyu Ho; Morley, James] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Kim, Chang-Jin] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Chang-Jin] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Korea University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Kang, KH (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",khkang@wustl.edu; changjin@u.washington.edu; morley@wustl.edu,"Kim, Chang-Jin/AAN-4657-2020; Morley, James C/J-9166-2012","Morley, James/0000-0003-2380-6747",,,,,32,37,42,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

By analyzing the main responsibilities of different social welfare, welfare objects, features and benefits in the various stages, it shows that the emergence of social welfare system is inevitable and the future of social welfare must be multiple.","[Li, Qin] Shanghai Univ Engn Sci, Social Welf Res Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Engineering Science,,lqin06@yahoo.com.cn,"li, xiaofeng/GXF-9442-2022",,,,,,10,0,0,0,6,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-074-2,,,,2009,,,,,,,295.0,298,,,,,,4,Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BQC55,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280692900066,0

We model their effects on the future costs of a low-carbon energy technology that is not currently commercially available, purely organic photovoltaics (PV). We find that: (1) successful R&D enables PV to achieve a cost target of 4c/kWh, (2) the cost of PV does not reach the target when only subsidies, and not R&D, are implemented, and (3) production-related effects on technological advance-learning-by-doing and economies of scale-are not as critical to the long-term potential for cost reduction in organic PV than is the investment in and success of R&D. These results are insensitive to two levels of policy intensity, the level of a carbon price, the availability of storage technology, and uncertainty in the main parameters used in the model. However, a case can still be made for subsidies: comparisons of stochastic dominance show that subsidies provide a hedge against failure in the R&D program.","[Nemet, Gregory F.] Univ Wisconsin, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Nemet, Gregory F.] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Baker, Erin] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Nemet, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, 1225 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",nemet@wisc.edu; edbaker@ecs.umass.edu,"Baker, Erin/R-7481-2019; Nemet, Gregory/B-3422-2008","Baker, Erin/0000-0002-4139-9930; Nemet, Gregory/0000-0001-7859-4580","Office of Science (BER) U.S. Department of Energy [DE-FG02-06ER64203]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0745161] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Office of Science (BER) U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was partially supported by the Office of Science (BER) U.S. Department of Energy, Grant No. DE-FG02-06ER64203.

Today, three-eights of all PhDs with a degree in science and engineering (S&E) work in the private sector. These placements provide a major means for universities to participate in technology transfer. Students are not only up-to-date in terms of codified knowledge; they also possess tacit knowledge that can only be transferred by face-to-face interaction. They may also have participated as research assistants or as postdocs in the development of a technology that has been licensed by the firm where they are employed. Despite the important role that alumni play in technology transfer, universities rarely track the placements of graduate students in industry. Universities do not also systematically keep information on the contributions that alums make to innovations after graduating. Moreover, few programs socialize students to think of careers in the private sector as a top choice. Instead, many programs, especially in the biomedical sciences, socialize students to aspire to research careers in academe, with industry seen as a distinct second choice. Indeed, many PhDs only take jobs in industry after failing to find an academic position after serving as a postdoc for four or five years. This paper examines recent placements of doctoral students in industry, using the verbatim records from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) for 1997-2002. An advantage of this data is that we know the name of the firm (and the location of the firm) where the individual plans to work. This permits an exploration of several interesting dimensions regarding technology transfer not explored elsewhere, such as (1) sources (in terms of universities) educating students going to industry; (2) the R&D intensity of the firms where newly trained PhDs go to work and the industrial classification of the firms; (3) the role that proximity plays in facilitating these knowledge spillovers; and (4) the degree to which universities make placements with firms licensing their technologies. The paper also examines the amount of information that universities provide regarding the placements of their PhDs. We find that although students are ready and willing to provide information regarding work plans after graduation, universities seldom provide information on placements. We conclude with a suggestion regarding the procedures universities could follow to create and make placement data available.","[Stephan, Paula E.] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,,,,,,,,,24,10,11,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1048-4736,,978-1-84855-466-5,ADV ST ENTR,,,2009,19.0,,,,,,113.0,140,,10.1108/S1048-4736(2009)0000019005,0.0,,,28,Business; Economics; Management; Social Issues,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Issues,BLP46,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270728000006,0

We use a quantitative electricity market model that accounts for these aspects and decompose the impact of the German Feed-in tariff (FIT) into two frequently counteracting effects: a substitution effect and a permit price effect. We find that the total effect of the policy increases the German consumer price slightly by three percent, while the producer price decreases by eight percent. In addition, emissions from electricity generation in Germany are reduced by eleven percent but are hardly altered on the European scale. Finally, it turns out that price-cost margins of almost all firms are increased by the FIT while nonetheless, the profits of firms are significantly lowered unless the firms combine relatively carbon-intensive production with a weak connection to the German grid.","[Traber, Thure] DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Traber, T (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",ttraber@diw.de,,"Traber, Thure/0000-0002-0076-8226; Kemfert, Claudia/0000-0002-6742-0478",EU Commission,EU Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"We acknowledge financial support by the EU Commission under the project Adaptation and Mitigation -Supporting European Climate Policy (ADAM).

A growing number of studies have examined the effects of such food taxes, but few have estimated the weight-loss effects. Typically, a static model of 3500 calories for one pound of body weight is used, and the main objective of the study is to demonstrate its bias. To accomplish the objective, we estimate income-segmented beverage demand systems to examine the potential effects of a SSB tax. Elasticity estimates and a hypothetical 20 percent effective tax rate (or about 0.5 cent per ounce) are applied to beverage intake data from a nationally representative survey, and we find an average daily reduction of 34-47 calories among adults and 40-51 calories among children. The tax-induced energy reductions are translated into weight loss using both static and dynamic calorie-to-weight models. Results demonstrate that the static model significantly overestimates the weight loss from reduced energy intake by 63 percent in year one, 346 percent in year five, and 764 percent in year 10, which leads to unrealistic expectations for obesity intervention strategies. The tax is estimated to generate $5.8 billion a year in revenue and is found to be regressive, although it represents about 1 percent of household food and beverage spending.

As a result, growing public and political pressures are likely to further target air transportation to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The key challenges faced by policy makers and air transportation industry stakeholders is to reduce aviation greenhouse gas emissions while sustaining mobility for passengers and time-sensitive cargo as well as meeting future demand for air transportation in developing and emerging countries. This paper examines five generic policies for reducing the emissions of commercial aviation; (1) technological efficiency improvements, (2) operational efficiency improvements, (3) use of alternative fuels, (4) demand shift and (5) carbon pricing (i.e. market-based incentives). In order to evaluate the impacts of these policies on total emissions, air transport mobility, airfares and airline profitability, a system dynamics modeling approach was used. The Global Aviation Industry Dynamics (GAID) model captures the systemic interactions and the delayed feedbacks in the air transportation system and allows scenarios testing through simulations. For this analysis, a set of 34 scenarios with various levels of aggressiveness along the five generic policies were simulated and tested. It was found that no single policy can maintain emissions levels steady while increasing projected demand for air transportation. Simulation results suggest that a combination of the proposed policies does produce results that are close to a weak sustainability definition of increasing supply to meet new demand needs while maintaining constant or increasing slightly emissions levels. A combination of policies that includes aggressive levels of technological and operations efficiency improvements, use of biofuels along with moderate levels of carbon pricing and short-haul demand shifts efforts achieves a 140% increase in capacity in 2024 over 2004 while only increasing emissions by 20% over 2004. In addition, airline profitability is moderately impacted (10% reduction) compared to other scenarios where profitability is reduced by over 50% which pose a threat to necessary investments and the implementation of mitigating measures to reduce CO2 emissions. This study has shown that an approach based on a portfolio of mitigating measures and policies spanning across technology and operational improvements, use of biofuels, demand shift and carbon pricing is required to transition the air transportation industry close to an operating point of environmental and mobility sustainability.

A simple model is developed in which farmers who live around a circular lake engage in trade with their adjacent neighbors. The payoffs from this activity are governed by a prisoner's dilemma rule of engagement. Every farmer has one son when the population is not growing, or two sons when it is growing. In the former case, the son takes over the farm when his father dies. In the latter case, one son stays on his father's farm, whereas the other son settles around another lake, along with the other sons of the other farmers. During his childhood, each son observes the strategies and the payoffs of his father and of the trading partners of his father, and imitates the most successful strategy when starting farming on his own. Then mutant defectors are introduced into an all-cooperator community. The defector strategy may spread. A comparison is drawn between the impact in terms of the sustainability of cooperation of the appearance of the mutants in a population that is not growing, and in one that is growing. It is shown that the ex-ante probability of sustaining the cooperation strategy is higher for a community that is growing than for a stagnant community. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Rural origin is the most significant predictor of rural residence choice. An important finding is that nonpecuniary goals and values such as family tradition, being respected by friends, and building a business for one's children to inherit have more weight with Iowa State University alumni who reside in rural areas after college than do monetary returns. This implies that incentives such as tax breaks will not work, or will be too expensive, to attract or retain college graduates in rural areas. Second, entrepreneurship rates are higher among Iowa State University alumni in rural areas and rural entrepreneurs tend to have local or, at least, rural roots. This finding lends support to the increasingly popular grow your strategies for rural business development.","[Artz, Georgeanne] Univ Missouri, Agr & Appl Econ Dept, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Yu, Li] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Ctr Human Capital & Labor Market Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Artz, Georgeanne] Univ Missouri, Truman Sch Publ Affairs, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Central University of Finance & Economics; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Artz, G (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Agr & Appl Econ Dept, 215 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",artzg@missouri.edu,"Yu, Li/AAI-9671-2020",,,,,,42,20,27,0,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This short note sketches the argument and explores under what conditions the assertion holds. The positive predictive value (PPV) is lower than 1/2 if the a priori probability of the truth of a hypothesis is low. However, computation of the PPV includes only significant results. If both significant and non-significant results are taken into account the total error ratio (TER) will not exceed 1/2 provided no extremely large publication bias is present. Moreover, it is shown that theory-driven research may reduce the proportion of errors. Also, the role of replications is emphasized; replication studies of original research are so important because they drastically decrease the error ratio.","ETH Zurich Soziol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Diekmann, A (通讯作者)，ETH Zurich Soziol, CLU D 3,Clausiusstr 50, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",diekmann@soz.gess.ethz.ch,"Diekmann, Andreas/E-3624-2014","Diekmann, Andreas/0000-0002-7344-5591",,,,,15,5,5,0,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

They have erroneously been used to help estimate the level of travel in congested networks. We argue that supply curves, which track vehicles in their passage through congested networks, are needed for this purpose, and that they differ from the performance curves generated from MFD. We use a microsimulation model, DRACULA and two networks, one synthesizing the network for Cambridge, England, and one of the city of York, England, to explore the nature of performance curves and supply curves under differing patterns of demand. We show that supply curves differ from performance curves once the onset of congestion is reached, and that the incorrect use of performance curves to estimate demand can thus seriously underestimate traffic levels, the costs of congestion, and the value of congestion relief measures. We also show that network aggregated supply curves are sensitive to the temporal distribution of demand and, potentially, to the spatial distribution of demand. The shape of the supply curve also differs between origin destination movements within a given network. We argue that supply curves for higher levels of demand cannot be observed in normal traffic conditions, and specify ways in which they can be determined from microsimulation and, potentially, by extrapolating observed data. We discuss the implications of these findings for conventional modelling of network management policies, and for these policies themselves. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As an addition to the bargaining set for a global climate negotiation, trade in principle widens the range of jointly beneficial potential outcomes and can in this sense be a potential facilitator of an agreed global climate regime. The reverse is also true that in a linked climatetradefinance global policy coordination structure that goes well beyond what was envisioned at Bretton Woods, climate now added to the global policy bargaining set also offers the prospect of potentially stronger trade disciplines (and even beyond WTO disciplines being negotiated). Trade policy can as well be an instrument for the implementation of a global climate regime, since trade provides a mechanism for achieving an internalisation outcome for the global externality that climate change represents and that provides a potentially more efficient outcome and also helps meet distributional objectives. In short, trade added to the emerging post-2012 climate regime can both expand the bargaining set for both (effectively linked) negotiations and additionally provide an instrument for the implementation of an agreed outcome.","[Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada; [Whalley, John] CIGI, London, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Whalley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,25,8,8,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2011,34.0,11,,,SI,,1844.0,1862,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01422.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,864SE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298259500002,0

This is accomplished by modeling the behavior of receivers in response to financial incentives, and the ensuing behavior of the carrier in response to both pricing and the receivers' decisions concerning off-hour deliveries. The analytical formulations consider both the base case condition, and a mixed operation with both regular hour and off-hour deliveries; two pricing schemes: cordon time of day, and time-distance pricing; two types of operations: single-tour, and multi-tour carriers; and three different scenarios in terms of profitability of the carrier operation, which include an approximation to the best case, the expected value, and the worst case. The analyses, both theoretical and numerical, highlight the limitations of pricing-only approaches. In the case of cordon time of day pricing, the chief conclusion is that it is of limited use as a freight demand management tool because: (1) in a competitive market the cordon toll cannot be transferred to the receivers as it is a fixed cost and (2) the structure of the cost function, that only provides an incentive to the carrier to switch to the off-hours when all the receivers in the tour switch to the off-hours. The analyses of time-distance pricing clearly indicate that, though its tolls could be transferred to the receivers and provide an incentive for behavior change, the magnitude of the expected toll transfers under real life conditions are too small to have any meaningful impact on receivers choice of delivery times. In essence, the key policy implication is that in order to change the joint behavior of carrier and receivers, financial incentives-or programs that foster unassisted off-hour deliveries-should be made available to receivers in exchange for their commitment to do off-hour deliveries. As the paper proves, if a meaningful number of receivers switch to the off-hours, the carriers are likely to follow suit. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To avoid loss of ridership, transit authorities have focussed on improving the punctuality of routes that operate using timetables. This paper presents a new approach to generating run-time values that is based on analytical development and micro simulations. The work utilizes previous research (described herein) and the experience acquired by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) in operating bus routes based on timetables. Using a sample of historical data, the method used for generating run-time values consists of the following steps: purging and screening atypical trips, based on the consideration of confidence intervals for median trips; segmenting the day into time bands based on the introduction of a new hierarchical classification algorithm; creating initial run-time values based on criteria derived from statistical analysis; adjusting and validating initial run-time values using micro simulations; and evaluating incident-recovery times at the end of trips in order to guarantee the punctual departure of the next trip in the vehicle schedule. To favour service improvement, we also introduced certain indicators that can identify the root causes of non-compliance. As a final step, in order to ensure the applicability and use of the model, we promoted the development of our model within the framework of the HASTUS (TM) software solution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, an extended continuous time probability model is used to examine households' transitions from renting to owning and subsequent possible transitions either back to rental tenure or to another owned home during our three observation periods. Coefficient estimates show that financial variables such as house price appreciation and out-of-pocket housing cost play an important role in determining all the transitions. In addition, the analysis demonstrates the interesting result that the cumulative likelihoods of homeownership derived from the model are consistently lower than the probabilities of an initial transition to homeownership from rental tenure during the observation period.

Much of the language of European cohesion policy eschews the idea of trade-offs between efficiency and equity, suggesting it is possible to maximize overall growth while also achieving continuous convergence in outcomes and productivity across Europe's regions. Yet, given the rise in inter-regional disparities, it is unclear that cohesion policy has altered the pathway of development from what would have occurred in the absence of intervention. This article draws on geographical economics, institutionalist social science and endogenous growth theory, with the aim of providing a fresh look at cohesion policy. By highlighting a complex set of potential trade-offs and interrelations - overall growth and efficiency; inter-territorial equity; territorial democracy and governance capacities; and social equity within places - it revisits the rationale of cohesion policy, with particular attention to the geographical dynamics of economic development.","[Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] IMDEA, Madrid, Spain; [Farole, Thomas] World Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Storper, Michael] Inst Etud Polit Paris, Paris, France",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; IMDEA Materials Institute; The World Bank,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodriguez-Pose, Andres/B-8746-2008","Rodriguez-Pose, Andres/0000-0002-8041-0856",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,198,203,2,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The level of subsidies distributed to a region and the location of manufacturing activities are increasing in the region's relative political participation rate. The standard prediction in the economic geography literature, that the larger region becomes the core when trade barriers are reduced, no longer holds. The establishment of manufacturing production in the economically smaller region is increasing in the level of regional integration. As trade is increasingly liberalized, the economy features a reversed core-periphery equilibrium. Empirical evidence shows that the model is consistent with qualitative features of the data, and the results are robust to an instrumental variable strategy that accounts for the potential endogeneity of voter turnout.

We use longitudinal micro-level data with information on demographic events, household structure and socioeconomic status. The main finding is that the socioeconomic gradient is a very recent phenomenon. While mortality fell in all socioeconomic groups it was not until the 1950s that a socioeconomic gradient appeared, and then only among adults in working ages. For the elderly, we find no significant mortality differentials between various social groups at any time. These results are consistent with the divergence hypothesis, although this process started much later than previously thought, and was not an immediate consequence of industrialization.

The Downsian model assumes that each elector votes on the basis of his utility function which depends only on the distance between his preferred policy platform and the ones proposed by candidates. A succession of papers introduces valence issues into the model, i.e., candidates' characteristics which are independent of the platforms they propose. So far, little is known about which of the existing utility functions used in valence models is the most empirically founded. Using a large survey run prior to the 2007 French presidential election, we evaluate and compare several spatial voting models with valence. Existing models perform poorly in fitting the data. However, strong empirical regularities emerge. This leads us to a new model of valence that we call the intensity valence model. This new model makes sense theoretically and is grounded empirically.","[Hollard, Guillaume] Paris Sch Econ, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Hollard, Guillaume] CNRS, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Gouret, Fabian] Univ Barcelona, Dept Teoria Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Gouret, Fabian] Univ Barcelona, CAEPS, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Rossignol, Stephane] Univ Paris 05, UFR Math & Informat, F-75006 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Universite Paris Cite,"Hollard, G (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",fabiangouret@ub.edu; hollard@univ-paris1.fr; rossignol@math.uvsq.fr,"Gouret, Fabian/AAF-9009-2020","Gouret, Fabian/0000-0002-5891-5452",,,,,34,13,14,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2011,37.0,2,,,,,309.0,340,,10.1007/s00355-010-0495-0,0.0,,,32,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,775SI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291483300006,0

The incorporation thesis argues that unions merely implement policy over which they have had little influence. The critical engagement thesis suggests that there may be union gains, but these are emergent. The article reviews key debates and considers the key outcomes of the union learning representative initiative. It argues that models of union learning are shaped by union character, structure and organizational priorities and afford space for unions to develop their representative and regulatory capacity. New forms of activism, formal and informal representative roles offer avenues for exploring the changing nature of industrial relations and workplace representation.","[Rainbird, Helen] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Stuart, Mark] Univ Leeds, Ctr Employment Relat Innovat & Change, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Birmingham; University of Leeds,"Rainbird, H (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Univ House, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",h.rainbird@bham.ac.uk,"Stuart, Mark/AAX-3529-2020","Stuart, Mark/0000-0003-4962-6496",,,,,51,16,18,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This article presents an empirical test of workforce intermediation through a study of community colleges in North Carolina. It demonstrates the positive contribution of intermediary colleges in increasing access to jobs in the pharmaceutical and bioprocessing industries. It also considers the limits of this strategy when adopted by only a subset of colleges within a larger labor market region and, specifically, the challenges this creates for forging strong relationships with employers outside the jurisdictional boundaries of individual colleges. The authors conclude by considering policy options for extending the reach of intermediation across the regional labor market through greater intercollege coordination. The authors argue that coordination efforts in North Carolina, although still in their infancy, hold considerable promise for other college systems that are looking to position themselves as institutional leaders in intermediation.","[Lowe, Nichola; Donegan, Mary] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Goldstein, Harvey] MODUL Univ, Publ Governance & Management Program, Vienna, Austria",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Lowe, N (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, 303 New E Bldg CB 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",nlowe@unc.edu,,,,,,,26,15,17,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Successive governments in Athens had failed to overcome endemic problems of low competitiveness, trade and investment imbalances, and fiscal mismanagement placing the economy in a vulnerable international position. Once the market crisis erupted, the European Union's Council of Ministers and the European Central Bank failed to provide a timely and effective response. The implications are threefold: the constraints on domestic reform proved immutable to EU stimuli; the 'euro' is more vulnerable to crisis than previously acknowledged; and the early discussion on 'euro' governance reform suggests that its underlying philosophy has not shifted significantly towards more effective 'economic governance'. This article explores the antecedents and management of the crisis and assesses the outcome. At the EU level, a paradox was evident in the denial of agency and resources that might limit the obligation of states to rescue an errant peer. Domestically, within Greece, the unprecedented external monitoring and policing of its economy - though matched by some initial successes - raises in the longer term sensitive issues of legitimacy and governability, with uncertain prospects for avoiding further crises.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Hellen Observ, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Featherstone, K (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Hellen Observ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.featherstone@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,82,182,200,3,210,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

It examines how young people understand their own unique positions and the possibilities open to them through their aspirations and future orientations to employment and family life. These young people do not anticipate postponing work identities, but rather embrace post-school options such as gaining qualifications, work experience and achieving financial security. Boys expected a distant involvement in family life secondary to participation in paid work. In contrast, around half the girls simultaneously expected a future involving primary care-giving and an autonomous, independent career, suggesting attempts to remake gendered inequalities.","[McDonald, Paula] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Management, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Pini, Barbara] Curtin Univ, John Curtin Inst Publ Policy, Perth, WA, Australia; [Bailey, Janis] Griffith Univ, Dept Employment Relat & Human Resources, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Curtin University; Griffith University,"McDonald, P (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Management, POB 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",p.mcdonald@qut.edu.au,"; Price, Robin/I-9856-2012","Pini, Barbara/0000-0002-8093-7017; Price, Robin/0000-0003-3795-7351; McDonald, Paula/0000-0002-3549-4691",,,,,52,51,64,1,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In the USA, some have suggested that as much as one-third of the workforce might be vulnerable to such outsourcing. However, the labour market impacts of this displacement are difficult to assess using purely analytical or statistical approaches. In this paper, simulation methods are used to understand how sensitive the US economy and labour market are to increases in services imports. Specifically, the scenario examined assumes that the share of imported services in total employment increases from 0.8 per cent to 7.25 per cent over a time horizon in which workers are unable to change occupations. In response, it is found that all industries increase their use of imported services and their use of the composite input that is comprised of imported services and tradable labour. With the exception of legal workers, all workers in tradable occupations experience declines in their real wages. Demand for non-tradable occupations labour rises in the industries that expand the most, while demand falls in shrinking industries. The non-tradable occupations that are used intensively in the shrinking industries experience declines in real wages, while the real wages rise for workers in non-tradable occupations used intensively in the expanding industries.","[Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Hertel, Thomas W.; Walmsley, Terrie L.] Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,,,,"Walmsley, Terrie/0000-0001-9748-7844",,,,,42,4,7,3,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2011,34.0,2,,,,,192.0,222,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01297.x,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,723UR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287533300002,0

These systems, or transnational regions, affect global economics, politics and diplomacy. Latin America is a widely recognised and documented transnational region. It contains subregional nation systems that might have all of the characteristics and significance of regions and might also affect the broader integration of Latin America. The author defines regionality on the basis of economic integration and measures it with two methods for Latin America, North America, three Latin American subregional systems and one arbitrarily defined nation system within Latin America. He finds a high degree of integration in Latin America, the Andean nations and the Southern Cone of South America. He finds only a modest degree of integration in North America and not significantly greater integration in South America than in Latin America. The division of Latin America into subregions is consistent with the incidence of sub-regional trade initiatives in the past two decades and might be at least partly responsible for the limited progress to date towards Latin America-wide integration. Latin American subregions might now be providing a foundation on which to build regionalism in the future.","US Natl Def Univ, Washington, DC USA",National Defense University - USA,"Berg, GC (通讯作者)，US Natl Def Univ, Washington, DC USA.",,,,,,,,31,1,2,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2011,34.0,2,,,,,298.0,312,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01321.x,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,723UR,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287533300006,0

A basic proposition is that MV follows from EU under the assumption of quadratic utility. A less recognized proposition, first raised by Markowitz, is that MV is fully justified under EU, if and only if utility is quadratic. The existing proof of this proposition relies on an assumption from EU, described here as Buridan's axiom after the French philosopher's fable of the ass that starved out of indifference between two bales of hay. To satisfy this axiom, MV must represent not only pure strategies, but also their probability mixtures, as points in the (sigma, mu) plane. Markowitz and others have argued that probability mixtures are represented sufficiently by (sigma, mu) only under quadratic utility, and hence that MV, interpreted as a mathematical re-expression of EU, implies quadratic utility. We prove a stronger form of this theorem, not involving or contradicting Buridan's axiom, nor any more fundamental axiom of utility theory.","[Johnstone, D.

We focus on factor models that account for mixed-frequency data and missing observations at the end of the sample. These are data irregularities applied forecasters have to cope with in real time. To extract the factors from the irregular data, special factor estimation techniques are necessary, expanding on the standard approaches for balanced data such as principal components (PC). The estimation methods include variants of the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm together with PC and factor estimation using state-space models. Given the estimated factors, forecasts can be obtained from bridge equations, mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) regressions and the Kalman smoother applied to fully-fledged factor models in state-space form. Empirical applications for German GDP growth often find that forecasts based on factor models are informative only a few months ahead compared to naive benchmarks. Thus, these models can be regarded as short-term forecast tools only. However, the factor models estimated on mixed-frequency data with missing observations tend to outperform factor models based on balanced data time-aggregated from high-frequency data.","Deutsch Bundesbank, Res Ctr, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Schumacher, C (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Res Ctr, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",christian.schumacher@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,61,5,5,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

He claimed that the ban on exporting grain from Bohemia led to a distortion of prices and to a welfare loss for domestic agriculture. Independently of Adam Smith he arrived at similar arguments but also held that liberalization would improve public morality and thus enhance general welfare. Though now largely forgotten, Schindler's one book on economics is an interesting example for the use of physiocratic arguments intended to make Joseph II abandon traditional cameralist policies. The Catholic Enlightenment had a strong influence on Schindler's concern that trade protectionism may suborn the moral corruption of society.","St Norbert Coll, De Pere, WI 54115 USA",,"Grassl, W (通讯作者)，St Norbert Coll, De Pere, WI 54115 USA.",wolfgang.grassl@snc.edu,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,5,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

We model their costs, exploiting the fact that the seven existing RTOs initiated their various functions at different points in time over their roughly ten-year history. Specifically, we investigate the costs of each of the market functions administered by RTOs, the relative costliness of different RTOs in petforming the same functions, the possibility of learning economies from either their individual or industry-wide experience, and economies of scale over the sampled range of RTO output. Our results confirm the importance of some of these factors but raise doubts about others, in all cases based on systematic modeling and data analysis. doi : 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-No4-7","[Kwoka, John] Northeastern Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Kwoka, J (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Dept Econ, 301 Lake Hall, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",j.kwoka@neu.edu,,,,,,,20,8,9,0,9,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2011,32.0,4,,,,,159.0,181,,10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-No4-7,0.0,,,23,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,824GI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295190000007,0

For the general site-directed mutagenesis, sequencing is the only choice to confirm the mutant clone; however in our protocol, named OE-PCR-S1, we not only improved the efficiency with Dpn I, but also used mismatch cleavage by S1 nuclease to replace sequencing to screen the mutants, which made the protocol more rapid and labour efficient and less expensive. We have used it for Foc, and have successfully deleted three bases from a pathogenic gene, FOW1 (EU795421). The mutant DNA can be inserted into an expression vector and transformed into Foc for functional domain analysis.

We also calculate the price changes implied by China's net oil import growth from a longer-term supply and demand shift perspective. doi: 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-No4-4","[Mu, Xiaoyi] Univ Dundee, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Ye, Haichun] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",University of Dundee; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Mu, XY (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Carnegie Bldg, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",mxiaoyi@gmail.com; haichunye@gmail.com,,"Mu, Xiaoyi/0000-0002-3280-6426",Carnegie Trust,"Carnegie Trust(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","We thank Kevin Forbs, Ian Lange, Zhen Zhu, two anonymous referees, the journal editor James Smith and other seminar participants at University of Stirling and University of Dundee for helpful comments, Audrey McLaughlin for helping us proofread the paper.

Samples were taken almost exclusively from cultivated bananas (around 20 different cultivars) in smallholder and backyard plots. In total, 178 isolates were received and, of these, 135 have been assigned a VCG. Isolates have tested positive for the following VCGs or VCG complexes: 0120/15, 0121, 0123, 0124/5, 0126, 01213/16, 01218 and 01219. VCG 01213/16 (the so-called tropical race 4, TR4) was by far the most prevalent strain detected, accounting for approximately 60% of the positive results. It was most commonly isolated from the cultivars 'Barangan' (syn. 'Lakatan', AAA) and 'Pisang Raja' (AAB) and was detected in Sumatra (Aceh and West Sumatra), Java (West Java and Yogyakarta), Kalimantan (West and East Kalimantan), Sulawesi (South East and North Sulawesi) and Papua. These findings highlight the wide distribution of Foc TR4 in Indonesia and the importance of managing its spread.","[O'Neill, W.

This is true in radical international political economy, where, for example, it was the subject of (often polarised) debates between Giovanni Arrighi and David Harvey prior to Arrighi's death in 2009. This reflected a broader debate in IPE between development theory and radical globalisation analysis. The key point of contention is whether China's rise represents a challenge to or further consolidation of neoliberal hegemony on a global scale. This article critically scrutinises some of the key assumptions of the radical globalisation approach, specifically, that China represents another form of the 'competition state' whose development aspirations have been radically constrained by global 'new constitutionalism' and American monetary power so as to conform to neoliberalism. Deploying a structurationist approach to global governance and an eclectic/regulatory analysis of the Chinese state, I argue that China has challenged neoliberalism by projecting its growing power through constitutionalised global governance. In the face of (declining) American power, global constitutionalism has provided an opportunity structure that may help China consolidate its long-term strategy of consensual development. Far from anchoring 'neoliberal hegemony', global economic governance is increasingly central to its unravelling.","Lincoln Univ, Sch Social Sci, Brayford LN6 7TS, Lincoln, England",University of Lincoln,"Strange, G (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Sch Social Sci, Brayford LN6 7TS, Lincoln, England.",gstrange@lincoln.ac.uk,,,,,,,57,30,30,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Success of banana breeding depends mainly on the use of natural diploids and/or developing superior synthetic diploids. India has nurtured the development of a number of wild and parthenocarpic diploids harbouring resistant gene sources for a number of biotic and abiotic factors. Present study on 15 diploids includes nine parthenocarpic and six wild diploid accessions of which ten are indigenous and five are exotic introductions. They have been evaluated for various traits like resistance to nematodes, weevils and borers, Fusarium wilt, leaf spot complex and reaction to drought. Based on their usefulness of traits, diploids were included in the breeding programme either directly or through development of synthetic diploids. This paper reports on the results of evaluation of these 15 diploids for their fertility status, breeding behaviour and compatibility status with other diploid and triploid parents. The paper also provides baseline information on factors affecting seed set, like temperature and relative humidity, extent of seed set in 79 diploid cross combinations, percent of good seeds with viable embryos, germination time (10-432 days), germination success ( 0-92%) and regeneration capacity ( 2.5-98.3%). This baseline information will be useful in selecting parents for future breeding programmes with better success in seed yield. The poor germination and regeneration of hybrid seeds into plantlets reiterates the need for standardised techniques for embryo rescue for better success in improvement of banana through classical breeding.","[Uma, S.; Mustaffa, M.

This paper proposes a new statistical method to address this issue. This method, known as the dynamic conditional correlation GARCH model, enables us to study the dynamics of the correlation between the two markets over time and enrich our understanding of the public and private market pricing of real assets. We find that the correlation between NAV returns and REIT returns is dynamic for all REIT types and there is a strong degree of persistence in the series of correlation. Our Granger-causality tests show that price discovery generally takes place in the securitized public market. However, we also find significant variations across property types and individual firms within each type. Our results indicate that constructing an optimal portfolio requires firm level analysis of causality and correlation between REIT returns and NAV returns.","[Yavas, Abdullah] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business Adm, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Yildirim, Yildiray] Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Syracuse University,"Yavas, A (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business Adm, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",ayavas@psu.edu; yildiray@syr.edu,,,,,,,34,28,29,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The results suggest a strong systematic co-movement between wheat production and ship traffic, with less evidence for wine production and stock-herding activities. While ship traffic created demand for wheat exports, the size of the co-movement provides evidence that ship traffic also stimulated local demand through secondary and tertiary sector activities, supporting the hypothesis that ship traffic acted as a catalyst for growth in the Cape economy.","[Boshoff, Willem H.; Fourie, Johan] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Boshoff, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, Private Bag 11, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",johanf@sun.ac.za,"Boshoff, Willem H./D-7182-2012","Fourie, Johan/0000-0002-7341-017X; Boshoff, Willem/0000-0003-1520-3997",,,,,69,25,26,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

We propose an infinite-horizon optimizing model of an open economy with a fixed rate of time preference that explains these empirics. In this type of economy, households consume both durable and non-durable goods, firms operate under costly investment, and all the transactions involving consumption and investment are subject to cash-in-advance (CIA) constraints. Employing the new 'sign restriction' identification procedure due to Uhlig (J Mone't Econ 52(2)381-419, 2005), we corroborate the empirical validity of the proposed model. In order to verify the robustness of our results, we consider another shock, namely, productivity shock in our empirical analysis and find that while productivity shock dominates in the case of the US, inflationary shock has a dominating effect in the case of the UK, Canada, and Italy.","[Mallick, Sushanta K.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London E1 4NS, England; [Mohsin, Mohammed] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Mallick, SK (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",s.k.mallick@qmul.ac.uk,,"Mallick, Sushanta/0000-0003-3851-3680",,,,,50,44,44,1,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Two payment vehicles were used to elicit WTP: park entry fee and cave entry fee. The main contribution of this paper is the joint estimation of the two payment vehicles using the multivariate probit model by allowing the error terms of the two models to be correlated. Emphasis was given to testing whether parameters of the two bid levels should be constrained and to overcoming anchoring bias. The estimated median WTP for cave and park entry fees when accounting for anchoring effect and constrained parameters was AU$10.20 and AU$16.40, respectively. Without correcting for the anchoring effect, the WTP probability is overestimated for lower bids and underestimated for higher bids.","[Tapsuwan, Sorada] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia; [Burton, Michael; Perriam, James] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Western Australia,"Tapsuwan, S (通讯作者)，CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Private Bag 5, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia.",sorada.tapsuwan@csiro.au,"Tapsuwan, Sorada/G-5869-2010; burton, michael/A-9541-2009","Tapsuwan, Sorada/0000-0002-8160-3828; burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093",,,,,26,13,13,0,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This helps to create an international diversification strategy for direct real estate. We use constrained cross-section regression with dummy variables for regions and property types to measure the best risk reducer. We analyze the impact of currency changes on total returns by looking at a hedged and un-hedged portfolio, both stock and equally weighted. The findings show that geographic factors have the largest influence on the volatility of international real estate returns. The average variance of the regional effects is higher than the property type effects and therefore the regional effects have a higher influence on the variation of the total portfolio. However, the regional effects are less stable through time, compared with the variance and correlation of the property type effects. Also the property type effect seems to become a more important factor for the return over time, especially when the return is expressed in local currency.","ING Real Estate Select, London EC2R 7BP, England",,"de Wit, I (通讯作者)，ING Real Estate Select, 25 Copthall Ave, London EC2R 7BP, England.",Ivo.deWit@INGRealEstate.com,,,,,,,28,6,10,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Using data collected on treated and controls 18 and 48 months after randomization, it is shown that the offer of the subsidy had important impacts on participants' marriage and divorce decisions. Treated participants who reported being unmarried prior to randomization were 42% more likely to be married 48 months after opening an account than similar control group members. The offer to receive the subsidy is also shown to substantially increase the divorce rates for originally married participants, with the most pronounced effect occurring among women with children or those who reported poor spousal relations prior to randomization. Although the exact mechanisms for how the subsidy affects such decisions are unclear, homeownership is shown to have an important role. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the determinants of privatization by applying the probit model for a data set of special public corporations in Japan. In December 2001, the Japanese government made a resolution to consider the privatization of special public corporations, evaluating 74 special public corporations for possible privatization. In the empirical analysis on the determinants of privatization, we find that among several factors affecting privatization decisions, two are important-the market condition factor and the policy/regulation factor. As for market conditions, a public corporation which exists in a commercialized industry is about 20% more likely to be privatized than others. As for the policy and regulation factor, the public corporation's privatization under a single regulator is about 25% more likely, compared with the public corporation's privatization under multiple regulators.","[Mizutani, Fumitoshi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Uranishi, Shuji] Fukuyama Heisei Univ, Fac Business Adm, Fukuyama, Hiroshima 7200001, Japan",Kobe University,"Mizutani, F (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",toshi@kobe-u.ac.jp; uranishi@heisei-u.ac.jp,"Mizutani, Fumitoshi/Q-7400-2019","Mizutani, Fumitoshi/0000-0002-9063-6090",,,,,21,3,4,0,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This trend has exerted an important macroeconomic effect maintaining a long lasting housing bubble and contributing significantly to finance the rising current account deficit. Foreign real estate investment in Spain is mostly of a housing acquisition type and therefore the analysis of its determinants requires a specific approach. In this sense, neither a pure foreign direct investment nor a portfolio theoretical model might be useful. So we propose a modelling of foreign real estate investment for Spain from the point of view of a demand for tourism services and from a financial focus. Using time series data from 1990 to 2007 the hypothesis arising from our foreign real estate investment modelling reveals the consistency of this approach. There seem to be relevant determinants from the demand side and from the financial dimension. Indeed, Gross Domestic Product per capita, expected capital gains, travel costs, tourism agglomeration and housing prices are all relevant factors explaining Foreign real estate investment. We consider that this case study may also be applied to other countries sharing similar foreign real estate investment type flows.","[Rodriguez, Carlos; Bustillo, Ricardo] Univ Basque Country, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Rodríguez, C (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",carlos.rodriguezg@ehu.es; ricardo.bustillo@ehu.es,"Rodriguez, Carlos/DNT-3892-2022; MESANZA, RICARDO BUSTILLO/Y-1197-2019","Rodriguez, Carlos/0000-0001-6629-2147; MESANZA, RICARDO BUSTILLO/0000-0001-7246-8735",,,,,21,38,41,2,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Yet scholars and practitioners assessing IO performance frequently focus on traditional modes of governance such as treaties and inter-state dispute-resolution mechanisms. When they observe poor performance, moreover, they often prescribe a strengthening of those same activities. We call this reliance on traditional state-based mechanisms International Old Governance (IOG). A better way to understand and improve IO performance is to consider the full range of ways in which IOs can and do operate-including, increasingly, by reaching out to private actors and institutions, collaborating with them, and supporting and shaping their activities. Such actions are helping to develop an intricate global network of public, private and mixed institutions and norms, partially orchestrated by IOs, that we call Transnational New Governance (TNG). With proper orchestration by IOs, TNG can ameliorate both state failure-the inadequacies of IOG-and market failure-the problems that result when the creation and evolution of norm-setting institutions is highly decentralized. Orchestration thus provides a significant way for IOs to improve their regulatory performance. Some IOs already engage actively with private actors and institutions-we provide a range of illustrations, highlighting the activities of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). Yet there remains a significant orchestration deficit that provides real opportunities for IOs. We draw on the lessons of existing IO activities to suggest additional possibilities for improving IO performance.","[Snidal, Duncan] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Abbott, Kenneth W.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Sandra Day OConnor Coll Law, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University of Chicago; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Snidal, D (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Dept Polit Sci, 5828 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",Ken.Abbott@asu.edu; Snidal@uchicago.edu,"Snidal, Duncan/IIS-1718-2023","Snidal, Duncan/0000-0003-2098-7634; Abbott, Kenneth W./0000-0002-5540-1683",,,,,71,191,208,2,81,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Partnership agreements continue the procedural bias of traditional British collective agreements representing the lowest common denominator of agreement - unions work towards the success of the enterprise in return for involvement in employers' decisions.

In this empirical study, we develop and apply a cardinal measure of risk attitudes to analyze not only the existence, but also the strength of this phenomenon. Since probability levels involved in decision problems are already known to have a strong impact on behavior, we use this approach to study the impact of probabilities on the extent of the response mode bias. We find that the direction in which probabilities influence measured risk aversion is the opposite in the certainty equivalence (CE) method versus in the probability equivalence (PE) method. Utilizing the CE elicitation approach leads to an increase of risk seeking for gambles involving high probabilities. For the PE method, subjects tend to behave risk averse with gambles of high probabilities. This behavior is reversed in the gain domain. This tailwhip effect is consistently replicated in several experiments, involving both loss and gain domains of lotteries.","[Schwand, Christopher] IMC Univ Appl Sci Krems, A-3500 Krems, Austria; [Vetschera, Rudolf; Wakolbinger, Lea M.] Univ Vienna, Dept Business Adm, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Schwand, C (通讯作者)，IMC Univ Appl Sci Krems, Piaristengasse 1, A-3500 Krems, Austria.",christopher.schwand@fh-krems.ac.at; rudolf.vetschera@univie.ac.at; lea.wakolbinger@univie.ac.at,,"Vetschera, Rudolf/0000-0003-2809-8989",,,,,58,7,8,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2010,69.0,3,,,,,395.0,416,,10.1007/s11238-010-9193-8,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,627WL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280074600004,0

Given the non-stationary but cointegrated nature of the panel data, panel cointegration estimation techniques are employed. The results show that tourists are sensitive to price changes in South Africa and also to tourism price changes in compering destinations. The level of development, tourism infrastructure, distance (or transportation costs), common border and language are also found to affect arrivals.

One player has to use a finite automaton while the other player has to use a finite perceptron. Some examples illustrate that the sets of strategies which are induced by these two types of machines are different and not ordered by set inclusion. Repeated game payoffs are evaluated according to the limit of means. The main result establishes that a cooperation at almost all stages of the game is an equilibrium outcome if the complexity of the machines the players may use is limited enough and if the length T of the repeated game is sufficiently large. This result persists when more than T states are allowed in the player's automaton. We further consider a variant of the model in which the two players are restricted to choosing strategies which are implementable by perceptrons and prove that the players can cooperate at most of the stages provided that the complexity of their perceptrons is sufficiently reduced.,"[Beal, Sylvain] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Beal, Sylvain] Univ St Etienne, CREUSET, St Etienne, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite Jean Monnet,"Béal, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",beals@gredeg.cnrs.fr,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2010,69.0,2,,,,,183.0,204,,10.1007/s11238-009-9158-y,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,628BY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280090600002,0

Several transit agencies try to be competitive through offering faster service, such as limited-stop (express) bus service This study uses AVL and APC data, in addition to a disaggregate data obtained from a travel behavior survey, to select stops and estimate run times for a new limited-stop service that will run parallel to a heavily used bus route (67 Saint-Michel) in Montreal. Canada Three different scenarios are developed based on theory and practice to select stops to be incorporated in the new limited service. The time savings for each scenario are then evaluated as a range and a fourth scenario is developed. A limited-stop service is recommended based on selecting stops serving both directions of the route, major activity points and stop spacing. This study shows that implementing a limited-stop service would yield substantial time savings for both, the new limited service and the existing regular service running in parallel.

The advantage of this estimator is that it takes into account the exact likelihood function while avoiding the huge computational burden associated with MCMC methods and without the ad hoc assumption that certain bond yields are measured without error. The proposed methodology is implemented and tested on simulated data. For realistic parameter values the estimator seems to have good small sample properties, compared to the popular quasi maximum likelihood approach, even using moderate simulation sizes. The effect of simulation errors does not seem to undermine the estimation procedure.","UBS Investment Res, London EC2M 2PP, England",,"De Rossi, G (通讯作者)，UBS Investment Res, 1 Finsbury Ave, London EC2M 2PP, England.",Giuliano.De-Rossi@ubs.com,,,,,,,28,19,19,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Immigrants are found to be more often unemployed in countries where natives have higher unemployment rates. Immigrants' unemployment rates are lower in countries with a larger segment of low-status jobs, with higher immigration rates and with a higher GDP per capita. Destination countries' integration policies and welfare state regimes do not affect the unemployment risk of immigrants. At the level of origin countries, immigrants from more politically stable and free, more developed and more wealthy societies are found to be less often unemployed. Immigrants coming from Islamic countries have higher rates of unemployment, while those originating from Western Europe are less likely to be unemployed.","[Fleischmann, Fenella] Univ Utrecht, ERCOMER, Dept Interdisciplinary Social Sci ASW, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Dronkers, Jaap] Maastricht Univ, Res Ctr Educ & Labour Market ROA, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Fleischmann, Fenella] Univ Leuven, Ctr Social & Cultural Psychol, Louvain, Belgium",Utrecht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); KU Leuven,"Fleischmann, F (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, ERCOMER, Dept Interdisciplinary Social Sci ASW, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",f.fleischmann@uu.nl; J.dronkers@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Fleischmann, Fenella/E-7984-2013","Fleischmann, Fenella/0000-0001-5121-885X",,,,,21,94,108,2,62,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

At the same time, while all countries will experience impacts from climate change, developing countries are the most vulnerable. Significant financial assistance for adaptation is therefore needed for developing countries, but current proposals are inadequate. Solutions to the challenges of both aviation greenhouse gas emissions and climate change adaptation finance are thus urgently required.

Vacant land, being a major raw material for development of real estate, is traded by developers who actively manage development risk for profit. Real estate, being a long lived final product, is traded by end-users or investors for use or investment in the secondary market. This study examines price discovery between the two markets. The key question is whether land transactions, in the form of public auctions, convey any new information to the secondary real estate market. Our results suggest unexpected land auction outcomes have both market-wide and local effects on real estate prices. However, the impacts are asymmetric. We found that lower than expected land auction prices have a significant negative market-wide and local impact on real estate prices while higher than expect land auction prices have little or no impact.","[Chau, K.

We exploit a unique nine-year crime panel at the neighborhood level to estimate models that properly address the endogeneity of crime and allow us to overcome other specification errors that have plagued previous studies.

Milgram-Baleix and Ana I. Moro-Egido This paper investigates the determinants of vertical Spanish intra-industry trade with developed and developing countries. We empirically test the comparative advantage explanation. To do so, we build physical, human and technological capital stocks. On average, when using OLS techniques, differences in endowments are a limitation for vertical intra-industry trade. Using quantile regression techniques, we observe that this negative effect decreases in absolute terms as vertical intra-industry trade flows increase and, in some cases, the impact becomes positive for the upper tails, thus supporting the view of a reduced version of the comparative advantage explanation. Our results provide interesting insights into Spain and emerging countries. A large part of Spanish trade already takes place on an inter-industry basis or consists of exporting low quality products in exchange for similar products of a higher quality range, in particular with European countries but more surprisingly with emerging countries. Our study shows that high quality exports and horizontal intra-industry trade are mainly driven by proximities of demand and technological capital while low quality exports share most determinants of inter-industry trade.","[Milgram-Baleix, Juliette; Moro-Egido, Ana I.] Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Milgram-Baleix, J (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",,"Milgram-Baleix, JULIETTE/H-5986-2015; MORO-EGIDO, ANA I./O-3432-2014","Milgram-Baleix, JULIETTE/0000-0002-4793-9977; MORO-EGIDO, ANA I./0000-0002-5992-1408",,,,,45,7,7,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2010,33.0,5,,,,,746.0,777,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01238.x,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,594IG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277529500004,0

Although some clubs achieve consistent success, and a few, consistent failure, most clubs display a cyclical pattern as they make a run for success, then take fallback positions. This behavior is difficult to explain using the now standard league model of Fort and Quirk. In this article, the authors discuss the likelihood of this cyclical behavior emerging in the standard model and then develop an extension to the model, which can generate movements between good (team success) and bad (team failure) equilibria. The authors then discuss the stability conditions for each equilibrium and the conditions under which a club might find one of these equilibria unsustainable in the long run.","[Rockerbie, Duane W.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada; [Easton, Stephen T.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",University of Lethbridge; Simon Fraser University,"Rockerbie, DW (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, 4401 Univ Dr, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",rockerbie@uleth.ca,,,,,,,14,1,2,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

This article highlights the importance of the structure of protection in the relation between trade policy and its potential growth-promoting impact. Evidence is based on a new database on industrial tariffs for the 1870s. The results show that income, factor endowment and policy independence are important for explaining regional asymmetries between tariffs and growth. At a global level, increased protection, measured by total and average tariffs on manufactures, implied more unskilled inefficient protection and less growth, and this is especially true for the poor countries in the late nineteenth century. Protection was only positive for a 'rich club' if we include in this group new settler countries, which grew rapidly in the late nineteenth century and imposed high tariffs mainly for fiscal reasons.","Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ Hist & Inst, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Tena-Junguito, A (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ Hist & Inst, C Madrid 126-28 903, Madrid, Spain.",antonio.tena@uc3m.es,,"Tena-Junguito, Antonio/0000-0002-7845-5406",,,,,60,16,17,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Several studies have documented secular changes in the physical growth of children or of adult height, but seldom have the socioeconomic differences in secular trend been reported. The aim of this study is to examine differences in the secular trend of height, weight and BMI of 10-16-year-old boys enrolled in two schools of opposite socioeconomic makeup in Lisbon, Portugal, in the early and late 20th century. The samples from the upper-middle class come from the Colegio Militar, a military boarding school, and the lower-class samples come from the Cosa No de Lisboa, a residential school for underprivileged boys. While boys from both schools show an approximate increase of 13.6 cm in height, 13.5 kg in weight and 2.4 kg/m(2) in BMI. the Casa Pia Students were shorter and lighter than their Colegick Militar counterparts throughout the 90-year period. Social class differences in mean height, weight and BMI tend to be greater in 1910 than in 2000, but results are statistically significant for height alone. When the two periods are taken together, Colegio Militar boys differ from their Casa No counterparts by approximately 6.4 cm in height, 4.8 kg in weight and 0.4 kg/m(2) in BMI. Both samples show a considerable increase in height, weight and BMI but class differences in height, weight and BMI decreased slightly if at all, throughout the 90-year period. This suggests that socioeconomic disparities are persistent, having diminished only slightly since the early 20th century. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Cardoso, Hugo F.

Many studies have reported on the effectiveness of the directives, mostly in terms of the impact on the openness of public procurement and the impact on cross-border trade. However, research on the explanation (or the lack) of compliance with EU directives is limited. This article identifies the directives which are most sensitive to non-compliance. A multidisciplinary model for explaining compliance is presented, drawing from criminal theory, economics, social psychology and public purchasing. The impact on compliance is quantified, using survey data from purchasing professionals of the Dutch Ministry of Defence. The results indicate that both the expected gains of compliance and the organizational pressure have a positive impact on compliance. In contrast, no support is found for the effect of certainty and severity of sanctions and the perceived resistance of suppliers in case of non-compliance.","[Ghijsen, Paul] Open Univ Netherlands, Fac Management Sci, NL-6419 AT Heerlen, Netherlands",Open University Netherlands,"Ghijsen, P (通讯作者)，Open Univ Netherlands, Fac Management Sci, Valkenburgerweg 177, NL-6419 AT Heerlen, Netherlands.",paul.ghijsen@ou.nl,"Ghijsen, Paul/E-4702-2010",,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/D004853/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/D004853/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,56,13,15,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

However, there is scope to develop this body of work by harnessing recent contributions in the economics literature on cycles or waves in demand. This paper presents a simple economic model of the rise, fall and possible renaissance of the resort. The analysis is based on the work of Cowan et al (1997, 2004), which models waves in consumption when there are interdependencies between consumers. Of particular interest here are the conditions under which we may observe a 'travelling wave', where a new resort starts off as a distinctive and select venue but then, as it grows in Popularity, starts to go downmarket. After the resort has been unfashionable for some time and unattractive associations art: far enough in the past, a new sort of pioneer (accompanied by a new wave of investment) can start off a second wave of popularity. The model presented was motivated by reference to the history of the city of Bath, which enjoyed a long period as a very popular resort and then fell into decline in the 19th century, but enjoyed a renaissance In the mid-20th century to become one of the most Popular medium-sized towns in England.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England",University of Nottingham,"Swann, GMP (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Jubilee Campus,Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",peter.swann@nottigham.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,9,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The addition of this parameter allows the theory to accommodate changes in the decision maker's mood and circumstances, as the saliencies of anticipated consequences are driven by concerns of the moment. By allowing for the number of consequences given attention at the moment of decision to vary, the new model mutes the criticism that SEU models call for an omniscient decision maker. Use of the model is illustrated with a large-scale longitudinal study showing that adolescent smokers have higher utility for smoking than nonsmokers. We also propose to use the model hierarchically to describe everyday decisions that people deal with repeatedly. Big decisions, which set policy, guide a host of nested little decisions, which in turn lead to action. For a little decision, one of the options will be consistent with the policy, and will inherit its high utility. Accordingly, most little decisions will be made quickly and will follow the policy. However, people do sometimes decide to violate their own policies, and we describe how these lapses can lead to collapse of the policy.","[Weiss, Jie W.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Hlth Sci, Fullerton, CA 92831 USA; [Weiss, David J.] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Edwards, Ward] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton; California State University System; California State University Los Angeles; University of Southern California,"Weiss, JW (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Hlth Sci, 800 N State Coll Blvd, Fullerton, CA 92831 USA.",jweiss@fullerton.edu; dweiss@calstatela.edu,,,,,,,51,11,16,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2010,68.0,1-2,,,,,101.0,114,,10.1007/s11238-009-9155-1,0.0,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,545RX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273755400006,0

For a cross-country dataset of product-level bilateral export flows, exporting is found to be a perilous activity, especially in low-income countries. Unobserved individual heterogeneity in product-level export flow data prevails even when a wide range of observed country and product characteristics are controlled for. This questions previous studies that used the Cox proportional hazards model to analyze export survival. Following Meyer (1990), a Prentice-Gloeckler (1978) model is estimated, amended with a gamma mixture distribution summarizing unobserved individual heterogeneity. The empirical results confirm the significance of a range of product-as well as country-specific factors in determining the survival of new export flows. Important for policy-making is the finding of the value of learning-by-doing for export survival: experience with exporting the same product to other markets or different products to the same market is found to strongly increase the chance of export survival. A better understanding of such learning effects could substantially improve the effectiveness of export promotion strategies. Export survival, Cox proportional hazard, low-income countries.

There is increased interest in risk management and insurance to promote agricultural investment and access to credit, and to provide financial stability to farmers and other actors in the agri value chain. The various types of intervention which are made by governments to facilitate agricultural insurance are reviewed, based on the results of a recent international survey conducted by World Bank. Whilst premium subsidy is the most common intervention, other enabling measures are important, such as the legal and regulatory framework, reinsurance, technical and administrative assistance, and linkages to government extension services in agriculture, animal health or meteorology. The main constraints and opportunities for crop and livestock insurance in developing countries are considered, such as insurance product types, hazards, vulnerability, and rural institutions which can support organisation and distribution. Developing appropriate distribution channels, and linking insurance to measures which can increase agricultural productivity, such as credit, farm inputs and services, provide an opportunity where insurance can add benefit to farmers. Insurance in isolation may attract little demand and may not be seen as a value proposition. Agricultural insurance is normally only affordable for exceptional events, and should not crowd out traditional risk coping at household or community levels, and can complement formal savings to manage frequent risk events. Agricultural insurance is complex from technical, organisational and financial standpoints, leading to many challenges for the insurance market and to decisions by government for appropriate intervention. This paper will consider international experiences in developing agricultural insurance, the governments' interventions and relate these to the rapid expansion of the Chinese agricultural insurance market.

We outline an analytical framework which illuminates the various pathways by which state leaders seek to address a principal-agent problem common to all sovereign wealth funds. We suggest that state leaders select corporate governance regimes that mesh with what we call the state's 'governance endowments'. We then substantiate the claim that China's particular governance endowments have led China's leaders to embrace a corporate governance model premised on competition among the state's sovereign wealth investors. We trace the intense bureaucratic conflicts that shaped the creation of CIC and then show how SAFE was subsequently drawn into competition with CIC in the area of high risk, high yield investment. Although China's SWF tournament emerged as a quite unintended consequence of bureaucratic politics, China's leadership has since tacitly endorsed this rivalry because it has supplied the government with valuable carrot and stick mechanisms with which to discipline fund managers.","[Eaton, Sarah] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Eaton, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,"Eaton, Sarah/0000-0002-3416-7867",,,,,66,17,19,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

America's rejection of compulsory government health insurance in the Progressive Era,EXPLORATIONS IN ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health insurance; Social insurance; Self-insurance; Savings; Progressive Era,OLD-AGE INSURANCE; UNITED-STATES; WORKERS-COMPENSATION; SICKNESS; MARKET; MORBIDITY; BENEFIT,"Between 1915 and 1920, 18 U.S. states considered the introduction of compulsory health insurance. Progressive reformers expected state health insurance to be welfare enhancing for American wage-workers since it would result in lower cost insurance and an extension of coverage to more of the population. The evidence presented in this paper indicates that the absence of broad political support for health insurance legislation in this early period reflects that compulsory insurance would not have improved on what was available and affordable through voluntary arrangements and had the potential to reduce the welfare of wage-earners.

It finds that among the 11 variables, only the variable of the propotion of assets of four state-owned commercial banks accounted for the banking industry has a negative effect on international competitiveness of China's financial services trade, the other variables all have positive effects. Among the affecting factors, the role of government is relatively the largest.

The literature's theoretical framework, however, needs to be expanded to be able to adequately address the ways that households and reproductive relations are impacted by the global economy. Addressing this gap, this article attempts to carve out a heuristic space that can more clearly establish variations in the social and economic purpose of households over time and understand how these shifts have been shaped by, and shape, the social relations of capitalism. It then brings this framework to bear on the case study of Canadian neoliberal restructuring, demonstrating that through labour market and welfare restructuring, and the promotion of private and individual social reproduction strategies, the neoliberal state's aggressive reordering of people's daily lives extends too, into the household and spheres of reproduction.","York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",York University - Canada,"LeBaron, G (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",,"LeBaron, Genevieve/JJF-3645-2023; /K-2994-2013",/0000-0003-0083-6126,,,,,49,95,103,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The asymmetry is modeled using Markov-switching in the transitory component in the spirit of Kim and Nelson's (1999) version of Friedman's plucking model. The findings suggest that ignoring the correlation between permanent and transitory movements underestimates the role of permanent movements, whereas ignoring asymmetry in the transitory component underestimates the role of temporary movements in U. S. real GDP. These results imply that both permanent movements and asymmetric transitory shocks are important for explaining post-war output fluctuations in the U.

Large utility-scale electricity storage can decrease the value of energy arbitrage by smoothing differences in prices on- and off-peak, however this price-smoothing effect can result in significant external welfare gains by reducing consumer energy costs and generator profits. As such, the incentives of merchant storage operators, consumers, and generators may not be properly aligned to ensure socially-optimal storage use. We examine storage use incentives for these different agent types and show that under most reasonable market structures a combination of merchant and consumer ownership of storage maximizes potential welfare gains from storage use.","Ohio State Univ, Integrated Syst Engn Dept, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Sioshansi, R (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Integrated Syst Engn Dept, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",sioshansi.1@osu.edu,,,,,,,12,75,85,2,22,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2010,31.0,2,,,,,173.0,198,,,,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,578GP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276281900007,0

As a first approximation, Public Economics a la Musgrave can be understood as a synthesis of Pigovian Public Finance and the Wicksell-Lindahl tradition. Musgrave's intellectual background includes a more encompassing and differentiated spectrum of influences, including elements from German communal traditions, fiscal sociology, Austrian marginal utility theory, and Italian Public Finance. German language Finanzwissenschaft in the interwar period was a fertile environment for new combinations. German-educated US economists Richard Musgrave and Gerhard Colm transformed seeds from this environment into lasting achievements. Their acquaintance with the broad range of approaches characteristic of interwar Finanzwissenschaft was a necessary condition for the role they played in the development of modern Public Economics. Moreover, Musgrave's influence on modern Public Economics is an example of how the dissemination of innovations is enhanced by a suitable expository framework. By contrast, the conceptual gap between Anglo-Saxon Public Economics and Gerhard Colm's version of a synthesis (even though the latter influenced or paralleled the Musgravian synthesis in important respects) prevented its swift absorption.","Graz Univ, Inst Publ Econ, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Sturn, R (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Inst Publ Econ, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",richard.sturn@uni-graz.at,,,,,,,87,22,23,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

The literature generally provides one elasticity estimate for each country, assuming similar response for till households. However, it is possible that different households can have different responses to the same stimuli depending on the household characteristics. Assuming a single elasticity for all households may fail to capture the detailed distributional effect on different socio-economic groups, which is often needed to fully understand the impact of fuel tax measures. This paper presents results from a household level gasoline demand model which accommodates variation in price and income elasticity with increasing income as well as for different socio-economic characteristics in the USA. We find substantial heterogeneity in price and income elasticities based on demographic groupings and income groups. Results of a distributional analysis for a gasoline tax are also Presented using the heterogeneous responses.","[Wadud, Zia] Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Graham, Daniel J.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ctr Transport Studies, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Noland, Robert B.] Rutgers State Univ, Alan M Voorhees Transportat Ctr, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET); Imperial College London; University of London; University College London; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Wadud, Z (通讯作者)，Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh.",,"Noland, Robert B/C-7806-2009; Graham, Daniel/AAA-6157-2021; Wadud, Zia/A-6025-2012","Graham, Daniel/0000-0002-6971-8737; Noland, Robert/0000-0003-0775-0624; Wadud, Zia/0000-0003-2692-8299",Commonwealth Scholarship Commission,Commonwealth Scholarship Commission,This research benefited from funding provided by the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission and was conducted at Imperial College London.,,67,53,56,0,19,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2010,31.0,1,,,,,47.0,74,,,,,,28,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,542ST,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273516200003,0

Past research has not investigated the possible consequences on abortions of these two welfare policies. We construct a theoretical model of low-income CPSW to investigate them. The results of the theory yields the following hypotheses: (1) diversion payments to low-income mothers lower abortion incidence; and (2) diversion payments and CPSW eligibility together raise abortion incidence.

We perform an unobserved components, structural time series analysis of nine regional indexes and two super-regional factors and fit a classic smooth trend plus cycle model. We then apply bivariate unit root tests for absolute and relative convergence of the regions and factors, allowing for the possibility of a structural break. We find the two super-regions have slightly different patterns of trends and cycles until the early to mid-1990s, when a common pattern of strong and sustained price appreciation is seen. The evidence for regional convergence is mixed, with little for the first super-regional factor and some examples of relative convergence within the second factor.

It consists of price discrimination against the losing bidder, who is offered an identical item at the value of his or her highest bid. Prior work has shown that, if the goods are private-value goods and price discrimination is certain, rational bidders can anticipate it and accordingly modify their bidding strategies; this results in revenue loss for the seller. This paper hence examines the impact of randomized price discrimination. It examines a similar, more general problem: a seller has k items of the private-value good. They are sold to N bidders in a two-stage game. The first stage is a sealed-bid first-price auction with N bidders. The second stage is a take-it-or-leave-it offer to each of k - 1 losing bidders; randomized between a fixed-price offer and a second-chance offer. Showing that analytic techniques do not provide complete solutions because bidding strategies are not always monotonic increasing, this paper uses genetic algorithm simulations to determine the Bayesian (near-Nash) equilibrium strategies for bidders and sellers, for N = 8 and different values of k.

The results obtained were mixed. While little evidence of stationarity was detected using univariate methods, rejection of the unit root hypothesis was observed under panel data unit root testing, although rejection was found to be sensitive to cross-sectional variation. In this note the results of Culver and Papell are reconsidered in light of conditional heteroskedasticity detected in the inflation rate series. Using a more appropriate univariate testing procedure combining local-to-unity detrending and joint maximum likelihood estimation of a unit root testing equation and GARCH process, strong evidence in favour of stationarity is detected in 11 of 13 economies examined. In contrast to the univariate findings of Culver and Papell, the results obtained herein using an alternative univariate procedure provide evidence in support of their I(0) inference drawn using panel methods.

However, there is little evidence to support this hypothesis. This study provides an empirical test that measures the impact of the level of institutional investment on the turn-of-the-month effect using a sample of REITs over the period 1980 to 2004. We find that a significant change in the turn-of-the-month effect occurred following the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 which relaxed the requirements on the level of institutional investment in REITs. The evidence suggests that the dramatic rise in institutional holdings can account for a good part of this change. However, the impact of institutional investment may not be as large as some researchers have suspected. There is no evidence to suggest that institutional investment impacts returns on the day when the turn-of-the-month effect is most pronounced, suggesting that this calendar anomaly is not caused exclusively by institutional investors in the market.","[Wiley, Jonathan A.] Coll Charleston, Charleston, SC 29401 USA; [Zumpano, Leonard V.] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL USA",College of Charleston; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Wiley, JA (通讯作者)，Coll Charleston, Charleston, SC 29401 USA.",wileyj@cofc.edu,,,,,,,54,10,10,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Consistent with previous studies, we find that REIT IPOs are associated with lower levels of underpricing relative to traditional issues. We also find that REITs are associated with smaller file price revisions. Both findings are potentially attributable to the lower level of uncertainty associated with pricing REITs. In contrast, using an alternative measure of issuance costs that incorporates the share retention decision by preexisting owners, we find no significant difference between REIT and non-REIT issues, suggesting the results of previous studies are not robust to various specifications of issuance cost and that preexisting owners do not necessarily benefit from the lower level of underpricing. Additionally, we find no difference in the issuance costs of equity versus mortgage REITs, particularly once we control for the use of umbrella partnerships.","[Dolvin, Steven D.] Butler Univ, Coll Business Adm, Indianapolis, IN 46208 USA; [Pyles, Mark K.] Coll Charleston, Sch Business & Econ, Charleston, SC 29401 USA",Butler University; College of Charleston,"Dolvin, SD (通讯作者)，Butler Univ, Coll Business Adm, 4600 Sunset Dr, Indianapolis, IN 46208 USA.",sdolvin@butler.edu; pylesm@cofc.edu,"Pyles, Mark/A-8057-2009",,,,,,18,27,29,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Firstly, we survey theoretical and empirical literature on the oil-unemployment relationship and relate them to the German case. Secondly, we illustrate this issue within the framework of a vector autoregression (VAR) approach for Germany. For this purpose, we use three different specifications in order to adequately address the uncertainty related to the construction of an adequate oil variable. Using monthly data from 1973 to 2008, we show that oil price increases induce a rise in unemployment in the German labor market. Moreover, for a restricted sample period for post-unification Germany, we oppose claims that the oil to macroeconomy relationship has weakened since the 1980s.

Spillovers to and feedback from other segments of the labour market are unavoidable and may counteract the direct effects of the reform. An adequate representation of heterogeneous labour markets becomes therefore an important issue for the assessment of reforms. We analyse the possible interactions between labour market segments in a combined, consistent microsimulation-AGE model with a flexible representation of substitution possibilities and different mechanisms of wage determination. We look at a stylised reform and find labour-demand cross-price elasticities between the low and medium skilled to be the main drivers of the results.

The important determinants of FDI inflows into Russian regions since the start of transition appear to be market size, the presence of large cities and sea ports, oil and gas availability, proximity to European market, and political and legislative risks. Since 1998, it appears the importance of big cities, the Sakhalin region, oil and gas resources, proximity to European markets, and legislation and political risks has increased. Our results also reveal a shift from horizontal FDI strategy to vertical FDI strategy in the post-crisis period.

Weight, height, fat mass and waist circumference are measured by health professionals. We find that only waist circumference has a negative association with wages for women, whereas no obesity measure is significant in the linear wage models for men. However, all measures of obesity are negatively associated with women's employment probability and fat mass is negatively associated with men's employment probability. We also find that the use of categories for waist circumference and fat mass has a substantial influence on the results. For example, the category for high fat mass is associated with roughly 5.5% lower wages for men. All in all, the results indicate that in the absence of measures of body composition, there is a risk that labour market penalties associated with obesity are measured with bias.

Larger (in terms of sales) and younger headquarters tend to relocate more often, as well as larger (in terms of the number of headquarters) and foreign firms, and firms that are the outcome of a merger. Headquarters relocate to metropolitan areas with good airport facilities-with a dramatic impact, low corporate taxes, low average wages, high level of business services, same industry specialization, and agglomeration of headquarters in the same sector of activity-with all agglomeration variables having an important and significant impact.

Or should they run publicly owned firms and regulate prices at the expense of rents to insiders? A theoretical model is used to answer these normative questions. The analysis focuses on the tradeoff between fiscal benefits and consumer surplus during privatization of noncompetitive sectors. Privatization transfers control rights to private interests and eliminates public subsidies, yielding benefits to taxpayers at the cost of increased prices for consumers. In developing countries, where budget constraints are tight, privatization and price liberalization may be optimal for low profitability industries but suboptimal for more profitable industries.

This approach does not constitute the only theoretical framework which gives prominence to the issue of firm finance; a meaningful theory could be elaborated on the basis of the works of Keynes and Schumpeter. The aim of this paper is to highlight the most significant differences between these two approaches; it will be shown that the distinctive element of the asymmetric information approach is the return to the principle of the neutrality of financial variables. In contrast, the Keynes-Schumpeter approach underlines that bank money, banks and credit market are elements that mark an economy that is completely different from the pure exchange economy to which the principle of the neutrality of the financial variables is applied.

This study uses data from nationally representative surveys in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Indonesia, and Mexico and from special surveys in India and Tonga to show similar patterns of association between mental health and socioeconomic characteristics. Individuals who are older, female, widowed, and report poor physical health are more likely to report worse mental health. Individuals living with others with poor mental health are also significantly more likely to report worse mental health themselves. In contrast, there is little observed relation between mental health and consumption poverty or education, two common measures of socioeconomic status. Indeed, the results here suggest instead that economic and multidimensional shocks, such as illness or crisis, can have a greater impact on mental health than poverty. This may have important implications for social protection policy. Also significant, the associations between poor mental health and lower labor force participation (especially for women) and more frequent visits to health centers suggest that poor mental health can have economic consequences for households and the health system. Mental health modules could usefully be added to multipurpose household surveys in developing countries. Finally, measures of mental health appear distinct from general subjective measures of welfare such as happiness.","[Das, Jishnu; Do, Quy-Toan; Friedman, Jed; McKenzie, David] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"McKenzie, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jdas@worldbank.org; qdo@worldbank.org; jfriedman@worldbank.org; dmckenzie@worldbank.org,"Friedman, Jed/AAA-1326-2020",,,,,,49,38,45,1,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

This article strives to contribute to this knowledge by first analysing the influence of accessibility and agglomeration on firm behaviour with exceptionally detailed firm data for the province of South Holland in The Netherlands. Next the added value of incorporating such effects in urban simulation models is tested with two series of validation runs with a microscopic model for firm dynamics. The presented Spatial Firm-demographic Micro-simulation (SFM) model simulates transitions and events in the firm population, including firm relocations, firm growth, firm dissolution and firm formation. Accessibility is measured with proximity to infrastructure access points and logsums of business and commuting trips from a transport model. Agglomeration measures are based on theories from urban economics and integrate travel time range bands into measures for specialisation and diversification. Estimation results confirm a significant influence of accessibility and agglomeration on the choice behaviour of firms. Application of these measures prove to increase the validity of the firm-demographic Simulation model to a significant but modest extend. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Advances in numerical methods allow to solve large GPs and new areas of successful applications have emerged: besides of technical applications, there are also GPs for optimal production planning, finance, etc. In real-life applications of GP, some of coefficients and/or exponents need not be precisely known. Stochastic geometric programming can be used to deal with such situations.

The investigation of voting in Macedonia and Bosnia, which are similarly small, impoverished, ethnically fragmented and threatened states that arose out of Yugoslavia, helps uncover factors that encourage voters to support parties willing to engage in cooperative multiethnic governance. Analysis of survey data suggests that supporters of the non-nationalist challengers in the first post-violence elections expressed both strong positive associations with the past communist system and clear negative assessments of the governing record of the incumbent nationalists, sentiments that were stronger among Macedonians than among Bosniaks. Data, however, call into question popular contentions that voters' support for non-nationalists is rooted in their social tolerance or engagement in civil society. The finding that Macedonian support for non-nationalist parties is partly due to negative voting combines with difficult domestic social and economic conditions, unfriendly neighbours and uncertain regional integration processes to suggest continuing challenges for Macedonia.","Coll William & Mary, Dept Govt, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary,"Pickering, PM (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Govt, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",pmpick@wm.edu,"Pickering, Paula/ABA-4199-2021",,,,,,83,13,18,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2009,61.0,4,,,,,565.0,591,PII 911201854,10.1080/09668130902826121,0.0,,,27,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,445WY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266083400001,0

We estimate linear and non-linear income and price elasticities, using time fixed effects to control for unobserved dynamic effects such as technological change. We also test for asymmetric responses to price changes. The analysis leads to the following conclusions. First, the income elasticity of energy demand is high and increases with income, both on the country and the sector level. Second, energy demand is more responsive to end-use price than international oil price changes. Third, the price elasticity of energy demand increases with the price level. This result, driven by the residential and agricultural sector, is new to the literature for developing countries, and is consistent with the hypothesis of stronger responsiveness to high energy prices. Finally, we find that after including time fixed effects, allowing for price asymmetry adds little to the results.","[van Benthem, Arthur] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"van Benthem, A (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",arthurvb@stanford.edu; mattia.romani@occ.gsi.gov.uk,,"van Benthem, Arthur/0000-0002-1028-9464",,,,,23,36,40,0,12,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,30.0,3,,,,,91.0,114,,,,,,24,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,464NN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267511900005,0

In addition to the traditional variables affecting export volumes, price and foreign demand, an unobserved component in the form of a time-varying trend enters the export equations to capture underlying non-price competitiveness. The structural modelling approach used within an error correction framework allows isolating the different sources of trade fluctuations and to better assess the contribution of each set of variables to export flows. The findings confirm that stochastic trends are present as a result of technical change and other exogenous factors driving export flows, and that a failure to account for these trends will lead to biased estimates of long-run price elasticities.","Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy",University of Calabria,"Algieri, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy.",b.algieri@unical.it,,,,,,,74,8,9,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Theoretical and Empirical Analyses of Risk Factors Using the Caliper Test,JAHRBUCHER FUR NATIONALOKONOMIE UND STATISTIK,,,English,Article,,,,,,,REPLICATION RESEARCH; STATISTICAL TESTS; SOCIAL DILEMMAS; VICE-VERSA; SCIENCE; METAANALYSIS; SOCIOLOGY; ECONOMICS; JOURNALS; HYPOTHESES,"Significance tests were originally developed to enable more objective evaluations of research results. Yet the strong orientation towards statistical significance encourages biased results, a phenomenon termed publication bias. Publication bias occurs whenever the likelihood or time-lag of publication, or the prominence, language, impact factor of journal space or the citation rate of studies depend on the direction and significance of research findings. Although there is much evidence concerning the existence of publication bias in all scientific disciplines and although its detrimental consequences for the progress of the sciences have been known for a long time, all attempts to eliminate the bias have failed. The present article reviews the history and logic of significance testing, the state of research on publication bias, and existing practical recommendations. After demonstrating that more systematical research on the risk factors of publication bias is needed, the paper suggests two new directions for publication bias research. First, a more comprehensive theoretical model based on theories of rational choice and economics as well as on the sociology of science is sketched out. Publication bias is recognized as the outcome of a social dilemma that cannot be overcome by moral pleas alone. Second, detection methods for publication bias going beyond meta-analysis, ones that are more suitable for testing causal hypotheses, are discussed. In particular, the caliper test seems well-suited for conducting theoretically motivated comparisons across heterogeneous research fields like sociology. Its potential is demonstrated by testing hypotheses on (a) the relevance of explicitly vs. implicitly stated research propositions and on (b) the relevance of the number of authors on incidence rates of publication bias in 50 papers published in leading German sociology journals.","[Auspurg, Katrin; Hinz, Thomas] Univ Konstanz, Dept Hist & Sociol, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Auspurg, K (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Hist & Sociol, Box D40, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",katrin.auspurg@uni-konstanz.de; thomas.hinz@uni-konstanz.de,,"Auspurg, Katrin/0000-0003-4504-0391",,,,,89,10,10,0,33,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The findings show that, unlike industrial IPOs, lockup periods for REIT IPOs do not cluster at 180 days, tend to cover longer periods, and vary over time. Our results support the commitment device hypothesis instead of the signaling hypothesis. That is, REIT managers tend to use lockup agreements to alleviate moral hazard problems and protect post-IPO investors rather than to send signals to investors. Finally, contrary to previous studies, we find no significant negative abnormal returns around the unlock date for the whole sample. The lack of aggressive sales by insiders and the fact that REITs are not backed by venture capitalists can explain our finding.","[Lu, Chiuling] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Chen, Hsuan-Chi] Univ New Mexico, Anderson Sch Management, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Fok, Robert (Chi-Wing)] Univ Wisconsin Parkside, Dept Business, Kenosha, WI 53141 USA",National Taiwan University; University of New Mexico; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Parkside,"Lu, CL (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Int Business, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",chiulinglu@management.ntu.edu.tw,,"Chen, Hsuan-Chi/0000-0002-6001-1823",,,,,21,7,8,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This work provides new data on ownership decisions and owner preferences under various scenarios, coupled with calibrated models to microsimulate Austin's personal-fleet evolution. Opinion survey results suggest that most Austinites (63%, population-corrected share) support a feebate policy to favor more fuel efficient vehicles. Top purchase criteria are price, type/class, and fuel economy. Most (56%) respondents also indicated that they would consider purchasing a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) if it were to cost $6000 more than its conventional, gasoline-powered counterpart. And many respond strongly to signals on the external (health and climate) costs of a vehicle's emissions, more strongly than they respond to information on fuel cost savings. Twenty five-year simulations of Austin's household vehicle fleet suggest that, under all scenarios modeled, Austin's vehicle usage levels (measured in total vehicle miles traveled or VMT) are predicted to increase overall, along with average vehicle ownership levels (both per household and per capita). Under a feebate, HEVs, PHEVs and Smart Cars are estimated to represent 25% of the fleet's VMT by simulation year 25: this scenario is predicted to raise total regional VMT slightly (just 2.32%, by simulation year 25), relative to the trend scenario, while reducing CO2 emissions only slightly (by 5.62%, relative to trend). Doubling the trend-case gas price to $5/gallon is simulated to reduce the year-25 vehicle use levels by 24% and CO2 emissions by 30% (relative to trend). Two- and three-vehicle households are simulated to be the highest adopters of HEVs and PHEVs across all scenarios. The combined share of vans, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and cross-over utility vehicles (CUVs) is lowest under the feebate scenario, at 35% (versus 47% in Austin's current household fleet). Feebate-policy receipts are forecasted to exceed rebates in each simulation year. In the longer term, gas price dynamics, tax incentives, feebates and purchase prices along with new technologies, government-industry partnerships, and more accurate information on range and recharging times (which increase customer confidence in EV technologies) should have added effects on energy dependence and greenhouse gas emissions.

They have generally shown that both socio-demographic characteristics and built environment characteristics are associated with walking propensity. We examine the traditional walkability variables that encompass density, mix of uses, and network connectivity in New Jersey, using a statewide sample including an oversample of Jersey City. We estimate a two-stage least squares model using a conditional mixed process that combines an ordered probit model of walking frequency in the second stage based on a truncated regression of car ownership in the first stage. Our results show that built environment variables have some small effects, mainly from better network connectivity associated with increased walking frequency. One of our key findings is that built environment features also work indirectly via how they influence car ownership. In general, we find sufficient evidence that suggests fewer cars are owned in areas with more walkable built environment features. The other key variable that we control for is whether a household owns a dog. This also proved to be strongly associated with walking suggesting that dog ownership is a necessary control variable to understand the frequency of walking. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, this study reviews published port literature for the last three decades (1980-2000s). The investigation primarily categorises the literature according to various methodological issues such as research paradigm, research strategy, base-disciplines, research methods and analysis techniques in order to provide meaningful implications on methodological evolution in seaport research for the period. This study suggests methodological bias in port research to a positivistic paradigm, following a quantitative trajectory moving from conceptual to empirical studies. In addition, the increased use of mathematical modelling and advanced statistical analysis methods is clearly observed. The introduction of advanced analytical tools used in other academic disciplines facilitates discussions in particular research area and amplifies the literature in those areas.

We focus upon liquidity measures that do not require micro-structure data (1) to facilitate use of our results as benchmarks for comparisons with results from international markets for which micro-structure data may be unavailable, (2) to provide benchmarks that do not require access to costly (and voluminous) micro-structure data. We find that REIT liquidity improved during the early and mid-1990s, deteriorated during the late 1990s, and then improved dramatically during 2000-2006, with the notable exception of 2007. Liquidity improved the most for REITs traded on the NYSE, and was an order of magnitude better than liquidity of REITs traded on the AMEX or NASDAQ. We link the deterioration in liquidity observed in 2007 to the investment portfolio of a REIT. We find that the percentage bid-ask spread is highly correlated with the measure of price impact proposed by Amihud (2002). We provide panel-data evidence on the key determinants of the percentage bid-ask spread that largely confirms the results reported by Bhasin et al. (1997) for 1990 and 1994: the percentage spread is a positive function of the volatility of stock returns, and a negative function of dollar volume turnover, share price and market capitalization. Finally, we provide evidence that these results obtained using daily closing bid- and ask-prices are not qualitatively different from those obtained using market micro-structure data. This suggests that we can use liquidity measures based upon readily available daily return data rather than being forced to rely upon market micro-structure data.","[Cannon, Susanne E.; Cole, Rebel A.] Depaul Univ, Dept Real Estate, Kellstadt Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",DePaul University,"Cole, RA (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, Dept Real Estate, Kellstadt Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",scannon@depaul.edu; rcole@depaul.edu,"Cole, Rebel A/C-4399-2008; Cole, Rebel A./Q-8533-2019","Cole, Rebel A./0000-0001-9830-662X",,,,,22,39,40,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Furthermore, the term structure acts as an amplifier of the impulse response for REIT return, a stabilizer for the housing counterpart under some regime, and, perhaps surprisingly, almost no role for the stock return. In contrast, GDP growth has very marginal effect in the impulse response for all assets.","[Leung, Charles Ka Yui] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chang, Kuang-Liang] Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Chiayi 60054, Taiwan; [Chen, Nan-Kuang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 10021, Taiwan",City University of Hong Kong; National Chiayi University; National Taiwan University,"Leung, CKY (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",klchang@mail.ncyu.edu.tw; nankuang@ntu.edu.tw; kycleung@cityu.edu.hk,"Leung, Charles/AAM-2236-2020","Leung, Charles/0000-0003-1450-5889",,,,,69,57,63,1,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

However, in the absence of a binding cap on millage rates, an assessment limit simply lowers the tax share of low-mobility homeowners at the expense of high-mobility homeowners. A recent amendment in Florida made existing exemptions portable, lowering the tax share of high mobility households and raising the tax share of low mobility households. Examining vote share by precinct, we find that more mobile households support portability but that precincts with larger exemptions do not. We also find evidence that voters understood how the amendment impacts their tax share. Support for portability is higher when a city has many out-of-state and thus exemption-less immigrants and support is lower when mobility in the rest of the tax jurisdiction is high. These findings suggest that voters alter assessment rules to minimize their own tax share. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate that R&D is in fact procyclical, but, interestingly, estimates using demand-shift instruments suggest that it responds asymmetrically to demand shocks.

Results are decomposed by region and household types, and the bootstrap method is applied to test for the statistical significance of all our findings. Across household types, single parents with children have the highest poverty risk. Most striking is a huge regional divide in poverty which only narrows slightly over the period under investigation: the incidence and the intensity of poverty are substantially higher in the New states. A nonlinear Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition is conducted to quantify the separate contribution of regional differences in households' characteristics to the likelhood of being poor. Estimates from the decomposition indicate that differences in the distributions of socioeconomic characteristics play a negligible role for the 1993 poverty divide. Already in year 2003, however, differences in the distributions of characteristics explain more than fifty percent of the poverty divide, indicating that the poverty divide is likely to become a persistent phenomenon.","[Boenke, Timm] Free Univ Berlin, Fachbereich Wirtschaftswissensch Offentl Finanzen, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Schroeder, Carsten] Univ Kiel, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",Free University of Berlin; University of Kiel,"Bönke, T (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Fachbereich Wirtschaftswissensch Offentl Finanzen, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",timm.boenke@fu-berlin.de; carsten.schroeder@economics.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,59,3,3,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Intragenerational redistribution is measured by the Bismarckian factor which provides information about the relative importance of the earnings-benefit link in the pension formula (as compared to a flat-benefit Beveridgean pension system). Based on micro data from the Luxembourg Income Study, we find both, a trend towards (more Bismarckian) pension systems which obey the principle of participation equivalence and an international convergence of pension systems. The reduced variation of pension systems (sigma convergence) is driven by countries with a high degree of intragenerational redistribution catching up with more traditional Bismarckian countries (beta convergence). Both, fundamental pension reforms as Sweden's and Italy's move to notional defined contribution systems, and parametric reforms ranging from the removal of group,specific benefits to alternative calculations of contribution history, such as changing from best years to the entire worklife, underlie this development.","[Krieger, Tim] Univ Paderborn, Dept Econ, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Traub, Stefan] Univ Bremen, Zentrum Sozialpolit, D-28209 Bremen, Germany",University of Paderborn; University of Bremen,"Krieger, T (通讯作者)，Univ Paderborn, Dept Econ, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",tim.krieger@notes.uni-paderborn.de; traub@uni-bremen.de,"Krieger, Tim/G-6241-2012","Krieger, Tim/0000-0003-0045-9172",,,,,42,9,9,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

For the 2009-2010 National Football League (NFL) season, NFL.com, the official website of the NFL, had fans enter a ''fan rating'' for each game of the season. This rating was on a scale of 0-100 with 100 being the most memorable. Using these figures, the authors test the economic hypotheses of the importance of uncertainty of outcome during the game and overall points scored by both teams in the game. As expected, the margin of victory in the game was shown to have a negative and significant effect on the fan rating, implying that fans enjoy uncertainty of outcome as the game is played. In addition, higher scoring games led to higher fan ratings than lower scoring games, implying fan preference for scoring.","[Weinbach, Andrew P.] Coastal Carolina Univ, Wall Coll Business Adm, Conway, SC 29528 USA; [Paul, Rodney J.] St Bonaventure Univ, Dept Finance, St Bonaventure, NY 14778 USA",Coastal Carolina University,"Weinbach, AP (通讯作者)，Coastal Carolina Univ, Wall Coll Business Adm, POB 261954, Conway, SC 29528 USA.",aweinbac@coastal.edu,,,,,,,12,21,24,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Further, when accounting for non-convexities in the cost function, production responds with a delay.

Default is a rare event for most segments of a bank's portfolio and data information can be minimal. Inference about default rates is essential for efficient capital allocation, for risk management and for compliance with the requirements of the Basel II rules on capital standards for banks. Expert information is crucial in inference about defaults. A Bayesian approach is proposed and illustrated using prior distributions assessed from industry experts. A maximum entropy approach is used to represent expert information. The binomial model, most common in applications, is extended to allow correlated defaults yet remain consistent with Basel II. The application shows that probabilistic information can be elicited from experts and econometric methods can be useful even when data information is sparse. Copyright.

In this paper, we provide a quantitative assessment of capacity flexibility for the passenger transportation network using bi-level network capacity models. Two approaches for assessing the value of capacity flexibility are proposed. One approach is based on the concept of reserve capacity, which reflects the flexibility with respect to changes in terms of demand volume only. The second approach allows for variations in the demand pattern in addition to changes in demand volume in order to more fully capture demand changes. Two models are developed in the second approach to consider two types of capacity flexibility. The total capacity flexibility allows all users to have both route choice and destination choice when estimating capacity flexibility. The limited capacity flexibility estimates how much more demand volume could be added to a fixed demand pattern by allowing the additional demand to deviate from the fixed demand pattern. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the different concepts of capacity flexibility for a passenger transportation system under demand changes.

In fact, country fixed effects, reflecting time-invariant differences in the business environment as well as other factors such as health care and education, matter more for firm performance than differences in the business environment across firms within countries.","[Commander, Simon] IZA, IE Business Sch, EBRD, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Svejnar, Jan] Univ Michigan, CERGE EI, CEPR, IZA, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Commander, S (通讯作者)，IZA, IE Business Sch, EBRD, Ann Arbor, MI USA.",,"Svejnar, Jan/H-2924-2014",,,,,,44,79,87,12,98,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The model can handle variables with different timeliness, sample size and frequency. We show that the forecasts based on the factor model outperform naive random walk forecasts, a hard to beat benchmark for euro area inflation forecasts in recent years, at horizons of and beyond nine months ahead. They are also comparable, in terms of accuracy, to the judgemental forecasts prepared in the context of the Eurosystem macroeconomic projection exercises. The factor model is therefore a very suitable tool to extract the signal on current and future euro area inflation from new data releases.","[Lenza, Michele] European Cent Bank, DG Res Econometr Modelling Div, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Warmedinger, Thomas] European Cent Bank, DG Econ Fiscal Policy Div, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; European Central Bank,"Lenza, M (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, DG Res Econometr Modelling Div, Kaiser Str 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",michele.lenza@ecb.int; Thomas.Warmedinger@ecb.int,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

It considers a decision maker who faces a number of possible models of the world (possibly corresponding to true parameter values). Every model generates objective probabilities, and von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility applies where these obtain, but no probabilities of models are given. This is the classic problem captured by Wald's (Statistical decision functions, 1950) device of risk functions. In an Anscombe-Aumann environment, I characterize Bayesianism (as a backdrop), the statistical minimax principle, the Hurwicz criterion, minimax regret, and the Pareto preference ordering that rationalizes admissibility. Two interesting findings are that c-independence is not crucial in characterizing the minimax principle and that the axiom which picks minimax regret over maximin utility is von Neumann-Morgenstern independence.","[Stoye, Joerg] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Stoye, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",j.stoye@nyu.edu,,,,,,,34,31,37,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2011,70.0,2,,,,,129.0,148,,10.1007/s11238-010-9227-2,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,700NR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285751200001,0

Findings from surveys, interviews, and project case studies are discussed in terms of their support for a positive relationship between successful economic development efforts and factors such as leadership and private investment. The authors also discuss the creation of a quantitative assessment model using well-known approaches such as economic impact multipliers and cluster theory.

Using ground-based lightning detection censors as well as global satellite data, we construct lightning density data for the contiguous U. S. states and a large cross section of countries.

This paper explores the determinants of the asymmetries in the international integration of banking systems. We consider an approach based on both network analysis and the concept of geographic neutrality. Our analysis focuses on the banking systems of 18 advanced economies from 1999 to 2005. Results indicate that banking integration should be assessed from the perspective of both inflows and outflows, given that they show different patterns for different countries. The parametric techniques point out the remarkable role of both geographic distance and trade integration. However, the most relevant results are yielded by nonparametric techniques, which we use due to the lack of well-established results on the determinants of trade in assets. These techniques reveal that the effect of the covariates on banking integration is not constant over the conditional distribution which (in practical terms) implies that the sign of the relationship varies across countries.","[Arribas, Ivan; Perez, Francisco] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain; [Tortosa-Ausina, Emili] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",University of Valencia; Universitat Jaume I,"Arribas, I (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",ivan.arribas@uv.es; francisco.perez-garcia@uv.es; tortosa@uji.es,"Arribas, Ivan/F-4245-2016; Perez Garcia, Francisco/F-1090-2017","Arribas, Ivan/0000-0001-7600-8066; Perez Garcia, Francisco/0000-0003-4724-3598",,,,,88,3,4,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Realist and constructivist scholars share Stanley Hoffmann's formulation of states as either 'obstinate or obsolete'. EU foreign and security policy is puzzling in this respect as it corresponds to neither. Drawing on two examples - the EC's role in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in 1973-75 and the contemporary workings of the Political and Security Committee (PSC) - this article suggests that we think of EU foreign and security policy as driven not by the obstinacy or the obsolescence of the nation-state but rather by its transformation. In line with this claim, the article proposes a social theory of EU foreign and security policy with democracy and bureaucracy as two competing political forms within the framework of the modern state. It is the changing balance between these two political forms that drives forward closer foreign and security co-operation in Europe.","[Bickerton, Chris J.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, NL-1012 DL Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Bickerton, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Oudezijds Achterburgwal 237, NL-1012 DL Amsterdam, Netherlands.",C.Bickerton@uva.nl,,,,,,,71,25,26,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Customs costs play a particularly important role in these results. Lower market entry costs can also promote diversification, but the effect is weaker (1 per cent). We also find evidence that trade facilitation has stronger effects on diversification in poorer countries. Our results are highly robust to estimation using alternative dependent and independent variables, different country samples, and alternative econometric techniques.

Schumpeter's treatment of the 'School of Milan' describes Pietro Verri as 'the most important pre-Smithian authority on Cheapness-and-Plenty'. A careful canvass of the texts substantiates Schumpeter's suggestion.

Using the partially overlapping time-series (POTS) framework of Smith (2005), we model jointly all futures contracts with delivery dates up to a year into the future and extract information from these prices about the persistence of market shocks. The model depicts highly nonlinear volatility dynamics that are consistent with the observed seasonality in demand and storage of the three commodities. Specifically, volatility of the three commodity prices exhibits time-to-delivery effects and substantial seasonality, yet their patterns vary systematically by contract delivery month. The conditional variance and correlation across the three commodities also vary over time. High price volatility of near-delivery contracts and their low correlation with concurrently traded distant contracts imply high short-horizon price risk for an unhedged position in the calendar or crack spread. Price risk at the one-year horizon is much lower than short-horizon risk in all seasons and for all positions, but it is still substantial in magnitude for crack-spread positions. Crack-spread hedgers ignore nearby high-season price risk at their peril, but they would also be remiss to ignore the long horizon. doi: 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-No3-2","[Smith, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Suenaga, Hiroaki] Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",University of California System; University of California Davis; Curtin University,"Smith, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",asmith@primal.ucdavis.edu,,"Suenaga, Hiroaki/0000-0002-0208-2586",Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We gratefully acknowledge insightful comments from the editor James Smith and three anonymous reviewers, which helped improve the paper.

The set method of the construction safety expert system was studied based on the analysis of the properties of the different tap tools. The six kinds of the types and contents of the construction safety expert system were probed into through theory analysis and practical experience. Its building steps of the construction safety expert system are also suitable for engineers. So, the tap tools and set methods of the construction safety expert system will have a bright future in engineering application.","[Tian Sijin] Shanghai Inst Technol, Sch Urban Construct & Safety Engn, Shanghai 201418, Peoples R China",Shanghai Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,ETP-ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY PRESS,HONG KONG,"ROOM 2202, PING CHUN HOUSE PING TIN ESTATE, LAM TIN, KOWLOON, HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-988-18242-8-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,605.0,608,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BVY56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000293148000163,0

The loss of control efficacy in the field was attributed to low inoculum levels of the bacterium in the soil. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a suitable formulation for Serratia to enhance its viability and efficacy in field applications. A comparison between sunlight-exposed and non-exposed formulations was also made. The clay-based materials bentonite and kaolin were selected as carrier materials as they are naturally abundant in the environment. To each clay, non-fat skimmed milk (NFSM) and sucrose were added as enrichment materials and para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) was added for its assumed UV-protectant properties, in various combinations. Preliminary laboratory experimental results revealed that formulation with bentonite was slightly more efficient in inhibiting Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense tropical race 4 (Foc TR4) compared to kaolin, with 4.06 and 4.28 log10 CFU/ml, respectively. This was attributed to the higher viable cell count of Serratia recovered, especially from formulations enriched with NFSM and sucrose. Bentonite formulations also produced higher viable cell count for both sunlight-exposed and non-exposed treatments. PABA on the contrary was found to have antimicrobial properties towards both Serratia and Foc R4. In addition, the UV-protectant effect was absent in all formulations with PABA resulting in low viable cell counts of Serratia. Therefore, for future applications, it is suggested to omit PABA from the bentonite formulation, while NFSM and sucrose levels can be further optimised for economical reasons. This biotechnological formulation is also highly cost effective as the total cost for formulations with combinations of bentonite, NFSM and sucrose was less than USD10 per 100 g.","[Ting, A. S.

This paper derives the set of all shape-invariant demand functions and associated preferences. All previously known shape-invariant demands were derived from utility functions that, up to monotonic transformation, are called IB/ESE (independent of base-equivalence scale exact) utility functions, because they yield IB/ESE equivalence scales. This paper shows that there exist exceptional shape-invariant demands that are not derived from a transform of IB/ESE utility and provides some simple tests for these exceptions. In particular, all the exceptions have rank 2, so any rank 3 or higher demand system is shape invariant if and only if it is derived from a transform of IB/ESE utility.","Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Boston College,"Lewbel, A (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",,,"Lewbel, Arthur/0000-0003-3864-2618",,,,,26,11,12,0,7,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Open innovation describes the nascent practice of firms using knowledge created outside their boundaries and also marketing ideas they would not commercialize themselves. Firms engaging in open innovation thrive on knowledge spillovers, and weak R&D regions could benefit from this model through the creation of Marshallian externalities. It is therefore interesting to ask whether weak R&D states take advantage of this model. This case study analysis shows that states involved in the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research partially support the emerging open innovation paradigm. All states have science and technology strategies and actively support and invest in their higher education infrastructure. They show variation in their support for university-industry partnerships, entrepreneurship, capital access, commercialization, and technology transfer. None of the states, however, uses the open innovation framework explicitly.","Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Mayer, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",mayer@giub.unibe.ch,,"Mayer, Heike/0000-0001-9419-0770",,,,,33,13,18,0,59,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The case study is McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and data was obtained by means of a web-based survey that included questions regarding travel behavior, socio-demographic information, and attitudes toward travel, land use, and the environment. The objective variable is defined as the ratio of ideal to actual commute time, and regression analysis is implemented to test the relationship between this variable and socio-demographic variables and attitudinal scores. The impact of different attitudes on the gap between ideal and actual commute time is expanded to include three different modes, active travel (walk/cycle), transit, and personal automobile. Interestingly, the results indicate that active travelers tend to be less dissatisfied with their commute, followed by those who travel in a personal vehicle and transit users. A number of attitudinal responses are shown to impact the desire to travel more or less, including variables that relate to the social environment, availability of local activities, quality of facilities, productive use of the commute, and the intrinsic value found in the commute travel. The picture emerges of a traveler who would like to spend more time commuting, as someone who is an active traveler, thinks that getting there is half the fun, dislikes traveling alone, but rather likes to live in an active neighborhood where there is a sense of community. The results suggests that enjoyment of commuting, while a challenge from the perspective of motorized mobility, may provide valuable policy opportunities from the perspective of active transportation.

I document a positive association between height and later-life cognitive function, which is larger for women than for men. This sex difference increases when I address potential feedback effects from mid- and later-life circumstances on stature by using knee height as an instrument for height. Specifically, while the estimates for women remain largely unchanged, I only find a diminished and statistically insignificant association between instrumented height and later-life cognition for men. This finding suggests that at least part of the association between height and later-life cognition among men may stem from common third factors that are correlated with both height and later-life cognition, such as adverse occupational exposures or health events during mid- and later life. Extended models that also include education further diminish the association between height and later-life cognition. Education displays strong positive gradients with the employed measures of childhood circumstances - including height which points to education as a potential pathway linking early-life conditions and later-life cognitive function.

The term used to denote the scheme is Ecopass, conveying the stated political objective of the scheme: a pass to improve the quality of the urban environment (ECO). The charge depends on the Euro emission standard of the vehicle. The paper illustrates the main features and impacts of the Milan Ecopass scheme, and presents a preliminary cost-benefit analysis. The scheme has been effective in curbing not only pollution emissions, but also congestion, and the result has been achieved with low implementation costs and without major political opposition. The cost-benefits analysis presents an overall net benefit. The identification of the winners and losers of the policy is conditioned by penalty payments. Without including the penalties, the surface public transport users and the society at large are the main winners, whereas car and especially freight vehicle users are net losers.

Two models are specified: a partial vector error correction model (VECM) and a general VECM. In the partial VECM, we look for a long-run interdependent relationship between the interest rates of the two currency areas and specify the Taylor Rule terms as exogenous variables. In the general VECM, we regard all variables as endogenous, and look for long-run equilibrium relationships among them, which may reveal monetary policy interdependence between the two central banks. Weak exogeneity is checked in both models in order to establish a possible leader-follower relationship. The empirical results of both models indicate interdependence between the ECB and the Fed, but only the general VECM testifies a leader-follower pattern between the two central banks. According to this pattern, the ECB does follow the Fed.","[Belke, Ansgar] Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany; [Belke, Ansgar] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Cui, Yuhua] Univ Hohenheim, D-7000 Stuttgart, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University Hohenheim,"Belke, A (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,30,12,12,1,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2010,33.0,5,,,,,778.0,797,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01227.x,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,594IG,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277529500005,0

We apply a structural model of economic geography to data on per capita income over 190 Chinese cities between 1995 and 2002, and evaluate the extent to which market proximity and spatial dependence can explain the growing income inequality between Chinese cities. The econometric specification explicitly incorporates spatial dependence in the form of spatially-lagged per capita income. We show that the geography of market access and spatial dependence are significantly correlated with per capita income in China. Market access is particularly important in cities with smaller migration inflows, which is consistent with NEG theory, whereas spatially-lagged per capita income matters more in cities with greater immigration. We conclude that the positive impact of spatially-lagged income partly results from labour mobility between neighbours, so that spatial dependence reflects the influence of migration, knowledge transfers and increasing competition between cities.","[Hering, Laura; Poncet, Sandra] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Hering, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",,,"Hering, Laura/0000-0001-6020-5903",,,,,32,15,20,2,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2010,33.0,5,,,,,655.0,679,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01241.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,594IG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277529500001,0

The architecture of the Eurosystem permits the processing and analysis of a vast amount of national and aggregate economic, financial and monetary data and assists the Governing Council in taking monetary policy decisions - and this each month. Our aim is to describe the role of a variety of committees and sub-committees that prepare and support the monetary policy decision-making process. A federal organization is at the heart of this process.

As of 2009, however, Canada's greenhouse gas emissions are far above its 1990 level which calls for stringent short-term policy measures if Canada is to meet its legally binding commitment. This paper uses a multi-region, multi-commodity static general equilibrium model to quantify the economic impacts of alternative compliance strategies for Canada in the context of climate policies undertaken by other Kyoto parties. The numerical results confirm fears by Canadian policymakers of substantial economic adjustment costs should Canada fulfill its Kyoto commitments solely through domestic action. However, a rigorous use of the project-based CDM on top of international emissions trading could allow Canada to live up to its international climate policy commitment at politically much more tolerable costs.","[Boehringer, Christoph] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-2900 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Böhringer, C (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-2900 Oldenburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,43,37,40,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2010,33.0,2,,,,,177.0,211,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01229.x,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,551WG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274242700002,0

That an individual country's economic performance does not affect world oil prices is imposed on the Vector Autoregressive setting as an identifying restriction. The estimates suggest that oil price increases have a statistically significant and positive effect on the outputs of Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates. However, oil price shocks do not appear to have a statistically significant effect on the outputs of Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia.

After tracing the links between the response to the Asian crisis and the drive towards securitisation, this article suggests that while the international financial community has avoided repeating the first major error that they made after the Asian crisis - by recognising that the problems now lie as much at home as abroad - they continue to make a second and more profound error in their response to the subprime crisis: financial leaders continue to believe that a large part of the solution is to be found in greater transparency, more accurate risk assessment models, better due diligence - in short, to provide the markets with a truly comprehensive picture of the financial instruments that are being traded. I suggest that there are two crucial problems with this assumption. The first is that it is highly unlikely that it will ever be possible to truly calculate and quantify the indeterminacies that are at the heart of the process of securitisation and the originate to distribute (OTD) model. The second is that even if it were possible to develop such a comprehensive picture of the indeterminacies involved in securities markets, it is not at all clear that financial markets will have the capacity or the interest in making effective use of that information. These limits to financial risk management not only raise some serious questions about the kinds of regulatory solutions that are currently being proposed, but also make it all the more important that we develop a politically accountable response.",,,,jbest@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,72,50,52,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Assessing the determinants of numeracy, we find school enrollment as well as Chinese instruments of number learning to have been particularly important. We also study the contribution of numeracy as measured by the age-heaping strategy for long-run economic growth using a pooled cross-section analysis.

And rather than being an insight properly attributable to a particular individual, it was, by that time, a commonplace of economic discussion. This much is easy to establish. It is argued that the common attribution arises at least in part because the Keynesians unwisely chose to express their disagreement with Freidman in terms of expectations rather than in terms of the existence of the natural rate of unemployment. As a result, 40 years later, it has become hard to see that two separate points ever existed.","Univ Oxford Balliol Coll, Oxford OX1 3BJ, England",University of Oxford,"Forder, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Balliol Coll, Oxford OX1 3BJ, England.",james.forder@balliol.ox.ac.uk,"Forder, James/JPK-5506-2023",,,,,,57,22,22,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Third, the crisis aroused fears of Transylvanian irredentism, which Bucharest used to control the population.

While in the first three games subjects' play easily converges to the unique equilibrium rule, in the last game the proportional rule overwhelmingly prevails as a coordination device, especially when we frame the game as an hypothetical bankruptcy situation. We also administered a questionnaire to a different group of students, asking them to act as impartial arbitrators to solve (among others) the same problems played in the lab.

While studies of transnational commodity flows focus on the organization and coordination of economic activities over geographic space, little research has been done on their competitive relations. In this article, I focus on the political economy of disputes over market access by linking trade regimes to the economic and political activities of actors in the rival Colombian and US cut flower commodity chains. I argue that the regulation of the Colombian and US cut flower commodity chains is a process marked by institutional mediation and political and economic contestation. In shaping their economic spaces, a combination of shifting discourses, litigation, and political lobbying in sites of power are used by economic actors to meet their interests. The examination of rivalry over market access shows variation in the configuration of economic activity in the US cut flower market over time while drawing attention to the dynamic interaction among economic actors, institutions, and markets.","Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Patel-Campillo, A (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,"Patel-Campillo, Anouk/0000-0002-9841-4310",,,,,74,14,19,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Fifteen years later, more than a hundred countries had accepted (or planned to accept) a single set of accounting standards - yet not the American ones. Instead, a London-based private body had become the world's standard setter, and even in the US there was serious discussion about phasing out national standards for multinational companies. My explanation for change in the international politics of accounting standards emphasizes two conceptual tools featured in this special issue: cross-border sequencing effects and internal institutional configurations and capacity building. Unlike previous work that centers on the rise of private or technical authority or gives pride of place to either EU regional reform and capacity building or US developments, this article attributes the change in the politics of accounting standards to a sequence of developments that took place in the transatlantic political arena, inside and between these two large polities. The order and timing by which the US created and the EU emulated institutional configurations and regulatory capacities determined the particular set of transatlantic interactions. If the US or the EU had never developed these arrangements and capacities or had developed them in a different sequence or at different historical moments, transatlantic interactions would likely have followed an alternate path and generated different types of international politics.","[Posner, Elliot] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Posner, E (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,"Posner, Elliot/0000-0002-7178-6528",,,,,61,50,55,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This article suggests not, and that individual choices on home loans reflect a welfare trade-off steeped in social norms. These norms provide a range of choices for individuals' intentional rationality, from which decisions can be legitimated among their social peers. To understand individual choices about taking on a home loan, such actions must be interpreted within the context of the dominant welfare trade-off within a society over how one ensures income over their life cycle. This can be understood comparatively and also over time. This article situates the American experience among other advanced industrialised economies to locate its particular variety of residential capitalism and why their experience is more mild than wild. It then assesses change over time in the US case, arguing that the subprime crisis requires us to consider the everyday politics of expectations. Seen over time, everyday expectations about how the economy works provide constraints on the capacity of economic and political elites to change the system. They also encourage institutional experiments to cope with crises. I discuss this in the context of institutional experiments in response to the 1980s crisis in the US and the role that community activists played in linking credit access to rights discourses from the 1930s and 1960s. I then discuss how this politics has played out in the current crisis, providing a broader perspective on the politics of the subprime crisis and why it's not just the economy, stupid.","Univ Warwick, Ctr Study Globalisat & Regionalisat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Seabrooke, L (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Ctr Study Globalisat & Regionalisat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",L.Seabrooke@warwick.ac.uk,"Seabrooke, Leonard/F-7091-2013","Seabrooke, Leonard/0000-0001-5581-3293",,,,,63,38,42,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Emissions trading has risen in popularity to become the most broadly favoured government strategy. Carbon permits have then quickly been developed as a serious financial instrument in markets turning over billions of dollars a year. In this article, I show how the reality of permit market operation is far removed from the assumptions of economic theory and the promise of saving resources by efficiently allocating emission reductions. The pervasiveness of Greenhouse Gas emissions, strong uncertainty and complexity combine to prevent economists from substantiating their theoretical claims of cost-effectiveness. Corporate power is shown to be a major force affecting emissions market operation and design. The potential for manipulation to achieve financial gain, while showing little regard for environmental or social consequences, is evident as markets have extended internationally and via trading offsets. At the individual level, there is the potential for emissions trading to have undesirable ethical and psychological impacts and to crowd out voluntary actions. I conclude that the focus on such markets is creating a distraction from the need for changing human behaviour, institutions and infrastructure.","Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Spash, CL (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, As, Norway.",clive.spash@umb.no,"Spash, Clive/IST-5510-2023",,,,,,64,174,193,1,102,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Under the mandate of the Barcelona Declaration, EU-Turkish industrial tariffs will be abolished, whilst agro-food protectionism remains largely intact. Consequently, the direct impacts from a hypothetical EU accession scenario will be concentrated in agro-food sectors, whilst their share of economic output in Turkey implies 'secondary' macro impacts. To this end, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework is employed to quantitatively reassess full Turkish accession. Unlike previous CGE studies, agriculture, fishing and food sectors are disaggregated, whilst significant advancements to the 'standard' model code are incorporated to capture the vagaries of agricultural factor, input and product markets. In addition, a realistic 'baseline' scenario is constructed including 'up to date' trade and domestic agricultural policy reforms prior to Turkish entry to the EU. The results show that trade-led gains in Turkey are moderated due to tariff liberalisation prior to EU entry, whilst Turkey receives significant budgetary transfers from the CAP budget, which are 'mirrored' as EU-27 costs. With additional migration effects, Turkish (EU-27) production possibilities fall (rise), whilst real income per capita rises (falls).","[Philippidis, George] Govt Aragon, Aragonese Agcy Res & Dev ARAID, Aragon, Spain; [Karaca, Orhan] Govt Aragon, Ctr Agrofood Res & Technol CITA, Aragon, Spain",,"Philippidis, G (通讯作者)，Govt Aragon, Aragonese Agcy Res & Dev ARAID, Aragon, Spain.",,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2009,32.0,12,,,,,1706.0,1729,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01207.x,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,530KP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272590300003,0

Of the pollutants considered, we find that high carbon monoxide (CO) levels, even when below federal air quality standards, significantly increase absences.

If price effects are sufficiently small, then typically an individual benefits from an increase of bargaining power, necessarily to the detriment of others. If price effects are drastic, the welfare of all household members moves in the same direction when bargaining power shifts, at the expense (or for the benefit) of outside consumers. Typically a shift of bargaining power within a set of households also impacts upon other households. We show that each individual of a sociological group tends to benefit, if he can increase his bargaining power, but suffers if others in his group do the same.","[Gersbach, Hans] ETH, CER, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Haller, Hans] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Gersbach, H (通讯作者)，ETH, CER, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",hgersbach@ethz.ch; haller@vt.edu,,,,,,,19,6,6,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,NOV,2009,33.0,4,,,,,665.0,690,,10.1007/s00355-009-0385-5,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,509BH,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270985500009,0

A special form of non-stationarity, where the underlying generator switches between (approximately) stationary regimes, seems particularly appropriate for financial markets. We use a dynamic switching (modelled by a hidden Markov model) combined with a linear conditionally heteroskedastic latent factor model in a hybrid conditionally heteroskedastic factor analysed hidden Markov model (CHFAHMM) and discuss the practical details of training such models with a new approximated version of the Viterbi algorithm in conjunction with the expectation-maximization algorithm to iteratively estimate the model parameters in a maximum-likelihood sense. The performance of the CHFAHMM is evaluated on both simulated and financial data sets. On the basis of out-of-sample forecast encompassing tests as well as other measures for forecasting accuracy, our results indicate that the use of this new method yields overall better forecasts than those generated by competing models.","[Saidane, Mohamed] Univ 7 November Carthage, ISCC Bizerte, Dept Quantitat Methods, Zarzouna 7021, Bizerte, Tunisia; [Lavergne, Christian] Univ Montpellier 2, Dept Math, CNRS, I3M,UMR 5149,CC, F-34095 Montpellier, France",Universite de Carthage; Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI),"Saidane, M (通讯作者)，Univ 7 November Carthage, ISCC Bizerte, Dept Quantitat Methods, Zarzouna 7021, Bizerte, Tunisia.",saidane@math.univ-montp2.fr; Christian.Lavergne@math.univ-montp2.fr,"Saidane, Mohamed/ABD-1586-2021","Saidane, Mohamed/0000-0002-4828-5426",,,,,57,4,4,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Thus, knowledge of aggregate tourism demand hinges on the determinants of corner solutions at the microeconomic level. Furthermore, with regard to those households that consume tourism, their travel frequency patterns in the year need not be the same. This paper uses household microdata to examine the socio-demographic and economic determinants of both decisions: holiday participation and the intensity of participation in the year conditional on participation. The results highlight the relevance in tourism demand analyses of distinguishing between both decisions. In fact, many socio-demographic variables show only explanatory power for the participation decision. The two key. factors in explaining both decisions are the previous year's tourism participation pattern, suggesting evidence of habit persistence, and income, although with an Income elasticity below unity.","[Alegre, Joaquin; Mateo, Sara; Pou, Llorenc] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Appl Econ, Ctr Valldemossa, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Alegre, J (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Appl Econ, Ctr Valldemossa, Edificio Gaspar Melchor Jovellanos,Km 7-5, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Spain.",joaquin.alegre@uib.es,,,,,,,44,34,35,4,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We then analyze the Nash equilibria of capacity allocation games, in which preferences of hospitals and interns are common knowledge and every hospital determines a quota for the regular market given its total capacity for the two matching periods. Under the intern-optimal stable matching system, we show that a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium may not exist. Common preferences for hospitals ensure the existence of equilibrium in weakly dominant strategies whereas unlike in games of capacity manipulation strong monotonicity of population is not a sufficient restriction on preferences to avoid the non-existence problem. Besides, in games of capacity allocation, it is not true either that every hospital weakly prefers a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium to any larger regular market quota profiles.","[Saglam, Ismail] TOBB Univ Econ & Technol, Dept Econ, TR-06560 Ankara, Turkey; [Mumcu, Ayse] Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey",TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University; Bogazici University,"Saglam, I (通讯作者)，TOBB Univ Econ & Technol, Dept Econ, Sogutozu Cad 43, TR-06560 Ankara, Turkey.",mumcu@boun.edu.tr; ismail.saglam@etu.edu.tr,"Saglam, Ismail/GLT-2744-2022; Mumcu, Ayse/P-9232-2015","Mumcu, Ayse/0000-0002-4322-339X; Saglam, Ismail/0000-0002-9561-9476",,,,,23,6,8,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2009,33.0,3,,,,,383.0,403,,10.1007/s00355-008-0364-2,0.0,,,21,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,480YR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268773700003,0

In 2001, a program was implemented to encourage the use of natural gas in vehicles in the Aburra Valley in Colombia, with incentives to convert small cars from gasoline and diesel to hybrid engines with natural gas, most notably a cash subsidy. Using a survey administered to both commercial and private car owners we study the determinants of conversion under this fuel conversion program. We thus obtain information about the reasons for adoption of new technologies in vehicles. This allows us to discuss the possible outcomes of this type of policy.

According to economic theory, it is generally expected that income and the number of beach visits affect the value of a recreational visit. The recreational value should increase as income increases and should decrease as the number of beach visits increases. Nevertheless, anomalies such as the Veblen effect are admitted. The data used for this research were obtained from a questionnaire carried out in Lido di Dante, a coastal tourist resort in Italy. The contingent valuation method (CVM) in the value of enjoyment (VOE) version was applied. Beach visitors were asked to give a monetary value to informal recreational beach use (such as sunbathing, walking and swimming) in three different scenarios: status quo, erosion and artificial defence. Beach services are modelled in private goods terms, because each individual may make a different number of visits, and different categories of beach visitor (all beach visitors, day visitors and residents, and tourists) are described by presenting their respective use value functions. It is shown that household income explains the recreational beach value of all visitor categories considered, while the number of beach days explains only that of day visitors and residents. The coefficients of these two independent variables do not have the expected sign, thus suggesting that the preferences of beach visitors at Lido di Dante belong to the category of anomalies in the economic theory of demand.","Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Brandolini, SMD (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",silva.marzetti@unibo.it,,"marzetti, silva/0000-0001-8888-5736",,,,,48,10,11,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

At many of the world's largest airports there are fewer than 100 passengers per air transport movement, although congestion and delays are growing. Furthermore, demand for air transport is predicted to continue growing but aircraft size is not. This paper aims to investigate and explain this phenomenon, the choice of relatively small aircraft. It seems that this choice is associated mainly with the benefits of high frequency service, the competitive environment in which airlines operate and the way airport capacity is allocated and priced. Regression analysis of over 500 routes in the US, Europe and Asia provides empirical evidence that the choice of aircraft size is mainly influenced by route characteristics (e.g. distance, level of demand and level of competition) and almost not at all by airport characteristics (e.g. number of runways and whether the airport is a hub or slot coordinated). We discuss the implications of this choice of aircraft size and suggest that some market imperfections exist in the airline industry leading airlines to offer excessive frequency on some routes and too low frequency on others.

J,"Konow, J",,,,"Konow, James",,,Is fairness in the eye of the beholder? An impartial spectator analysis of justice,SOCIAL CHOICE AND WELFARE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMICS; WELFARE; ETHICS,"A popular sentiment is that fairness is inexorably subjective and incapable of being determined by objective standards. This study, on the other hand, seeks to establish evidence on unbiased justice and to propose and demonstrate a general approach for measuring impartial views empirically. Most normative justice theories associate impartiality with limited information and consensus. In both the normative and positive literature, information is usually seen as the raw material for self-serving bias and disagreement. In contrast, this paper proposes a type of impartiality that is associated with a high level of information and that results in consensus. The crucial distinction is the emphasis here on the views of impartial spectators, rather than implicated stakeholders. I describe the quasi-spectator method, i.e., an empirical means to approximate the views of impartial spectators. Results of a questionnaire provide evidence on quasi-spectator views and support this approach as a means to elicit moral preferences. By establishing a relationship between consensus and impartiality, this paper helps lay an empirical foundation for welfare analysis, social choice theory and practical policy applications. There is no objective standard of 'fairness.' 'Fairness' is strictly in the eye of the beholder... To a producer or seller, a 'fair' price is a high price. To the buyer or consumer, a 'fair' price is a low price.

A lucky player who wins early faces relatively stronger economic incentives to exert effort because of his early success. As a consequence, early winners are more likely to keep winning through the middle of the series. That is, a grand prize generates what looks like a hot hand. Indeed, this argument about economic incentives may help to rationalize the inconsistent evidence of a hot hand in sporting events. This article develops this argument and assesses it empirically using data from the Professional Golfers' Association Tour, before and after a grand prize, the season-ending Tour Championship, was introduced.","[Knoeber, Charles R.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [McFall, Todd A.] Welch Consulting, Bryan, TX USA",North Carolina State University,"Knoeber, CR (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Box 8110, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",charles_knoeber@ncsu.edu,,"Thurman, Walter/0000-0002-6106-7685",,,,,20,22,24,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Under the assumption that the real estate market is somewhat efficient, such a large discount would be counterintuitive. We argue, and empirically show, that the estimated foreclosure coefficients in most of the previous research are upward biased because they do not control for variables such as the physical condition of the property and the relationship between marketing time and price. Accounting for these factors and correcting for two types of spatial price interdependence, our results show that estimates of foreclosure discount reported by previous studies are about one-third higher than the true discount caused by foreclosure per se.","[Clauretie, Terrence M.] Univ Nevada, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Daneshvary, Nasser] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Coll Business, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Clauretie, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",Mike.clauretie@unlv.edu; Nasser.daneshvary@unlv.edu,,,,,,,29,91,114,0,18,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2009,37.0,1,,,,,43.0,67,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00234.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,409RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263522400003,0

Almost half of respondents in a county-wide survey stated that they changed their attitudes towards congestion charges during the trial. Most of them became more positive. An analysis of media shows that the attitudinal change in media towards the trial coincides with the attitudinal change of the public. There was no dramatic change in the proportion of articles expressing a negative view. Instead, the result indicates that the increase in positive views was driven by a shift from neutral to positive articles during the trial. In order to ascertain why the public attitudes swung, we have analysed the anticipated and perceived effects of the trial. Generally, the analysis seems to indicate that improved understanding of the type and magnitude of concrete effects was not a main driving force behind the attitudinal change. Instead, it seems that the public attitude changed because personal experience gave a new understanding of the implications of the charges for the personal well-being. This would imply that trials, generally, may be a more useful tool than information in the process of implementing 'difficult' policy measures, such as congestion charges. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The first fire reduces house prices by about 10%, while the second fire reduces house prices by nearly 23%, a statistically significant difference.

Challenging a view that contrasts 'cardinal' to 'ordinal' calculus, we show that these two forms of calculus constitute instead different phases of a single approach. Bentham sometimes has to rely upon proxy variables because of operational constraints, and consequently upon factors other than utility. As a utilitarian, Bentham is de facto welfarist from an ethical point of view. Surprisingly however, this study shows that Bentham resorts to non-welfare information in the actual application of his calculus. His approach reconciles non-welfarism from the technical standpoint with welfarism as a fundamental moral principle.","Univ Caen Basse Normandie, CREM, F-14000 Caen, France",Universite de Caen Normandie,"Baujard, A (通讯作者)，Univ Caen Basse Normandie, CREM, 19 Rue Claude Bloch, F-14000 Caen, France.",Antoinette.Baujard@unicaen.fr,,"Baujard, Antoinette/0000-0002-4156-7527",,,,,62,14,14,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

The maximum likelihood estimates are obtained using the weekly series of U.S. three-month treasury bill rates. The estimation results reveal that there are strong evidences for the existence of high and low volatility regimes, for the time varying transition probability of the regime variable, and for the high persistence of both regimes. In both regimes, the volatility, but not the drift, is estimated accurately and plays a key role in explaining the dynamics of the interest rates. High persistence's and different volatilities of two regimes can well explain volatility clustering observed in the data. Based on the inferred probability of the process being in each regime, most of the high volatility periods correspond to some historic events. The likelihood-based test shows that misspecification can result in misleading outcomes particularly regarding the volatility and transition probabilities of the regime index.","Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Choi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",seungmoon.choi@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,54,14,14,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

In line with previous results, we find little evidence for an effect of treaties on the level of total sales. We do, however, find that a tax treaty increases the probability of investment by a firm in a given country. In addition, we find that a treaty reduces exports to the parent but increases imports of intermediate inputs from the parent. This is consistent with treaties increasing the effective host tax. This suggests that tax treaties impact the behaviour of multinationals along some dimensions but not along others.","[Davies, Ronald B.] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Norback, Pehr-Johan] Res Inst Ind Econ, IfN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Tekin-Koru, Ayca] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",University of Oregon; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Oregon State University,"Davies, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",,"Tekin-Koru, Ayça/U-7590-2019; Davies, Ronald/AAT-4531-2021; Tekin-Koru, Ayça/I-5210-2018","Tekin-Koru, Ayça/0000-0002-0817-9055; Davies, Ron/0000-0002-9738-9256",,,,,41,28,30,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2009,32.0,1,,,,,77.0,110,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01158.x,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,400XD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262901800005,0

We start from the methodological precept that period and continuous time representations of the same macrostructure should give rise to the same qualitative outcome, i.e. in particular, that the results of period analysis should not depend on the length of the period chosen. A simple example where this is fulfilled is given by the Solow growth model, while all chaotic dynamics in period models of dimension less than 3 are in conflict with this precept. We discuss a typical example from the recent literature, where chaos results from an asymptotically stable continuous-time macroeconomic model when it is reformulated as a discrete-time model with a sufficiently long period length.","[Flaschel, Peter] Univ Bielefeld, D-4800 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bielefeld,"Flaschel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, D-4800 Bielefeld, Germany.",pflaschel@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de; christian.proano@web.de,,"Proano, Christian/0000-0002-5148-7635",,,,,10,3,3,0,1,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

An external auditor is an independent service provider whose impact can provide significant influence on the organization being audited and its stakeholders. Even though they are not part of the organization, they play a key role in developing internal control. Auditors can comment on weaknesses in the accounting records, systems and controls that they review in the audit. They provide a statistical analysis on the clarity and effectiveness of the accounting policies put in place by the company. They also help management become aware of evidence that may affect future audits. They can give advice management through recommendations in their audit notes or discussions.

Organizational location matters. Organizational site is related to professional perspective and to the institutional outlook that attaches to various sorts of work in the academy. Five possible sites are explored, analyzing the dimensions of such locations from the experience of other new'' activities in universities. One type of site consists of an interstitial (Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004), nonacademic, support unit of managerial professionals (neither faculty nor senior level administrators), as in an Office of Technology Transfer or an Office of Institutional Research. A second type of site would be an academic unit in which measurement tasks could be performed by faculty members. A third type of site would be a hybrid model that combines elements of the first two models, as in the case of entrepreneurship units in many universities. A fourth possible type of site would be to situate such activity in an intermediating association (Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004) outside of the university, which mediates between public and private sectors, and that promotes various sorts of innovation and measurement as in the case of Educause and innovative information technologies. A fifth type of site would consist of establishing university extension units in the community, to provide services more directly to constituents, as traditionally was the model for agricultural extension in land grant universities. Each of the models has its owns benefits and challenges, its implications for what sorts of professionals would be doing the work and what they would see their principal function as being, and for the impact they would have on the academic workforce and the institution's direction.","[Rhoades, Gary] Univ Arizona, Coll Educ, Ctr Study Higher Educ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,,,,,,,,,46,2,2,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1048-4736,,978-1-84855-466-5,ADV STUD ENTREP INNO,,,2009,19.0,,,,,,237.0,267,,10.1108/S1048-4736(2009)0000019010,0.0,,,31,Business; Economics; Management; Social Issues,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Issues,BLP46,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270728000011,0

We provide weak stationarity conditions and unconditional moments to the fourth order. We apply this new class to Dow Jones index returns. We find that a two-component mixed exponential power distribution dominates mixed normal distributions with more components, and more parameters, both in-sample and out-of-sample. In contrast to mixed normal distributions, all the conditional variance processes become stationary. This happens because the mixed exponential power distribution allows for component-specific shape parameters so that it can better capture the tail behaviour. Therefore, the more general new class has attractive features over mixed normal distributions in our application: less components are necessary and the conditional variances in the components are stationary processes. Results on NASDAQ index returns are similar.","[Rombouts, Jeroen V.

This belief that tourism can cause long-run growth is known in the literature as the 'tourism-led growth hypothesis'. This case study of Brazil can be taken as a specific test for such a hypothesis. In the paper, two different econometric methodologies are applied to two distinct data sets, showing that the results are independent of either data or methodology. On the one hand, annual data from 1965 to 2007 for Brazil as a whole are used for a cointegration analysis to look for the existence of a long-run relationship among variables of economic growth, international tourism earnings and the real exchange rate. On the other hand, high-quality data for the 27 Brazilian states, though for a shorter period (from 1990 to 2005), enable the use of the dynamic panel data model proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991). The authors show that the long-run elasticities between real per capita GDP with respect to tourism receipts and the real rate of exchange are 0.13 and 0.30, respectively. Finally, they compare their results with those of similar studies.","[Brida, Juan Gabriel] Free Univ Bolzano, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, Sch Econ & Management, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Punzo, Lionello F.] Univ Siena, Dept Econ, Osservatorio Turismo Sostenibile, I-53100 Siena, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Siena,"Brida, JG (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bolzano, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, Sch Econ & Management, Via Sernesi 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",juangabriel.brida@unibz.it; punzo@unisi.it; risso@unisi.it,"Brida, Juan Gabriel/H-3727-2015","Brida, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-2319-5790",,,,,40,58,62,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

It first analyzes the co-movements between the survey indicators and the Italian business cycle by performing a sensitivity analysis with respect to the reference business cycle and to the filtering technique, using time and frequency domain methods. It then discusses the ability of such indicators to predict business cycles and their importance with respect to other standard national accounts data. The results of bivariate analysis show that, whereas the degrees of plant utilization, confidence climate and order book level are procyclical, inventories appear to be countercyclical with respect to both the industrial sector and the whole-economy business cycle. Spectral analysis suggests that the high-frequency elements of the survey data tend to lead those of the business-cycle estimates obtained from the national income accounts. The choice of filtering technique affects the results, especially in the magnitude of co-movements. The forecasting exercise reveals the usefulness of such data in forecasting the real economy in the short run.","Minist Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy",,"Cesaroni, T (通讯作者)，Minist Econ & Finance, Via 20 Settembre, Rome, Italy.",tatiana.cesaroni@tesoro.it,,,,,,,27,8,11,1,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

According to previous research on the modern portfolio theory, a company can reduce risks and thus increase its value with more diversified operations. Such reasoning can certainly apply to the hotel industry in terms of its segment strategy. However, the findings are inconclusive. In particular, other literature argues for more concentrated rather than diversified operations. This study therefore examines the impacts of segment diversification on companies' risk-adjusted performances among publicly traded US hotels.

We base our analysis on the July framework scenario which considers a tiered formula that adopts a Harbinson Approach plus sensitive and special product provisions. The results indicate that while the world prices of the major exportable commodities of the region will fall, those of their imports will rise. Subsequently, consumers of nearly all of the commodities analysed encounter potential welfare losses, while almost all producers of these commodities experience potential welfare gains. Consumers are expected to encounter an aggregate loss of about $591.93 million, while a net producer surplus of about $423.78 million is expected to be generated. However, because the gains by producers are insufficient to compensate consumers losses, the fifteen West African nations considered in the analysis are expected to experience a net welfare loss of about $168.16 million. On the contrary, large developing countries such as Brazil, India and China as well as developed nations like the EU and Japan are expected to enjoy net welfare gains. The net losses accrued to the region imply more poverty and heightened food insecurity as all West African countries faced severe hunger situation in 2010. However, even though these findings conform to other research results indicating net food importing countries will become losers from agricultural trade reform, while net food exporters experience welfare gains, concerns of data quality and reliability that are usually associated with macrolevel analysis render these results more indicative than definitive.","[Nuetah, John Alexander; Xian, Xin] China Agr Univ, Ctr Rural Dev Policy, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Nuetah, John Alexander; Xian, Xin] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Ting] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Nuetah, JA (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Ctr Rural Dev Policy, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,29,6,7,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2011,34.0,12,,,SI,,2044.0,2062,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01407.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,866AU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298352800004,0

It uses a large-dimensional structural approximate dynamic factor model. There are three main findings. First, common shocks, especially demand shocks, which seem to originate from the U.S., play an important role in explaining French economic activity. While international trade, relative prices, and foreign direct investment (FDI) flows are the main channels of transmission, the stock market, consumer confidence, and interest rates also matter. Second, France's integration with the rest of the world has increased over time. Third, there is some tentative evidence of regional components in explaining French output fluctuations; country-specific components also contribute. The predominance of exogenous factors affecting French output, the asymmetry in the transmission of shocks, and France's participation in a currency area argue for making French goods, services, and labor markets as flexible as possible.","[Kabundi, Alain] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [De Simone, Francisco Nadal] Cent Bank Luxemburg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",University of Johannesburg,"Kabundi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ, POB 524,Auckland Pk, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",akabundi@uj.ac.za; Francisco.NadaldeSimone@bcl.lu,"De Simone, Francisco Nadal/AAM-8710-2020; Nadal De Simone, Francisco de Asis/JRY-8897-2023",,,,,,60,6,8,0,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

It exploits available quarterly information not yet used in the literature, and combines different data sources in the framework of mixed-frequencies time series models. The quarterly frequency of our data allows us to decompose the casual effects into purely intra-annual effects and across-years effects. Our conclusions establish the existence of purely intra-annual links between public and private sector wages (signalling effect). There is strong evidence of public wages' leadership, either in conjunction with bi-directional links from the private sector (Spain, Italy) or pure public sector leadership (Germany and France in the sample 1991-2007). Our empirical approach allows us to also unveil a complex and rich structure of indirect links of wages with other variables (prices, productivity and institutional factors).","[Perez, Javier J.] Bank Spain, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Jesus Sanchez, A.] U Pablo de Olavide Ctra, Seville 41013, Spain",Banco de Espana; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Sánchez, AJ (通讯作者)，U Pablo de Olavide Ctra, Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",jesussanchez@upo.es,"SANCHEZ-FUENTES, A.

It also proposes an alternative paradigm for obtaining more robust estimates of volatility changes around official liberalisation dates and/or other important market events. By focusing on five East Asian emerging markets, all of which liberalised their financial markets in the late, and by using recent advances in the econometrics of structural change, it shows that (i) the detected breakdates in the volatility of stock market returns can be dramatically different to official liberalisation dates and (ii) the use of official liberalisation dates as breakdates can readily entail inaccurate inference. In contrast, the use of data-driven techniques for the detection of multiple structural changes leads to a richer and inevitably more accurate pattern of volatility evolution emerges in comparison with focussing on official liberalisation dates.","[Karoglou, Michail] Newcastle Univ, Dept Econ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Demetriades, Panicos] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester, Leics, England; [Law, Siong Hook] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Econ, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia",Newcastle University - UK; University of Leicester; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Karoglou, M (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Dept Econ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",mkaroglou@yahoo.co.uk,"Law, Siong Hook/AAF-6672-2020; Demetriades, Panicos/K-2279-2019","Law, Siong Hook/0000-0002-6058-4883; Demetriades, Panicos/0000-0002-4752-013X",,,,,41,1,1,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The results show that international property companies underperform local property companies in the early years of the sample period. This underperformance is driven by the political environment, the level of economic integration, and the transparency of the real estate market in target countries. The underperformance of internationals disappears in the later years of the sample period, and so does the significance of the aforementioned factors in explaining performance differences among international companies. These findings suggest that the increased transparency of the global real estate industry has leveled the playing field for foreign property investors.","[Eichholtz, Piet M.

We identify five main channels through which the housing market affects state and local tax revenues: property tax revenues, transfer tax revenues, sales tax revenues (including a direct effect through construction materials and an indirect effect through the link between housing wealth and consumption), and personal income tax revenues. We find that property tax revenues do not tend to decrease following house price declines. We conclude that the resilience of property tax receipts is due to significant lags between market values and assessed values of housing and the tendency of policy makers to offset declines in the tax base with higher tax rates. The other four channels have had a relatively modest effect on state tax revenues. We calculate that these channels jointly reduced tax revenues by $22 billion from 2006 to 2009. which is about 3% of total state own-source revenues in 2006. We conclude that the recent contraction in state and local tax revenues has been driven primarily by the general economic recession, rather than the housing market per-se.

We first characterize the bias introduced by misclassification on the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) under a conditional independence assumption, in both a binary and a multiple-treatment setting. We find that the bias of matching-type estimators computed from misclassified data cannot in general be signed. We subsequently provide easily implementable methods to bound the ATT of interest semiparametrically, in particular allowing for very general forms of impact heterogeneity and of the no-treatment outcome equations, as well as for some dependence of the misreporting probabilities on individual characteristics. The empirical problem that motivates our paper is the estimation of the wage returns to a number of educational qualifications in the United Kingdom, allowing for misreporting in attainment. We investigate the sensitivity of the raw estimates to the presence of misclassification and explore the identification power of plausible restrictions on the nature and extent of misclassification. We show that the resulting bounds are sometimes wide but generally point to reasonable ranges of positive values for average returns to schooling among the schooled. For the range of educational qualifications considered, we further show that the claim sometimes made that measurement error bias roughly cancels out selection bias is not supported. More generally, our results show that under relatively mild restrictions, we can obtain strong conclusions regarding our questions of interest.","[Battistin, Erich] Univ Padua, I-35100 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Battistin, E (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",,,"Battistin, Erich/0000-0001-6434-1734",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,42,16,18,0,14,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

We focus on the REIT industry. We find that bidder returns are higher for REITs with smaller boards, with more experienced CEOs, but with shorter tenure. Acquirers' announcement returns are also significantly and positively related to higher ownership by their CEOs and board directors.

Sale of the property in the above three options is conducted by a motivated seller, either the owner or the lender, who desires to sell the property as quickly as possible. Thus, relative to a no-default sale, the house is most likely to be sold at a discounted price. It is generally expected that the discount would be lower in the case of a short sale. This option, however, may result in a longer marketing time, thus a higher total loss, than the other two options. We developed a model that allows simultaneous estimation of price and time-on-market effects of short sales, foreclosures, and REO options. We find that the short-sale option has the lowest-price discount, but significantly higher costs associated with marketing time. The pattern of price discount and marketing time reverses as we move to a sale while in the process of foreclosure and to a sale with an REO status.","[Daneshvary, Nasser] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Clauretie, Terrence M.] Univ Nevada, Dept Finance, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Daneshvary, N (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, 4505 Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",mike.clauretie@unlv.edu; Nasser.daneshvary@unlv.edu,,,,,,,26,27,36,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This surge is attributed to 'size effects' whereby economies of scale and scope, and agglomeration impact, create productivity improvements. This paper concentrates on both conceptual and empirical studies about the most important contributions from real and financial sectors towards economic growth in large emerging economies. In particular, the transmission channels from finance to growth are discussed in this paper, to show how size effects can affect these transmission mechanisms from finance to development. The econometric estimations use a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model for four specific large emerging economies - BICS - and analyse dynamic shocks from real sectors and financial sectors, together with size-effect variables: education investment, government spending and military expenditures. We conclude that real shocks have much higher impact effects on output and growth compared to financial shocks.","[Sun, Puyang; Tong, Jiadong] Nankai Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Sun, Puyang] Univ Nottingham, GEP Res Ctr, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Sen, Somnath] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Nankai University; University of Nottingham; University of Birmingham,"Sun, PY (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,18,5,5,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2011,34.0,5,,,,,778.0,791,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01352.x,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,769RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291034800007,0

We examine the provision of accurate forecasts both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we use a simple Neo-Hotelling model. In that model, the public forecaster, the National Weather Service (NWS), tries to achieve socially-efficient forecast accuracy operating under a per capita tax constraint; on the other hand, the private providers compete against each other for profits by choosing their optimal level of forecast accuracy in a monopolistically competitive market in which each private provider caters to a market niche while co-existing with the NWS. Empirically, we use a unique data set on daily maximum temperature forecasts for 704 U.S. cities and estimate the nearest neighbor matching and the state fixed effect (FE) models. Our empirical findings are consistent with the predictions of our simple public good model: we find that forecast accuracy is sensitive to economic variables such as population and average household income in that the accuracy increases in these economic variables. Our most surprising theoretical and empirical finding is that population and income sensitivity is found not only for private forecasters but also for the public forecaster, the NWS.

There has been significant progress in the area of regulatory integration; however, an in-depth analysis requires also taking into account what happens on the ground - that is, at the market level. As a consequence of this larger and more interactive point of view, this article shows that financial integration is less uniform than a cursory look at the evolution of European Union regulation would have us believe. This is because national contexts continue to bear considerable weight. In particular, any explanation of the current state of affairs in the EU's financial integration needs to take the market-regulation nexus seriously. This implies looking at market structure as well as at the political and institutional context. This article suggest a framework to explain more adequately the contradictions between regulatory and market integration.","[Leblond, Patrick] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Grossman, Emiliano] Ctr Etud Europennes, Paris, France",University of Ottawa,"Leblond, P (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 55 Laurier Ave E,Off 11154, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",pleblond@uottawa.ca,"Grossman, Emiliano/B-8891-2009","Leblond, Patrick/0000-0002-9889-7498; Grossman, Emiliano/0000-0002-5547-6028",,,,,64,44,47,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In this paper, we provide empirical evidence that parsimonious versions of the model generate the best covariance forecasts in the absence of bias correction.

Following a sample of low- and moderate-income borrowers through the first years following home purchase, the analysis identifies differences in the refinancing transaction associated with the use of mortgage brokers vs. retail lenders. Specifically, the analysis includes measures of the refinancing process, including whether the lender initiated contact with the borrower, whether the terms of the mortgage changed at closing, and the level of borrower satisfaction in hindsight. Care must be taken in extrapolating from this sample to the broader mortgage market, as all borrowers refinanced out of 30-year fixed-rate purchase mortgages in the Community Advantage Program (CAP). Nevertheless, analysis of this sample offers unique insight into borrowers' interactions with mortgage brokers during the refinancing transaction. Origination with a mortgage broker, compared with origination through a retail lender, is associated with both a less satisfactory refinancing process and a higher likelihood of refinancing into an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM).","[Spader, Jonathan S.] Univ N Carolina, Ctr Community Capital, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Spader, Jonathan S.; Quercia, Roberto G.] Univ N Carolina, Ctr Community Capital, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Spader, JS (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Ctr Community Capital, CB 3452,1700 Martin Luther King Jr Blvd,Suite 129, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",spader@email.unc.edu; quercia@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

However, in the latter case (i.e. if the Time Delay Method is used) recent evidence has shown that spurious structures appear, strongly distorting the results of the indicators of the RQA and, consequently, the conclusions of our tests.

We distinguish between three modes of internationalisation: foreign direct investment, exporting and importing of capital goods. Our results point strongly at the superior performance of foreign affiliates vs domestic firms, exporters vs non-exporters, and importers vs non-importers: internationalised firms are larger, more capital intensive, pay higher wages and are more productive than purely domestic firms. Foreign ownership is the strongest factor accounting for gains from internationalisation. The premia from exporting are substantially lower, though also significantly positive. The performance of capital goods importers is also higher compared to non-importers and is to some extent related to their involvement in other types of international activity. The results are robust to the choice of specification and productivity estimator. The analysed enterprises recorded a sizeable and broad-based productivity improvement over the period under consideration. Not only the initial levels of productivity of exporters, importers and foreign affiliates were on average significantly higher that those of their non-internationalised counterparts, but they also recorded faster productivity gains (manifested in increasing productivity premia), so that the discrepancies grew even larger. We also perform the analysis of productivity spillovers from internationalised firms onto own, downstream and upstream sectors. We find evidence of significant horizontal and backward spillovers from all three types of international activity. Our results suggest that trade externalities are rather of a horizontal nature, while those related to foreign direct investment operate mainly via backward linkages.","[Hagemejer, Jan; Kolasa, Marcin] Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland; [Hagemejer, Jan] Univ Warsaw, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland; [Kolasa, Marcin] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski; University of Warsaw; Warsaw School of Economics,"Hagemejer, J (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Hagemejer, Jan/G-6339-2013; Kolasa, Marcin/AAA-4797-2021","Hagemejer, Jan/0000-0003-0775-3411; Kolasa, Marcin/0000-0003-4252-4622",,,,,43,37,37,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2011,34.0,1,,,,,74.0,100,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01294.x,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,708YX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286401300004,0

Dramatic falls in transport costs and free trade, enforced, if necessary, by colonial rule, combined to open vast frontier areas throughout Southeast Asia to global commerce and create a handful of large urban centres. These cities, through linking Southeast Asian primary commodity exporters to world markets, grew predominantly as part of the global economy. Our econometric analysis shows that measures of globalization in particular industrial production in the world core and international transport costs are much better predictors of the size of Southeast Asia's main cities than domestic factors such as total population, GDP per capita, land area or government expenditure.

A re-reading of the Economic Consequences of the Peace points along a path parallel to the one usually associated with Keynesian policies - deficit spending and public investments which relies on the concept of reasonableness. This paper outlines the context in which the Consequences was written and then traces Keynes's approach back to the Bloomsbury background. It is argued that the distinction between reason (or rationality) and reasonableness, to be seen also in Rawls, is one of the characteristic features of Keynes's economic thought which can be used to trace out a parallel between the humiliation of the conquered at Versailles and the debtor mortification inflicted on Lehman Brothers. The conclusion is that the return to Keynes we should wish for is not only a matter of supporting demand in order to avoid general deflation, or reform of the international monetary system to avert the effects of the present world imbalances, but more extensive application of the Keynesian concept of reasonableness against the so-called rationality of individuals and markets.","[Marcuzzo, Maria Cristina] Univ Roma, Dipartimento Sci Stat Sapienza, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,,cristina.marcuzzo@uniroma1.it,"Marcuzzo, Maria Cristina/AAK-8514-2020","Marcuzzo, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-4768-8872",,,,,22,7,7,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-14408-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,35.0,52,,10.1007/978-3-642-14409-7_3,0.0,,,18,Economics; History Of Social Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BVA34,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290894000004,0

Utilising survey data on employees working in the Australian aged-care industry, statistical analysis is used to test the mediating effect of order and predictability on associations between HPWS practices and employee experience of work. The results suggest that positive outcomes arise in part because HPWS practices contribute to workplace order and predictability. In explaining this finding, the article highlights the importance of contextual factors, notably industry and employee characteristics, in shaping outcomes. The article concludes that socio-logically oriented analyses which apprehend the importance of employee interests provide a useful supplement to conventional psychologically oriented accounts of HPWS and provide a basis for continued development of labour process theory.","[Harley, Bill; Sargent, Leisa] Univ Melbourne, Dept Management & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Allen, Belinda] Monash Univ, Dept Management, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",University of Melbourne; Monash University,"Harley, B (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Management & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",bharley@unimelb.edu.au; lsargent@unimelb.edu.au; belinda.allen@monash.edu,"Sargent, Leisa/AAQ-5888-2020; Sargent, Leisa D./IVH-0478-2023",,,,,,41,49,54,1,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In particular, it allows us to reconcile the empirical evidence with the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson predictions. Our focus here is on Italy. As for local trade - within its own cone of diversification - Italy is specialised in the production of unskill-intensive goods, while for global trade - with respect to the other cone of diversification - it is mainly specialised in the production of skill-intensive goods. On the evidence of these specialisation patterns, we point out that the local trade has a strong impact on wage inequality. In particular, in line with the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson predictions, the local export performance reduces wage inequality as it favours blue-collar workers.

Given that studies have paid little attention to the relationship between income and sensitivity to price, this paper analyses the relationship between income and tourists' sensitivities to price. The author identifies and measures these sensitivities individual by individual from real choices made by tourists: that is, tourist sensitivity to price is estimated for each individual by observing the destination he or she actually selects. The empirical application is carried out on a sample of 2,127 individuals and the operative formalization used to estimate individual sensitivities to price follows a random coefficient logit model. To detect how the sensitivities relate to income, a regression analysis is employed. The results show an anomalous relationship: income levels moderate tourist sensitivity to price such that increases in the first levels of income reduce the negative effect of price (as expected), but there is a 'saturation point' that is, beyond a threshold, tourist sensitivity to price increases again (the negative effect of price reappears) against expectations for these high-income earners.","Univ Alicante, Fac Econ, Dept Financial Econ Accounting & Mkt, E-03080 Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Nicolau, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Fac Econ, Dept Financial Econ Accounting & Mkt, POB 99, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",JL.Nicolau@ua.es,"Nicolau, Juan Luis/AAZ-6589-2021; Nicolau, Juan Luis/I-4982-2016","Nicolau, Juan Luis/0000-0003-0048-2823",,,,,25,1,1,0,10,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The results are important for the fiscal implications of changing benefit levels as the take-up rate is systematically related to the benefits potential recipients are entitled to receive.

This paper turns to U.S. county data on land inequality over the period 1890 to 1930 to help address this fundamental question in political economy. Redistributive policy was primarily decided at the local level during this period, making county-level data particularly informative. Examining within-state variation also reduces the potential impact of latent institutional and political variables. The paper also uses a variety of identification strategies, including historic variables as well as county weather and crop characteristics, as instruments for land inequality. The evidence consistently suggests that greater inequality is significantly associated with less redistribution. This negative relationship is especially large in heavily rural counties, where concentrated landownership implied that landed elites also controlled the majority of economic production.","Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Ramcharan, R (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,66,46,56,0,14,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Tax increment finance can move large portions of the tax base off the general fund tax rolls. Further, over time there is a reallocation of revenue streams away from the non-municipal overlying jurisdictions to the municipal government, and these resources are used to subsidize development. Over time local authorities may therefore adjust tax rates in response to changes in the tax base. Using data from nearly all Wisconsin municipalities over the 19902003 period, we find that the use of tax increment finance leads to increases in property tax rates in non-municipal overlapping jurisdictions while reducing rates in municipal governments. The tax burden reallocation appears to be temporary; non-municipal tax rates fall and municipal tax rates increase when tax increment finance districts close. This research shows that the burden of covering the tax increment finance development subsidies results in explicit changes in tax rates across jurisdictions. These findings serve to more fully inform the decision makers of the implications of using the tax increment tool. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, policies have been implemented to shift logistics operations to nighttime hours. The purpose of such policies has generally been to mitigate congestion and environmental impacts. However, the atmospheric boundary layer is generally more stable during the night than the day. Consequently, shifting logistics operations to the night may increase 24-h average concentrations of diesel exhaust pollutants in many locations. This paper presents realistic scenarios for two California cities, which provide diesel exhaust concentration and human intake estimates after temporal redistributions of daily logistics operations. Estimates are made for multiple redistribution patterns, including from 07:00-19:00 to 19:00-07:00, similar to daytime congestion charging polices, and from 03:00-18:00 to 18:00-03:00, corresponding to the PierPASS program at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Results for these two redistribution scenarios indicate that 24-h average exhaust concentrations would increase at most locations in California, and daily human intake is likely to worsen or be unimproved at best. These results are shown to be worse for inland than coastal settings, due to differences in meteorology.

J,"Weiss, J",,,,"Weiss, John",,,Changing Trade Structure and its Implications for Growth,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CHINA; EXPORTS,"There is a long tradition in the development literature that what a country exports matters for its growth prospects. Recent work has refocused on this issue by attempting to produce numerical scores for different types of product to identify the complexity or sophistication of a country's export basket. Based on the insight that the type of product an economy exports can have important implications for its economic performance and that goods exported predominantly by rich countries will have different characteristics from those exported by poor countries, Lall et al. (2006) put forward a means of classifying commodities based on the income levels of a product's main exporters. At around the same time, Hausmann et al. (2006), following a similar approach, put forward a slightly different form of product classification and Rodrik (2006) applied this specifically to an analysis of China. This paper highlights the difference between the approaches and its implications for the analysis of China, which appears less 'special' using the approach of Lall et al. It argues that the classification of products at a disaggregate level is a helpful starting point for assessing issues of trade competitiveness and that further work using either or both forms of classification is justified.","Univ Bradford, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England",University of Bradford,"Weiss, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bradford, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,11,8,8,0,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2010,33.0,10,,,,,1269.0,1279,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01281.x,0.0,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,658UY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000282516100004,0

This study uses retrospective life history data for Germany, the Netherlands and Great Britain to investigate the long-term effects of childbirth on mothers' labour supply for successive birth cohorts. Probit estimates with correction for selection into motherhood and the number of births show strong drops in participation before first childbirths and strong recovery after the birth of the last child, especially in Great Britain. Younger cohorts display a less sharp decline in participation around childbirth and a faster increase in participation in the 20 years after childbirth, especially in the Netherlands. However, mothers' participation rates do not return to pre-birth levels in any of the countries studied here. Labour market conditions and institutional public support seem to contribute to explaining the cross-country variation in participation after childbirth.","[Fouarge, Didier] Maastricht Univ, Res Ctr Educ & Labour Market ROA, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Manzoni, Anna] Yale Univ, Ctr Res Inequal & Life Course CIQLE, Dept Sociol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Muffels, Ruud; Luijkx, Ruud] Tilburg Univ, Dept Sociol, Tilburg, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); Yale University; Tilburg University,"Fouarge, D (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Res Ctr Educ & Labour Market ROA, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",d.fouarge@maastrichtuniversity.nl; anna.manzoni@yale.edu; Ruud.J.Muffels@uvt.nl; R.Luijkx@uvt.nl,"Luijkx, Ruud/L-1480-2019; Muffels, Ruud/E-3644-2013; Luijkx, Ruud/D-7164-2013; Manzoni, Anna/C-6962-2008","Muffels, Ruud/0000-0001-8559-7616; Luijkx, Ruud/0000-0002-9698-2891; Manzoni, Anna/0000-0003-3264-177X",,,,,35,20,25,1,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This paper process-traces the contentious creation of the Fund's Independent Evaluation Office (IEO). I use primary interviews conducted at the Fund headquarters in 2008-2010 and Fund archive documents dating back to the beginning of the debate over independent evaluation in 1992 to analyze the interaction of internal and external actors and interests that led finally to the creation of the IEO in 2001. I then comment on the 'performance of the performance evaluator.' I draw from a recent external evaluation of the IEO (Lissakers et al. 2006), as well as interviews and secondary sources, to identify enduring contestation over the IEO's function and scope of authority and to discern how this has affected the ability of the IEO to inform and shape the Fund's process and outcome performance. To this end, I discuss four issues currently facing the IEO: the need to establish both actual and perceived independence, the problems of ambiguous or non-existent metrics for assessing Fund performance, difficulties in balancing candor of evaluation reports with credibility in the eyes of multiple constituencies, and the challenges of fostering a culture of learning in the Fund.","Univ Texas Austin, LBJ Sch Publ Affairs, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Weaver, C (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, LBJ Sch Publ Affairs, 2315 Red River St,Mail Code E2700, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",ceweaver@austin.utexas.edu,,,,,,,51,30,35,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal.

It also provides a cross-country comparison of securitized real estate return predictability. In contrast to most of the literature on this issue, the analysis is not based on a multifactor asset pricing framework as such analyses may bias the results. We use a time series approach and thus create a level playing field to compare the predictability of the two asset classes. Forecasts are performed with ARMA and ARMA-EGARCH models and evaluated by comparing the entire empirical distributions of prediction errors, as well as with a trading strategy. The results, based on daily data for the 1990-2007 period, show that securitized real estate returns are generally more predictable than stock returns in countries with mature and well established REIT regimes. ARMA-EGARCH models are found to have portfolio outperformance potential even in the presence of transaction costs, with generally better results for securitized real estate than for stocks.","[Hoesli, Martin] Univ Geneva HEC & SFI, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Serrano, Camilo] Univ Geneva HEC, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Hoesli, Martin] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland; [Hoesli, Martin] Bordeaux Ecole Management CEREBEM, F-33405 Talence, France",University of Geneva; University of Geneva; University of Aberdeen,"Hoesli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva HEC & SFI, 40 Blvd Pont Arve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",martin.hoesli@unige.ch,,,,,,,51,32,35,2,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Psychological and medical studies often suggest an association between bipolar illness and creative achievement, but they tend to focus on eminent figures, case studies, or small samples. We seek to examine occupational creativity of non-eminent individuals with bipolar disorder. We use Epidemiologic Catchment Area data to estimate a multinomial logit model matched to an index of occupational creativity. Those with bipolar illness appear to be disproportionately concentrated in the most creative occupational category. Nonparametric kernel density estimates reveal that the densities of the occupational creativity variable for the bipolar and non-bipolar individuals significantly differ in the ECA data, and suggest that the probability of engaging in creative activities on the job is higher for bipolar than non-bipolar workers.

In addition, the joint predictive density can be used to construct simple statistics to evaluate the local internal consistency of a forecasting exercise of a system of variables. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that these simultaneous confidence regions provide approximately correct coverage in situations where traditional error bands, based on the collection of marginal predictive densities for each horizon, are vastly off the mark.

The flexibility of MCMC, and its ability to provide an objective measure for assessing model fit, makes it preferable to maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of stochastic production frontiers. Within the context of men's basketball, this article addresses the question of whether technical efficiency necessarily leads to success relative to one's competitors. Results indicate that (a) technical efficiency does not vary significantly, either across or within teams, implying that teams in the A-10 play at very close and high levels of efficiency and (b) technical efficiency does not correlate strongly with productivity, suggesting that the fundamental quality of one's resources are more important than an efficient use of those resources. In addition, parameter estimates suggest that a single turnover or offensive rebound could mean the difference between winning and losing.","[Rimler, Michael S.] Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, Cincinnati, OH 45207 USA; [Song, Seongho] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",University System of Ohio; Xavier University; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Rimler, MS (通讯作者)，Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, 3800 Victory Pkwy, Cincinnati, OH 45207 USA.",rimlerm@xavier.edu,,,,,,,35,14,19,0,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Concurrently, housing prices have grown faster in these skilled cities. This paper argues that the diffusion of computers and outsourcing may partly explain these two phenomena. In the presented model, skilled workers are more productive in skilled cities and need unskilled support services. The cities' unskilled workers can perform the support services, but when it is cheaper, such services can be undertaken by computers or outsourced to less-skilled cities. New technologies facilitating computerization and outsourcing can increase the skill share and housing prices in skilled cities relative to less-skilled cities, under reasonable assumptions. The basic economics is that the new technologies diminish the demand for unskilled workers in skilled cities and permit skilled workers to earn higher wages. which in turn increases the supply of skilled workers in skilled cities and drives up housing prices. Empirically, this paper documents five stylized facts that the theory can rationalize. Particularly important is rising skill premium in skilled cities relative to less-skilled cities, which supports a production theory involving shifts in labor demand. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The long-term model is formulated in the Markov Decision Process framework with risk-averse actions and transitional probabilities describing the uncertainty in the deterioration process. The well known Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is used as the measure of risk. The steady-state risk-averse M&R policies are modeled assuming no budget restriction. To address the short-term resource allocation problem, two linear programming models are presented to generate network-level polices with different objectives.

Using export data from 354 magisterial districts of South Africa for 1996 and 2001 we estimate spatial growth regressions that include measures of the degree of export specialization and diversification. Overall, exporting regions outperform other (less or non-) exporting regions. Also, we find that export specialisation, rather than export diversification, has been associated with local economic growth; with specialization in mining and agriculture being especially beneficial. Our results support the view that specialization in a locality's area of comparative advantage is good for local economic development. We also find that localities with higher initial levels of human capital, and higher subsequent population growth, performed better. This is consistent with the belief that policies aimed at strengthening human capital and improving agglomeration economies, will enhance local economic development.","[Naude, Wim] United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Bosker, Maarten] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Bosker, Maarten] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Matthee, Marianne] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa",University of Groningen; Utrecht University; North West University - South Africa,"Naudé, W (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland.",,"Matthee, Marianne/AAU-6454-2021; Naudé, Wim/E-3812-2017","Naudé, Wim/0000-0003-2496-6945; Matthee, Marianne/0000-0002-4679-9757",,,,,46,43,47,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2010,33.0,4,,,,,552.0,572,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01239.x,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,577KT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276222600002,0

It is assumed that one end of the road is in the central business district (CBD) and that the households are uniformly distributed along the road. Each individual makes trips from his/her residence to the CBD. Trip demand is elastic and depends on the cost of the trip (including congestion costs). During the first stage, the government determines the length of the expanded section given the width of that section. In the second stage, road users determine their trip demands by taking into consideration the trip cost function. In the process of solving this problem, the equilibrium traffic volume is first solved using differential equations. The optimal length of the expanded section is then solved by maximizing the social welfare. The analysis is then applied to the case of the Tucheng city - Banciao city - Taipei CBD corridor in the Taipei metropolitan area. The scheme of road expansion without tolling performs closely to the first-best scheme for the case of a high potential demand. This study's approach can serve as valuable reference for city planners engaged in road planning in a transportation corridor between the CBD and satellite cities in a metropolitan area.

Following these extensions, we examine the ability of the two routines to maximize the likelihood function for a sequence of test economies. Our results show that the CMA-ES routine clearly outperforms Simulated Annealing in its ability to find the global optimum and in efficiency. With ten unknown structural parameters in the likelihood function, the CMA-ES routine finds the global optimum in 95% of our test economies compared to 89% for Simulated Annealing. When the number of unknown structural parameters in the likelihood function increases to 20 and 35, then the CMA-ES routine finds the global optimum in 85 and 71% of our test economies, respectively.

J,"Bandelj, N",,,,"Bandelj, Nina",,,How EU Integration and Legacies Mattered for Foreign Direct Investment into Central and Eastern Europe,EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This essay uses the case of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Central and Eastern Europe to stipulate how European Union (EU) integration affected the economic globalisation of the post-socialist region. Existing studies argue that expectations of impending EU membership had a direct effect on raising FDI inflows because they reduced perceived investment risks for potential investors. In contrast, I show that the EU accession process worked through an indirect effect on FDI: it influenced post-socialist states' efforts to promote FDI as a desirable strategy of economic development and the behaviour of firms. These state efforts, in turn, increased FDI inflows, net of conventional risk and return factors. Further analyses indicate that decisions about state FDI-promotion have been influenced not only by EU conditionality but also, and importantly, by particular legacies, namely the countries' initial choice of privatisation strategies, extent of reform during socialism and history of state sovereignty. Overall, the results suggest that EU integration and legacies of the past shape both the structural and the ideational context for domestic decision-making elites in Central and Eastern Europe, and may act not only as constraints but also as enabling conditions facilitating the global economic integration of the region.","Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Bandelj, N (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Sci, 4263 Social Sci Plaza B, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",nbandelj@uci.edu,,"Bandelj, Nina/0000-0002-7103-7252",,,,,71,22,25,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2010,62.0,3,,,,,481.0,501,,10.1080/09668131003647846,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,593BA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277425300005,0

Presumably, developing countries conclude these agreements in order to attract much-needed capital to their economies. Although the positive effect of BITs on foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows may seem straightforward, the findings produced by extant research are mixed. This article advances the study of the relationship between BITs and FDI in two manners. First, it draws attention to the often underappreciated distinction between signed and mutually-ratified treaties. It argues that only BITs in force function as a costly signal of pro-investment climate and a credible commitment to the protection of FDI. Second, it employs a comprehensive data set on American investment in developing countries to empirically evaluate the effect of BITs on FDI inflows. Employing a variety of model specifications and accounting for potential endogeneity, the findings indicate that BITs have the expected positive effect on FDI inflows, but only to the extent that they are in force.","Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Haftel, YZ (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",,,,,,,,52,81,97,4,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The difficulty comes from the fact that desire does not depend on pleasure as an impression, but on the force of an idea of pleasure, based upon a belief in the realisation of the correlative impression. Typically, this belief is linked to the underlying emotional state, expressed in the degree of violence of the passions, which governs both the individual's reactivity to pleasure, and his preference for present (compared with future) pleasures. On the contrary, interest and happiness do not depend on the distortion introduced by beliefs, and are directly linked to pleasure. It is shown that the decisional valuation only coincides with interest in the case of what Hume called a 'calm passion', which gives birth to the greatest happiness.","Univ Paris 01, PHARE, F-75647 Paris 13, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Lapidus, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, PHARE, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",lapidus@univ-paris1.fr,,"Lapidus, Andre/0000-0003-4412-821X",,,,,23,7,8,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

The results indicate that stringent mitigation targets can be met under many technology scenarios, but major technological change is needed, highlighting important roles for R&D and learning-by-doing. The analysis explores the impact of limiting the set of available technology options (to account for technical uncertainties and issues of public acceptance) and identifies important influences on energy system development and economic costs under low stabilization. Biomass availability is seen to have a major influence on the characteristics of the energy system. Carbon capture and storage technologies also prove to be potentially critical for both electricity and fuel synthesis, particularly when combined with biomass to produce net negative emissions. Additionally, the availability of fast breeders provides a competitive zero-emissions option. Energy efficiency and large-scale application of renewables are also critical to realising low stabilization scenarios.","[Magne, Bertrand; Kypreos, Socrates] Paul Scherrer Inst, Energy Modeling & Syst Anal Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Turton, Hal] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Paul Scherrer Inst, Energy Econ Grp, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Paul Scherrer Institute,"Magné, B (通讯作者)，Paul Scherrer Inst, Energy Modeling & Syst Anal Grp, Zurich, Switzerland.",Bertrand.Magne@iea.org,,,,,,,44,28,28,0,18,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2010,31.0,,,,1,,83.0,107,,,,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,681SC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284336100004,0

Test results are as follows: (1) there isn't a time-varying co-integration relationship between GDP and services industries; the time-varying equilibrium has a steady increasing trend. Based on the analysis, the author put forward some suggestions on the development of China's service industry.","[Wang Bifeng] Liaoning Univ, Sch Econ, Shenyang 110036, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Wang Bifeng; Lai Zhihua] Shijiazhuang Univ Econ, Sch Econ & Trade, Shijiazhuang 050031, Hebei, Peoples R China",Liaoning University; Hebei GEO University,"Wang, BF (通讯作者)，Liaoning Univ, Sch Econ, Shenyang 110036, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",wangbifeng201@sina.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-14-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,37.0,43,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE32,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298225400007,0

Economists have traditionally opposed environmental regulations based on the argument that regulations reduce economic growth. Some scholars, however, have argued that polluting firms often adjust to environmental regulations through technological innovations that have the opposite effect. This study examines the effects of environmental regulations on economic growth through a case study of the metal finishing industry in the South Coast Basin of Southern California. The industry in the Basin has been regulated since 1988 by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) as a result of the industry's use of hexavalent chromium. Based on a comparative analysis of the metal finishing industries in Chicago and Detroit, it appears that the AQMD regulations have not had a detrimental impact on the growth of the industry in the Basin.","Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Northridge, CA 91330 USA",California State University System; California State University Northridge,"Thomas, W (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.",thomas@csun.edu,,,,,,,60,20,23,1,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

We offer a model of international capital allocation where firms are heterogeneous in their ability to manipulate transfer prices. Perhaps paradoxically, we show that the ability to shift profits can make parent companies' investment more sensitive to host-country tax rates, as long as investors expect fiscal authorities to use price and profit detection methods. We then offer a comprehensive empirical study to test our predictions in the case of Japanese FDI. We exploit the finding that the unobservable ability to manipulate transfer prices is correlated with whole ownership of affiliates and R&D expenditure. Based on country, parent firm and sector characteristics, we estimate an investment equation on a sample of 3,614 Japanese affiliates in 49 emerging countries. We obtain a greater semi-elasticity of investment to the statutory tax rate in affiliates that are wholly-owned and that have R&D-intensive parents. We interpret these results as indirect evidence that abusive transfer pricing is one of the determinants of FDI activity.","[Azemar, Celine] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Azémar, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,"Azemar, Celine/0000-0002-0560-8934",,,,,32,10,11,0,17,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2009,32.0,9,,,,,1291.0,1318,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01210.x,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,487YV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269316500003,0

Because real estate investment trusts (REITs) must distribute 90% of their earnings as dividends, many are repeat participants in the seasoned equity market. Thus, REITs have unusually strong incentives to strive for security market transparency. We find that the capital markets reward REITs that overinvest in audit services with better liquidity as measured by bid-ask spreads. However, firms with abnormally high nonaudit expenditures appear to be penalized with wider spreads, consistent with the notion that such fees may compromise auditor independence.","[Danielsen, Bartley R.; Warr, Richard S.] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Harrison, David M.] Texas Tech Univ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Van Ness, Robert A.] Univ Mississippi, Oxford, MS 38677 USA",North Carolina State University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of Mississippi,"Danielsen, BR (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",brdaniel@ncsu.edu; david.m.harrison@ttu.edu; rvanness@bus.olemiss.edu; rswarr@ncsu.edu,,"Warr, Richard/0000-0001-9918-0643",,,,,50,21,23,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2009,37.0,3,,,,,515.0,557,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00250.x,0.0,,,43,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,489AO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269392000006,0

This issue is examined here with a large socio-economic dataset from the Greek prefectures. We start by identifying spatial patterns of association in the data through an exploratory spatial data analysis and then explore the persistence of spatial clustering across socio-economic indicators through the application of a number of simple statistical tests. Greece presents an interesting case for examination, given its complex nature of geographical disparities and spatial heterogeneity. The derived results are important for Greek regional policy, as they help highlight yet another dimension of the challenges it faces for regional development, but they are also of particular relevance for applied spatial analysis, as they offer new insights in the analysis of spatial processes.","London Sch Econ, European Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Monastiriotis, V (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",v.monastiriotis@lse.ac.uk,", Vassilis/AAI-9243-2021",", Vassilis/0000-0003-3709-3119",,,,,34,20,25,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We show that the average height of adult Koreans increased from the beginning to the end of Japanese rule from about 164 to 166 cm. Height increased slightly before 1910 and dramatically after 1945, but during occupation declined slightly for a few years, only to rise rapidly through the late 1920s, and then stagnated until liberation. This finding is corroborated by a similar study of the Taiwanese under Japanese rule. The deterioration in the growth rates of both peoples from about 1930 to 1945 may be due to the deterioration of living conditions in the two colonies, victims of Japan's economic depression of 1927 and then of austerity measures as Japan mobilized for war.

In response, many communities have experimented with local regulations to encourage land conservation, but little is known about their effects on land-use change or housing supply. Wetlands protection bylaws are a potentially important and highly controversial form of local land-use regulation in Massachusetts. This paper uses conditional variation in the timing of adoption of these bylaws across communities to analyze their effects on rates of land-use change and housing growth from 1971 to 1999. We find that bylaws significantly reduced the rate of land conversion from open space to residential uses in communities where they were enacted, but did not significantly reduce growth in housing units. housing values or housing density in those communities. We do not find strong evidence that land-use conversion was displaced to neighboring communities, but supply constraints may have encouraged additional development at alternate sites within communities or additional higher density housing development in communities where it was allowed.

The strategy of a leading team becomes more defensive, resulting in fewer goal shootings by that team, as well as fewer shooting opportunities for the opponent.

To derive testable hypotheses, we set up a theoretical model that analyses the sensitivity of wages to the variability in productivity conditions in a unionised oligopoly framework. The model distinguishes centralised and decentralised wage determination. The theoretical results predict wages to be negatively associated with the degree of firm heterogeneity under centralised wage-setting, as unions internalise negative externalities of a wage increase for low-productivity firms. We test this prediction using a linked employer-employee panel data set from the German mining and manufacturing sector. Consistent with our hypotheses, the empirical results suggest that under industry-level bargaining workers in more heterogeneous sectors receive lower wages than workers in more homogeneous sectors. In contrast, the degree of firm heterogeneity is found to have no negative impact on wages in uncovered firms and under firm-level contracts.","Ctr European Econ Res, Dept Labour Markets Human Resources & Social Poli, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Guertzgen, N (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res, Dept Labour Markets Human Resources & Social Poli, L 7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",Guertzgen@zew.de,,,,,,,24,5,5,0,4,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We analyse both conditional and unconditional measures of the price-to-price deviation by using the geometry of least squares as an auxiliary tool. We discuss two fundamental types of measure: the correlation between two different sets of prices, and the dispersion in a set of ratios between pairs of prices. We show that none of these measures can be used to estimate the actual degree of disequilibrium in a real system of prices, due to a problem related to the selection of measurement units.","[Diaz, Emilio] Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ, Seville 41018, Spain; [Osuna, Ruben] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Dept Econ Anal, Madrid 28040, Spain",University of Sevilla; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Díaz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ, Ave Ramon & Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain.",emidiaz@us.es; rosuna@uned.cee.es,"Osuna, Ruben/A-6497-2009","Osuna, Ruben/0000-0001-8581-5644; , Emilio Diaz-Calleja/0000-0003-1644-6923",,,,,28,10,11,1,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper offers an analysis of additional factors that affect rent, such as landlord and tenant characteristics and the landlord-tenant interaction. We examine a novel data set of the Norwegian rental market and obtain substantial improvements in explanatory power by including tenant and landlord characteristics.

Officials of clubs often argue that the atmosphere in an arena is significantly better than that of a multipurpose facility and that spectators prefer such an atmosphere. Estimated panel regression with fixed effects shows a significant positive effect of a monofunctional soccer stadium on spectator demand. Controlling for other demand determinants in the German professional soccer league, Bundesliga, an isolated effect of around 2,800 additional spectators a game can be found.

We investigate how people really do rank distributions in terms of welfare. According to Harsanyi, the evaluation can be done from the standpoint of an uninvolved external judge, a public official, for example, or by a person who knows that she holds one of the positions in society, with an equal chance for any of the available positions. Are these two structures to be viewed differently? We use a questionnaire experiment to focus on the two different interpretations of the Harsanyi approach.

This method illustrates the intuition why the ex ante efficient allocation is Bayesian implementable through the Stegeman (1996) auction (a second-price auction with a reserve price equal to seller's valuation and no entry fee). More importantly, our method leads to an alternative ex ante efficient auction that implements uniquely the efficient entry.

Rather than simply infer the oil price changes as oil supply shocks, we identify three different shocks in the crude oil market: the oil supply shock, the global aggregate demand shock, and the oil-market specific demand shock. We then use impulse response functions to compute the conditional oil price pass-through ratios. It is found that the largest oil price pass-through is caused by oil supply shocks. However, evidence from historical decompositions suggests that the oil price movements have been driven by shocks from strong global aggregate demand and oil demand while only minor contributions come from oil supply shocks. Disentangling demand and supply shocks in the crude oil market helps to uncover the fact that a recent decline in unconditional oil price pass-through may come from the low conditional pass through caused by global demand shocks.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chen, SS (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 21 Hsu Chow Rd, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",sschen@ntu.edu.tw,"Chen, Shiu-Sheng/ABD-4421-2020","Chen, Shiu-Sheng/0000-0003-2289-5063",,,,,16,16,16,1,10,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,30.0,4,,,,,141.0,154,,,,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,500HU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270290500005,0

The FIGARCH model also demonstrates strong evidence of LM for volatility for most of oil and products prices' returns, with also different resilience levels. Structural breaks have only the partial effects of slightly reducing persistence for just absolute and-squared returns. Examining the forecasting behavior of two competing models, the less parsimonious ARFIMA which satisfies the LM property, and the parsimonious ARMA with short-term processes, the ARFIMA model provides significantly better out-of-sample forecasts at all forecasting horizons for all three Petroleum types.","[Hammoudeh, Shawkat] Drexel Univ, Lebow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Choi, Kyongwook] Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, Seoul 130743, South Korea",Drexel University; University of Seoul,"Hammoudeh, S (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, Lebow Coll Business, 3141 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",kwchoi@uos.ac.kr; Hammousm@drexel.edu,,"Hammoudeh, Shawkat/0000-0002-5455-5453",,,,,32,34,38,0,13,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,30.0,2,,,,,97.0,116,,,,,,20,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,426UV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264734400005,0

This paper treats these abnormal episodes or price spikes as count events and attempts to build a model of the spiking process. By contrast to the existing literature, which either ignores temporal dependence in the spiking process or attempts to model the dependence solely in terms of deterministic variables (like seasonal and day of the week effects), this paper argues that persistence in the spiking process is an important factor in building an effective model. A Poisson autoregressive framework is proposed in which price spikes occur as a result of the latent arrival and survival of system stresses. This formulation captures the salient features of the process adequately, and yields forecasts of price spikes that are superior to those obtained from naive models that do not account for persistence in the spiking process.","[Christensen, Timothy; Hurn, Stan] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Lindsay, Kenneth] Univ Glasgow, Dept Math, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Glasgow,"Christensen, T (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",t.christensen@qut.edu.au,,"Hurn, Stan/0000-0002-6134-7943",,,,,36,31,33,1,12,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,30.0,1,,,,,25.0,48,,,,,,24,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,390FK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262149500002,0

In addition, we emphasize the moderating role of social networks in the relationship between prior knowledge and entrepreneurial alertness. This study is a pilot study of a larger survey of nascent entrepreneurs in China's Taiwan Province. Participants were founders of start-ups in Taiwanese incubators. We mailed a structured questionnaire to a total of 756 entrepreneurs and 45 (6.0%) valid returns were obtained. Results indicate that social networks comprising weak ties had positive effects on entrepreneurial alertness. In addition, interpretation ability was positively associated with the innovativeness of the opportunities the entrepreneurs recognized.

The analysis focuses on the impact on inflation (through the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and its energy component) in the short and medium run. The main conclusion is that, in the short term, changes in oil prices are of vital importance for the understanding of inflation, but that at longer horizons their impact on inflation is much more complex and depends on the initial shock. An analysis of the sources of oil price increases remains therefore a pre-requisite for a proper understanding of historical fluctuations of oil prices and the related developments in the euro area, and for drawing policy conclusions.","[Jacquinot, Pascal; Mestre, Ricardo; Spitzer, Martin] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Kuismanen, Mika] Minist Finance, FI-00023 Helsinki, Finland",European Central Bank,"Jacquinot, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",pascal.jacquinot@ecb.int; mika.kuismanen@vm.fi,,,DSGE,DSGE,"This paper relies heavily on work done in the construction of the DSGE model presented, for which the authors are grateful to Paolo Pesenti, Dirk Muir and participants in ECB seminars for invaluable advice and remarks.

The political economy explanation presented here emphasizes the role of politics and policy - especially regulatory policies and overall development strategies - in setting the external parameters of variation among groups, and also incorporates additional internal economic logics ( economies of scope and risk reduction). This political economic approach helps distinguish the core logics of three main kinds of business groups - organic, portfolio, and policy-induced - that have reacted differently to recent trends in market reform and globalization.","MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Schneider, BR (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,57,54,66,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

These changes were well underway prior to the Asian crisis of 1997-98 but have been consolidated and accelerated by post-crisis reforms that have further institutionalized market-oriented practices. However, the changing patterns of financial markets have not preordained convergence towards the Anglo-American model of capitalism and have shown significant divergences from financial liberalism. Challenging the market-driven convergence and historical institutionalist models, this article locates the political sources of changing financial structures within the interaction between international structural forces and domestic interest alliances of private and public actors. This interactive process has not only oriented the national financial architecture towards securities markets but also made market-oriented changes different from the neo-liberal paradigm.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Zhang, XK (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Zhang, Xiaoke/N-4837-2016",,,,,,98,14,15,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Using programming or regression models, efficiency is defined as the distance of a given team observation from the technology. In this article, the authors show that the standard measures of efficiency using deterministic models are biased downward due to serial correlation with respect to the efficiency measure. In particular, if the number of observed wins for a given team is affected by the team's inefficiency, it is necessarily true that another team is able to produce outside of the technology. As a result, the observed frontier is not feasible if all inefficiency is eliminated.

The study found that regional growth trends show strong common features among groups of regions in Sweden. Natural-resource-rich regions benefited from the First Industrial Revolution. Contrary to regional development in many other European economies, a growth surge in Sweden later benefited virtually the whole country during the Second Industrial Revolution. The countrywide trend of growth slowed in the 1970s when the metropolitan regions became the main growth engines. In mid- and short-term cyclical movements, regions display more heterogeneous growth patterns, and we find evidence of mid-term, sequential lead-lag patterns in regional growth, especially between urban cores and the periphery.

We suggest that work to date has focused on the effects of improvements in transport technologies, changes in the price of transport, physical infrastructure provision, behavioural change and alternative institutional arrangements for governing transport systems. In terms of research methodologies, positivist and quantitative analysis prevails, although there are signs of experimentation with non-positivist epistemologies and participatory methods. These particular engagements with climate change mitigation reflect mutually reinforcing tendencies within and beyond the academic transport community. We first draw on a revised version of Thomas Kuhn's philosophy of science to explore the path dependencies within transport studies, which are at least partly responsible for the predisposition towards quantitative modelling and technology, pricing and infrastructure oriented interventions in transport systems. We then employ the governmentality perspective to examine how transport academics' engagements with climate change mitigation depend on and align with more general understandings of climate change in UK society and beyond. The analysis makes clear that ecological modernisation and neo-liberal governmentality more generally provide the context for the current focus on and belief in technological, behaviour change, and especially market-based mitigation strategies. While current research trajectories are important and insightful, we believe that a deeper engagement with theoretical insights from the social sciences will produce richer understandings of transport mitigation in transport and briefly outline some of the contributions thinking on socio-technical transitions and practice theories can make.

It has been more recently established that because they carry out so many different tasks, a balance of skills may be beneficial to entrepreneurs (Lazear (2004, 2005)). This paper unifies these approaches to agglomeration and entrepreneurship. The paper's model of multidimensional task completion generates several interesting results. First, agglomeration economies arising from market thickness are reflected in shorter completion times. Second, complex projects that are infeasible in small cities may be feasible in large cities, where adaptation costs and completion times are lower. Third, it may be possible for less balanced entrepreneurs to manage successfully in large cities by substituting local market thickness for a balance of skills. Fourth, the Lazear result on the balance of entrepreneurs is shown to be related to Jacobs' (1969) classic result on urban diversity (city balance). Both are special cases of a more general sort of balance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, the relationship between changes in activity-travel behavior on the one hand and public acceptability and its most important determinants on the other are investigated by means of a stated adaptation experiment. Using a two-stage hierarchical model, it was found that behavioral changes themselves are not dependent on the perceived acceptability of road pricing itself, and that only a small amount of the variability in the behavioral changes were explained by socio-cognitive factors. The lesson for policy makers is that road pricing charges must surpass a minimum threshold in order to entice changes in activity-travel behavior and that the benefits of road pricing should be clearly communicated, taking into account the needs and abilities of different types of travelers. Secondly, earlier findings concerning the acceptability of push measures were validated, supporting transferability of results. In line with other studies, effectiveness, fairness and personal norm all had a significant direct impact on perceived acceptability. Finally, the relevance of using latent factors rather than aggregate indicators was underlined. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, the authors consider a type of within-season uncertainty termed playoff uncertainty (PLU). As with any type of within-season uncertainty, this concept looks at how demanders respond to the probability that their team has a chance of winning over the course of the season. But more specifically, PLU focuses on whether attendance is affected by a team's chance of making the playoffs. Looking at attendance data on a monthly basis, the authors find that a tighter pennant race does enhance league-wide attendance, but only for those months toward the end of the season when the pennant race is heating up.","[Krautmann, Anthony C.] Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Lee, Young Hoon] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Quinn, Kevin] St Norbert Coll, De Pere, WI 54115 USA",DePaul University; Sogang University,"Krautmann, AC (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",akrautma@depaul.edu,"Lee, Young/AFO-2829-2022","Lee, Young/0000-0002-1104-9446",,,,,22,7,9,1,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Using an original data set from nearly 200 interviewees, the article examines the policy preferences of top bureaucrats of the European Commission. It shows that top Commission managers favour deeper European integration regardless of their national background or their organizational experience. The tilt of the Commission bureaucracy toward supranationalism is indicated by a broader consensus within the organization on some of the most controversial initiatives in the EU, such as the constitutional treaty, Turkish accession and the directive for the liberalization of the services sector. This notable consensus suggests that despite occasional policy setbacks and perceived intergovernmental 'trends', the Commission will continue serving its integrative mission.","[Ellinas, Antonis A.] Coll Holy Cross, Worcester, MA USA; [Suleiman, Ezra N.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",College of the Holy Cross; Princeton University,"Ellinas, AA (通讯作者)，1 Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",aellinas@holycross.edu; esuleiman@princeton.edu,,"Ellinas, Antonis/0000-0002-4757-5018",,,,,40,22,23,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Vehicle registration tax and annual motor tax rates in Ireland changed in July 2008 from being based on engine size to emissions performance of cars. This paper provides a one year ex-post analysis of the first year of the tax change, tracking the change in purchasing trends arising from the measure related to specific CO2 emissions, engine size and fuel, and the implications for car prices. CO2 emissions abatement, and revenue gathered. While engine efficiency improvements had been offset by purchasing trends towards larger and generally less efficient cars in the past, with the average MJ/km remaining constant from 2000 to 2007, this analysis shows that in the first year of the new taxation system the average specific emissions of new cars fell by 13% to 145 g/km. This was brought about, not by a reduction in engine size, but rather through a significant shift to diesel cars. Despite an unexpected reduction in car sales due to a recession in 2008, the policy measure has had a larger than anticipated impact on CO2 emissions, calculated to be 5.9 ktCO(2) in the first year of the measure. The strong price signal did however result in a 33% reduction in tax revenue from VRT, in financial terms amounting to a drop of 166 million compared to a baseline situation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In most metropolitan areas, there is insufficient road space to dedicate a portion exclusively for cyclists without negatively affecting existing motorists. Thus, it is crucial to find an efficient way to implement a road diet plan that both maximizes the utility for cyclists and minimizes the negative effect on motorists. A network design problem (NDP), which is usually used to find the best option for providing extra road capacity, is adapted here to derive the best solution for limiting road capacity. The resultant NDP for a road diet (NDPRD) takes a bi-level form. The upper-level problem of the NDPRD is established as one of multi-objective optimization. The lower-level problem accommodates user equilibrium (UE) trip assignment with fixed and variable mode-shares. For the fixed mode-share model, the upper-level problem minimizes the total travel time of both cyclists and motorists. For the variable mode-share model, the upper-level problem includes minimization of both the automobile travel share and the average travel time per unit distance for motorists who keep using automobiles after the implementation of a road diet. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is mobilized to solve the proposed problem. The results of a case study, based on a test network, guarantee a robust approximate Pareto optimal front. The possibility that the proposed methodology could be adopted in the design of a road diet plan in a real transportation network is confirmed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Using various measures of macroeconomic and financial risks, I find that the surges in counterparty risk premiums were predominantly driven by heightened uncertainties about the macroeconomy and financial market, as well as underlying mortgage default risks. The new liquidity facility that the Federal Reserve established, the Term Auction Facility, significantly relieved the strains in the money market, primarily through lowering banks' liquidity concerns.

Empirically, this implies that the consumption-to-output ratio and the investment-to-output ratio must be stationary and that consumption and investment must be cointegrated with output. This article tests these implications with respect to Germany, using unit root tests and cointegration techniques that allow for an endogenously determined structural break. We find that the long-run growth path of the German economy is consistent with the balanced-growth hypothesis if we allow for a structural break associated with the worldwide productivity slowdown of the early 1970s.","[Kemper, Niels; Herzer, Dierk] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Appl Econometr & Int Econ Policy, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Zamparelli, Luca] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ Theory, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Goethe University Frankfurt; Sapienza University Rome,"Kemper, N (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Appl Econometr & Int Econ Policy, Grunerburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",nkemper@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de; dierkherzer@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de; l.zamparelli@dte.uniroma1.it,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In our theory a policy choice is legitimate if the process through which the final choice was determined is consistent with some principle that can be used to (perhaps partially) rank the potential policy choices. The set of principles in any choice situation is taken to be exogenous, but a decision-making process is defined so as to deal with any nontrivial set of principles. Such a process is itself referred to as legitimate if it is guaranteed to select a legitimate outcome for each possible exogenous set of principles. We characterize the class of procedures that are legitimate, prove that legitimate policy decisions consistent with principles always exist and characterize the set of policy decisions that are legitimate for a any given set of principles. As we do not require the principles to be weak orders of the alternatives, our theory provides a notion of legitimacy that can be satisfied even when the guiding principles are potentially cyclic or incomplete. Accordingly, our theory illustrates one nontautological means by which majoritarian principles can be reconciled with legitimacy.","[Patty, John W.; Penn, Elizabeth Maggie] Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Washington University (WUSTL),"Patty, JW (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",jpatty@wustl.edu; penn@wustl.edu,,,,,,,64,5,11,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2011,36.0,3-4,,,,,365.0,382,,10.1007/s00355-010-0509-y,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,726TZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287750400002,0

On its basis, we argue that sometimes, a regulator aiming at maximising social welfare should affect the environment in such a way that it becomes 'less safe' in common perception. More specifically, we introduce a bias into each agent's choice of optimal risk levels: consequently, in certain environments, agents choose a behaviour that realises higher risks than intended. Individuals incur a welfare loss through this bias. We show that by deteriorating the environment, the regulator can motivate individuals to choose behaviour that is less biased, and hence realises risk levels closer to what individuals intended. We formally investigate the conditions under which such a Beneficial Safety Decrease-i.e. a deteriorating intervention that has a positive welfare effect-exists. Finally, we discuss three applications of our model.","[Rosencrantz, Holger] Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Grune-Yanoff, Till] Helsinki Coll Adv Studies, Helsinki, Finland",Royal Institute of Technology; University of Helsinki,"Rosencrantz, H (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden.",till.grune@helsinki.fi; hrz@kth.se,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2011,70.0,2,,,,,195.0,213,,10.1007/s11238-010-9235-2,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,700NR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285751200005,0

S. business incubators and to explore the geographically bounded factors that influence the location of business incubators. The authors' data show that U. S. business incubators are unevenly distributed across urban/rural divisions, states, and counties. Factor analysis identifies three common factors from 28 demographic, social, and economic variables drawn from publicly available data at the county level. These factors include agglomeration, welfare, and business/entrepreneurship. The results of binomial logistic regressions suggest that incubators are more likely to be found in counties with high levels of agglomeration but low levels of existing business development. Our findings suggest support for the incubation push hypothesis over the business pull hypothesis on the location of business incubators based on the regional configuration of incubator presence.","[Qian, Haifeng] Cleveland State Univ, Maxine Goodman Levin Coll Urban Affairs, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Haynes, Kingsley E.; Riggle, James D.] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University; George Mason University,"Haynes, KE (通讯作者)，4400 Univ Dr,MS 3C6, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",khaynes@gmu.edu,,"Qian, Haifeng/0000-0001-8371-5826",,,,,18,14,22,1,55,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Hawtrey's main contributions to the theory of the lender of last resort (LLR), both national and international (ILLR). This theory is a continuation of one of the traditions of the classical period, started by Henry Thornton, which differs in important points from that of Walter Bagehot. In their treatment of the classical concepts the authors partly depart from the interpretation of Thomas M. Humphrey, who considers that Thornton and Bagehot have basically the same approach about LLR. Hawtrey renewed Thonton's views and extended the concepts to new problems, including the ILLR. Hawtrey built a model of LLR in a dynamic macroeconomic model that includes the Cambridge market for cash balance and introduces the bases of a theory of ILLR, describing the sequence of twin crisis, exchange and banking crisis, thus explaining the difficulties for an ILLR to act on the currency market without taking the risks involved, in a situation completely different to the one faced on the money market by the national LLR.","[des Roches, Jerome de Boyer] Univ Paris 09, LEDa SDFi & PHARE, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Solis Rosales, Ricardo] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Iztapalapa 09340, DF, Mexico",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico,"des Roches, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, LEDa SDFi & PHARE, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",jdbdr@free.fr; rsolis47@yahoo.com.mx,,,,,,,51,5,5,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Contemporary debates, fuelled by the recent crisis, commonly draw on the concepts of input and output legitimacy to answer this question. As this article argues, however, this distinction is as difficult to apply in practice as it may be sensible in theory. Limitations in input legitimacy, which covers the inclusiveness and fairness of policy goal definition, cannot be compensated by higher output legitimacy, for example through supranational or global institutions. Whether such institutions are appropriate venues for producing policy hinges on the specific goals that they are charged to realize. And if these goals do not emerge from a deliberation process that can itself be considered legitimate, such institutions will do little to make policy outcomes more legitimate per se. After all, a supranational body might excel in the pursuit of one particular policy goal, but be wholly unsuitable to another. In short, this article argues that rather than seeking legitimacy of financial governance in the institutions through which it is made, we should focus on the desirability of specific policy outcomes and distribution of their costs and benefits when deciding how and by whom policy should be made. This argument is demonstrated using the case of capital market policy in the European Union, a case for which this article exposes serious legitimacy deficits, largely owing to an excessive influence of the financial industry compared to other societal stakeholders.","Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, NL-1012 DL Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Mügge, D (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Oudezijds Achterburgwal 237, NL-1012 DL Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,"Mugge, Daniel/0000-0001-9408-7597",,,,,93,35,35,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It is important to be able to distinguish these cultivars from other similar cultivars and identify the various subgroups within the AAB and AA genome groups, and possibly come up with some recommendations for future economical considerations. Objectives of this study were: 1) to identify morphological characters that distinguish a) the various subgroups of AAB dessert bananas found in East Africa, and b) the Muraru from other cultivated AA bananas; 2) to evaluate the relationship among the AAB and among the AA Muraru dessert banana groups of East Africa in relation to other bananas. Forty-three (43) cultivars of AAB, AA groups and outgroups from a large banana collection at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, Kisii were characterised in 2007 using morphological traits. Morphological data were collected using 84 characters derived from a modified version of the descriptors for bananas developed by Bioversity International in conjunction with CIRAD. Techniques of multivariate analysis were employed. Based on unweighted pair group using arithmetic mean (UPGMA), two major clusters of Musa acuminata-derived cultivars (AAs and AAAs) and hybrids of Musa balbisiana and M. acuminata (AAB) were produced. Within the major clusters were subclusters conforming to various subgroups. Within the AAB dessert cluster, four distinct subclusters were formed, i.e. Sukari Ndizi, Prata, Mysore and Silk. Muraru also formed a well-defined cluster. Thirty-three (33) characters contributed 71% of the total variation within the 43 accessions on the first and second principal components, allowing separation of clusters corresponding to genome groups and subgroups. The analysis further revealed that morphological traits, particularly of male bud, fruit and sucker, can be used to make distinctions within genome groups and subgroups, and to isolate various subgroups within genome groups. Morphological traits can be used confidently to describe various banana subgroups.","[Onyango, M.] Kenya Agr Res Inst KARI Kisii, Kisii, Kenya",,"Onyango, M (通讯作者)，Kenya Agr Res Inst KARI Kisii, POB 523, Kisii, Kenya.",,,,,,,,17,7,8,0,0,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,95.0,105,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200009,0

The results showed that 73 accessions should be classified in the AA/AAA and AAA genomic groups, two accessions in the BB genomic group, 21 accessions in the AAB genomic group and 20 accessions in the ABB genomic group. Ninety-nine out of the 116 accessions were unique genotypes while the rest were synonyms.

All banana accessions belonging to the BB, ABB and AAB genomic groups clustered in the first main cluster, together with the majority of the accessions containing the pure A genome. The second main cluster was formed of 11 accessions of AA/AAA and AAA genome. Within the first main cluster, the accessions containing the B genome were clustered according to their genomic group, except four AAB accessions clustering with accessions containing the A genome alone.

This work aimed to establish a screening method for FW resistance under greenhouse conditions and validate its reliability by challenging cultivars with different levels of FW resistance. Two types of substrates (vermiculite and washed river sand) and three inoculum sources (conidial suspension from 1-week-old colonies grown in Potato-Dextrose-Agar-PDA, conidial suspension produced after stress of 1-week-old colonies and Foc-colonised corn meal-sand (CMS) medium) were studied by inoculating 45-day-old plantlets of 'Silk' (AAB, susceptible) in a double-tray system. Symptoms were observed in plants grown in both substrates, but highest incidence occurred in washed river sand. Low infection rates were observed using conidial suspension from PDA-grown colonies. By contrast, inocula from stressed colonies and CMS caused consistent symptom expression. Using washed river sand as substrate and inoculum from PDA-grown stressed colonies and/or Foc-colonised CMS, plantlets of the cultivars 'Tropical' (AAAB) and 'Thap Maeo' (AAB) (field intermediary resistance) were challenged. Plantlets of 'Silk' and 'Grande Naine' (AAA) were used as susceptible and resistant controls, respectively. While the incubation period in 'Silk' was 13 days after inoculation (dai), initial symptoms were only observed at 17 dai in 'Tropical' and 'Thap Maeo'. No symptoms were observed in 'Grande Naine'. The disease progress evaluated based on external symptoms and rhizome discolouration scales allowed discriminating cultivars according to resistance levels. Since experiments were repeated three times with similar results, our research suggests that the method here described could be suitable for early detection of banana genotypes resistant to Fusarium wilt.","[Ribeiro, L.

The policy advice from the international good governance regime, which is based on the principal-agent theory, is geared towards incremental change that will set in motion a virtues circle. It is argued that this theory and the following incremental policy approach is dysfunctional for curbing corruption. It is unlikely that small institutional devices can set in motion a process towards establishing good governance in countries were corruption is systemic. Based on an understanding of corruption as an instance of the theory of collective action, it is argued that what is needed to establish a new equilibrium of social and economic exchange is a big-bang type of change. Incremental policies that are based on the principal-agent theory are likely to end in a social trap situation worsening the problem. The argument is illustrated by an historical case-study of how corruption was eradicated in 19th century Sweden.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Rothstein, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,,,,,,76,141,161,6,70,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We apply a game-theoretic Cournot model to the German power market and analyze different counterfactual and realistic cases of pumped hydro storage. Our rnain finding is that both storage utilization and storage-related welfare effects depend on storage ownership and the operator's involvement in conventional generation. Strategic operators generally under-utilize owned storage capacity. Strategic storage operation may also lead to welfare losses, in particular if the total storage capacity is controlled by an oligopolistic generator that also owns conventional generation capacity.

It tests the feasibility of using a passive travel data collection methodology in a complex urban environment, by developing GIS algorithms to automatically detect travel modes and trip purposes. The study was conducted in New York City where the multi-dimensional challenges include urban canyon effects, an extreme dense and diverse set of land use patterns, and a complex transit network. Our study uses a multi-modal transportation network, a set of rules to achieve both complexity and flexibility for travel mode detection, and develops procedures and models for trip end clustering and trip purpose prediction. The study results are promising, reporting success rates ranging from 60% to 95%, suggesting that in the future, conventional self-reported travel surveys may be supplemented, or even replaced, by passive data collection methods.

Many voiced frustration with their employment prospects in terms of mobility and promotion, which were limited given the perceived lack of quality jobs at managerial level in the external labour market.

We employ a cointegration methodology, invariant to pair-wise correlational instability plaguing MPT approaches, to investigate regional and country property market diversification benefits for U.S. domiciled global real estate investors. We show, theoretically and empirically, the cointegration procedure aptly identifies markets integrated by common trends that mitigate diversification potential. We show global property markets are interregionally independent but find intraregional market cointegration. A portfolio of markets independent of cointegrating relationships performs best during the period but is insufficiently diversified relative to a cointegrated portfolio. Independent country markets do account for the bulk of global property diversification gains but cointegrated markets, particularly from the North American and Asia Pacific regions, retain some diversifying qualities. We also show cointegrated markets converge toward benchmark characteristics, reducing their attraction as portfolio candidates.","[Gallo, John G.] Univ Iowa, Dept Finance, Tippie Coll Business, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Zhang, Ying] Monmouth Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Real Estate, W Long Branch, NJ 07764 USA",University of Iowa; Monmouth University,"Gallo, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Finance, Tippie Coll Business, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",john-gallo@uiowa.edu; yzhang@monmouth.edu,,,,,,,95,16,21,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Yet lingering concern about the subjectivity of life writing prevents wider use of autobiographies within business history. This article seeks to allay such concern by applying the narratological method to the colonial entrepreneur Jules Joubert's autobiography, Shavings and Scrapes. Joubert's narrative identity is as an 'adventurer'. This identity shored up his self-image and was used by him to enhance his reputation. Narratology shows that an autobiography can stabilise and publicise the colonial entrepreneur's narrative identity, thereby benefiting their business career.","Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Reveley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",,"Reveley, James/AFU-8622-2022",,,,,,71,14,16,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

The inclusion not only of aggregate trade variables but also of variables covering trade with different partner countries/regions helps analyzing more deeply the trade channel, e.g. the role of direct trade versus trade with third countries. Another focus lies on the transmission of US shocks to specific industries such as the car and the machinery industries which were particularly severely affected by the global financial crisis.

First, as in roommate problems, any two agents can be matched and second, as in two-sided assignment problems, the division of payoffs to agents is flexible as part of the solution. We take a similar approach to one-sided assignment problems as Sasaki (Int J Game Theory 24:373-397, 1995) for two-sided assignment problems, and we analyze various desirable properties of solutions including consistency and weak pairwise-monotonicity. We show that for the class of solvable one-sided assignment problems (i.e., the subset of one-sided assignment problems with a non-empty core), if a subsolution of the core satisfies [Pareto indifference and consistency] or [invariance with respect to unmatching dummy pairs, continuity, and consistency], then it coincides with the core (Theorems 1 and 2). However, we also prove that on the class of all one-sided assignment problems (solvable or not), no solution satisfies consistency and coincides with the core whenever the core is non-empty (Theorem 4). Finally, we comment on the difficulty in obtaining further positive results for the class of solvable one-sided assignment problems in line with Sasaki's (1995) characterizations of the core for two-sided assignment problems.","[Klaus, Bettina] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Nichifor, Alexandru] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",University of Lausanne; Maastricht University,"Klaus, B (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, Internef 538, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",bettina.klaus@unil.ch; a.nichifor@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Klaus, Bettina E/H-8223-2012","Klaus, Bettina/0000-0001-9140-4729",,,,,10,7,7,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2010,35.0,3,,,,,415.0,433,,10.1007/s00355-010-0447-8,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,637MI,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280821700004,0

The findings, however, differ by gender: the IV estimates on spending are statistically significant only for male literacy.

We suppose a two stage game, in which in the first stage each country decides whether or not to join the agreement while, in the second stage, the quantity of pollution abatement is chosen. Agents may act cooperatively, building coalitions and acting according to the interest of the coalition, or they make their choices taking care of their individual interest only. We consider two kinds of countries: the first type are industrially advanced, namely developed countries, while the second type are the less developed, namely developing countries. About environmental preservation, the developed countries are characterized by a higher measure of the environmental awareness than developing ones. We provide a new graphic way to visualise results about stable coalitions of different sizes taking into account several environmental awareness values. Moreover, we present a handy Maple algorithm to determine both the optimal costs for each country and the coalitions' stability with an arbitrary number of developed and developing countries.

In contrast to previous approaches to forecast comparison, which are based on measures of global performance, we focus on the entire time path of the models' relative performance, which may contain useful information that is lost when looking for the model that forecasts best on average.

We propose a semiparametric strategy for the consumer demand problem in which expenditure share equations are estimated nonparametrically in the real expenditure direction and estimated parametrically (with fixed or varying coefficients) in price directions. In Our model, Engel curves are unrestricted: demands may have any rank. Because the demand model is derived from a cost function, it may be restricted to satisfy integrability and used for consumer surplus calculations. Since real expenditure is unobserved, but rather estimated under the model, we face a semi parametric model with a nonparametrically generated regressor. We show efficient convergence rates for parametric and nonparametric components. We illustrate the feasibility Of Our proposed strategy using Canadian expenditure and price data: Engel curves display Curvature which cannot be encompassed by standard parametric models. We also find that the rationality restriction Of Slutsky symmetry is rejected in the fixed-coefficients model, but not in the varying-coefficients model.

This retains the normative assumptions of expected utility and Pareto-efficiency, and relates fairness to individual preferences. It makes utilitarianism unfalsifiable, however, if agents' all-inclusive utilities are not explicitly specified. This note proposes a two-stage model to make utilitarian welfare analysis falsifiable by specifying all-inclusive utilities explicitly through models of individual fairness preferences.

Our approach builds directly on recently developed realized variation measures and non-parametric jump detection statistics constructed from high-frequency intra-day data. A sequence of simple-to-implement moment-based tests involving various transformations of the daily returns speak directly to the importance of different distributional features, and may serve as useful diagnostic tools in the specification of empirically more realistic continuous-time asset pricing models. On applying the tests to the 30 individual stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index, we find that it is important to allow for both time-varying diffusive volatility, jumps, and leverage effects to satisfactorily describe the daily stock price dynamics.

Research on the Europeanization of public policies has so far mostly been limited to qualitative analysis. While such case studies, or comparative case or country studies have produced valuable insights into the nature of Europeanization, the challenge to measure how much national policy-making has been influenced by European law and policies has not yet been mastered by the discipline. After outlining both the scholarly and the political context of the debate, the article briefly discusses different methods that have been developed so far to measure the Europeanization of national legislation in the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark, France and Germany. Their common feature is that they aim to measure Europeanization - and that they do so by using diverse methods and measures. Not only do they display some flaws in how they measure the Europeanization of legislation, but the results of these diverse studies are by no means comparable. Based on a short discussion of these approaches that have been developed so far, I will outline how this challenge could be faced. I will then present a concept for the development of an analytical tool to measure the scope and extent of the Europeanization of national public policies across policy fields, time and countries, as a means of improving our knowledge and as a starting point for explaining variance across policy fields, across time and, most interesting, across countries. Finally more and less fundamental objections to this enterprise are discussed.","Fernuniv, Chair Publ Policy, D-58084 Hagen, Germany",Fern University Hagen,"Töller, AE (通讯作者)，Fernuniv, Chair Publ Policy, Univ Str 41, D-58084 Hagen, Germany.",annette.toeller@fernuni-hagen.de,,,,,,,74,55,59,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Indigenous populations all over the world, whose lifestyle is changing rapidly and drastically, seem to be particularly prone to show an increased prevalence of overweight and its co-morbidities among adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between socioeconomic and nutritional statuses in adults of two indigenous populations of the Argentine Gran Chaco: the Toba and Wichi of the province of Formosa. Originally hunter-gatherers, they are now more settled and engage in temporary wage labor and local political positions. A total of 541 adults (>20 years old) participated in the study. Almost 50% of the adult Toba and 34% of the adult Wichi were overweight and 10% of adults in both populations were obese. Socioeconomic status was positively associated with body mass index in both populations. Furthermore, political connectedness with the non-indigenous sector, as in the case of community leaders, was highly correlated with obesity. Differences within and between groups can be explained by biocultural factors that include gender, diet (foraged vs store-bought), lifestyle (sedentary vs more active), and history of political power. Our study highlights the interactions among social, cultural, and political economic variables, such as political hierarchies within the group or degree of social connectedness with community leaders. By making these variables an integral part of our analysis and interpretation, we hope to improve our understanding of the situation of indigenous populations in transition. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To date, however, little attention has been paid to the experience of uncertainty in the preoperational phase (i.e., during the development process). When the development process in a given municipality is rife with ambiguity or unpredictability, it may deter firms from moving there, even if the location is attractive on the basis of its long-term operating economics. This study draws on in-depth interviews to explore how real estate professionals experience uncertainty while navigating the development process.

If so, three types of people can exist, and the two types having multiplicative representations of joint receipt have, in contrast to most utility theories, absolute scales of utility. This makes possible, at least in principle, meaningful interpersonal comparisons of utility with desirable properties, thus resolving a long standing philosophical problem and having potentially important implications in economics. Two behavioral criteria are given for the three classes of people.

This framework is applied to the analysis of panel data on 58 countries over a period of 31 years from 1970 to 2000.

The paper implements models with a linear trend, models making use of the price decomposition of Dargay and Gately (1995a) and the Structural Time Series Models (STSMs) of Harvey (1989). Stochastic trends have been found to be rather important while in neither of the sectors assessed in this study could the hypothesis of symmetric price effects be rejected. Following Hunt and Judge (2005), stochastic trend and asymmetric price effects are found to be substitutes in the industrial sector In particular we conclude that asymmetric price effects can substitute for the slope in the stochastic trend.

Huskisson argued that the suspension of convertibility made it possible to extend issues of paper currency beyond its proper limits. Such an expansion, being in the interest of all parties concerned, would actually take place and stimulate excessive speculations, which would eventually prove unsustainable and bring generalized ruin and distress. Although some elements of these explanations were not new (having been anticipated by writers such as James Currie in 1793, William Roscoe in 1793, William Anderson in 1797 and some anonymous writers in 1793 to 1796), Huskisson's explanation is more systematic and better organized, and his emphasis on the endogenous character of the crisis and on the instability of the dynamics of trade and credit makes it an interesting foreshadower of the theories of crises that were advanced half a century later.",,,"Besomi, D (通讯作者)，Cp 7, CH-6950 Gola Di Lago, Switzerland.",dbesomi@bluewin.ch,,,,,,,112,5,5,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

At quarterly frequency, we find that, first, both home prices and trading volume are affected by conditions in labor markets, the mortgage market, and the stock market, and the effects differ between markets with low and high supply elasticity. Second, home prices Granger cause trading volume, but the effects are asymmetric-decreases in prices reduce trading volume, and increases in prices have no effect. Third, trading volume also Granger causes home prices, but only in markets with inelastic supply. Finally, we find a statistically significant positive price-volume correlation; which, however, is mainly explained by co-movements of prices and volume caused by exogenous shocks, instead of the Granger causality between prices and volume.","[Peng, Liang] Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Clayton, Jim] Pens Real Estate Assoc, Hartford, CT 06103 USA; [Miller, Norman] Univ San Diego, Sch Business Adm, San Diego, CA 92110 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of San Diego,"Peng, L (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, 419 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",liang.peng@colorado.edu,,,,,,,29,71,77,2,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The aim of this paper is to analyse and restate some hitherto neglected discussions and to discover some bold ideas that could form the hallmarks of a French approach to the question. The enquiry starts at the turn of the century with the seminal work of J.-B. Say and writings by A.L.C. Destutt de Tracy, who both shaped the liberal reflection on public economics during this period. But the works of these authors suffered from important ambiguities. It is shown how subsequent liberal economists-Ch. Dunoyer, V. de Broglie, G. de Molinari, E. de Girardin, P. Leroy-Beaulieu-tried to deal with some of the unresolved questions and, mainly on the basis of Say's work, developed original approaches focusing on the productivity of public spending, the role of the State as a factor of production, utopian views of the State as a private company, and finally the inexorable political and administrative logic of the modern electoral State.","Univ Pantheon Assas, ERMES, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Faccarello, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pantheon Assas, ERMES, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",gilbert.faccarello@u-paris2.fr,,,,,,,70,7,8,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Besides, the systemic GERD-GDP scaling factor indicates that the GERD of Western region is growing far slower than its GDP as compared with Eastern and Central regions. This observation has policy implications suggesting that further improvements need to be made to the Western region infrastructure and funding for research.","[Gao Xia] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Hohhot, Peoples R China",Inner Mongolia University,,,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,2,DONGHUA UNIV PRESS,SHANGHAI,"1882 YAN AN WEST RD, SHANGHAI, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-81111-752-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,26.0,29,,,,,,4,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BVE75,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291325600006,0

Causes of technological change, and its impact on the size of firms were discussed by Marshall in Book II (especially chapters II and III), while the matter is also treated in the context of changes in business organisation (Book II, chapters X-XII).

To understand this ostensibly sudden change in Moldova's allegiance to Europe, it is argued that analysis needs to go beyond conventional governance framework(s).

It explores the influence on industrial performance of a number of once-only non-repetitive factors of market development that were typical of the transition period and compares them with longer term aspects of the market economy. The case that we discuss here is the development of the market for products of the Hungarian printing industry since the late 1980s. During the transition phase, privatisation, deregulation, the abolition of administrative distribution, and radical cuts in subsidies were all among the factors affecting this industry. Its supply chains also changed radically. However, these lost their importance after the transition had been completed and the long term processes of technical development and consumer behaviour became the main determinants of the behaviour of the printing companies.","Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Laki, M (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary.",laki@econ.core.hu,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2010,62.0,6,,,,,933.0,957,PII 924269296,10.1080/09668136.2010.489262,0.0,,,25,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,624SH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279840500003,0

Finally, a more appropriate Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model is established which provides a reference tool for the short-term prediction of fisheries GDP of Liaoning Province.

In doing so, it employs state-of-the-art techniques in microeconometrics, particularly the locally flexible normalized quadratic functional form, and provides evidence consistent with neoclassical microeconomic theory The results indicate that the interfuel substitution elasticities are consistently below unity, revealing the limited ability to substitute between major energy commodities (i.e., coal, oil, gas, and electricity). We find that on average, industrial and residential sectors tend to exhibit higher potential for substitution between energy inputs as compared to the electricity generation and transportation sectors in all countries, with the United States being the only exception. In addition, we find that developed countries demonstrate higher potential for interfuel substitution in their industrial and transportation sectors as compared to the developing economies. The implication is that interfuel substitution depends on the structure of the economy, not the level of economic development.

The main education system in the world is academic universities, similar institutions of high education and the specialized higher technical college or polytechnic institute. Nearly every fourth new student enrolls today at a polytechnic institute. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss and study the education idea and education model for those institutes and students. Through the statistics of the Chinese tech-hours, this article considers that the Chinese students in polytechnic institute have too less tech-hours for practice to train technical skills. And meantime, the student numbers and laboratory numbers have not reached a common ratio. To solve the above problems, one of the effective methods is to use the resources of society, including offices, enterprises and factories etc. According to the analysis of the studying record, this article puts forward a proposal that the report card should be reformed. Especially, the practical report list should include more details instead of today only one number. Finally, this article gives some suggestions and conclusions.","[Tian Sijin] Shanghai Inst Technol, Sch Urban Construct & Safety Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,6,2,2,0,0,DONGHUA UNIV PRESS,SHANGHAI,"1882 YAN AN WEST RD, SHANGHAI, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-81111-752-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,169.0,171,,,,,,3,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BVE75,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291325600037,0

As can be seen from the impulse response results, the impact on the environment from export in Guangdong Province is relatively larger. However, the growth in exports in Zhejiang Province has no significant effect on the environment, and changes little in the long term. The results show that environment pollution is more sensitive to export under export-oriented mode, but in the endogenous-type mode, this relationship is relatively weak. In terms of Zhejiang, environmental pollution mainly comes from small and medium private enterprises and other non-export industries, has less influence by the export. Therefore, Guangdong should make efforts to prevent the transfer of environmental costs, and Zhejiang is required further efforts to increase environmental protection.","[Yang Yuqiong; Yu Haishan] Ningbo Univ, Fac Business, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Ningbo University,,musicyyq5252@yahoo.com.cn,"liu, xinyu/IWD-6630-2023",,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-14-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,849.0,856,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE32,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298225400133,0

Looking at the per capita GDP of the provinces from 1952 to 2008, we find there is no evidence showing that income convergence. Not only agent of production accumulation but also total factor productivity is the key reason of increasing income gap. At the meantime, the rapid economic growth of China's provincial economies over the reform period is at the price of the increasing interprovincial income inequality, which results from the different productivity growth across the provinces. We suggested that building an integrated market economy in order to facilitate interregional technology diffusion to improve productivity should be on the top of China's economic reform agenda in the next five-year plan.","[Zhang Jian; Chen Song] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Tongji University,,,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,2,DONGHUA UNIV PRESS,SHANGHAI,"1882 YAN AN WEST RD, SHANGHAI, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-81111-752-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,261.0,265,,,,,,5,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BVE75,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291325600056,0

The challenge is: how to achieve the required food production to meet the growing demand? To feed the increasingly growing population, on the one hand, balanced, broad-based pro-poor growth-oriented programs are generally required to increase food production, agricultural productivity and rural income and, on the other hand, special targeted programs are necessary to alleviate hunger. Success mostly depends on having conducive policies, adequate institutions improved market infrastructure, social safety nets and primarily peace an stability, all on a sustainable basis.

Migrants' remittances have been fore-grounded as a key aspect in this relationship and have increasingly been seen as a potential source of 'development capital'. Yet the fact that migration and remitting are often entangled in processes of violent conflict and political upheaval is often overlooked. This paper uses the Somali case to raise a set of conceptual issues regarding the dynamics and impact of remittances in conflict-affected settings. The implications of the violent causation of migration, the on-going conditions in the country of origin, and the post-migration situation of refugees are advanced as key ways in which remittance dynamics in conflict situations may differ from those in more peaceful settings.","Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Dev Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Lindley, A (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",al29@soas.ac.uk,"Lindley, Anna/ABH-5183-2020","Lindley, Anna/0000-0003-1133-7381",,,,,52,10,11,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

An understanding of service reliability is necessary to develop strategies that help transit agencies provide better services. However, few studies have been conducted analyzing bus reliability in the metropolis of China. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of service reliability based on bus operational characteristics in Beijing. Three performance parameters, punctuality index based on routes (PIR), deviation index based on stops (DIS), and evenness index based on stops (EIS), are proposed for the evaluation of bus service reliability. Reliability involves routes, stops, punctuality, deviation, and evenness. The relationship among the three parameters is discussed using a numerical example. Subsequently, through a sampling survey of bus lines in Beijing, service reliability at the stop, route, and network levels are estimated. The effects of route length, headway, the distance from the stop to the origin terminal, and the use of exclusive bus lanes are also analyzed.

In this paper we consider the problem of spuriously detecting breaks point in hypothesis of long memory data generating processes. For this purpose, we address the issue of estimating the number of breaks using several techniques, namely, the information criteria, Bai and Perron's sequential selection procedure (Econometrica 66:47-78, 1998), and the automatic procedure of Lavielle (J Financ Econ 2:290-318, 2004). By means of Monte Carlo experiments, we investigate the effect of increasing the long memory parameter on selecting the number of breaks and their locations, and show that the Lavielle's method is the best technique since its frequency of choosing the true number of changes is the highest particularly when the order of integration is close to 0.5. As it seems that inflation rates contains long memory and structural breaks, an application to the U.S. inflation process is presented to illustrate the usefulness of these procedures. The results show that the Lavielle's method (J Financ Econ 2:290-318, 2004) selects only 2 breaks, however, the number of breaks detected by the information criteria and the sequential procedure of Bai and Perron (Econometrica 66:47-78, 1998) are superior or equal to three.","[Belkhouja, Mustapha; Boutahar, Mohamed] Univ Mediterranee, GREQAM, F-13002 Marseille, France",Aix-Marseille Universite,"Belkhouja, M (通讯作者)，Univ Mediterranee, GREQAM, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France.",belkhouja_mustapha@yahoo.fr; boutahar@univmed.fr,,"belkhouja, mustapha/0000-0002-5595-7788",,,,,22,6,6,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

We find that the unemployment and welfare effects of corporate taxes differ considerably among European countries. The magnitude of these effects rises in particular in the broadness of the corporate tax base of a country, and the strength of international spillover effects through foreign direct investment. The effect on unemployment is smaller if the substitution elasticity between labour and capital is large, if international spillover effects operate primarily via multinational profit shifting, and with small labour market imperfections. Although the effect of corporate taxes on unemployment may be smaller than the effect of labour and value-added taxes (e.g. under relatively strong real wage resistance), the welfare costs of corporate taxation are typically larger for most European countries under plausible parameters, especially under strong international spillovers.","[Bettendorf, Leon; de Mooij, Ruud A.] Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, CPB, Netspar, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Bettendorf, L (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, CPB, Netspar, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,26,13,13,2,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2009,32.0,9,,,,,1319.0,1347,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01211.x,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,487YV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269316500004,0

This article seeks to reply to Brook's core concerns and deal with issues of substance about the phenomena Brook and I are both interested in. Mainly this paper considers how we conceptualize emotional labour and work, and how might that fit into labour process analysis? In response to the misgivings of Brook, the discussion will reveal why and how there is a need to develop analytically the idea of emotional labour, that the typology introduced in Emotion Management in the Workplace (Bolton, 2005a) offers a nuanced explanatory framework; and that labour process analysis is its theoretical home.","Univ Strathclyde, Sch Business, Glasgow G4 OQU, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Bolton, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Sch Business, 199 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 OQU, Lanark, Scotland.",sharon.bolton@gsb.strath.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,62,69,1,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

It is argued in this paper that analysing vacation expenditure without distinguishing between its components - the quality, quantity and duration of vacations - can be misleading. The authors develop a theoretical model to analyse the properties of household demand functions for these vacation components. By applying the model to Israeli data, they find that the rise in income and quality-adjusted price are responsible for the increase in the number of vacations and their level of quality. The increase in the wage rate (time cost) is the main impetus behind the observed trend towards short vacations.","[Fleischer, Aliza; Rivlin (Byk), Judith] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Fleischer, A (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, POB 12, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",fleische@agri.huji.ac.il; rivlin@agri.huji.ac.il,"Fleischer, Aliza/J-7900-2016","Fleischer, Aliza/0000-0002-6575-4052",,,,,33,18,19,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This survey analyses customer purchase attitudes, especially towards farm-raised fish through a hierarchical clustering analysis performed on 300 buyers in traditional shops in Milan. The perception of the product seems to be tied to traditional customs. However, it is indicated that contemporary customers have the capacity to understand differences between fish products, consequently allowing for new communication approaches. In particular, wild-caught fish, purchased by hedonic and old customers, can be displayed through new labels stating the product origin, in order to merge sensory and cultural-empathetic consumption together. The fish farmers' challenge is to enhance consumer loyalty to their product, through general communication campaigns related to the farm-raised fishes' intrinsic and environmental properties to fill the gap between producers' and buyers' knowledge.","[Gaviglio, Anna; Demartini, Eugenio] Univ Milan, Dept Agr Agrifood & Environm Econ & Policy, Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Gaviglio, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Agr Agrifood & Environm Econ & Policy, Milan, Italy.",,"Demartini, Eugenio/H-2235-2014; Gaviglio, Anna/K-5325-2016","Demartini, Eugenio/0000-0002-6733-9098; Gaviglio, Anna/0000-0002-0842-0988",,,,,27,17,18,0,19,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2009,8.0,3,,,,,34.0,40,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,512TI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271273100005,0

Our point estimates suggest that a worker with a one standard deviation higher level of permanent ability would have a return to annual potential experience that is 0.61 of a percentage point lower. The analogous point estimate for actual experience is 0.87 of a point lower.

In mapping the co-movement between excess liquidity and inflation and developing a dynamic model, the paper shows that excess liquidity, ignited by dramatic capital inflows, is a significant driver for consumer price inflation in China during the last decade. In addition, the article compares the dynamic paths of inflation and interest rates between China and the United States and reveals marked changes in their differentials over recent years. Associating these findings with the evolving appreciation of the yuan against the dollar, the paper advises a slowdown in the rate of RMB appreciation. Instead of quick appreciation, the paper proposes more flexibility in the RMB exchange rate regime combined with alternative capital control measures to rein-in excess liquidity and curb ongoing inflation in China.","Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Zhang, CS (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,15,17,19,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2009,32.0,7,,,,,998.0,1018,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01191.x,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,468PZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267833300002,0

An Italian experience,NEW MEDIT,,,English,Article,,,,,,farm management; women's work; Rural Development,,"A large body of literature pointed Out the great importance of the role of women in the rural development process to guarantee the commercial farm survival. Indeed, the women's management - in particular for family-run farms - proved to have a notable capacity to seize new opportunities of income and great skills in the management regeneration offered by new links with society and rural areas. At the same time, the women's management often meets opposition with the persistence of cultural factors reflecting a chauvinist approach; such opposition is more likely to occur in a territorial contest characterized by socio-economic marginalization. In this sense, an overriding objective of the European policy for rural development is to support the overcoming of such restrictions, by implementing the female enterprise in rural areas - connected or not to agricultural activities - or by promoting the women's interest within the local network and the formal-informal institutions that preside over governance systems. The goal of this paper is to deepen the dynamics that have characterized the women's management in Italian rural areas, in particular in the region of Lazium, under three different scenarios. First of all, we analyze the evolution of family and structural typologies related to farms consulting the Italian agricultural census data; we investigate the type of relationship existing between family and farm. Secondly, relating to policy use, we examine investments Made by an unbiased sample of regional, women-run farms that benefited from the Rural Development Plan (RDP) by the Lazium Regional Government. Lastly, using survey data collected on farm, we address Our effort to improve Our understanding of the main socio-economic conditioning factors that could affect the women's management performance.","[Adinolfi, Felice] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Morfofisiol Vet & Prod Anim, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Capitanio, Fabian] Univ Naples Federico 2, Dipartimento Econ & Polit Agr, Naples, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Naples Federico II,"Adinolfi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Morfofisiol Vet & Prod Anim, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",,"Capitanio, Fabian/J-2815-2016; Capitanio, Fabian/E-7806-2011","ADINOLFI, FELICE/0000-0002-8181-5492; Capitanio, Fabian/0000-0003-0327-8019",,,,,25,4,4,0,8,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2009,8.0,2,,,,,23.0,30,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,470GF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267962500004,0

To assess the forecasting performance from the March quarter of 2004 to the December quarter of 2006, models are fitted to the growth rates of Hong Kong inbound tourism demand from selected tourism markets (Australia, Japan, the UK and the USA). Composite leading indicators for the single input leading indicator model are constructed from selected national leading and lagged indicators. To avoid false signals in turning points, a method is specified to identify the correct turning points in tourism demand growth rates. The prediction performance of these models is then examined, based on the mean absolute percentage error, directional change error and turning point error.

We analyze two different demand systems: independent samples and consumer panel. Under the first system, there is a different and independent random sample of N consumers in each period and each consumer makes only a single purchase decision. Under the second system, the same N consumers make a purchase decision in each of T periods. Interestingly, there exists an asymptotic link between these two systems, which has important implications for the estimation of these demand models.

Here this assumption is dropped. I show when the probability of breakdown is decreasing in group size and also present sufficient conditions under which the probability of breakdown is increasing in group size. Moreover I show that for large groups this probability is non-negligible in the limit and that the expected number of participants is less than one.

First, to make surveillance more focused, the IMF's assessment should be principles-based; that is, the Fund should assess the overall coherence of exchange rate, monetary, fiscal and financial policies, with a view to analyzing their effects on external stability. Second, the IMF should have a governance structure that increases incentives to support candid, transparent assessments of surveillance. In practice, this entails a different role for the Executive Board: the Board will set out the Fund's strategic framework for surveillance; the Managing Director and the staff will conduct surveillance. These reforms clarify the roles and responsibilities of the IMF and its member countries in the surveillance process. Also, our proposed reforms aim at making surveillance more even-handed and objective. We believe that this principles-based approach can bolster the credibility and legitimacy of surveillance, giving the Fund greater influence on the economic policies of members.","[Lavigne, Robert; Maier, Philipp; Santor, Eric] Bank Canada, Int Dept, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Santor, E (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Int Dept, 234 Wellington Ave, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",esantor@bankofcanada.ca,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The history of the Australian suburb, particularly since 1945, is yet to be written. Oral history and municipal archives will be crucial to the writing of such histories.

It finds that the disincentive effect of Medicaid on household savings is heavily concentrated in the middle net-worth households. In contrast, the effects on the bottom and top net-worth households are quite small and insignificant. These heterogeneous incentive effects are partly explained by Medicaid asset tests. Our findings hold regardless of whether affluence is measured in terms of wealth or income. They suggest that despite generating substantial crowd-out for the mean household, Medicaid expansions are unlikely to discourage the savings of the poorest households.

Considering separate models by gender, we find that overweight females incur $790 more in annual expenditures than those of normal weight but we find no expenditure differences by bodyweight for males.

In these cases, proper simulation of the choice set is crucial for correct simulation of the choice context. In this regard, our paper has two main objectives. The first is to give a general contribution to choice set modelling by extending and applying the concept of dominance among alternatives to the framework of random utility theory. The main result is the definition of a methodology for the generation of new dominance attributes, which can be used in choice set modelling. The second aim is to make a specific contribution to destination choice modelling: dominance attributes are defined from the above methodology and introduced into this choice context, and new spatial variables reproducing better knowledge of zones with a privileged spatial position are also proposed. Methodology and attributes are tested both on synthetic and on real data. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Organized activities have increased and the immediate neighbourhood is not always the most appropriate or desirable area to play in or carry out various leisure activities. This paper presents findings from a nationwide survey in Norway that focus on children's mobility. The results suggesting that a large proportion of children 6-12 years participate in organized leisure activities - sporting pursuits and music being the most popular and car is the main transport mode to these activities. The car share is higher than for school trips. The analysis indicates that children, particularly in these age groups, have parents with at least one car and who use the car for most purposes. Families who live in the larger cities have less access to a car than families living in other places, and this is reflected in the transport mode when children are escorted to leisure activities. Although distance to activities and children's age are important for car-use, parents travel habits also have an impact on mode choice for these purposes. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of marketing period risk are found to disappear in the limit with growth in the size of the portfolio, with ex ante variance approaching ex post variance, but only if the portfolio consists of nonsystematic risk alone, in which case both approach zero. The marketing period risk factor (MPRF), representing the ratio of ex ante to ex post variance, however, does not in general approach zero in the limit, in fact could increase or decrease depending upon the illiquidity characteristics of the individual assets and the magnitude and degree of correlation among individual property returns and marketing periods. The results suggest that even large institutional real estate portfolio managers must consider the illiquidity present in their portfolios and cannot assume that its effect will be diversified away.","[Lin, Zhenguo; Liu, Yingchun] Fannie Mae, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Vandell, Kerry D.] Univ Calif Irvine, Paul Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae); University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Lin, ZG (通讯作者)，Fannie Mae, 3900 Wisconsin Ave, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",len_lin@fanniemae.com; yingchun_liu@fanniemae.com; kvandell@exchange.uci.edu,,,,,,,7,12,14,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Although blacks and whites today in the US reach similar terminal statures, nineteenth century African-American statures were consistently shorter than those of whites. Greater insolation (vitamin D production) is shown to be associated with taller black and white statutes and a considerable share of the stature difference between US blacks and whites was attributable to insolation and vitamin D production. Black statutes increased during the antebellum period, while white statutes declined. Black and white statutes both decreased after the Civil War. Farmers were taller than workers in other occupations, and an alternative explanation for stature variation by social class is considered. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The panel data methods are applied to estimate the modified Phillips curve, which describes the evolution of the inflation. The case of the transition economies is treated separately from developed market economies. In transition economies, there was often problem with high inflation, so the main purpose of the inflation targeting in these countries was to get inflation under control. However, in developed market economies the inflation has been stable in the last 10 years, so the inflation in these economies is modelled slightly differently from the case of transition economies. It is stressed the importance of correct economic interpretation of the results from the regression. In the case of transition economics, it may look like from the first point of view that the inflation targeting strategy is enormously effective way how to get control over the inflation, but more detailed examination shows that it is not true due to the above mentioned differences between the two groups of countries. In the case of developed market economies, the results from the regression are biased to the other side. From the first point of view, it looks like the inflation targeting strategy gives the same results as other monetary regimes. But in the analogy to the first case of the transition economies, it is then shown that the results are more complicated to interpret.","[Cizek, Ondrej] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,cizeko@vse.cz,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,52.0,56,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900009,0

Two specific methods for evaluation of enterprises and subsequent recommendations are discussed: Weighted Slack-Based Measures (WSBM) and Generic Directional Distance Model (GDDM). A common feature of these methods is the possibility to include weights and/or directional vectors in the recommended changes. In addition, both models can be modified to allow for negative outputs that are often seen in practical situations. Another goal of our work is to propose a specific procedure for weight determination in each particular model; this is relevant as the same weight vector might lead to different recommendations - and efficiency scores - in each model. In the applications part, we examine farming enterprises located in the Czech potato-growing region - the largest part of arable land in the Czech Republic. An attractive feature of this choice is the homogeneity of the gain production structure throughout this region.","[Friebel, Ludvik; Friebelova, Jana] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Math & Informat, Bohemia, NY USA",,,friebel@ef.jcu.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,72.0,76,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900013,0

The analysis is guided by recent theoretical models of international trade with firm heterogeneity. The paper finds that while only a small share of euro area firms locate affiliates abroad, these firms account for over-proportionally large shares of output, employment and profits in their home countries. They have higher survival rates and their productivity growth is also higher. The strongest contribution is by productivity growth of existing firms with a multinational status rather than entry into the multinational status. finally, there are performance premia for multinationals with a large number of affiliates abroad relative to those with a small number.","[Goerg, Holger] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Goerg, Holger] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Jabbour, Liza] Univ Nottingham, GEP, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel; University of Nottingham,"Görg, H (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",,,,,,,,3,3,3,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2009,32.0,1,,,,,1.0,5,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01154.x,0.0,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,400XD,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262901800001,0
