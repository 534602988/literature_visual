Based on a Swedish data set, the results show that having a self-employed father, as well as having a self-employed grandfather, has a positive effect on self-employment propensities for male third-generation immigrants. For native Swedes having a self-employed father is of importance for self-employment propensities, while having a self-employed grandfather is not. Evidently, there appears to be a generational link in self-employment across three generations for immigrants, but not for natives. Since immigrants transfer general self-employment abilities, third-generation immigrants with self-employed ancestors are over-represented in self-employment. Many of them, however, are not necessarily in the same business line as their fathers. In contrast, when natives transfer general self-employment abilities, their offspring tend to become self-employed in the same business line as their fathers.","[Andersson, Lina; Hammarstedt, Mats] Vaxjo Univ, Dept Econ, S-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden",Linnaeus University; Vaxjo University,"Andersson, L (通讯作者)，Vaxjo Univ, Dept Econ, S-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden.",lina.andersson@vxu.se,,"Alden, Lina/0000-0002-0702-5564",,,,,23,64,66,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Chandler's description and analysis of the business-related aspects of professionalization. According to Chandler, professional managers, scientists, and engineers made crucial contributions to the expansion of large enterprises in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and these firms, Chandler contended, were the most important drivers of economic growth in America and the other developed economies. While this essay agrees with many aspects of that conclusion, it contends that the social transformation that brought professionals into power in business was more contested, more difficult to organize, and frequently less successful than Chandler indicated. Moreover, that transformation and the development of business capabilities in the 20th century cannot be understood without looking outside of the firm more than Chandler did. It is necessary to analyze the public and non-profit institutions that made professional development possible in the United States and elsewhere. It is also necessary to take note of the shifting public evaluations of the professions-those inside as well as outside of the business sector.","[Galambos, Louis] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Hist, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Galambos, Louis] Johns Hopkins Univ, Inst Appl Econ, Baltimore, MD USA; [Galambos, Louis] Johns Hopkins Univ, Study Business Enterprise, Baltimore, MD USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University,"Galambos, L (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Hist, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",galambos@jhu.edu,,,,,,,71,12,12,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The empirical examination is based on two closely related analyses of eggplant production and consumption sectors of India. At present, the vegetable markets of south India provide the landrace cultivators with a price premium adequate enough to cover the opportunity cost of not opting for high-yielding modern varieties. However, we detect an underutilized consumer demand for landrace products. The wide margin that exists between the price premium farmers currently obtain for the landrace attribute and what consumers are willing to pay for it is indicative of the unexploited potential of labelling and certification schemes as an emerging agrobiodiversity conservation strategy.","[Krishna, Vijesh V.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, New Delhi 110012, India; [Pascual, Unai] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Giannini Fdn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); University of Cambridge; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Krishna, VV (通讯作者)，Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, CG Ctr Block,NASC Complex,DP Shastri Marg, New Delhi 110012, India.",v.krishna@cgiar.org; up211@cam.ac.uk; zilber11@berkeley.edu,"Pacual, Unai/B-6685-2011; Krishna, Vijesh/AAD-3431-2022; Pascual, Unai/O-7946-2019","Pascual, Unai/0000-0002-5696-236X; Krishna, Vijesh/0000-0003-2191-4736",,,,,56,16,16,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The hypothesis was that changing the maximum price level would either give rise to an income effect or have no effect on consumers' preferences. This was tested in the framework of a valuation study of different quality characteristics of minced pork. The data was analysed using a mixed logit error component model, which accounts for correlation in the unobserved part of the utility. Results suggest that the size of the maximum price level does matter, and that changing the maximum price level has a statistically significant effect on both the general preferences structure and the WTP estimates.

Although there are a great many reasons why social dismay might descend into social disorder, only few yardsticks or indices can plausibly be used to gauge the potential for social unrest (PSU). If policy makers want to undertake public action to prevent social dismay escalating into social disruption, they obviously need to draw on practical sensors. This paper assesses critically the adequacy of two such measures, the polarization (P) index, and the total relative deprivation (TRD) index. The paper proposes a tentative guide to selecting between these two measures. A review of three stylized scenarios suggests that, where income redistributions reduce the number of distinct income groups, and when each group is characterized by a strong sense of within-group identity, the P index surpasses the TRD index as a basis for predicting PSU. When the within-group identification is weak, however, it is better to use the TRD index to predict PSU.","[Stark, Oded] Univ Bonn, ZEF, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Stark, Oded; Hyll, Walter; Behrens, Doris A.] Univ Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Stark, Oded] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Stark, Oded] Warsaw Univ, Warsaw, Poland; [Stark, Oded] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Behrens, Doris A.] Vienna Univ Technol, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",University of Bonn; University of Klagenfurt; University of Vienna; University of Warsaw; Warsaw School of Economics; Technische Universitat Wien,"Stark, O (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, ZEF, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",ostark@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,8,3,4,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2010,143.0,1-2,,,,,229,236,,10.1007/s11127-009-9499-7,0.0,,,8,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,574LD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275989800012,0

This paper contributes to this debate by studying the driving forces of fluctuations in an estimated new neoclassical synthesis model of the U.S. economy. In this model, most of the variability of output and hours at business cycle frequencies is due to shocks to the marginal efficiency of investment. Imperfect competition and, to a lesser extent, technological frictions are the key to their transmission. Although labor supply shocks explain a large fraction of the fluctuations in hours at very low frequencies, they are irrelevant over the business cycle. This finding is important because the microfoundations of these disturbances are widely regarded as unappealing. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In our analysis, the international transmission mechanism works through movements in the exchange rate, commodity prices, short-term interest rates and the trade balance. We find that an increase in the federal funds rate causes the euro to immediately depreciate, while commodity, and in particular oil, prices decline sharply, reflecting a decline in demand. Lower commodity prices stimulate household consumption in the short run, and the higher aggregate demand induces an expansion of eurozone economic activity. Our results show that the effects of changes in the federal funds rate on commodity prices are greater than previously found in the literature. Our analysis also assesses the likely effects on the eurozone economy of the European Central Bank's (ECB's) own responses to macroeconomic developments. We find that the expansionary effect of lower commodity prices and a depreciated euro on the eurozone economy is partially offset by the ECB increasing short-term nominal interest rates to curb inflationary pressures in an expanding economy. This result highlights the importance of commodity prices and the euro-dollar exchange rate as inputs into European monetary policy-making, as seen, for example, in the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections used by the Governing Council to assess the risks to price stability.","[Neri, Stefano; Nobili, Andrea] Banca Italia, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Neri, S (通讯作者)，Banca Italia, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",stefano.neri@bancaditalia.it; andrea.nobili@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,33,10,11,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

We examine behavioral and survey measures and conclude that the amount sent in the trust game is a good, albeit partial and overreaching, measure of one facet of trust. Common survey measures of trusting capture well other facets of trusting. The proportion sent back in the trust game represents well trustworthiness in the specific context in which it was developed, an investment situation, but falls short in capturing other facets of trustworthiness. The Machiavellian scale appears to be a weak measure of any facets of trustworthiness. Gender is the primary determinant of investment-related facet of trusting, and personality is a strong determinant of other facets.

We distinguish two different types of households, which represent opposite ends of a spectrum of potential familial structures: 'dynastic households', in which the family sticks together forever and 'micro-households', in which children leave their parent's household immediately after birth. We show that the decision of parents on the number of births involves an externality that is qualitatively different for both types of familial structure. Hence, population policy should be different, according to the type of household. A first best result may be obtained in the case of dynastic households if an appropriate tax on the household size is applied, or, in the case of micro-households, if an appropriate tax on children is applied.","[Joest, Frank] Univ Heidelberg, Dept Econ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Quaas, Martin F.] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Kiel,"Jöst, F (通讯作者)，Univ Heidelberg, Dept Econ, Bergheimer Str 20, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",frank.joest@uni-hd.de; quaas@economics.uni-kiel.de,"Quaas, Martin/C-4220-2012","Quaas, Martin/0000-0003-0812-8829",,,,,27,6,7,0,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Moreover, even if birth order itself has very small effects, the positional concern increases with the number of siblings among those who grew up together with siblings.

When controlling for investment strategies, performance, fund age, size, lockup, high-water mark, and leverage, we find that funds with larger downside risk have a higher hazard rate. However, standard deviation loses the explanatory power once the other explanatory variables are included in the hazard model. Further, we find that liquidation does not necessarily mean failure in the hedge fund industry.

Although the median VSL estimate for workers is $7-$8 million, the VSL varies considerably within the worker population. New estimates of the income elasticity of VSL are 1.0 or above, which are consistent with theoretical models linking VSL to the coefficient of relative risk aversion. The specific relationship between VSL and risk aversion is, however, more complex than previously understood. Age differences in VSL are substantial, with young children being accorded especially high VSL amounts.

This paper examines the cost of failing states in the Pacific. The Pacific region differs from other regions: since its countries are islands the neighbourhood spillovers that normally generate these costs do not apply. The cost of state failure for an island is much lower than for other states, but state failure is more costly to the state itself, as opposed to its neighbours, if the state is an island. This may be due to the greater openness of islands, implying greater flight of financial and human capital. Because neighbours are not directly affected by state failure in the Pacific, any possible interventions should be centred on the humanitarian concern.","[Hoeffler, Anke] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, CSAE, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Chauvet, Lisa] DIAL Paris, Paris, France",University of Oxford,"Hoeffler, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, CSAE, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",anke.hoeffler@economics.ox.ac.uk,"; Chauvet, Lisa/J-8760-2016","Hoeffler, Anke/0000-0002-0684-6096; Chauvet, Lisa/0000-0002-1918-4124",,,,,13,6,7,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

Data are collected from a representative sample of 460 U. S. residents through an on-line experiment on McDonald's chicken breast sandwiches and analyzed with Latent Growth Modeling. This study assesses which content of positive brand information effectively mitigates the risk of negative information shocks on animal welfare. On average, brand information has the same positive impact on consumers' beliefs and attitudes, regardless of whether it is related or unrelated to animal welfare. However, there is strong market segmentation in terms of consumers' response when exposed to brand information, suggesting that brand managers would benefit from tailoring brand information according to consumers' age, education, gender and income.","[Dentoni, Domenico] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Tonsor, Glynn T.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Calantone, Roger] Michigan State Univ, Eli Broad Grad Sch Business, Dept Mkt, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Peterson, H.

We use a transport master plan (the Spanish Plan Estrategico de Infraestructuras y Transporte 2005-2020, PEIT) as a case study for applying our methodology. In order to Calculate and map regional spillovers, economic potential values are computed using network routines in a Geographic Information System (GIS) by comparing two scenarios: firstly. the scenario PEIT 2020; and secondly the scenario which includes the improvements envisaged for the year 2020 in all the regions except the region whose spillover effects are being analyzed. The differences between these two scenarios represent the potential spatial spillover effects of this region on the rest of the regions, This procedure is repeated for each of the Spanish regions in order to calculate a matrix of inter-regional spillovers in economic potential units. In a second step, this matrix is monetized by distributing the costs of the investment in infrastructures envisaged in the region according to the regional distribution of the economic potential benefits. This inter-regional matrix of investments flows characterizes the inner, export, and import values of each of the regional road investments. Subtracting from the direct investment the exports to other regions and adding the imports from other regions, an estimation of the real investment of the plan in each region taking into account all the spillover effects is obtained, This value can be compared with the direct investment in the region. analyzing whether one region has more or less direct investment than real. The proposed methodology makes it transparent which regions benefit more from national transport investment irrespective of where the investment Occurs. The spillover matrix can be a valid instrument, especially in federal states or in the case of transnational projects, in the field of regional economics because it offers very useful information for both planners and policy makers.

Standardizing these components in a program library (or a framework) would allow IMS developers to avoid duplicating standard programs by speeding up code development and ultimately saving costs. In this article we identify and briefly describe each of these components as well as the desirable architecture of such a framework, while considering industry best practices in the field of management information systems development, and keeping an eye on the security and performance of these systems. Currently, the majority of the enterprise-level information management systems are built around databases, using object-oriented designs. This leads to the usage of other design patterns (such as object-relational mapping) with positive impact on the costs and flexibility of the systems developed using these patterns. At enterprise level the client-server architecture is gaining in popularity, as placing the applications on the server optimizes maintenance costs. On the client side, using a web browser becomes increasingly attractive, given the large diversity of platforms on which web browsers are able to run and access remote information. Because information management systems share many features and components, both in terms of programming patterns and program logic, it is desirable to use a framework as a foundation for the development of new systems. Many such frameworks exist, and we attempted to identify the most important features which should be part of an ideal framework. For the parts where no industry standard design patterns exist, we made more detailed recommendations, related to the software architecture (logging, reporting, and partially access management). Thus, the present material can aid in the selection of an existing framework, or serve as the blueprint for the development of a new one. Enterprise applications must have the flexibility to capture and implement complex business logic, differentiating themselves from other software such as embedded systems or desktop productivity suites. Thus, a set of design ideas effective in dealing with enterprise complexity should deliver software quicker. Prototyping and iterative development can also be facilitated by a framework, accelerating the development cycle and testing the software earlier against business requirements. We will further our research by studying possible improvements related to the stakeholders of a programming framework, these are the developers, the clients of the systems based on the framework, and the end-users of these systems. For the developers, visual design and the integration of a larger number of common components has a positive impact on the speed and flexibility of the development cycle. The clients are mostly interested in total cost of ownership and security, and the end users are interested in clear, easy to understand interfaces and system responsiveness. Thus, our research will continue to focus on the integration of these features in a common framework, while being aware of the current trends in both server and client platforms.","[Ionescu, Bogdan; Ionescu, Iuliana; Tinca, Andrei] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,ionescub@gmail.com,"Ionescu, Bogdan-Ștefan/AFC-7959-2022","Ionescu, Bogdan-Ștefan/0000-0003-0021-2938",,,,,24,0,0,0,8,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,389,403,,,,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100025,0

A thorough analysis of the quality of life in the individual regions and identification of the factors causing regional disparities remain the cornerstones in determining suitable instruments for the mitigation of regional disparities. The paper sets out to analyze the disparities in regional economic performance in the Czech Republic by using the multidimensional statistical method of factor analysis. In total 68 indicators were identified for the individual regions of the Czech Republic out of which 11 indicators were chosen for the calculation of the index of development potential by using the factor analysis, such as the number of enterprise-type registered units in agriculture, industry, civil engineering, trade, accommodation, boarding, transport sector, warehousing and communications, per capita gross domestic product in CZK, per capita gross added value in thousands of CZK, per capita gross fixed capital generation in CZK and per capita receipts and expenditures in CZK. The above specified indicators of economic performance in the regions of the Czech Republic were analyzed for the years 2002 - 2007. Factor analysis determined the index of development potential, which allows for expressing and quantifying the existing disparities in economic efficiency of specific regions of the Czech Republic.

A declining interest of the state in political economy reduced an interest in economic thinking which resulted in a considerable decrease of publishing activity. A certain toleration of authorities to the criticism of the officially prescribed Sonnenfels' textbook has enabled the reception of new ideas of the classical school into the education.

In spring 2008, a pot experiment with ten fertilizer treatments (combination of N, P and K application) was established and both Rumex species were seeded Plants in pots were exposed to winter conditions without any protection. During the experiment, the lowest measured temperature -13.2 degrees C was recorded 3rd January 2009. Winter survival over all levels of nutrient availability was 18% and 100% for R. obtusifolius and R. crispus, respectively. No survival of R. obtusifolius was recorded in K treatment and survival was higher than 30% in NP and NPK treatments. In the case of R. crispus, there was no mortality recorded R. obtusifolius flowered in all treatments during the first season while R. crispus start to flower in the second season after over -wintering.

It also examines how the quality of supervisory standards may have mitigated the vulnerabilities arising from these risk factors. Using panel data, the paper finds that (1) credit quality is of general concern especially in circumstances where credit growth is accelerating; (2) although higher provisioning could adversely affect profits and returns volatility, good supervisory policies on provisioning mitigate such adverse effects; and (3) highly liquid banks are not necessarily more stable because they might be pursuing activities with more volatile returns, but a well-functioning payments system helps to lower the adverse impact on stability.

The levels of living are understood to be summary of all the material, cultural, social and moral values available to the population over the given time and space as well as all the conditions necessary for satisfaction of the needs connected and or creating the ways of life. From this viewpoint, the levels of living constitute a multidimensional quantity, containing a very broad system of indicators of both the quantitative and qualitative nature. Assessment of the state of levels of living then presents a comparatively complex task. The official statistics are aimed at quantifying and univariate analysis of some selected components of the levels of living, particularly from the areas of population incomes and consumption. Such an analysis offers very important information on the levels of living but it is only partial information. The levels of living are a socio-economic category in principle which cannot be reduced into the purely economic factors, anyway. Besides those indicators, also some other factors-the subjective opinion of the population concerning their levels of living and the state of the conditions of life -have to be included into the levels of living. The indicators do not function at equal levels, anyway, some of them are fundamental and their effect materializes very strongly, the effect of some others can be weaker, but still very important), of the indicators can function marginally, only. The paper provides information on the use of multivariate statistical methods and on the use of the aggregate indicators.","Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Svatosová, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",svatosova@pef.czu.cz,"Svatosova, Libuše/H-8217-2018",,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,365,371,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600041,0

Our results show that accounting for bubbles is important in whether changes in earnings can predict future stock returns. In periods of no bubble, we find that changes in earnings Granger-cause future returns, whereas in periods of bubble, this Granger causality from changes in earnings to future returns cannot be found.

To address the impact of these and other stressors it is necessary to develop a deeper understanding of concepts such as 'vulnerability' and 'food insecurity'. This is challenging as both concepts are used rather loosely in the food security literature, despite both having at least two dimensions. Vulnerability has an external and internal dimension, and food insecurity has a temporal and intensity dimension. However, assessments are often only concerned with one dimension at a time. An exploration of the two concepts suggests that in both cases the dimensions need to be combined in order to understand the different interactions and the interconnections between different dimensions and the multiple levels of the systems in which they are embedded. This combination of dimensions is important for understanding the significant role that livelihoods play in the accumulation of assets and for accessing food. It makes the understanding of the multiple causes and consequences of vulnerability and food insecurity for different households clearer. Those households and individuals considered chronically poor or food-insecure are likely to experience severe food insecurity in the long-term, as a result of their weak livelihoods and minimal assets. Consequently, future studies on vulnerability to food insecurity should focus on these chronically food insecure households in order to determine the multidimensional nature of the stressors they experience and their ability to cope and adapt to these stressors. This would contribute to our understanding of the contexts in which the data from larger quantitative studies are embedded.","[Hart, T. G.

The methodology yields estimates of the degree of tax capitalization, rather than an implied tax rate. This makes it straightforward to identify the marginal investor and test for changes in tax capitalization. The empirical approach also makes it unnecessary to jointly estimate the degree of tax capitalization and the entire yield curve. Corporate taxes are found to have been fully capitalized in pre-tax Government of Canada bond yields during the period 1986-1993. Since 1994, taxes have not been capitalized in yields. These results are consistent with the existence of a marginal investor, but the identity of the marginal investor changed from a financial sector firm to a non-taxed entity in the early 1990s.

Net internal migration was predominantly determined by regional housing supply, and not by employment growth. Growth of the regional housing stock appeared insensitive to changes in the number of people and jobs.

The paper calibrates the model to two regions-the Caribbean and the Sahel region in sub-Saharan Africa-and assesses the sensitivity of the results.

We consider a setting in which the investor faces moral hazard with respect to the effort and risk choices of the portfolio manager. The employment contract promises the manager: (i) a fixed payment, (ii) a proportional asset-based fee, (iii) a benchmark-linked fulcrum fee, and (iv) a benchmark-linked option-type bonus incentive fee. We show that the option-type incentive helps overcome the effort-underinvestment problem that undermines linear contracts. More generally, we find that for the set of contracts we consider, with the appropriate choice of benchmark it is always optimal to include a bonus incentive fee in the contract. We derive the conditions that such a benchmark must satisfy. Our results suggest that current regulatory restrictions on asymmetric performance-based fees in mutual fund advisory contracts may be costly. (JEL G11, G12, D82, D86)","[Li, C.

Most methods implemented in monthly data also lack power to detect abnormal returns. We also consider unique issues arising when using the newly available daily bond data, and formulate and test methods to calculate daily abnormal bond returns. Using daily bond data significantly increases the power of the tests, relative to the monthly data. Weighting individual trades by size while eliminating noninstitutional trades from the TRACE data also increases the power of the tests to detect abnormal performance, relative to using all trades or the last price of the day. Further, value-weighted portfolio-matching approaches are better specified and more powerful than equal-weighted approaches.

Furthermore, we examine the relationship between volatility and volume using different volatility measures and controlling for the effects of autocorrelation and trading costs. We find that small trades increase significantly after stock splits and the increase in return volatility is strongly related to the increase in small trades after stock splits.

At the high confidence levels at which bank loan portfolio and collateralized debt obligation (CDO) default losses are typically measured for economic capital and rating purposes, conventionally based loss estimates are downward biased by a full order of magnitude on test portfolios. Our estimates are based on U. S. public nonfinancial firms between 1979 and 2004.

This evidence suggests that labor markets, collaborative research, and contract research were the principal mechanisms by which early university science contributed to the development of in-house research capabilities in the emerging US pharmaceutical industry. This article further demonstrates a pattern in which firms with lesser R&D capabilities were generally constrained to work with local partners, while firms with greater internal R&D capabilities primarily engaged local partners for smaller-scale projects requiring generalist skills and distant partners for larger-scale efforts and extraordinary projects. We conclude by examining the implications of collaboration for those firms that did engage university academic partners. Our findings suggest that pharmaceutical firms that collaborated with universities during this period achieved higher rates of patenting and laboratory growth.","[Furman, Jeffrey L.] Boston Univ, Sch Management, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Furman, JL (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Sch Management, 595 Commonwealth Ave,653A, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",furman@bu.edu; mmacgarv@bu.edu,"Furman, Jeffrey L/A-9771-2008","Furman, Jeffrey L/0000-0002-6273-8380",,,,,77,32,39,0,54,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The ambiguity premium can be large even in the simplest log-utility setting and is also nonzero for stochastic factors that have a zero risk premium. A calibrated low-dimensional two-factor model with ambiguity is able to reproduce the deviations from the expectations hypothesis documented in the literature, without modifying in a substantial way the nonlinear mean-reversion dynamics of the short interest rate.

We use information on almost 6,000 German SMEs from a company survey. Using the intensity of banking competition at the district level as an instrument to control for endogeneity, we find that a higher equity ratio is conducive to a higher R&D intensity. Owners may only start R&D activities if they have the financial resources to sustain them until successful completion. We find a larger influence of the equity ratio for young companies. Equity may be more important for young companies which have to rely on the original equity investment of their owners since they have not yet accumulated retained earnings and can rely less on bank financing.","[Mueller, Elisabeth] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Zimmermann, Volker] KfW Bankengruppe, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Müller, E (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",mueller@zew.de; volker.zimmermann@kfw.de,,,,,,,70,82,91,2,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

However, evidence shows that consumers perceive price and quality as positively related even when they are weakly correlated in the real markets. This paper explores whether this perceived relationship can be cognitively de-coupled by providing explicit reasons why low price and high quality may be compatible. The participants were asked to rate existing stores and fictitious stores in a two-dimensional price-quality space. When the participants were given plausible reasons why the seemingly high quality fictitious stores could have lower than average prices, their judgement of the price-quality relationship was significantly less correlated than when these stores were judged without such reasons. Therefore, the demonstrated phenomenon of reason-based judgments can be used to attenuate the typical price-quality overestimation, or heuristic, which has important implications for decision making research and marketing practice.

This study serves as an important guide for those who aim to increase employee performance and decrease turnover intent in an important sector for Turkey. Multiple regression analyses suggest that power distance, internal uncertainty avoidance, external uncertainty avoidance and individualism-collectivism have significant effects on perceived organizational support.

A comprehensive approach to food security should focus on exploiting opportunities around increasing local food availability through production, as well as stimulating food accessibility by, for example, supporting small enterprises through micro-credit, and supporting food utilisation through education. In this way a range of options is created that vulnerable people can adopt to promote their livelihoods beyond survivalist strategies. This paper explores the issue of agricultural production within Greater Sekhukhune to provide insights into the challenges facing a comprehensive food security strategy that would guarantee food supply through a range of interventions. The study in the Greater Sekhukhune District in Limpopo Province was conducted through two sets of household surveys (2004 and 2006) and the responses to the agricultural production part of these surveys are discussed. Marked changes from 2004 to 2006 were observed. For agrarian reform to be a success, the necessary institutional framework needs to be in place to enable a broad range of services from government and non-governmental actors.

A contract with a parametric or index trigger (such as a catastrophe bond) is insensitive to information asymmetry and therefore alters the equilibrium in the reinsurance market. Provided that basis risk is not too high, the introduction of contracts with parametric or index triggers provides low-risk insurers with an alternative to reinsurance contracts, and therefore leads to less cross-subsidization in the reinsurance market.","[Finken, Silke] DZ Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Laux, Christian] Univ Frankfurt, CFS & ECGI, D-6000 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Finken, S (通讯作者)，DZ Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",silke@finken.eu; laux@finance.uni-frankfurt.de,,"Laux, Christian/0000-0003-2580-7313",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [W 1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),,,29,39,41,2,28,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

The puzzling divergence of aggregate rents and user costs, 1980-2004. The Review of Income and Wealth 54(4), 671-699] demonstrated that housing rents and ex ante user costs diverge markedly for extended periods of time, a finding with profound implications for income and inflation measurement. But the primary data sources in that study were various indexes, based upon largely disjoint data sources, constructed using different aggregation techniques, and each subject to various criticisms. This raised doubts about the quality of the comparison. The relationship between user costs and rents might we] I be much tighter at the micro level; after all, house prices and rents (and their growth rates) can vary dramatically within cities, and rents are notoriously sticky. Furthermore, the use of indexes precludes both cross-sectional and dollar cost comparisons. In this study, we use Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey (CE) data to examine the relationship between user costs and rents at tire individual unit-level, in dollars, using unit-level information on house value, rent, taxes, and the like. This allows us to accurately estimate unit-specific user costs and to control for unobservables like structure and neighborhood quality. We also make the point that in theory, after-tax user costs should equal net rent, i.e., expected rental income, rather than gross rent. Our findings are striking. In keeping with most previous research, we find tremendous divergence between conventional measures of user costs and net rents, thus ruling out index construction errors as a possible explanation. This divergence does not result from a faulty rent measure: we find that reported rents are sensible, in that they move similarly to official rent indexes, and are not simply out-of-pocket expenses. Instead, and most perplexing, we find a surprisingly close correspondence between net rents and a particular estimate of user costs, one implicitly assuming zero transactions costs and constructed using an appreciation measure that is both theoretically suspect and empirically a poor predictor of actual appreciation.

We argue that the choice of the bidder is influenced by the fact that the merge with a firm that belongs to an investment style more popular with the market may boost the bidder's value. By using data on the flows in mutual funds, we construct a measure of popularity, which relies directly on the identification of sentiment-induced investor demand, rather than being a direct transformation of stock market data. We show that differences in popularity between bidder and target help to explain their pairing. The merger with a more popular target generates a halo effect from the target to the bidder that induces the market to evaluate the assets of the less popular bidder at the (inflated) market value of the more popular target. Both bidder and target premiums are positively related to the difference in popularity between the target and the bidder. However, the target's ability to appropriate the gain is reduced by the fact that its bargaining position is weaker when the bidder's potential for asset appreciation is higher. We document a better short- and medium-term performance of less popular firm staking over more popular firms. The bidder managers engaging in these cosmetic mergers take advantage of the window of opportunity induced by the deal to reduce their stake in the firm under convenient conditions.

A simple utility framework of mortgage choice points to the long-term bond risk premium as distinct from the yield spread and the long yield as a theoretical determinant of mortgage choice: when the bond risk premium is high, fixed-rate mortgage payments are high, making adjustable-rate mortgages more attractive. We confirm empirically that the bulk of the time variation in both aggregate and loan-level mortgage choice can be explained by time variation in the bond risk premium, whether bond risk premia are measured using forecasters' data, a vector autoregressive (VAR) term structure model, or a simple household decision rule based on adaptive expectations.

Finally, to analyze how poverty and economic reform influence the extent and nature of social capital. Social networks, a crucial element of social capital, and cleavages are strongly affected by political and economic dislocations. The former include wars and civil wars, while the latter include state policies and economic conditions. Thus wasta, an old but still significant form of social capital in the Arab World, becomes helpful in good times but destructive in bad times.

In addition to a full claim on all IPO proceeds, new investors in a converted thrift also receive a claim on all pre-conversion market value at no cost. Thus, the average firm in our sample has a degree of underpricing automatically built into its offer price. We find that after removing the large initial returns, cumulative excess returns for the firms in our sample are positive for 12 months after the IPO. Beginning in the second year after the IPO, the average firm in our sample undergoes a significant price correction that lasts approximately 18 months and which produces negative cumulative abnormal returns for up to 5 years post-issue. Differences in risk-adjusted returns also indicate negative long-run returns, with poor performance concentrated in the second and third years following the IPO. The return differences are most pronounced among the small thrifts in our sample, and are broadly consistent with investor overreaction at the time of the IPO that continues for 6-12 months before prices begin reverting back to fundamental value.

Comparing to results of laboratory experiments, the estimated functions are closer to linearity and loss aversion is less pronounced. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The estimated price elasticity of R&D is -0.10 in the short run and -0.14 in the long run, with slightly higher elasticities for small firms than for large firms. We show that there is a deadweight loss associated with level-based R&D tax incentives that is particularly acute for large firms. For small firms it is not sizeable enough to suppress the R&D additionality, at least not for quite a number of years after the initial tax change. Incremental R&D tax credits do not suffer from this deadweight loss and are from that perspective preferable to level-based tax incentives.","[Mohnen, Pierre] Maastricht Univ, CIRANO, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands; [Mohnen, Pierre] UNU MERIT, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands; [Baghana, Rufin] Minist Finances, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Mohnen, P (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, CIRANO, Keizer Karelpl 19, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands.",p.mohnen@merit.unimaas.nl,"Mohnen, Pierre/ACL-4047-2022","Mohnen, Pierre/0000-0002-2289-7379",,,,,26,48,53,8,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The paper shows, first, that Keynes's non-numerical probabilities can be interpreted in terms of decision weights and distortions of the probability priors. Second, it is argued that the degree of non-additivity of the probability measure can account for the confidence in a probability assessment without any reference to a second order probability, as suggested by Keynes's notion of weight of argument. And, third, it is identified a criterion for decision making under uncertainty developed in the non-additive literature that incorporates a measure of the degree of confidence in the probability assessment. The paper aims to substantiate the view, put forward in a recent paper in this journal, that Keynes's analysis of uncertainty has continuing relevance to decision theory and can provide the foundations for a theory of decision making under uncertainty that is arguably more general than subjective expected utility theory.

Our analysis uses a standard, frictionless, full-information, dynamic, continuous-time, general-equilibrium, Lucas endowment economy in which there are two classes of agents who have time-additive power utility functions and differ only in their risk aversion. Our main result is to show analytically that if the intensity of the precautionary demand for savings is not too high, then the introduction of a nonredundant derivative increases the volatility of stock market returns. Furthermore, in the economy with the derivative, the volatility of stock market returns can be substantially greater than that of aggregate dividend growth (fundamental volatility).

Despite an extensive literature examining the relationship between trade policy and some political factors, relatively few studies have explored the role of a country's electoral system, arguably one of the most fundamental characteristics of a nation's political landscape. This paper examines the empirical relationship between tariffs and electoral systems across countries and over time. The broad theoretical framework is provided by Grossman and Helpman, which predicts a bias towards a non-zero average tariff, i.e. a protectionist bias, in countries with majoritarian systems, since politicians in a majoritarian system aim to maximize the welfare of their home districts, as opposed to the welfare of the nation as a whole. I compare average tariffs of countries with majoritarian systems to those with proportional systems, using methods that address the omitted variables/sample selection problem inherent to this analysis. I find that countries with majoritarian systems do indeed appear to have higher average tariffs than do countries with proportional systems. This result holds after controlling for other country-specific characteristics, such as a country's legal origins, colonial history, and geographic location.","Santa Clara Univ, Dept Econ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Santa Clara University,"Evans, CL (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Dept Econ, 500 EI Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",clevans@scu.edu,,,,,,,36,33,39,0,10,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

The paper finds these contracts to be excellent predictors of the fed funds rate, and shows that the claim of a nonzero term premium in the short-horizon contracts is more sensitive to outliers than previous research appears to have recognized. I find some statistically significant evidence of serial correlation in the daily changes, but this accounts for only a tiny part of the 1-day movements and there is essentially zero predictability for horizons longer than 1 day. Settlement futures prices for each day appear to incorporate the information embodied in that day's term structure of longer-horizon Treasury securities. Previous employment growth makes a statistically significant contribution to predicting futures price changes, though again this could only account for a tiny part of the daily variance. The paper concludes that futures prices provide a very useful measure of the daily changes in the market's expectation of near-term changes in Fed policy.","Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Hamilton, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",jhamilton@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,17,31,39,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

In the descriptive materials and questionnaire items used in a field survey, treated effluent from wastewater treatment plants was described as recycled water for one experimental group and as treated wastewater for another. Although the two terms describe the same commodity (i.e. purified effluent from wastewater treatment facilities) willingness to use was reliably higher with the recycled water descriptor for both farmers and consumers. In contrast, the descriptor affected willingness to pay only in the consumer sample; decisions about personal consumption of food products might be more affected by the differential disgust-eliciting effectiveness of descriptors than farmers' business decisions concerning the irrigation of products to be consumed by others. Respondents of both samples who were unwilling to use recycled water commodities most often cited feelings of disgust as the main cause of their rejection, supporting the view that successful marketing strategies for this valuable resource must take into account the normative learning histories of potential consumers.

The complexity is shown by different levels of quality, which provide a global picture of the performance of a health system: compliance with mandatory rules, compliance with professional recommendations/references, action of steady improvement aiming at resolving health problems, risk management or excellence seeking, etc. The multidimensional character is provided by various dimensions to be covered by evaluation indicators of the performance of a health system: acceptability -> in what points the health system meets our expectations; accessibility -> knowing whether we can receive the services where and when we need them; adequacy -> knowing whether the care meets our needs and is based on established rules; competence -> knowing whether knowledge and skills of health services providers are consistent with the care they provide; continuity -> matching services - coordination, integration, easy access; effectiveness -> concerning the services in operation and in what point they influence our health; efficiency -> achieving best results at the lowest cost; security -> minimizing possible risks in a health area or service. Out of these dimensions - which, from a synergetic perspective, define the overall performance of a health system - we retain for a detailed analysis only those concerning acceptability, adequacy and competence, which determine the responsiveness to the patients' expectations. Moreover, for working out a methodology for assessing the quality of health services, it is necessary to analyse various standard procedures for assessing the performance of health services initiated and rendered by international organisations and promoted, first of all, by the World Health Organisation. Our paper also deals with actions already taken worldwide, which now are undergoing structural improvements as well as with opportunities for making market surveys (opinion polls) among the beneficiaries of a health system: the citizens.","[Ristea, Ana-Lucia; Stegaroiu, Ion; Ioan-Franc, Valeriu] Univ Valahia Targoviste, Targoviste, Romania; [Ioan-Franc, Valeriu] Acad Romana, Natl Inst Econ Res, Bucharest, Romania; [Dinu, Vasile] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Valahia University of Targoviste; National Institute for Economic Research Costin C.

Our research is specifically concerned with the factors that may explain the conditions that lead to integration of researchers and lecturers in the academic career in France. More precisely, the paper analyses the factors affecting the access duration to a permanent job in the French academic sector. We use data from a French survey Generation 2001, carried out by the Cereq. We focus on a sample of 1400 individuals who obtained their PhDs in 2001 and were interviewed in 2004. A discrete time model is used to analyse the main factors influencing the access duration. In addition, in order to assess the effect of a estimation of models that simultaneously explain the access duration to a permanent job and participation to a post-doc program. Our main results indicate that the scientific publications and post-doc have an influence on the access duration to a permanent job, which is coherent with the idea that potential employers use this information as a proxy of research and teaching abilities.

Empirically, a one-standard deviation increase in the return volatility reduces the probability of investment by 13 percent, equivalent to a 9 percent decline in real prices. Increases in the number of potential competitors located near a project negate the negative relationship between idiosyncratic risk and development.

We find background risk factors posed by labor income uncertainty and health risk are important. Credit constraints and observed risk preferences play the expected role. A positive age gradient is identified for risky asset holdings and home-ownership is associated with greater risky asset holdings. A unifying theme for many of our empirical findings is the important role played by financial awareness and knowledge in determining risky asset holdings. Many non-stockholding households appear to lack the experience and financial literacy that might enable them to benefit from direct investment in stocks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence, technical criteria are becoming dominant in the selection process of the scholars. But also, a divorce appears between the two functions - research and teaching. This may be responsible for the lack of interest in economics by a large fraction of the students and hence for a low level of culture in economics among the future managers. However economics is a fundamental discipline, which help understanding how social systems are working. Therefore a dramatic revision of the organisation of training courses is unavoidable. In the French context, this implies to clearly distinguish between undergraduate and graduate studies, the former should be multidisciplinary and the latter should focus on the core of the discipline and on the required quantitative methods. Moreover, the new institutional environment, mainly characterised by the autonomy of universities, should give the means for to the necessary diversification of research interests and paradigms that will favour the development of the discipline and a better articulation between research and teaching.","[Gaffard, Jean-Luc] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Gaffard, Jean-Luc] CNRS GREDEG, OFCE Sci Po, F-06560 Valbonne, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite Cote d'Azur,"Gaffard, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",jeanluc.gaffard@sciences-po.fr,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Using data from 254 initial public offerings (IPOs) in 22 emerging markets, we find that portfolios that covary highly with the IPO experience a decline in prices relative to other portfolios during the month of the issue. The effects are stronger when the IPO is issued in a market that is less integrated internationally and when the IPO is bigger. This evidence is consistent with the idea that shocks to asset supply have a significant effect on asset prices.","[Larrain, Borja] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Adm, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Larrain, B (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Adm, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",blarrain@faceapuc.cl,"Braun, Matías/ABE-5360-2020","Larrain, Borja/0000-0003-1088-0550; , Matias/0000-0002-3895-0963",,,,,46,39,46,4,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

In the first stage, contestants compete A -la-Tullock; in the second stage, the winner can resell the rent A -la-Coase. We consider a complete information Tullock game in which the contestants have different valuations for the rent. The analysis focuses on the ex ante effects of a secondary market on efforts, payoffs, rent-dissipation and rent-misallocation. We show that the secondary market, while correcting possible misallocations, may exacerbate rent dissipation. In some situations, the increase in rent dissipation more than offsets the allocative advantage, so that a secondary market might reduce welfare. We further show how the effect of ex post tradeability on welfare depends on the parties' bargaining power and valuations of the rent, also considering the case of endogenous bargaining power.","[Dari-Mattiacci, Giuseppe] Univ Amsterdam, ACLE, Amsterdam Sch Econ, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Dari-Mattiacci, Giuseppe; Onderstal, Sander] Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Parisi, Francesco] Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Parisi, Francesco] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; University of Amsterdam; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Bologna,"Dari-Mattiacci, G (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, ACLE, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",gdarimat@uva.nl; a.m.onderstal@uva.nl; parisi@umn.edu,"Parisi, Francesco/CAJ-0100-2022","Parisi, Francesco/0000-0003-2807-2279; Onderstal, Sander/0000-0002-4700-870X",,,,,47,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2009,139.0,1-2,,,,,171,196,,10.1007/s11127-008-9387-6,0.0,,,26,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,421AB,,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264329200014,0

A number of recent micro studies suggest that interpersonal trust has its greatest impact on economic performance when court institutions are relatively weak. The conventional wisdom from most macro studies, however, is that social capital is unconditionally good for growth. On the basis of the micro evidence, we outline an investment game between a producer and a lender in an incomplete-contracts setting. A key insight is that social capital will have the greatest effect on the total surplus from the game at lower levels of institutional strength and that the effect of social capital vanishes when institutions are very strong. When we bring this prediction to an empirical cross-country growth regression, it is shown that the marginal effect of social capital (in the form of interpersonal trust) decreases with institutional strength. Our results imply that a one standard deviation rise in social capital in weakly institutionalized Nigeria should increase economic growth by 1.8 percentage points, whereas the same increase in social capital only increases growth by 0.3 percentage points in strongly institutionalized Canada.

A model is constructed in which individuals vote for government expenditure on a public good, for a given income tax rate. Labour supply is endogenous. The equilibrium ratio of transfers to public good expenditure is a function of the ratio of median to mean wages and the tax rate. Cross-sectional regressions confirmed that reductions in the skewness of the wage rate distribution are associated with reductions in transfer payments relative to public goods expenditure, at a decreasing rate. Increases in the tax rate initially increase the importance of transfer payments but eventually tax rate increases lead to lower transfers. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

I estimate that private charitable contributions to arts organizations increased by 50 to 60 cents due to a major funding cut to the NEA during the mid-1990s. These increases, however, also coincided with, on average, a 25 cent increase in fund-raising expenditures by arts organizations for every dollar decrease in government grants. The estimate of crowding out found in this paper is relatively large, particularly for a study using a micro-data set.

Anti-temporary replacement worker legislation (ATR) or anti-scab legislation is currently in effect in Quebec and British Columbia and existed for a short period of time in Ontario. This paper uses variation over time (1978-2003) and across provinces to provide empirical evidence concerning the impact of ATR on work stoppages. The results show that ATR increases strike incidence and decreases strike length-both effects are statistically significant and substantial in magnitude. Incidence and length have opposing effects on days lost to work stoppages. Empirical results provide weak evidence that anti-scab legislation may increase days lost to work stoppages in the first two years after the legislation takes effect but no evidence that such legislation has a statistically significant effect on days lost when it has been in effect for more than two years.,"[Duffy, Paul; Johnson, Susan] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Duffy, P (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",,,,,,,,14,3,3,1,1,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

To assess the impact of supermarket chains on various participants in the supply chain, a survey was carried out in Botswana, Namibia and Zambia in 2004, 2005 and 2007. To determine the factors that influence the choice between the supermarket or traditional market channel and the impact of participation in the supermarket supply chain, a two-step treatment model was used. The results showed that over 80% of all processed food products in Botswana, Namibia and Zambia were imported from South Africa, and that supermarkets used a mixture of procurement systems for fresh fruit and vegetables and processed food products. Participation in the supermarkets channel had a positive impact on small-scale farmers' incomes. Farmers who supplied fresh fruit and vegetables to supermarkets had a significantly higher income than those who supplied to traditional markets in Zambia. The expansion of South African supermarkets into the SADC countries may be beneficial to small-scale farmers and therefore efforts should be made to incorporate them into the supermarkets' fresh fruit and vegetable supply chain.","[Emongor, R.; Kirsten, J.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Emongor, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",remongor@yahoo.co.uk; Johann.Kirsten@up.ac.za,"Kirsten, Johann F/A-5645-2011; Kirsten, Johann/AAC-8055-2019","Kirsten, Johann/0000-0003-0770-9648",,,,,12,29,38,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,MAR,2009,48.0,1,,,,,60,84,,10.1080/03031853.2009.9523817,0.0,,,25,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,461HH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267254900005,0

WTP for the higher variation in risk is significantly greater than WTP for the lower risk change. We find evidence that those respondents who have had personal experience of avalanches in recent years combine the information about future risk increase-as provided in the survey-with the observed number of fatal avalanche accidents in the past.

These findings are robust against several variations of the setup: probability representations (verbal and numeric), reasons for default (insolvency and claim settlement practices), framing (positively and negatively expressed probability of default), and comparisons between the policy's level of default and that of an alternative (default free and small default risk). The major driver of willingness to pay is level of security concern and decisions are sensitive to the default probability. All other effects on willingness to pay are unsystematic.

We are dealing with new threats, new risks and, therefore, we have to ask ours elves a natural question: what do we understand by saying international security? Private security, private wars, the new cooperation standards, globalization, the perpetually increasing number of international actors and last, but not least the economic crisis, put security in a shady conceptual area, making it harder and harder to define. We can talk about a new security environment in relation with both the end of the Cold War and the military/non-military dichotomy or the global governance, seer. as interaction between many types of international actors. The asymmetries created by the non-conventional threats, by the organized crime, by the new forms of terrorism or by the natural disasters tend to lean the security toward its human approach. Nevertheless, we now have to deal with the need for international cooperation and with finding complex solution to complex global issues. Taking into consideration that there are many more actors nowadays that hold a certain kind of power on the international scene, international relations tend to be non-polar and not multipolar. We are witnessing a new security environment, which reinvents itself permanently and is but a work in progress, same as the international economic order or the global governance. The international scene can therefore be defined through its need for security and cooperation. Besides clarifying ambiguities that may be found in the literature on security governance the article aims to analyze the international relations in three directions: evolution of global governance including the relationship between global governance and international security, the impact of the financial crisis on the world and the need for reform, for a new global governance architecture as a solution for stability and sustainability. Global governance is an evolving concept and it became a central theme in the study of international relations. Besides the fact that it is based on series of principles, is considered that it provides global public goods that are non-rival and non-exclusive. Moreover, its relationship with international security defines the world we live in. In the context of the financial crisis, there is an acute need to reform global governance and international security governance through better risk management and a changed paradigm of global governance. In other words, security becomes a diffuse and hard to define concept and harder to manage internationally. Therefore, considering recent events, we need to find a new paradigm for the still emerging global governance and for the security governance. The aim of this paper is to put forward the need for global governance reform through government networks. Because every reform has to begin with a theoretical model I suggest we analyze international relations as a matrix that comprises vertical and horizontal relations. In addition, I consider a heterarchic vision of the new world order. All these are considering the possible role of Romania in the context of the global governance reform.","[Afrasine, Laura] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,laura.afrasine@gmail.com,"Zalzala, Laura/F-2899-2013",,,,,,26,0,0,0,5,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,3,12,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000001,0

In this paper we test the 'colonial human capital' explanation for sub-Saharan Africa, controlling for legal origin and geography. Utilising data on colonial era education, we find that instrumented human capital explains long-term growth better, and shows greater stability over time, than instrumented measures for extractive institutions. We suggest that the impact of the disease environment on African long-term growth runs through a human capital channel rather than an extractive-institutions channel.

Using 132 IPOs listed on the Main Board of the Bursa Malaysia, this study found that the disposition effect did indeed exist among IPO investors in the Bursa Malaysia. Investors were found to be 2.64 times more willing to flip winning compared to losing IPOs. Further, after scrutinizing the long run ex-post performance of the winners' and losers' portfolios, it was found that the tendency for investors to flip winning IPOs arising from their fear of regret was justifiable. Nonetheless, an investor's decision to hold on to losers was found to be a suboptimal behavior. This was because the ex-post performance of the losers was not significantly better than their initial performance. Finally, this study also uncovered that investors' mean revert anticipation was not justified by the ex-post return.","Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business & Management, Dept Banking & Finance, Jalan Meranek 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Chong, F (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business & Management, Dept Banking & Finance, Kota Samarahan Campus, Jalan Meranek 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia.",fenneechong@sarawak.uitm.edu.my,,,,,,,29,15,16,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

We extend this research by examining the potential effect of seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a documented psychological condition that produces heightened pessimism and risk aversion during the fall and winter months, on stock analysts' earnings estimates. Our results suggest that analysts are generally optimistic in their forecasts but significantly less so during SAD months. We also find this relation to be most pronounced for analysts located in northern states, who should be the ones most impacted by the disorder. We conclude that while the effect of SAD appears to be present, it actually seems to overcome an existing positive bent in earnings forecasts, thereby making estimates more accurate.

How can be values of competitiveness criteria and factors concerning a basis of comparison received if competitors' data is a trade secret? Which factors should be added into estimation of competitiveness so that the calculation takes into account conditions of current economic environment? According to our views, the first question can be solved by the separation of research spheres into SBUs (Strategic Business Units). In other words, it is necessary to separate the research of company competitiveness into several parts according to quantity of business units. For solving the second and the third questions it is needed to observe a number of requirements for comparison objects: comparability of scales; comparability of targets; availability of data. If one follows the given requirements, usage of competitors or a leader of the market as basis of comparison will be difficult. As for usage of average market rates like the basis of comparison is devoid of sense, because, in that case, competitiveness will show opportunities to maintain the average values, but not to compete. According to our views, one can solve this problem by usage as basis of comparison not outer data, but the ability of the company to realize its targets concerning each SBU. These targets are expressed in achieving of a certain competitive position.","[Ivashchenko, Nataliya; Gavrilova, Irina] Moscow State Text Univ AN Kosygin, Dept Management, Moscow 119071, Russia",Kosygin State University of Russia,,blackego@mail.ru; gim@staff.msta.ac.ru,"Gavrilova, Irina I/I-4619-2018",,,,,,4,1,1,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,142,147,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000016,0

This is consistent with the hypothesis that accountability to shareholders and depositors gives joint-equity banks a better incentive than state-owned banks to engage in prudent lending, and with the hypothesis that the reform of the banking system has improved the incentive for state-owned banks to behave more prudently in their lending.

These systems should also be capable of producing relevant results in accordance with the user's necessities. Thus, the solution is simple: intelligent information technologies. The following paper is consequently focusing on designing and explaining system architecture meant to emphasize the benefits and the opportunities of the intelligent technologies in the field of accountancy. During our research, we have seen the potential of multiagent systems and we consider that this is the perfect moment for the above-mentioned technology to prove its applicability in this vital domain for the Romanian economy. The main reason for which we have chosen to speak about this topic is based on our strong belief that present systems are limited and deficient in solving complex problems when compared to the benefits and positive impact of multi-agent system technology in the financial-accounting field.","[Lupasc, Adrian; Lupasc, Ioana; Mazilescu, Vasile; Zamfir, Cristina Gabriela; Susanu, Irina Olimpia] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati,,alupasc@ugal.ro; iandone@uaic.ro; ioanalupasc22@yahoo.com; cray_mk@yahoo.com; cristinapisica@yahoo.com; irisusanu@yahoo.com,"OLIMPIA, SUSANU IRINA/JNE-2226-2023; Cristina, Zamfir/GRX-7756-2022",,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,375,383,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000057,0

To ensure this measurement is the estimation of private benefits of control, this paper examined the total amount of related party transaction after the control transferred. This paper finds there is a inverted U-relationship between the controlling shareholder's shareholding proportion and private benefits, cross-listing significantly reducing the size of private benefits, and the supervision of board, the legal environment restricted the expansion of private benefits to some extent.

It is therefore important to include these services in the national system of economic accounts. This requires estimation of accounting prices for ecosystems, that is, the marginal value of a change in the size of the system. This raises a number of questions: What do we mean by the size of the system? What is the dynamics of the system? How do we quantify the impacts on services from a change in the size of the system and finally how do we value these impacts? We discuss these questions in a few examples of ecosystems, and valuation as such is not the major problem. The major problem is the lack of information of the appropriate dynamic model for most systems. We therefore suggest that economists and ecologists should set priorities on which ecosystems should be the first objects for study for these; we should test the possibilities of estimating the accounting prices.","[Maler, Karl-Goran; Aniyar, Sara; Jansson, Asa] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Maler, Karl-Goran] Univ Stockholm, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics; Stockholm University,"Aniyar, S (通讯作者)，Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Box 50005, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden.",sara@beijer.kva.se,,,,,,,42,36,40,1,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The next advantage of this theory is the fact that it can provide not only information about time consumption of the particular operation but also about its labour costs and other expenses. This is also very important source for the following decision of management. Open systems provide information about number of workers in the team of repairers and assemblers or how many workers should be employed in the dispatch office or in the stock. The closed systems can be used by the multimachines service, mainly by setting numbers of setters. According to independent research activity there is an example of application of queueing theory in setting optimal number of drivers of fork-lift trucks for particular working area of a company in the car industry.","[Slaichova, Eva] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,eva.slaichova@tul.cz,"Šírová, Eva/IZQ-0668-2023; Šírová, Eva/AAC-8968-2020","Šírová, Eva/0000-0003-2110-1698; Šírová, Eva/0000-0003-2110-1698",,,,,6,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,364,369,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000041,0

In particular, aggregate behavior is best characterized by probability distortions and hyperbolic discounting. But is it the same people who are prone to these behaviors? Based on an experiment with salient monetary incentives we demonstrate that there is a strong and significant relationship between greater departures from linear probability weighting and the degree of decreasing discount rates at the level of individual behavior. We argue that this relationship can be rationalized by the uncertainty inherent in any future event, linking discounting behavior directly to risk preferences. Consequently, decreasing discount rates may be generated by people's proneness to probability distortions.","[Epper, Thomas; Fehr-Duda, Helga; Bruhin, Adrian] ETH, Chair Econ, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Epper, T (通讯作者)，ETH, Chair Econ, Weinbergstr 35, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",epper@econ.gess.ethz.ch,"Lott, Corey/B-9795-2012",,,,,,64,69,78,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

The reduced-form profit equations are estimated for each group of countries for the period 1995-2006. The results suggest that the inclusion of X-efficiency and scale efficiency directly in the reduced-form profit equation is crucial in explaining the bank profit-structure relationship in the European banking markets. When we control for direct measures of efficiency, the market share and concentration coefficient become insignificant in all regressions. The results support the efficiency versions of the efficient-structure hypothesis over the relative market power and structure-conduct-performance hypothesis. For the developing economies of Europe, the findings of the paper indicate that efficiency is a crucial factor for establishing a sound banking system and the banks in these countries should increase their scale of operations to attain an optimal profit level.","[Kasman, Adnan; Kasman, Saadet; Turgutlu, Evrim] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Business, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University,"Kasman, A (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Business, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey.",,"Kasman, Saadet/ABF-8195-2020; Kasman, Adnan/ABF-6942-2020","Kasman, Adnan/0000-0001-9361-982X; KASMAN, Saadet/0000-0002-2304-0676",,,,,32,5,5,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

We provide a new rationale for the provision of deposit insurance. In our model the banking sector exhibits both adverse selection and moral hazard, which implies that the social benefits of bank monitoring must for incentive reasons be shared between depositors and banks. Consequently, socially too few deposits are made in equilibrium. Deposit insurance - or, equivalently, bank recapitalization - corrects this market failure. We find that deposit insurance should be funded not by banks or depositors but out of general taxation. The optimal level of deposit insurance varies inversely with the quality of the banking system. Hence, when the soundness of the financial sector is uncertain, governments should consider supporting deposit insurance schemes and undertaking subsidized recapitalizations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The respondents were offered actual inter-temporal noise change scenarios rather than hypothetical variations, which is uncommon in the literature, incorporating the presence or absence of an airport and other relevant transport attributes that also changed with the airport relocation. Whilst there is some variation in the valuation of the airport closure and opening, when these values are adjusted to reflect the actual change in decibels, there is remarkably little difference between the old and new airports. However, a significant variation in aircraft noise values is identified between different areas, with respect to education and to a lesser extent income.

Airports also connect aviation systems with other modes of transportation. As a result, access modes to airports are critical to the aviation system, and studying air passenger decisions regarding mode choice is an essential part of airport management and system planning. Though there has been systematic analysis of car use to access airports, there has been less systematic attention to the use of the public transport system, especially the taxi service. The aim of this study is to identify King Khaled International Airport (KKIA) access mode characteristics and users, which has not been investigated previously concentrating on the mix between car and taxi using data collected specifically for this research. More than half (55.5%) of the travelers surveyed arrived at KKIA by private car: taxi and limousine passengers accounted for 42.2% of the sample. The Saudi Public Transit Company (SAPTCO), transported only 2.3% of the air passengers surveyed. These results are similar to findings for an airport in the United States and very different from findings for an airports in the East (e.g., Hong Kong). A binary logit model was developed to evaluate the access mode choice. It was found that income, luggage, travel access time, and nationality significantly affect mode choice. Results provide insight for improved planning of access to KKIA. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of our analysis show that only three of the nineteen companies could be considered as being truly 'International' and service the 'lion's share' of the major and minor ports distributed across the globe. The port networks of the other companies in our survey, whilst having individualized features, shared common characteristics. Guided by the 'Uppsala Model of Incremental Internationalization' (Johanson and Vahlne, 1977), we were able to identify four intemationalization levels of a container shipping company that are indicated by their port network We argue that the port network plays an additional role as it contributes to the internationalization level of the container shipping companies. This is important because the internationalization level affects the container shipping company's ability to expand its customer base both at a local and international level. Local customers would have access to a larger international destination network and international customers would be able access a larger local distribution network without transhipping between different companies. Amongst other issues, we were able to determine that, for the analyzed container shipping companies, 'Internationalization' of a port network means including or excluding ports in specific regions or sub-regions in their own network, and that a company's home base or history plays a significant role in this development.

Although international securitized real estate returns are generally not predictable based on commonly-used statistical criteria, there is much evidence for the predictability based on economic criteria (i.e., direction of price changes and trading rule profitability), which is more often due to nonlinearity-in-mean. The forecast combinations for various models appear to improve the forecasting performance, while the allowance of data-snooping bias using White's reality check substantially mitigates spurious out-of-sample forecasting performance and weakens otherwise overwhelmingly strong predictability.

He argues that the puzzling estimates obtained using the standard equation for the efficient markets hypothesis are due to omitted variable bias. He identifies the missing variables as the future change in the forward exchange rate and the future interest differential. When these are added to the standard equation, he finds a one-to-one relationship between the future change in the spot rate and the forward premium. However, we argue that his equation can only test covered interest parity and offers no insight into the forward-bias puzzle. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

Many treatments have sought to estimate the effect of household income on the likelihood of home ownership. To date, no study has ever disaggregated the household income of married couples into the separate labor income components to see if one partner's income has a different effect than the other. Using a derived likelihood function to control for censoring in the wife's income, this paper estimates the effect of separate incomes on housing tenure choice, accounting for possible endogeneity of the wife's income. To compare the results of this estimation method, the paper also estimates the standard IV models, 2SLS and IV probit. While the results show that there is no endogeneity of the wife's income, ignoring the censoring of the endogenous variable (when a large fraction of observations are censored) can possibly lead to biased coefficient estimates. Also, this paper confirms the importance of total household income, which has a larger effect than the total disaggregated components. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The existing literature based on cross-sectional studies finds a negative relationship between income uncertainty and home ownership. This paper utilises data on transitions into home ownership and exogenous variation in unemployment risk, avoiding the endogeneity of employment to home ownership status. It also conditions the empirical estimates on a measure of house price volatility utilising a local-level house price index to control house price risk, which might also discourage home ownership. Results show a strong role for unemployment risk in lowering the likelihood of house purchase, but no statistically significant role for house price risk. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A vector autoregressive model (VAR) is estimated for four variables - excess return to housing, rents, the real interest rate and real disposable per capita income - using quarterly data over the period 1978-2009. This empirical investigation - which allows for a decomposition of house price movements into movements in rent (cash-flow) and expected return news components - indicates that the bulk of the variability of euro area house price movements can be attributed to movements in fundamentals. There remains nonetheless an important but less sizeable influence of market-wide (or expected-return) variations in house prices. Country-specific estimation indicates considerable heterogeneity around the euro area result, both for what concerns long-term impacts and dynamics. Notably, changes in expected returns play a relatively strong role in the house prices of Ireland and Spain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A probit analysis is used to identify the factors which determine the choice of a selling point. Variables capturing transaction costs are used in the analysis and these relate to searching for a trading partner, gathering information about the transaction, contracting, negotiating, monitoring and enforcing of contracts. The findings reveal that collective action, gender of household head, degree of dependence on the crop, geographical location and access to price information significantly affect the choice of selling point. This suggests that policies aimed at establishing market information systems, promotion of collective action among smallholder farmers, increased investment in rural infrastructure and achieving gender balance in trade are important.","[Jagwe, J.

PCA is a downstream cap-and-trade policy proposed in the UK, in which emission rights are allocated to individuals. We hypothesized that due to economic, pro-environmental and mental accounting drivers PCA would have greater potential to deliver emissions reduction than taxation. Participants (n = 1,096) received one version of a survey with the same energy-behavior related questions and identical incurred costs under one of the following framings: energy tax (where carbon was not mentioned), carbon tax, and PCA. Results suggest that policies that draw people's attention to carbon (PCA and carbon taxation) could have greater impact on their stated willingness to reduce energy consumption, and on the reduction amounts prompted, than would a non-overt price signal (energy tax). There is mixed evidence, however, as to whether PCA or carbon taxation would produce the largest energy demand reductions. Some indication was found for a spillover toward wider carbon conservation under the PCA framing.

Here, I propose a model where firms are subject both to infrequent price adjustment and search frictions. This interaction gives rise to real price rigidities, which have the effect of slowing down the adjustment of the price level to shocks. This has a number of consequences for equilibrium dynamics. First, inflation becomes less volatile and more persistent. More importantly, the model's empirical performance improves along its labor market dimensions, such as the size of unemployment fluctuations and the relative volatility of the two margins of labor.","Banco Espana, DG Econ Stat & Res, Madrid, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Thomas, C (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, DG Econ Stat & Res, Madrid, Spain.",carlos.thomas@bde.es,,,,,,,36,16,17,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The current paper extends Lucas' calculations by studying the costs of fluctuations arising from asset bubbles. We estimate two classes of costs: consumption volatility due to asset bubbles in a representative agent economy and consumption volatility that arises because households have heterogeneous exposure to the bubble assets. We show that the magnitude of welfare costs is primarily driven by the existence of heterogeneity. Our benchmark calibration implies that the asset bubbles of the last decade generated a social welfare cost equal to a permanent 3% reduction in the level of national consumption. If assets are held proportionately across the population, these welfare costs fall by an order of magnitude. Our calculations are sensitive to the details of the calibration, including the degree of balance sheet and trading heterogeneity, the coefficient of relative risk aversion, and the magnitude of the asset bubble. Our preferred specifications generate welfare costs ranging from 1% to 10% of (permanent) national consumption.","[Chauvin, Kyle; Laibson, David; Mollerstrom, Johanna] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Chauvin, K (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kchauvin@fas.harvard.edu; dlaibson@gmail.com; jmollers@fas.harvard.edu,"Laibson, David/AAA-7362-2022",,,,,,32,6,6,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We qualify this view. Social preferences tend to be irrelevant if two conditions are met: separability of preferences and completeness of contracts.

It finds that the strategic effect decreases as R&D spillover increases. The foreign firm tends to raise the likelihood of choosing direct entry when the technology spillover is larger. For the foreign firms as well as the host country, there is no difference between choosing direct entry or acquisition when the market is extremely competitive. On regulation of foreign ownership, technology spillover creates the possibility of choosing direct entry for the foreign firm, which is different from the results obtained in Mattoo et al.

This paper further takes into account the ARCH effects of the volatility of the exchange rate.

It then goes onto assess the impacts of the above policies on the industry structure, the performance of major airlines, and the competitiveness of Chinese airlines in international markets. The study shows that the industry became more competitive following the opening up of the domestic aviation market. Although major airlines saw an increase in passenger volume and an improvement in load factors, the falling yield and rising costs make them difficult to grow profitably. Moreover, Chinese airlines largely failed to capitalise on building an international network and the majors were weak in international competition. Strategic use of aviation policy to build a strong and profitable airline industry is still a formidable task lying ahead for policymakers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on a panel dataset consisting of 21 high-tech sectors during the period 1995-2004, an augmented knowledge production function is estimated. The results show that importing foreign technology alone does not facilitate innovation in Chinese state-owned high-tech enterprises, unless in-house R&D is also conducted. Domestic technology purchases, however, are found to have a favorable direct impact on innovation, suggesting that firms have less difficulty in absorbing domestic technological knowledge than utilizing foreign technology and that absorptive capacity is contingent upon the source or nature of the external knowledge.

Advances in transport technology have gradually diminished travel times, and this process has been discussed in the context of international- or national-level transport changes. This paper investigates the changing relationship between space and time at the urban level. The changing relationship between commuting time and distance in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) is empirically analysed by using the 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005 two-percent sample data of the Korean Census of Population and Housing. The study results empirically demonstrate the close relationship between the urban decentralisation process and the time-space convergence phenomenon. The key findings of this research are that commuting time per distance unit in the SMA shortened over the 15 years of the study period, and this improvement was greater for longer journeys than for shorter trips. The empirical evidence of this research shows that workers have migrated to faster commuting modes such as car and subway and away from slower modes such as buses, so that commuting time has decreased or remained constant even as commuting distance in the SMA has increased.

The issue of soldiering can be understood partly as a result of the political history of the Liberian state; in particular, its territorialization. This paper explores how labour has been mobilized historically and details what determined labour-force participation before the outbreak of the civil war. During the twentieth century, labour in Liberia was organized to service the functions of a resource-extraction economy, a prominent place being given to the main resource-based export industry, namely rubber, and the role of international companies. The administrative practices of the state in recruiting labour to these industries are central to mobilization. Efforts to demobilize and reintegrate combatants should take account of these historical legacies.","[Munive, Jairo] Danish Inst Int Studies, DK-1403 Copenhagen, Denmark",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies,"Munive, J (通讯作者)，Danish Inst Int Studies, Strandgade 56, DK-1403 Copenhagen, Denmark.",munive.jairo@gmail.com,,,,,,,54,12,16,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Existing classifications rely strongly on the indicator passenger frequency, which focuses on transport related issues, blending performance with preconditions at a given site. We argue that a classification system for strategic planning should focus on the demands and conditions of the site within which the railway station must function, i.e. system context. Here, we present such a classification system: a cluster analysis of the 1700 Swiss railway stations relying solely on context factors. The resulting classes vary primarily in density (of land use and transport services) and use (commuting, leisure time, tourism). Common geographic patterns and class-specific dynamics are discernable. These results indicate that classification based on the relevant demands and conditions given by context leads to clearly interpretable classes and supports multi-perspective strategic planning for railway stations. The systematic approach allows for a better understanding of the interrelations between railway stations and their context. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

According to the research results, organizational learning is rudimentary, substantiated on the individual learning of the entrepreneur. Learning is experiential and the main outcomes are skills and concepts. Knowledge dissemination is deficient, the main flow being oriented only from entrepreneur to employees. The entrepreneur cannot control knowledge absorption but can evaluate and encourage it.

Since such impact is likely to depend on differences in earning potentials and opportunities for skill acquisition across destination countries, we explore the heterogeneity of impact by host country.

Previous forecasts of the consumer impacts are reviewed and tested by the first quantitative analysis for British Columbia based on data since the HST was implemented. The key finding is that the HST has raised BC's cost of living by 0.5 to 0.6 percent, which is consistent with businesses having passed through to consumers all of their tax savings related to in-province sales. The study offers policy options for offsetting even the small consumer impact of the HST and improving its public acceptance.","Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Kesselman, JR (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",,,,,,,,43,6,8,1,3,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Here, we briefly review the English contextual value added (E-CVA) model used to construct league tables of school effectiveness and juxtapose it with studies that focus on teacher effectiveness, other criteria of educational effectiveness and effectiveness at the university level. Methodologically, we consider the fragility of causal inferences based on psychometric and econometric value added models, and new multilevel models that take into account measurement and sampling error. Value added models largely ignore measurement error which systematically biases the outcomes, but both measurement and sampling error can be incorporated into doubly-latent models that integrate multilevel and latent variable approaches. The E-CVA model focuses on school effects and ignores teacher effects. However, research on both secondary schools and universities shows that there is little variance at the school or university level, but much more at the teacher level. E-CVA models consider test scores as the only indicator of effectiveness; there is little emphasis on other indicators of effectiveness, tests of the construct validity of test scores as a measure of effectiveness in relation to other indicators, or formative evaluations to improve effectiveness. Research on university students' ratings of teachers incorporates a broader perspective to construct validation: multidimensional factor structure, reliability/stability, relations with multiple criteria of effective teaching, and interventions to improve teaching. Both areas of research could learn from the other, and many strategies from the higher-education literature could be incorporated into the literature on educational effectiveness at the primary- and secondary-school levels.","[Marsh, Herbert W.; Nagengast, Benjamin; Fletcher, John; Televantou, Ioulia] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Marsh, HW (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",herb.marsh@education.ox.ac.uk; benjamin.nagengast@education.ox.ac.uk; john.fletcher@stx.ox.ac.uk; ioulia.televantou@gmail.com,"Nagengast, Benjamin/M-5168-2016; Marsh, Herbert W/B-3134-2017","Nagengast, Benjamin/0000-0001-9868-8322; Marsh, Herbert W/0000-0002-1078-9717",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F041292/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F041292/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,7,7,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

The teaching and learning activities have been divided into three sessions, in the end of the third session a questionnaire was used in order to reveal students' opinions regarding the usefulness of this original method of teaching and learning. Thus, this study also disclosed the results of using the model from students' point of view, derived from the analysis of empirical data collected during the class through personal observation and questionnaire.

In the absence of such legislation, the Clean Air Act is a potentially effective vehicle for achieving reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Decisions regarding existing stationary sources will have the greatest effect on emissions reductions. Although the magnitude of reductions is uncertain, it is plausible that a 10 percent reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels could be achieved at moderate costs by 2020. This is comparable to domestic emissions reductions that would have been achieved under the Waxman-Markey legislation. These measures do not include the switching of fuels, which could yield further reductions. The ultimate cost of regulation under the Act hinges on the stringency of standards and the flexibility allowed. A broad-based tradable performance standard is legally plausible and would provide incentives comparable to the proposed legislation, at least in the near term.","Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Weitzman, ML (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mweitzman@harvard.edu,,,,,,,19,241,272,0,60,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

Defection, then, can have the unjust motive of greed or the just motive of retaliation. To establish cooperation, observers should distinguish both motives for defection and respond more cooperatively to the latter. We propose that the expression of emotions may facilitate this inferential process. Indeed, in two laboratory studies participants inferred that defection out of anger or disappointment was a just response to a defector and they responded more cooperatively than when no emotion was communicated. Moreover, participants inferred that defectors who evoked disappointment instead of anger had a relatively positive reputation. We conclude that emotions help establish cooperation through indirect reciprocity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Wubben, Maarten J.

In developing countries, such restrictions lead to the emergence of informal housing sectors. To deter low-income migrants, localities in developing countries withhold public services to the informal housing sector. Using a large sample of Brazilian localities, we examine migration and exclusion, focusing on the public provision of water to small houses where low-income migrants are likely to live. Withholding water connections reduces the locality growth rate, particularly of low-education households. In terms of service provision, during dictatorship in Brazil, we find evidence of strategic exclusion, where localities appear to withhold services to deter in-migration. We also find evidence of strategic interactions among localities within metro areas in their setting of service levels: if one locality provides more services to migrant households, other localities respond by withholding service.

We tested the model through Turkish internal and external population flows toward German regions. Our analysis contains the first regional-level immigration analysis between an EU country (Germany) and Turkey. The main results are: (i) the purely economic motivations are more important than the social motivations; (ii) among the economic motivations income level and economic size of host regions are the biggest ones; and (iii) and the network externalities play a more important role than the herd effect. Subsequently, we estimated some country-specific factors on im/migration. The main results are: (i) joining to the Customs Union led to acceleration in intern migration but slowing-down in external immigration; (ii) even though Turkey acts slowly in adopting EU reforms, the EU reform process seems to reduce the economic and social stress on Turkish im/migration; and (iii) the reunification of Germany created a constraint on Turkish immigration flows toward German regions.","Univ Strasbourg, BETA THEME, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Sorhun, E (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, BETA THEME, Bur 133,61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",sorhun@cournot.u-strasbg.fr,,,,,,,25,6,6,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This system was put in place after years of declining stocks and over investment. In this paper we describe this reform and estimate related allocative efficiency benefits for the most important industrial fishery in the country, the southern pelagic fishery. Benefits were estimated using a bioeconomic model estimated using data for the 1985-2004 period. The estimated model was then used to generate simulated scenarios of the evolution of this fishery in a 20 year horizon with and without the ITQ system in place. The benefits of the reform can then be estimated by comparing the fishery's costs in the scenarios with and without ITQs. This approach allows benefits to be estimated using more realistic counterfactual scenarios than just comparing the fishery before and after the reform. Estimated discounted net benefits reach US $166 million in the period 2001-2020. Fleet size fell from 149 active boats in 2000 to 57 in 2004 as a direct consequence of the reform. Among the interesting features of the Chilean experience is the way the political economy of the reform was facilitated by the prior introduction of de facto individual quotas within the framework of fishery experimental activities. When the authorities closed the southern pelagic fishery because of biological problems between 1997 and 2000, they organized 'experimental' fishing expeditions in which participant boats were given the right to fish a certain amount of resources per expedition. This pseudo quota system allowed fishermen to experience directly the benefits of individual quotas and that was instrumental to the political agreement leading to the reform. It is important to note that the Chilean southern industrial pelagic fishery has average catches of over 1.4 million tons a year, making it one of the largest fisheries in the world to be regulated by individual quotas.","[Pena-Torres, Julio] Univ Alberto Hurtado, ILADES Georgetown, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Gomez-Lobo, Andres] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Barria, Patricio] Fisheries Dev Inst, Valparaiso, Chile",Universidad Alberto Hurtado; Universidad de Chile,"Peña-Torres, J (通讯作者)，Univ Alberto Hurtado, ILADES Georgetown, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",agomezlo@econ.uchile.cl; jpena@uahurtado.cl; pbarria@ifop.cl,,,,,,,15,24,25,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The model outperforms a random walk at short horizons and its superior forecastability appears to be robust over different sample spans. Our finding hinges on the fact that exchange rates tend to follow highly persistent trends and accordingly, the key to beating the random walk is to identify these trends. An attempt to link the trends in exchange rates to the underlying macroeconomic determinants further reveals that fundamentals-based linear models generally fail to capture the persistence in exchange rates and thus are incapable of outforecasting the random walk.

Yet in many cases a few powerful incumbents seem to capture most of the gains from the reform. In this paper, I construct a model with endogenous formation of special interest groups that could reap most of the benefits of financial liberalization. In particular, these groups lobby to limit entry by other firms, while taking advantage of improved borrowing opportunities. I then use the model to study the Mexican financial liberalization of 1988. Analysis of firm-level panel data on manufacturing plants reveals patterns suggested by the model. Specifically, large firms in more concentrated or more corrupt sectors benefit more from liberalization. In addition, domestically owned firms gain more than firms with foreign ownership. I also propose a new way to measure corruption at the industry level based on the Mexican 10% profit sharing rule.","[Mityakov, Sergey V.] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA",Clemson University,"Mityakov, SV (通讯作者)，Care of Walker JE, Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, 222 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",smityak@clemson.edu,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,8,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

China accounts for about half of the total GDP in Asia ex-Japan but over two-thirds of the region's total savings and current account surplus. One feature shared by all Asian economies is the surge in corporate savings over the past decade. Household saving rates, by contrast, have increased in China and India but declined sharply in Korea. Contrary to the popular characterization of China as relying on export-led growth, GDP growth in China has been dominated by investment growth.

This study examined SES, income, neighborhood disadvantage, and poverty-related stress as predictors of a wide range of psychological problems including anxiety, depression, aggression, relationship problems, physical problems, and trouble with the law. Longitudinal analyses were conducted with a low-income multiethnic sample of 98 families recruited from the greater Denver, CO metropolitan area (300 family members: 136 adults, 82 preadolescents, 82 adolescents) using hierarchical linear modeling to predict all eight ASEBA narrow band syndromes. Analyses showed that poverty-related stress was directly related to anxious/depressed symptoms and social problems and interacted with prior symptoms, contributing to worsening symptoms for delinquency, attention problems, somatic complaints, and anxious/depressed symptoms. Hollingshead SES also had direct predictive effects for certain syndromes, though these effects were in the opposite direction predicted. In contrast, lower income-to-needs predicted more problems as expected. Neighborhood disadvantage also predicted psychological syndromes. Developmental differences are discussed. Our data show that parents are not the only family members who are affected by stress from living in poverty.

It distinguishes field-level and farm-level impacts. During this five-year period yields rose by 18% overall, with greater increases among poor farmers with the least access to information. Insecticide sprayings dropped by 55%, although predation by non-target pests was rising. However shifting from the field to the historically-situated context of the farm recasts insect attacks as a symptom of larger problems in agricultural decision-making. Bt cotton's opponents have failed to recognize real benefits at the field level, while its backers have failed to recognize systemic problems that Bt cotton may exacerbate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Downward biased expected rates of return and discount rates allow managers to increase reported pension expenses and, for discount rates, allow managers to increase reported pension liabilities. We find that prior to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, both rates are downward biased when firms freeze their plans, whereas after SOX the bias is lower.

Because these protected areas limit agricultural development and exploitation of natural resources, they are frequently opposed in developing nations where reducing poverty is an important social objective. Conservation advocates argue that protected areas can alleviate poverty by supplying ecosystem services, promoting tourism and improving infrastructure. Thus 'win-win' scenarios may be possible in which ecosystems and their services are protected and poverty is alleviated. Previous studies (Andam et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105(42):16089-16094 2008; 2010) suggest that Costa Rica's protected area system reduced deforestation and alleviated poverty. We demonstrate that these environmental and social impacts were spatially heterogeneous. Importantly, the characteristics associated with the most avoided deforestation are the characteristics associated with the least poverty alleviation. In other words, the same characteristics that limited the conservation effectiveness of protected areas may have improved the social welfare impacts of these areas. These results suggest that 'win-win' efforts to protect ecosystems and alleviate poverty may be possible when policymakers are satisfied with low levels of each outcome, but tradeoffs exist when more of either outcome is desired.","[Ferraro, Paul J.; Hanauer, Merlin M.] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Hanauer, MM (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, POB 3992, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",pferraro@gsu.edu; mhanauer1@gsu.edu,"Ferraro, Paul/B-4435-2014","Ferraro, Paul/0000-0002-4777-5108",,,,,31,98,120,4,138,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Specifically, both a multivariate regime-switching Gaussian copula model and the asymmetric generalized dynamic conditional correlation (AG-DCC) approach are used to capture non-linear correlation dynamics during the period 1995-2006. The empirical evidence confirms a contagion effect from the crisis country to all others, for each of the examined financial crises. The results also suggest that emerging BRIC markets are more prone to financial contagion, while the industry-specific turmoil has a larger impact than country-specific crises. Our findings imply that policy responses to a crisis are unlikely to prevent the spread among countries, making fewer domestic risks internationally diversifiable when it is most desirable.

History left China with favorable initial conditions for rapid poverty reduction through market-led economic growth; at the outset of the reform process there were many distortions to be removed and a relatively low inequality of access to the opportunities so created, though inequality has risen markedly since. By concentrating such opportunities in the hands of the better off, prior inequalities in various dimensions handicapped poverty reduction in both Brazil and India. Brazil's recent success in complementing market-oriented reforms with progressive social policies has helped it achieve a higher proportionate rate of poverty reduction than India, although Brazil has been less successful in terms of economic growth. In the wake of its steep rise in inequality, China might learn from Brazil's success with such policies. India needs to do more to assure that poor people are able to participate in both the country's growth process and its social policies; here there are lessons from both China and Brazil.

The paper focuses primarily on the educational activities of local action groups, as education is one of the principles which is applied within the LEADER approach in the Czech Republic (every member state of European Union can involve its own defined principles among the general principles of the approach), and because the inhabitants of some regions are able to create and spread innovation thanks to the process of education, and they can therefore utilize the development potential of a particular region. The objective of the paper is to find out which types of educational activities (educational activities that promote regional and local identity of inhabitants, educational activities focused on managing of project documentation for development, and eventually others) are supported through the LEADER approach. In order to fulfill this objective, the secondary analysis of information which is available on the web pages of all local action groups which act in the Czech Republic is used. This is supported by information from a field survey which concerns educational activities for rural inhabitants, and which is still in progress.

Discrete event simulation is used to analyze the impact on waiting times and capacity utilization at potential hubs and at sea terminals. The hub scenarios under investigation are the organization of an intermodal barge hub on the right river bank, an intermodal hub on the left river bank, a first multihub scenario with a local collection/distribution network and a potentially improved multihub scenario taking into account the specific structure of the port of Antwerp. The second multihub scenario offers most opportunities for reducing the turnaround time of all inland terminals. All hub scenarios lead to important efficiency improvements in the handling of barges at sea terminals. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Caris, A.; Janssens, G.

In particular, it examines the evolution of the raspberry export sector in the context of Chile's non-traditional agricultural export boom, and considers its importance to smallholder growers and rural households in central Chile. The paper first outlines the geography and structural configuration of the global value chain for Chilean raspberries, and considers modes of governance and forms of coordination between key actors within the chain. Second, the terms and implications of smallholder grower participation in the value chain are explored in a discussion of access to key livelihoods assets. The paper concludes that institutional support to smallholders, even in the case of a crop that is widely seen to have a small-scale 'size bias', remains integral to their capacity to comply with required safety and quality standards and gain and retain market access via the value chain.","[Challies, Edward R.

We use an exogenous shock to the U.S. banking system during the Russian crisis of Fall 1998 to separate the effect of borrowers' demand of credit from the supply of credit by the banks. Firms that primarily relied on banks for capital suffered larger valuation losses during this period and subsequently experienced a higher decline in their capital expenditure and profitability as compared to firms that had access to the public-debt market. Consistent with an adverse shock to the supply of credit, crisis-affected banks decreased the quantity of their lending and increased loan interest rates in the post-crisis period significantly more than the unaffected banks. Our results suggest that the global integration of the financial sector can contribute to the propagation of financial shocks from one economy to another through the banking channel.

We show that if the purpose is to construct factors, the unit-exposure variance-analysis model can be viewed as just an algorithm that does not really assume a return-generating process; and in practice the effect of relaxing the restriction is immaterial. The restriction is more important if one wants to estimate whether, for a typical stock, the country factor generates more variance than the sector factor: exposure estimation becomes more important (i) the further the average exposures are from unity; or (ii) the higher the dispersion of the exposures. With respect to (i), the more important the corrections for sector (or geographical) structure in country (or sector) factors are, the more the average exposure falls below unity. Thus, the average exposure provides an alternative indicator of the importance of country versus sector effects. We empirically find that the average sector exposure is low (0.3) compared to the average country exposure (0.9). With respect to (ii) we correct the dispersion of exposures for estimation error in the exposures. We find that in our sample these estimation error corrections are more important for sector factors than for country factors, and that country factors are generating far more variance, in a typical stock's return, than do sector factors.

I focus on the public health sector and develop an argument of strategic compliance: corrupt recipient governments have incentives to comply with donor objectives but they will do so in aid sectors, in which compliance is cheap.

The international responsibility caused by the imposition and implementation of economic sanctions mainly results from the breach of the international law of human rights and humanitarian law. In the present paper, both descriptive and analytic methods are used; the descriptive method is used for explaining the obligations regarded to sanctions and the analytic one is used for analyzing the basis and consequences of international responsibility caused by economic sanctions.The main aim of this paper is the clarification of the aspects of this responsibility and how to enforce it in the international level. There are judicial and non-judicial methods to enforce the responsibility arising from economic sanctions.

To achieve this goal, a literature review and some interviews with experts were conducted. To recognize these major challenges in the execution of oil industry projects the results were categorized into nine-areas of project management knowledge. A questionnaire survey based on Husky project lifecycle was distributed within the selected case studies to find out relevant root-causes and to validate information gathered from the interviews. Consequently, a percentage of deficiencies were discovered through analyzing and categorizing the fmdings in the nine project knowledge areas. These were mapped with five-group project management processes in current Iranian oil, gas, and petrochemical industry lifecycle which three major criteria of Procurement, Risk, and Documentation Mismanagement are discovered.

This paper examines the long-run relationship between outward FDI and total factor productivity for a sample of 33 developing countries over the period from 1980 to 2005. Using panel co-integration techniques, we find that outward FDI has, on average, a robust positive long-run effect on total factor productivity in developing countries and that increased factor productivity is both a consequence and a cause of increased outward FDI.","Univ Wuppertal, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany",University of Wuppertal,"Herzer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Wuppertal, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, Gauaystr 20, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany.",herzer@wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de,,,,,,,43,65,69,3,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Predicting the stock market is very difficult since it depends on several unknown factors. The traditional prediction models are not able to achieve a satisfying prediction effect in the problem of a non-linear system and non stationary financial signal. On the other hand data preparation is an important step for complex data analysis and it has a huge impact on the success of prediction. In this paper we propose a fusion model of forecasting by combining wavelet as a data preparation tool, fuzzy logic and neural network. We have used Tehran stock market prices as a sample dataset to compare simulation error of stock market returns between the proposed models. The experimental results show that this fusion model achieves better forecasting accuracy than either of the models used separately.","[Homayouni, Nassim] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Zanjan Branch, Zanjan, Iran; [Amiri, Ali] Univ Zanjan, Dept Engn, Comp Engn Grp, Zanjan, Iran",Islamic Azad University; University Zanjan,"Homayouni, N (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Zanjan Branch, Zanjan, Iran.",nassim20021@yahoo.com,"Amiri, Ali/AAF-8693-2019",,,,,,12,9,9,0,3,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-07-1016-3,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,25.0,,,,,,277,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392893100054,0

Prior research covering Indian cross border mergers and acquisitions is limited to the service and this is expanded to cover seven sectors. The principal aim is to investigate the market reaction on the bidders' stock price and compare this to studies in mature markets relating to a similar time period. The second aim is to determine whether there are industry and locational effects relating to the target companies. An event study approach using both abnormal returns and price-pressure effect analyses is adopted and statistically significant results are obtained. The Value and Volume patterns surrounding the announcement of proposed M&As are examined conjointly, and both affirm of an information effect with price and pressure effects.

The key research question was to explore the impact of those elements on increasing students' competitiveness in the new economy. The research method was a survey realized during the 2008 on the sample of 653 students from the five faculties of the University of Novi Sad. The main findings of this research indicate that prevailing number of students are not satisfied with the quality of entrepreneurial education and thinks that they are not preparing enough for the entrepreneurship. Specifically, students underline the missing opportunities for participating in the projects and exercises which could educate them to implement their theoretical knowledge in creating innovative and competitive business project. Furthermore, they do not find enough positive entrepreneurial role models within university institutions. Finally, students have experienced the whole climate at the University as not open and not encouraging enough for accepting new ideas and innovations. Thus, the lack of stimulating students' creativity as a crucial factor of competitiveness is obvious. General conclusion of the research is that entrepreneurial education by its contents and methods does not meet the needs of entrepreneurial economy. The implications of those findings underline the necessity of changing the curricula of entrepreneurial education at the University of Novi Sad.

The study focuses on asset retirement obligations because, to date, under U.S. GAAP they are the sole performance obligation measured at fair value. The findings indicate that with a benchmark, managers tend to manage earnings less with fair value measurements than entity-specific measurements. In contrast, without a benchmark, managers tend to manage earnings irrespective of whether the obligation is measured using fair value or entity-specific value. Findings suggest that to the extent IFRS entity-specific measurements are associated with internally derived benchmarks, they may be more reliable than Level 3 fair value U.S. GAAP measurements that will not have benchmarks.","[McEwen, Ruth Ann] Florida Int Univ, Sch Accounting, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Mazza, Cheri R.] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, John F Welch Sch Business, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Hunton, James E.] Bentley Univ, Waltham, MA USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Bentley University,"McEwen, RA (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Sch Accounting, 11200 SW 8th St,RB 210, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",rmcewen@fiu.edu,,,,,,,31,1,1,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

This paper highlights the theoretical linkages between organisational learning and lean sustainability. It identifies points of intersection where organisational learning connects with the basic principles of lean, and where organisational learning contributes to sustainability of lean implementation. However, there has not been much research on organisational learning in New Zealand.

Pyrolysis transforms any cellulosic materials into i) a bio-oil similar to crude oil ii) a synthesis gas similar to natural gas, and iii) a bio-charcoal substance. The pyrolyzer machine is currently being manufactured and tested with various types of feedstocks including corn stover and energy sorghum. The economic analysis focused on creating an automated process that integrates a transportation logistics cost optimization model with geographic information system (GIS) data. The geographic data provides possible paths for the mobile bioenergy pyrolysis unit as it moves to and from each harvest area, depending on stochastic availability of feedstock (determined by historical crop yields) and distance to oil refineries. The results indicated that there is a low probability of a positive Net Present Value (NPV) with current economic conditions. In general, the NPV was highest with a stationary scenario and it decreased with additional moving times. A sensitivity analysis is presented to assess the potential probability of success of a mobile pyrolysis system under alternative oil prices and feedstock costs scenarios.","[Palma, Marco A.; Richardson, James W.; Roberson, Brad E.; Ribera, Luis A.; Outlaw, Joe] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Munster, Clyde] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Palma, MA (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 600 John Kimbrough Blvd,2124 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",mapalma@tamu.edu; jwrichardson@tamu.edu; beroberson1@gmail.com; lribera@tamu.edu; joutlaw@tamu.edu; c-munster@tamu.edu,"Cuadros, Renzo/B-8684-2012",,,,,,18,33,37,0,23,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The open archives. platform aims at making accessible available materials on web pages, using mutual sharing of metadata among repositories, their publishing and archiving. In the case of the above stated scientific and scholarly research journal's local archives version 2.0 of OAI-PMH (Open Archive Iniciative - Protocol for Metadata Harvesting) is used for metadata harvesting. This protocol defines the mechanism of the metadata's records. harvesting. It means that OAI-PMH provides a simple technical means to make metadata open to services based on widely-spread standards HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and XML (Extensible Markup Language). The service for the basic level of the metadata exchange provides support for unqualified DC (Dublin Core), e. g. the metadata format based on an international agreement defining 15 core elements for an easy description of the source objects. The architecture of open access content of the scientific and scholarly research journal's local archives itself determines two logical roles - the role of the data provider and the one of the service provider. The Czech University of Life Sciences Prague as the data provider controls the data store of the scientific and scholarly research journal and makes accessible source objects stored in the local archives via their display for metadata harvesting by the service provider.

These procedures are valid only if the residuals are correlated either across time or across firms, but not across both. This paper shows that it is very easy to calculate standard errors that are robust to simultaneous correlation along two dimensions, such as firms and time. The covariance estimator is equal to the estimator that clusters by firm, plus the estimator that clusters by time, minus the usual heteroskedasticity-robust ordinary least squares (OLS) covariance matrix. Any statistical package with a clustering command can be used to easily calculate these standard errors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although price volatility is a normal feature of markets given the seasonal production cycle and discontinuity of supply in the face of a continuing demand, a greater uncertainty of a rapidly changing economic and natural environment contributes to and magnifies its occurrence. This chapter focuses on the main challenges of price volatility in agricultural commodity markets. We start by briefly touching upon the theoretical aspects of volatility, followed by a comparison of international and European markets to identify whether one was more affected than the other by increases in price volatility. Factors, implications and preliminary policy considerations of increased volatility follow before initial conclusions on future prospects are drawn.","[Tothova, Monika] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Agr & Rural Dev, Brussels, Belgium",,"Tothova, M (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Directorate Gen Agr & Rural Dev, Brussels, Belgium.",monika.tothova@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,9,18,21,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-7633-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,13,29,,10.1007/978-1-4419-7634-5-2,0.0,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BH1BB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000397483900002,0

The economic sustainability of the South African wine industry is found to be highly dependent on its trading performance, with more than 40 percent of production consistently being exported since 2005. The views and opinions of South African wine executives through the Wine Executive Surveys of 2005 and 2008 are used to identify, describe and explain these competitiveness trends and to qualitatively comment on factors impacting on performance. The Porter Diamond is applied to derive the most important industry determinants of competitive performance.

The system of agricultural insurance is usually considered as an important component of agricultural policy. That is very significant for the crop insurance system in the USA. Various approaches to agricultural insurance have been applied in the countries within the European Union. There are compulsory systems of agricultural insurance, various cooperation between the private and public sectors in agricultural insurance or reinsurance or solely on a private basis offered insurances. The differences in risk management for agriculture arise from the different natural conditions for agriculture in various European countries. The OECD is engaged in the monitoring of risk management in agriculture and the role of state intervention in this connection. Agricultural risks are divided into normal, marketable and catastrophic. State intervention is desirable in the case of catastrophic risk, justified in supporting the development of market of risks and counterproductive when attempting to limit impacts of normal risks. The subsidisation of agricultural insurance is required because of the higher risk in agriculture compared to other business sectors and by the necessity of maintaining rural viability and continuous agricultural production as well. Similar conditions of insurance protection are essential for the comparative competitiveness of agricultural producers from different countries. The paper compares the situation in the Czech Republic and other selected countries and tries to evaluate it and to outline some possibilities for its future development.","Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Vilhelm, V (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 1453-75, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic.",vilhelm.vaclav@uzei.cz,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,179,186,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100018,0

Moreover, agency competence is lower when (4) loyalty is important but the time horizon is short, and (5) outside opportunities improve but the time horizon is long.

The consequence of unbalanced development is the limited capacity of labour markets to absorb the workforce. Therefore, rural migrants in urban areas had no choice but to open small businesses, despite having few financial and technological resources.","Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Seoul 130701, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Yun, JW (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 1 Hoegi Dong, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",jiwhanyun@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,9,9,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Prior research shows that people predict women to be more risk averse than men, a result we confirm. We investigate whether differences in physical prowess underlie actual and perceived gender differences, a hypothesis suggested by both evolutionary and economic theories. Overall we find that perceptions of others' risk attitudes reflect stereotypes about gender and strength but tend to exaggerate the underlying relationships. Physically stronger and taller people and those perceived as attractive are predicted to be more risk tolerant, while women are perceived to be more risk averse. The impact of gender and physical prowess measures on actual gamble choices is much weaker. Sources of prediction bias are examined, showing that specific characteristics of the target and predictor lead to systematic over-prediction or under-prediction of risk aversion.","[Eckel, Catherine C.] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Ball, Sheryl] Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Heracleous, Maria] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Cyprus,"Eckel, CC (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, GR31, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",eckelc@utdallas.edu,"Eckel, Catherine/AAF-2268-2020","Eckel, Catherine/0000-0003-1583-5214",,,,,49,35,40,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

In this paper, we examine the decision of firms to participate in the VCR, the extent of their involvement, and then ask if greenhouse gas emissions are related to past VCR participation. As an information provision program, we find evidence that firms may participate in VCR to signal their environmental responsibility to regulators and to some extent investors, but not to consumers. We also find that past involvement in the VCR is a strong and significant determinant of current involvement in the registry. Greenhouse gas emissions reported to the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program in 2004, however, do not appear to be different between VCR reporters and non-reporters. GHG emissions are observed to be significantly lower among firms that are smaller, emit fewer toxic releases, use more renewable energy sources, are intermediate good producers, and are located in Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba.","[Harrington, Donna Ramirez] Univ Vermont, Dept Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Brouhle, Keith] Grinnell Coll, Dept Econ, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA",University of Vermont,"Harrington, DR (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Dept Econ, 233 Old Mill Bldg,94 Univ Pl, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",djramire@uvm.edu,,,,,,,43,14,14,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Indeed, recognition of this influence is codified in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which allows exceptions to treaty obligations for measures relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources, motivates the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, and underlies the Convention on Biological Diversity. Trade impacts operate through several channels. Trade liberalization changes relative prices, which affects exploitation incentives. Trade can also have broader effects, such as impacts on labor markets and incomes, which may affect demand for resource-intensive products-or for ecosystem services. Trade interacts with, and can influence, the institutions governing the management of natural resources. Finally, trade can also introduce threats to ecosystems, in the form of invasive species. All of these potential impacts pose special challenges for the conservation of renewable resources, which inherently involves dynamic economic and ecological processes.

After DBRS certification, bond yields change in the direction implied by the firm's DBRS rating relative to its ratings from other certified rating agencies. A one-notch-higher DBRS rating corresponds to a 39-basis-point reduction in a firm's debt cost of capital. The impact on yields is driven by cases where the DBRS rating is better than other ratings and is larger among bonds rated near the investment-grade cutoff. These findings indicate that ratings-based regulations on bond investment affect a firm's cost of debt capital.","[Kisgen, Darren J.] Boston Coll, Sch Management, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Strahan, Philip E.] Boston Coll, Wharton Financial Inst Ctr, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Strahan, Philip E.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston College; Boston College; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kisgen, DJ (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Sch Management, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",kisgen@bc.edu; strahan@bc.edu,,,,,,,26,152,178,3,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Multivariate cross-sectional analyses show a significant relation between a fund's performance and its asset composition: the higher the difference in the percentage of assets invested in convertible bonds compared to the percentage invested in stocks, the higher the performance, on average. We show that this result can be explained by factors associated with investment opportunities in the convertible-bond market and trading strategies related to convertible arbitrage, as typically performed by hedge funds. Overall, convertible-bond fund performance measured by alpha is comparable to a passive investment in stocks, bonds, and convertible bonds.

This paper critically evaluates the consequences of this policy in terms of a three-sector Harris-Todaro type general equilibrium model characterizing a typical developing economy. It finds that agriculture and SEZ can grow simultaneously provided the government spends a substantial amount of its resources on irrigation projects and other infrastructural development designed at improving the efficiency of land. Agricultural wage and aggregate employment in the economy may also improve owing to this policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We propose that the negative reaction to category spanning also depends on another mechanism: widespread category spanning lowers categorical contrast-the sharpness of a category's boundaries. Lowered contrast blurs boundaries among categories due to the impairment of the comparison processes underlying evaluations and the growing disagreement about the meaning of the category. These processes lower the appeal of all products in a category and make it problematic for any offer to receive widespread acclaim. By making boundaries less salient, reduced contrast also lowers the advantages of category specialism. These propositions receive support in an analysis of style categories and ratings of Barolos and Barbarescos, elite Italian wines.","[Negro, Giacomo] Emory Univ, Sch Business, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Hannan, Michael T.; Rao, Hayagreeva] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Emory University; Stanford University,"Negro, G (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Sch Business, 1300 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",giacomo_negro@bus.emory.edu; hannan@stanford.edu; hrao@gsb.stanford.edu,,,,,,,40,125,146,1,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Despite some debate, the somatic marker framework is still providing a unique neuroanatomical and cognitive framework that helps explain the role of emotion in decision-making. In this article, we review the neurological background, core mechanisms, and critiques of the somatic marker theory, put into perspective conceptually related approaches that link emotion to decision-making, and present an outlook for future neuroeconomics research.

Theoretically, this contract is more efficient than share tenancy or fixed-rent contract in terms of provision of incentives and risk-sharing, and thus raises the question of why such an efficient contract was uncommon outside Japan. We argue that transaction costs on the execution of rent reduction were the key element in the adoption of this contract. In prewar Japan, local communities played some role in governing the process of rent reduction and mitigated such costs. Thus the study proposes transaction costs and institutions as additional determinant of tenancy contract choice. We also find that higher prevalence of tenancy was associated with lower average rice yield at the prefectural level and such correlation was stronger in prefectures with a greater proportion of share tenancy.","[Arimoto, Yutaka] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan; [Okazaki, Tetsuji] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakabayashi, Masaki] Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Arimoto, Y (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Nakabayashi, Masaki/AAM-4041-2020","Nakabayashi, Masaki/0000-0003-1096-1350",,,,,63,6,6,2,24,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Using a standard new Keynesian business cycle model, this paper analyzes the behavior of a central bank that conducts policy under discretion while fearing that its model is misspecified. The main results are as follows. First, policy performance can be improved if the discretionary central bank implements a robust policy. This important result is obtained because the central bank's desire for robustness directs it to assertively stabilize inflation, thereby mitigating the stabilization bias associated with discretionary policymaking. Second, the central bank's fear of model misspecification leads it to forecast future outcomes under the belief that inflation (in particular) will be persistent and have large unconditional variance, raising the probability of extreme outcomes. Private agents, however, anticipating the policy response, make decisions under the belief that inflation will be more closely stabilized, that is, more tightly distributed, than under rational expectations. Finally, as a technical contribution, the paper shows how to solve with robustness an important class of linear-quadratic decision problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In light of the most recent theoretical and empirical evidence on this topic, we attempt to clarify some of the confusion that surrounds the heated debated on school choice by showing that its impact depends crucially on a number of key institutional features. After briefly describing the rules that govern the allocation of students to public and private schools in France, we provide an overview of the multiplicity of school choice policies around the world. We then discuss the potential costs and benefits of such policies and insist on the importance of several institutional parameters in determining their success or failure in terms of efficiency and equity. Based on the lessons that can be drawn from existing empirical evaluations of school choice reforms, we conclude with a number of suggestions regarding the future of school choice in France.","[Fack, Gabrielle] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Fack, Gabrielle] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Grenet, Julien] Ecole Econ Paris, CNRS, UMR Paris Jourdan Sci Econ 8545, F-75014 Paris, France",Pompeu Fabra University; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Paris School of Economics,"Fack, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Jaume 1 Bldg,Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",gabrielle.fack@upf.edu; julien.grenet@ens.fr,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,64,4,4,1,16,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Loadings on UMO incrementally predict the cross-section of returns on both portfolios and individual stocks, even among firms not recently involved in external financing activities. Further evidence suggests that UMO loadings proxy for the common component of a stock's misvaluation.","[Hirshleifer, David] Univ Calif Irvine, Paul Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Jiang, Danling] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Hirshleifer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Paul Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",david.h@uci.edu; djiang@cob.fsu.edu,"Hirshleifer, David/E-4342-2012; Jiang, Danling/K-4424-2013","Hirshleifer, David/0000-0003-0280-8882; Jiang, Danling/0000-0001-5104-6023",,,,,69,70,85,4,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

This paper's objective is to review the evidence and possible explanations for the flattening of the Phillips curve in the context of new-Keynesian economic theory. Using data for the United States and Australia, we find that the flattening is evident in the baseline 'structural' new-Keynesian Phillips curve.

Recent studies (e.g., Stiroh and Rumble, 2006) show that increasing OBS activities does not necessarily yield straightforward diversification benefits for banks. However, introducing a risk premium in the standard banks returns models, and resorting to an ARCH-M procedure, Canadian data suggest that banks risk-return trade-off displays a structural break around 1997. In the second subperiod of our sample (1997-2007), we find that the noninterest income generated by OBS activities no longer impacts banks returns negatively. While during the first period (1988-1996) the volatility variable is not significant in any returns equations, a risk premium eventually emerges, pricing the risk associated to OBS activities.

Our tests show that the use of terms that are contingent on an issuer's future performance increases with issuer risk. Among issuers with poorer stock performance, higher cash burn rates, and more uncertain investment prospects, purchase discount-only contracts are uncommon and contracts with contingent terms are frequently used.

This paper investigates these theories by tracking hedge fund managers herding behavior over their careers. I first examine managerial incentives for herding, and show that more senior managers that deviate from the herd have a significantly higher probability of failure and do not experience higher fund inflows than their less-senior counterparts. These implicit incentives should encourage managers to herd more as their careers progress. I find strong support for this hypothesis: using a number of proxies for herding. I show that more experienced managers herd more than less-experienced managers. Finally, I examine performance differences between more and less-experienced managers, and find that while more experienced managers underperform less-experienced managers, this under-performance does not appear to be caused by differences in herding. Overall, these results are in direct contrast with studies of mutual fund managers, reflecting important difference in implicit incentives between the two industries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that aggregate mortality risk is also a key determinant for individual annuitization decisions. Aggregate mortality risk appears to be a risk very difficult to transfer for individuals. Whether its existence leads to a higher or lower annuity demand depends on objective factors (e.g., insurers' vulnerability to aggregate mortality changes). Subjective factors (i.e., individuals' preferences) determine only the intensity of the annuity demand reaction to aggregate mortality risk. Our results are of significant importance not only for financial planning approaches of individual annuity buyers but also for strategic decisions in insurance companies and for solvency regulators. Furthermore, consideration of aggregate mortality risk may alleviate, but also intensify, the annuity puzzle.","[Schulze, Roman N.; Post, Thomas] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Schulze, RN (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.",tpost@wiwi.hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,62,14,14,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Business managers coordinated functions and corporate managers allocated resources. This article studies the impact of corporate management on capital allocation decisions by comparing investment behavior in multi- and single-business companies. Using a new taxonomy to control for the quality of each business unit, we analyze a cross-sectional sample of U.S. companies and identify a number of empirical regularities that highlight the allocative decisions of corporate management. In particular, we find that, when dealing with cash-needy businesses, multi-business firms invest more intensively in those that are less profitable. We find no evidence that this subsidy results in a higher success rate in making those businesses profitable over time.

In contrast, many have argued that further advances in transportation and communication have made vertical integration obsolete in recent years, replacing it with modularity, outsourcing, and networking. This article unpacks this apparent puzzle by regarding technological improvements in transportation and communication as theoretically neutral with respect to the degree of vertical integration. We argue that the key concepts and issues in supply chain management that Chandler highlighted remain highly relevant today. We integrate Chandler's detailed historical perspective on the evolution of the visible hand of managerial governance with more recent theories from organization economics and from engineering, yielding the following insights. First, aligning incentives of buyers and suppliers is important in achieving throughput and assured supply, but asset ownership is neither necessary nor sufficient for this. Second, vertical integration (and disintegration) decisions affect the internal operation of the firm and its future path. Third, firms need to design their value chains in such a way as to achieve coordination without information overload. The article demonstrates the continuing power of these insights in three phases over the last century. In the first phase (with the rise of mass production), Chandler himself noted a subtle array of make-and-buy decisions. In the second phase (with the rise of lean production), several varieties of non-integration (e.g. exit vs. voice) persisted because of the specific ways in which firms combined incentive alignment and information flow. In the third (New Economy) phase, management of information and material flows through the supply chain remains an important source of competitive advantage. In particular, disintermediation as a form of vertical integration, and successful outsourcing require investment in technical expertise over a wide range of technological fields and coordination of knowledge to manage suppliers (see for example, Brusoni and Prencipe, 2001; Brusoni, 2003; Clark and Fujimoto, 1991). By noting that neither externalization through outsourcing nor flattening of managerial hierarchy is the same as decentralization, the article provides theoretical and empirical bases for the continuing importance of Chandler's principles in managing supply chains.","[Helper, Susan] Case Western Reserve Univ, Weatherhead Sch Management, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Sako, Mari] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 1HP, England",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; University of Oxford,"Helper, S (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Weatherhead Sch Management, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",susan.helper@case.edu; mari.sako@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,89,27,30,1,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Based on a rational partisan perspective and policy-induced campaign contribution models, we expect that once in office, ideologically different parties deliver favorable policies to different industries in order to enrich their electoral and sector-specific supporters. Using daily stock market data, we empirically evaluate whether and how the mean and the volatility of returns to four important economic sectors covaried with the electoral prospects of a right-/left-leaning coalition in Germany from 1991 to 2005. This sheds light on the magnitude of sector-specific redistribution to be expected from ideologically different governments holding office. The results show that the mean and the volatility of defense and pharmaceutical sector returns increase if a right-leaning government is becoming more likely to win the upcoming election. In contrast, an increase in the probability of a left-leaning government triggers higher returns to the alternative energy sector and increases the volatility of consumer sector returns. Thus, our estimates partly support the idea that parties redistribute across sectors.","[Bechtel, Michael M.] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Fuess, Roland] Int Univ Schloss Reichartshausen, EBS, D-65375 Oestrich Winkel, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; European Business School (EBS) University,"Bechtel, MM (通讯作者)，ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, WEC C 25,Weinbergstr 11, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",michael.bechtel@ir.gess.ethz.ch; roland.fuess@ebs.edu,"Bechtel, Michael M./T-9309-2019","Bechtel, Michael M./0000-0002-6080-5367",,,,,70,13,13,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Its provision may increase the likelihood that the elderly, the vast majority of which are homeowners, can live independently and maintain their desired residential status even if in relatively poor health. We provide empirical evidence on the extent to which home health care benefits affect the housing and living arrangements of the elderly by examining plausibly exogenous changes in the supply of long-term care insurance through the Medicare program that occurred in the late 1990s. Prior to 1997, Medicare reimbursed home health care agencies on a retrospective-cost basis. Then, starting in October, 1997, as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA97), Medicare switched to a system of prospective payments for home health care, which induced state-by-calendar-year variation in the supply of this type of insurance. We exploit this variation to econometrically identify the short-run impact on the housing and living arrangements of the elderly, using CPS data from 1995 to 2000 (before and after the law change). Our estimates indicate that living arrangements are quite responsive to home health care benefits for the widowed, but not for the married elderly. The estimated elasticity of shared living to benefits is -0.9 for the widowed. However, these benefits have little impact on homeownership, at least in the short run, which suggests that the moderately adverse health events toward which public home health care benefits are targeted are not those that drive housing mobility and tenure transitions at advanced ages.

The idea is simple. Cities are dense areas where singles can meet more potential partners than in rural areas. To enjoy those benefits, they are willing to pay a premium in terms of higher housing prices. Once married, the benefits from meeting more potential partners vanish and married couples move out of the city. Attractive singles benefit most from a dense market and are therefore more likely to move to the city. Those predictions are tested and confirmed with a unique Danish data set. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It examines whether, in the light of EMU, the OCA theory may be considered as a relevant framework for assessing the functioning of a monetary union as well as the costs and benefits which ensue from it for its member countries. To this aim, both the traditional approach of OCA (based on the quest for optimality criteria) and the endogeneity approach (according to which a monetary union will endogenously become an optimal currency area) are considered. It appears that the first approach may be of limited scope if we would like to use it so as to assess the role played by asymmetries in the functioning of a monetary union. Moreover, only moderate evidence is found that EMU is endogenously turning into an optimum currency area.","Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux IV, CNRS, UMR 5113, GREThA, F-33608 Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Sénégas, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux IV, CNRS, UMR 5113, GREThA, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",senegas@u-bordeaux4.fr,,,,,,,158,1,1,2,29,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Upstream Kyrgyzstan controls the Toktogul reservoir which generates hydropower demanded mainly in winter for heating. Downstream Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan need irrigation water in summer, primarily to grow an export crop (cotton). Regional agreements obliging Kyrgyzstan to higher summer discharges in exchange for fossil fuel transfers from downstream riparians in winter have been unsuccessful, due to lack of trust between the parties. Striving for self-sufficiency in irrigation water, Uzbekistan initiated new reservoir construction. This paper examines their economic impact. We report a laboratory experiment modelling the Syr Darya scenario as a multi-round, three-player trust game with non-binding contracts. Payoff schemes are estimated using real-life data. While basinwide efficiency maximisation requires regional cooperation, our results demonstrate that cooperation in the laboratory is hard to achieve. Uzbek reservoirs improve cooperation only weakly and their positive impact is limited to low-water years.","[Abbink, Klaus] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Econometr, CREED, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Moller, Lars Christian] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [O'Hara, Sarah] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Amsterdam; The World Bank; University of Nottingham,"Abbink, K (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Econometr, CREED, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.abbink@uva.nl; lmoller@worldbank.org; sarah.o'hara@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Abbink, Klaus/0000-0003-4436-604X",,,,,49,16,21,3,55,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Although this approach has become popular in environmental negotiations, little is known about the characteristics of the outcomes that are reached. In this paper, we employ an Edgeworth box framework to investigate the nature of bargaining over public goods (environmental policies) that have multiple attributes. We then design and conduct laboratory experiments within this framework to test whether negotiated outcomes satisfy standard axiomatic bargaining predictions under a variety of conditions. Specifically, we test whether two parties with Pareto inefficient endowments of two goods will trade to Pareto improving and Pareto efficient outcomes, and to the Nash bargain in particular. We vary whether the Nash bargain coincides with or diverges from the outcome that maximizes the joint payoff, or the outcome that equalizes payoffs, and whether subjects are provided full or partial information. We find that bargainers reach Pareto improving and efficient outcomes across treatments, but withdraw support for the Nash bargain when it generates unequal payments or when payoff information is private. We conclude that this experimental framework offers a promising method for studying multi-attribute negotiations.","[Bruce, Christopher] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Clark, Jeremy] Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Christchurch 8020, New Zealand",University of Calgary; University of Canterbury,"Bruce, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",cjbruce@ucalgary.ca; jeremy.clark@canterbury.ac.nz,,,,,,,31,3,3,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Combining delivers statistically and economically significant out-of-sample gains relative to the historical average consistently over time.

First, we construct annual coexceedance probabilities for both lower and upper tail return quantiles using daily data from 1974-2006. Next, we explain these probabilities in a panel gravity model framework. Results show that macroeconomic variables asymmetrically impact stock market comovement across the return distribution. Financial liberalization significantly increases left tail comovement, whereas trade integration significantly increases comovement across all quantiles. Decreasing exchange rate volatility results in increasing lower tail comovement. The introduction of the euro increases comovement across the entire return distribution, thereby significantly reducing the benefits of portfolio diversification within the euro area.

Can debt relief foster their growth rates? To answer these important questions, this article looks at how the debt-growth relation varies with indebtedness levels, as well as with the quality of policies and institutions, in a panel of developing countries. The main findings are that, in countries with good policies and institutions, there is evidence of debt overhang when the net present value of debt rises above 20-25 percent of GDP; however, debt becomes irrelevant above 70-80 percent. In countries with bad policies and institutions, thresholds appear to be lower, but the evidence of debt overhang is weaker and we cannot rule out that debt is always irrelevant. Indeed, in such countries, as well as in countries with high indebtedness levels, investment does not depend on debt levels. The analysis suggests that not all countries are likely to profit from debt relief and thus that a one-size-fits-all debt relief approach might not be the most appropriate one.

Most of our focus on property tax concerns the effects of property tax on housing price under the new property tax reform. To answer this question, we conduct an empirical work with a sample of 30 provinces in China from 1999 to 2008 and test the data upon its econometric models. We find that some other factors such as interest rate, public expenditure, anticipated housing price growth and risk premium of investors, as well as property tax, are testified to act upon housing price. Results from the empirical analysis are consistent with findings from the previous theoretical proposition, suggesting that negative effect of property tax on housing price is approved to exist in the form of hysteresis and interest rate has the most significant effect on housing price. In addition, the increase population seems not to give upward pressure on housing price in urban area.","[Diao, Linlin] Renmin Univ China, Dept Land Management, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,linlin1113@163.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,11,CHINA ARCHITECTURE & BUILDING PRESS,BEIJING,"BAIWANZHUANG XICHENGGU, BEIJING, 10037, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-112-12328-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,215,232,,,,,,18,Economics; Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,BRM62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283112400016,0

We then examine how the EVI has been designed and how it can be used to compare SIDS and LDCs.

This study also finds a positive correlation between the number of importers in the same region, regardless of their industry affiliation, and the probability of importing intermediate inputs.

The expansion of Europe's overseas empires and the transitions to capitalism within Europe were differentiated moments within the geographical expansion of commodity production and exchange - what I call the commodity frontier. This essay is developed in two movements. Beginning with a conceptual and methodological recasting of the historical geography of the rise of capitalism, I offer an analytical narrative that follows the early modern diaspora of silver. This account follows the political ecology of silver production and trade from the Andes to Spain in Braudel's 'second' sixteenth century (c. 1545-1648). In highlighting the Ibero-American moment of this process in the present essay, I contend that the spectacular reorganization of Andean space and the progressive dilapidation of Spain's real economy not only signified the rise and demise of a trans-Atlantic, Iberian ecological regime, but also generated the historically necessary conditions for the unprecedented concentration of accumulation and commodity production in the capitalist North Atlantic in the centuries that followed.","Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Moore, JW (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Solvegatan 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",jasonwsmoore@gmail.com,,"Moore, Jason W./0000-0002-7237-9895",,,,,173,84,97,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We present the results of a detailed scenario-based investigation illustrating the differences between experience, composition and basis, impact and constraints on the application of water charges for both regions.

It was anticipated that firm conduct or behavior would be fairly homogeneous because the ethanol industry was in Stage II of the industry life-cycle, and societal support for ethanol production resulted in large volumes of publicly available information about technology and markets. Age of facility, size of facility, and type of ownership jointly explained a limited number of differences in responses across ethanol facilities, thus supporting the concept of fairly homogeneous conduct or behavior.","[Schmidgall, Timothy J.; Tudor, Kerry W.; Spaulding, Aslihan D.; Winter, J.

When behaving oligopolistically, an offering company influences the market demand and offer of the entire sector and therefore, while choosing an offer on the market, it has to count - besides the demand - also with the reaction of its competitor to its choice; at the same time it itself reacts to the choice of its competitors. The text of this article deals with oligopolistic competition on the food market in terms of behaviour of grocery producers and with the impact of this competition upon market competition in the sector. First, it analyzes agreements on common cooperation and procedure, when cartel market structure originates, using an example of baking companies that agreed on rising the prices of bread, pastry and confectionery by their customers. It also analyzes similar examples of contracting (collusive) oligopoly on the market with products in agrarian sector. The goal of this paper is to find out whether collusive oligopolies arise in the food-products market. We also investigate in what scale the cartel agreements appear in this sector and whether they can significantly influence the price level of food products and therefore have an important impact on consumer demand in the Czech Republic. The main research methods used are: the method of description (a description of single cases of cartel agreements) and mathematical methods in economy (used for modelling of the maximum profit of a collusive oligopoly). We show that although a substantial part of agriculture production arises outside of the oligopolistic structures (in conditions of monopolistic competition among small agricultural producers), trade in these products mainly occurs within oligopolitic sectors.","[Severova, Lucie; Sredl, Karel] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ Theories, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Severová, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ Theories, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",severova@pef.czu.cz; sredl@pef.czu.cz,"Šrédl, Karel/J-2521-2017; Severová, Lucie/J-2548-2017",,,,,,8,1,1,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,133,143,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600016,0

It is found that the risk perception of the employees for the shares of their own company as well as the indirect investment in equity shares is relatively lower than the risk perception for the shares of the companies other than their own companies. It was also found that there is lower degree of correlation among the risk perception for the shares of their own company, shares of other company and indirect investment in equity shares which means that risk perception with respect to one share is not influencing the risk perception for other shares.","[Singh, Ranjit] Assam Univ, Dept Business Adm, Accounting & Finance Area, A Cent Univ, Silchar 788011, Assam, India",Assam University,"Singh, R (通讯作者)，Assam Univ, Dept Business Adm, Accounting & Finance Area, A Cent Univ, Silchar 788011, Assam, India.",look_for_ranjit@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,24,13,13,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The two datasets that are used in particular are the General Household Survey, an annual household survey that began in 2002, and the Income and Expenditure Survey of 2005/06. Because these surveys are not designed for the analysis of household-level food security, it is not possible to do the kind of detailed analysis made possible by purpose-designed surveys. However these datasets have some value in respect of understanding food security, namely: large sample sizes; the depth of complementary types of information that assist in contextualising the experience of food insecurity and, in the case of the General Household Survey, regularity. Among the findings are a decline in the experience of hunger during the period 2002-2007, and significantly lower food expenditure per capita in rural areas, suggesting a greater extent of 'self-provisioning' than is commonly assumed.","Univ Western Cape, PLAAS Inst Poverty Land & Angrarian Studies, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"Aliber, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Cape, PLAAS Inst Poverty Land & Angrarian Studies, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.",maliber@uwc.ac.za,,"Aliber, Michael/0000-0001-8739-0379",,,,,26,90,103,1,13,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,,,AGREKON,Agrekon,DEC,2009,48.0,4,,,,,384,409,,10.1080/03031853.2009.9523833,0.0,,,26,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,586UM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276939000003,0

First, income shifting is examined by estimating the relationship between U.S. affiliate profit rates and foreign country tax rates.

This paper introduces decreasing relative impatience, which is directly related to the degree of convexity of the discount function. By giving empirical meaning to the convexity of the discount function this paper clarifies the relations between several concepts in intertemporal choice. This paper also introduces a concept of spread seeking. Spread seeking and decreasing relative impatience are likely to have distinct underlying psychological motives, but are shown to be equivalent under discounted utility. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The interaction between incentive provision and learning creates an intertemporal source of disagreement risk that alters optimal risk sharing. There is an endogenous regime shift between economies with small and large belief differences, and an early shock to beliefs can lead to large persistent differences in variable pay even after beliefs have converged.

U.S. trade policy since 1934 provides a prime example, especially antidumping law and its evolution.","[Zanardi, Maurizio] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Anderson, James E.] Boston Coll, Boston, MA USA; [Anderson, James E.] NBER, Boston, MA USA",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Boston College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Zanardi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium.",mzanardi@ulb.ac.be,,"Zanardi, Maurizio/0000-0003-1713-1034",,,,,26,5,6,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2009,141.0,1-2,,,,,129,150,,10.1007/s11127-009-9441-z,0.0,,,22,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,485VG,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269152300010,0

Bilateral aid influences migration by enhancing the information about labor market conditions in the destination country (attraction effect). Total aid correlates with migration through increasing expenditure financing and hence, wages in countries of origin (push effect). We compute the critical level of income above which emigration and income are substitutes, which is about US $7,300 per capita in PPP 2000 prices, for example, Brazil or Russia. We argue that for countries below this threshold, there is a trade-off between aid and migration policies. A tightening of the migration policy is equivalent to a reduction of the level of aid by about 24%. A comparison of skilled and unskilled migrations shows that the former are more sensitive to the attraction effect than the latter. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The model allows the investor to make a decision on whether and when information should be gathered, and allows a purchase decision based on the information. With this investor's decision-making process in mind, firms price their IPOs to maximize their payoffs by trying to avoid an IPO failure and by assessing the investor's possible post-search Outcomes. While the model provides implications to the general IPO puzzle, the results seem particularly relevant for explaining the pricing of REIT IPOs, MLP IPOs, and mutual fund IPOs.

A novel dataset put together from credit dossiers of large corporate loan applicants enables us to observe the information collected by loan officers, and how it is used by the ultimate loan approving officer. We find that greater hierarchical/geographical distance between the information collecting agent and the loan approving officer leads to less reliance on subjective information and more on objective information. By exploiting nonlinearities in the assignment rules that determine an applicant's hierarchical distance, and using information collecting agent fixed effects, we show that our result cannot be driven by endogenous assignment of applicants. We also find that higher frequency of interactions between the information collecting agent and loan approving officer, both over time and through geographical proximity, helps mitigate the effects of hierarchical distance on information use. Our results show that hierarchical distance influences information use, and highlights the importance of human touch in communication.","[Liberti, Jose M.] Depaul Univ, Charles H Kellstadt Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Mian, Atif R.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Mian, Atif R.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",DePaul University; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Liberti, JM (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, Charles H Kellstadt Grad Sch Business, 1 E Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",jliberti@depaul.edu,"Mian, Atif/JGM-2094-2023",,,,,,18,197,221,2,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Intriguingly, the economic importance of current account variations in accounting for the real estate valuation exceeds that of the other variables, including the real interest rate and inflation.

Several developments played a role, including the proliferation of complex mortgage-backed securities and derivatives with highly opaque structures, high leverage, and inadequate risk management. These, in turn, created systemic risk-that is, the risk that a triggering event, such as the failure of a large financial firm, will seriously impair financial markets and harm the broader economy. This article examines the role of systemic risk in the recent financial crisis. Systemic concerns prompted the Federal Reserve and U.S. Department of the Treasury to act to prevent the bankruptcy of several large financial firms in 2008. The authors explain why the failures of financial firms are more likely to pose systemic risks than the failures of nonfinancial firms and discuss possible remedies for such risks. They conclude that the economy could benefit from reforms that reduce systemic risks, Such as the creation of an improved regime for resolving failures of large financial firms.

What is the role of the incentives in improving the innovative performance of an economy by matching partially motivated public researchers to their mission? Sometimes government-funded research projects are mission-directed, and yet in many cases the public sector academics indulge in carrier-driven research. An innovation system where, as in the United States, basic research is also driven by patents implicitly sets an ex-post incentive to the researchers guided by invisible hand. For a public innovation system - like the European one - designing an incentive scheme to motivate public researchers is of key importance for fostering the performance of the economic system. This paper extends the Schumpeterian multisector growth model with vertical innovation by highlighting a link between the degree of 'targetness' of public research and aggregate innovation.

For a variety of reasons, spatial dependence is very likely present in and across these counts. In order to identify the nature of these unobserved relationships, this study provides the first application of a feasible generalized spatial 3SLS estimation procedure for a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model with two spatial processes. Statistical tests reveal that this more generalized model is superior to its constrained versions (e.g., SUR models without spatial components or with just a spatial lag or spatial error process). In the resulting model of Austin, Texas data, local land-use conditions offer substantial predictive power of household and job densities, and transportation access plays a role, as anticipated. The work demonstrates that SUR estimation of land-use intensities from parcel-level data with two types of spatial dependence is feasible and meaningful. Coupled with an upstream model of land-use type, this work offers key inputs for travel demand analyses, with transportation system performance feedback.

Our experiment informs decision making in social environments that include differing levels of competitive pressure. We find that competitive pressure significantly mitigates pro-sociality in boys, while it does not affect girls' propensities to make fair decisions.

We find that the effects of the knowledge-sourcing strategies differ significantly across innovation types (product or process innovation).

This dual role and opposed incentive structure of internal R&D create a significant question for both theory and R&D policy: Is internal R&D a complement or substitute for external R&D? We develop a model and novel technique for empirically estimating R&D substitution elasticities. We focus on bio-pharmaceutical and software industries in California and Massachusetts, where tax credit rates changed differently over time for the two types of R&D, creating a natural experiment. The effective tax prices for the two R&D types differ from type to type, firm to firm, state to state, and year to year. This allows us to examine changes in the composition of firms' R&D budgets between in-house R&D and external basic research when the relative tax prices of each category of research change.

J,[Anonymous],,,,[Anonymous],,,On the Non-Contractual Nature of Donor-Recipient Interaction in Development Assistance,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,AID; CONDITIONALITY,"The author analyzes three issues in strategic donor-recipient interaction motivated by the complexity of the rationale underlying aid. The first is when we have several principals with conflicting objectives. Any one principal cannot offer high powered incentives to the agent to carry out his or her designated task. The second is to do with the fact that effort associated with ensuring aid effectiveness may concern both principal and agent, the optimal solution to which requires cooperative behavior that is difficult to design. Consequently, the contractual type principal-agent relationship between donors and recipients is inappropriate. We need to consider models that signal recipient quality or commitment to reform. Thus, thirdly, a simple model of signaling with commitment problems is presented, along with extensions to multiple types of agent and time periods, as well as possible solutions involving mechanism design.",,,,,"Murshed, Syed Mansoob/AAY-3622-2020","Murshed, Syed Mansoob/0000-0002-8360-033X",,,,,16,6,10,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

J,[Anonymous],,,,[Anonymous],,,Does Aid Mitigate External Shocks?,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PANEL-DATA,"The authors investigate the role of aid in mitigating the adverse effects of commodity export price shocks on growth in commodity-dependent countries. Using a large cross-country dataset, they find that negative shocks matter for short-term growth, while the ex ante risk of shocks does not seem to matter. They also find that both the level of aid and the flexibility of the exchange rate substantially lower the adverse growth effect of shocks. While the mitigating effect of aid is significant in both countries with pegs and countries with floats, the effect seems to be smaller for the latter, suggesting that aid and exchange rate flexibility are partly substitutes. They investigate whether aid has historically been targeted at shock-prone countries, but find no evidence that this is the case. This suggests that donors could increase aid effectiveness by redirecting aid toward countries with a high incidence of commodity export price shocks.",,,,,,,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-156-25-0001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,33,12,12,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In our treatment, the performance measures, or the indexes of acceptability, are linked to positive expectations resulting from a stressed sampling of the cash-flow distribution. Theoretically, it is shown that the level of acceptability varies directly with the amount of stress tolerated. In an empirical application, the performance measures are applied to cash flows generated by writing options on the SPX and the FTSE.

Our econometric results suggest that reducing own most favored nation tariffs is associated with increasing manufacturing production specialization. Furthermore, we find that preferential trade liberalization and differences in the degree of unilateral openness have resulted in increased dissimilarities in manufacturing production structures across countries.

A repeated measures design is used with participants filing taxes 60 times. Study I focuses on taxpayers' immediate reactions to audits and examines whether a strong decrease in compliance following an audit is caused by either misperception of chance or loss repair. The second purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of audit positioning in a tax-paying life span. The results suggest that the decrease of compliance found after an audit is most likely caused by misperception of chance, while loss-repair tendencies are of moderate relevance. Moreover, results confirm that contrary to later audits, early audit experiences in a tax-paying life span lead to increased compliance. Independent of audit positioning, compliance decreases if participants are not audited over an extended period of time. It is hypothesized that just one further audit may suffice to increase compliance again. Study 2 confirms this assumption. The results show the relevance of specific audit patterns on tax compliance.

The framework is applied to study markup of Japanese firms in manufacturing and wholesale/retail trade for 1994-2002. The results indicate that, on average, the Japanese markets become more competitive in the 1990s than before even in non-manufacturing industries.

This paper takes tax shields and leverage return as a system and provides a knife, interest rate/ROI = Cost/Price, to slice the VTS capacity into earned VTS and unearned VTS. Earned VTS is VTS. Unearned VTS is the value of leverage return, because leverage return is tax payable. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

India's participation in an internationally tradable emission permits regime with grandfathered emissions allocation is preferable to any domestic carbon tax option, provided the world market price of emission permits remains low. Even better would be if India participated in a global system of tradable emission permits with equal per capita emission entitlements. India would then be able to use the revenues garnered from the sale of surplus permits to speed up its economic growth and poverty reduction and yet keep its per capita emissions below the 1990 per capita global emissions level.","Univ Delhi, Shri Ram Coll Commerce, Delhi 110007, India",University of Delhi; Shri Ram College of Commerce,"Ojha, VP (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, Shri Ram Coll Commerce, Delhi 110007, India.",vpojha@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,26,29,1,28,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Scholars, however, are only beginning to understand the reasons nonmonetary sanctions affect economic outcomes. Here we provide evidence that a preference for avoiding written expression of disapproval, or negative emotion, plays an important role in promoting fair decision making. We study one-shot Dictator games where one subject has the right to determine a division of an amount of money between herself and her receiver. In relation to the standard game, we find significantly fewer earning-maximizing decisions when receivers can react to offers with ex post written messages. We further find that credible threats of monetary sanctions, while economically inefficient, are significantly more effective than written messages in deterring selfishness. Our data provide new perspectives on the role of communication in promoting economic efficiency in social environments, and support economic theories of decision incorporating psychological factors such as guilt, shame, and self-deception.

In the United States, however, institutions are only required to report their ownership quarterly in 13-F filings. We infer daily institutional trading behavior from the tape, the Transactions and Quotes database of the New York Stock Exchange, using a sophisticated method that best predicts quarterly 13-F data from trades of different sizes. We find that daily institutional trades are highly persistent and respond positively to recent daily returns but negatively to longer-term past daily returns. Institutional trades, particularly sells, appear to generate short-term losses-possibly reflecting institutional demand for liquidity-but longer-term profits. One source of these profits is that institutions anticipate both earnings surprises and post-earnings announcement drift.

We consider a firm that faces asymmetric information in both the product and financial markets and that needs to raise external financing to fund its growth opportunity (new project). Any product market advertising undertaken by the firm is visible to the financial market as well. In equilibrium, the firm uses a combination of product market advertising, equity underpricing, and underfinancing (raising a smaller amount of external capital than the full information optimum) to convey its true product quality and the intrinsic value of its projects to consumers and investors. The following two predictions arise from our theoretical analysis for the relation between product market advertising and equity underpricing around new equity issues. First, firms choose a higher level of product market advertising when they are planning to issue new equity, compared with situations in which they have no immediate plans to do so. Second, product market advertising and equity underpricing are substitutes for a firm issuing new equity. We empirically test the above two predictions and find supporting evidence in the context of firms making initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Noneconomic damages caps are particularly influential in reducing medical malpractice losses and increasing insurer profitability. The long-run effects of these reforms are greater than insurers' expected effects; for example, 5- and 7-year developed loss ratios are below the initially reported incurred loss ratios for those years following the enactment of noneconomic damages caps. Analyses of reported losses consequently understate the ultimate effects of tort reforms. The quantile regressions show that reforms have the greatest effects for the firms that are at the high end of the loss distribution.","[Born, Patricia] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Baker, Tom] Univ Penn, Sch Law, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Viscusi, W.

This investigation enables us to evaluate the relative benefits of New York and London exchange listings and to assess whether these relative benefits have changed over time, perhaps as a result of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. We find that cross-listings have been falling on US exchanges as well as on the Main Market in London. This decline in cross-listings is explained by changes in firm characteristics instead of by changes in the benefits of cross-listing. We show that after controlling for firm characteristics there is no deficit in cross-listing counts on US exchanges related to SOX. Investigating the valuation differential between listed and non-listed firms (the cross-listing premium) from 1990 to 2005, we find that there is a significant premium for US exchange listings every year, that the premium has not fallen significantly in recent years, and that it persists when allowing for time-invariant unobservable firm characteristics. In contrast, no premium exists for listings on London's Main Market in any year. Firms increase their capital-raising activities at home and abroad following a cross-listing on a major US exchange but not following a cross-listing in London. Our evidence is consistent with the theory that an exchange listing in New York has unique governance benefits for foreign firms. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Karolyi, G.

Our results suggest that differences in physical capital intensity and in total factor productivity are both important sources of cross-province income differences, each accounting for roughly half of the variation in income levels. Differences in human capital explain only a small amount of income differences across provinces. The results are robust to whether or not the assumption of constant returns to scale is imposed.

In order to investigate the cause of this decline, we decompose the variance of output growth by frequency. Our important findings are: (1) The total variance of output growth decreased, which resulted from a reduction in the volatility at business-cycle frequencies; (2) At business-cycle frequencies, the variance of production fell by a larger percentage than did the variance of sales; and (3) In stark contrast, at high frequencies, the variance of production increased, while the variance of sales decreased. These features of production at different frequencies cannot be explained by changes in the sales process and cost-shock process. Instead, improved business practices-such as the adoption of the just-in-time technique-played a direct role in stabilizing the business cycles, while increasing output volatility at high frequencies.

The international development community has pushed transparency in resource revenues through such initiatives as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Despite the popularity of the transparency concept, its role in reducing corruption and averting the resource curse is poorly understood. This paper reviews the main mechanisms through which transparency can reduce corruption. It argues that transparency is insufficient in itself, and needs to be complemented by other types of policies. Transparency reform should focus on the areas most important to alleviating the resource curse. In view of the resource curse literature, the emphasis of the EITI on revenues rather than on expenditures appears misplaced. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A revenue-neutral increase in both the wage tax and the tax exemption and a revenue-neutral change in the composition of labor taxation towards the tax with the smaller base will lead to the same results: they moderate wages, workers' effort, effective labor input, and aggregate output. Whether employment rises or falls, however, depends in both reforms on the magnitude of the prereform total tax wedge. We show that this ambiguity stems from the effect tax progression has on the marginal revenue changes of tax and tax exemption changes. This budgetary effect determines the result in the same way in both tax reforms and turns out to be the crucial force in determining the effect the degree of tax progressivity has on employment.","[Schoeb, Ronnie] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Schöb, R (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",ronnie.schoeb@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,25,3,3,1,10,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2009,65.0,1,,,,,51,72,,10.1628/001522109X444206,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,457BA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266898600004,0

In contrast, most of the theoretical literature on liquidity provision suggests that central banks should lend at an interest rate of zero. This is broadly consistent with the Federal Reserve's behavior in the days following September 11, 2001. This paper shows that both policies can be reconciled. With commodity money, as in Bagehot's time, liquidity is scarce and a high price allows banks to self-select. In contrast, the Fed has a virtually unlimited ability to temporarily expand the money supply so self-selection is unnecessary.","Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Martin, A (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA.",antoine.martin@ny.frb.org,,,,,,,36,9,9,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The environment changes and especially the changes in the nature and the dimensions of the markets due to the globalization and regulation put real questions for companies, generate a strategic thinking and make compulsory the appearance of an efficient management control. Generally, the scientific papers concerning the concept of management control deal with the production companies more than with the trade ones. This is why we chose to present the importance of the controller within a trade company. The management control has to assure the coherence between the adopted strategy (where the company in the trade domain wants to go) and the practical means of achieving it (what it has to do and what it is used for). The management controller is the person that contributes to obtain this coherence. There is plenty of information available, but for the decision making purposes only a restricted number of facts are correlated, namely the relevant ones. The trade management controller takes part in creating the information system useful for the decision making. Such a system has to offer reliable information in due time to the decision making persons concerning the profitability of certain markets, distribution areas, products, clients, the analysis of margins, distribution costs, advertising expenses etc. The trade management controller plays the role of a manager's copilot, he assists him in the management of the activity, alerts him when problems are encountered, helps him to make the necessary decisions to correct the trajectory. These are a few reasons that allow us to sustain the important role played by the management controller in the activity of the companies in the trade area.","[Dumitrana, Mihaela; Glavan, Mariana; Dumitru, Madalina] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dumitrana, M (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",glavan_emariana@yahoo.com; madalina.dumitru@soft-expert.info,"Dumitru, Madalina/C-3885-2011; Dumitru, Madalina/AAC-5123-2022","Dumitru, Madalina/0000-0001-9159-6302; Dumitru, Madalina/0000-0001-9159-6302",,,,,15,3,3,0,10,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2009,11.0,25,,,,,91,102,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,437LN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265489100010,0

The fixed exchange rate regime cum monetary targeting policy which had been implemented since the beginning of 2000 collapsed with the November 2000-February 2001 crisis. The root cause of the crisis was the fragile banking sector The rescue operation of the banking sector sky-rocketed the public debt to GDP ratio. In the aftermath of the crisis fiscal dominance and weak banking sector severely constrained the conduct of monetary policy. The Central Bank of Turkey halted the monetary targeting regime which was put in place in the aftermath of the crisis at the end of 2001. The 2002-2005 was the implicit inflation targeting period which was replaced by formal inflation targeting at the beginning of 2006 Throughout both of the inflation targeting periods floating exchange rate regime was implemented.

The macro-economical approaches have been based in generally on the effect that real equilibrium, respectively on the situation, when prices are reduced and the value of the currency is increased, thus allowing a greater satisfaction to the individuals. Actually, the importance of the real effect is especially reduced, more towards the situation of an economical restarting. The monetary doctrine, according to which the prices grow proportionally to the increase of the monetary offer, no matter the monetary regime, it proves that there are no effects over the real transactions. The new paradigm of the monetary economy consists in the fact that it proves the inconsistency of the monetary theory, according to which the transactions have generated the currency demand.

Focusing on a sample of firms rated by Standard & Poor's (S&P), we show that the profitability of dispersion-based trading strategies concentrates in a small number of the worst-rated firms and is significant only during periods of deteriorating credit conditions. In such periods, the negative dispersion-return relation emerges as low-rated firms experience substantial price drop along with considerable increase in forecast dispersion. Moreover, even for this small universe of worst-rated firms, the dispersion-return relation is non-existent when either the dispersion measure or return is adjusted by credit risk. The results are robust to previously proposed explanations for the dispersion effect such as short-sale constraints and leverage. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Theoretically, we introduce persistent time-varying uncertainty about the fundamentals in an external habit model. The model matches the dynamics of dividend and consumption growth, including their volatility dynamics and many salient asset market phenomena. While the variation in price-dividend ratios and the equity risk premium is primarily driven by risk aversion, uncertainty plays a large role in the term structure and is the driver of countercyclical volatility of asset returns.

Agglomeration is measured alternatively through urbanization shares and through indices of spatial concentration based on data for sub-national regions.

The critical level is estimated at some USD 10,000, corresponding roughly to the current per-capita income level of Brazil or Bulgaria. Hence, the tradeoff between national growth and inter-regional equality may gradually lose its relevance.

Using a novel database of exogenous economic and political shocks for 14 systematically relevant EMEs, we find that EME shocks not only have a statistically but also economically significant impact on global equity markets. The economic significance of EME shocks is in particular underlined by their remarkably persistent effects over time. Importantly, EMEs are found to influence global equity markets about just as much in good times as in bad times, though they tend to be stronger during crises or periods of financial turbulence. Finally. we detect a large degree of heterogeneity in the transmission of EME shocks to individual countries' equity markets. stressing the different degrees of financial exposure, which is relatively higher for European equity markets.

Thus, there is less long-term information impounded inprices. The managerial myopia theory predicts that a variety of short-term pressures, including inadequate information on long-term projects. cause asymmetrically-informed corporate managers to underinvest in long-term projects. The introduction of long-term options called LEAPS provides a natural experiment to jointly test both theories, which are otherwise difficult to test. We conduct an event study around the introduction of LEAPS for a given stock and test whether corporate investment in long-term R&D/sales increases in the years following the introduction. We find that over a two year period of time LEAPS firms increase their R&D/sales between 23% and 28% ($125-SI52 million annually) compared to matching non-LEAPS firms. The difference depends on the matching technique used. Two other proxies for long-term investment find similar increases. We find that the increase is positively related to LEAPS volume. We also find that the increase is larger in firms where R&D plays a larger and more strategic role. We test if a firm becomes less likely to beat analyst's quarterly earnings forecasts after LEAPS are introduced and find support for the hypothesis. These results provide both statistically and economically significant support for the costly trade and managerial myopia theories. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To be successful in this sphere of business means knowing how to carefully evaluate and resolve the risks and changes which are involved in the modern marketing of the car industry. Also the communication of car brands has to reflect the range of changing facts. The Impact of changed competitive conditions and the appearance of new customer segments is at present bringing to the foreground the necessity of conceiving of the positioning of car brands by a new method, and focussing more intensely on customer perception and the satisfaction of their needs and ideas. A basic criterion of the success of a car brand is the high level of awareness of it, a positive image, a long history, a level of trust in the brand on the part of consumers, and effective communication. One of the communication channels used by all automotive manufacturers and dealers is the Internet. This article presents the results from content analysis of web sites of 10 of the most significant car brands in the Czech Republic. It also refers to the fact that the technique of desk research allows us to get a sufficient amount of valid information, with a low expenditure for the objective examination of the presentation of brands in a competitive field of the other best selling car brands in the Czech market. The research showed that websites of car brands are characterised by a high level of professionalism and unambiguously comprise one of the basic sources of information on the companies and their products. In this respect the initial hypothesis of the contents analysis was confirmed, i.e. that brand-based internet presentations are in accordance with the perceived high quality of their products. However, the research also showed how little the internet is understood on the part of auto manufacturers as regards its multi-layeredness and multi-functionality. With the odd exception it was shown that the perceived potential of the internet on the part of car brands corresponds rather to an idea of a static advertising medium.","[Jahodova, Hana] Skoda Auto Univ, Inst Management & Mkt, Mlada Boleslav 29360, Czech Republic",Skoda Auto University,,hana.jahodova@skoda-auto.cz,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,6,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,158,164,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000018,0

Literature which directly addresses factors influencing corporate income tax revenues is quite limited - in respect of number of papers as well as in respect of the range of examined countries and/or time period.

Presented article on the other hand covers observations for all OECD countries for a rather long time period 1980-2006. The authors believe that this paper addresses all important factors having influence on corporate income tax revenues, including tax avoidance and debt financing. The results of the analysis largely correspond to existing investigations of other authors; however, presented regression is of more complex and general character - it includes other factors of tax avoidance and data for all OECD members (except for some variables which are not available), including post-communist countries.","[Kubatova, Kveta] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic; [Rihova, Lucie] Ernst & Young Tax & Transact SRO, CZ-12000 Prague 2, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kubátová, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, N W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",kubatova@vse.cz; Lucie.Rihova@cz.ey.com,,,,,,,18,13,13,1,11,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Also, we explored the impacts of age, education, position level on these variables. The main findings are showed as follows. Firstly, communication openness is significantly related to Guanxi and organizational commitment. Secondly, Guanxi fully mediates the relationship between communication openness and organizational commitment. This research finds that personal Guanxi between supervisor and subordinate plays an important role in Chinese enterprises, and the suggestions for Chinese enterprises from the result are as follows. Chinese enterprises should build effective formal communication networks to ensure that any information can transmit without obstacle. Supervisors should be more open to subordinates, especially strengthen the initiative of communication. Besides, supervisors need to keep good personal Guanxi with subordinates, and spend time caring them to win subordinates' commitment, thus increase employees' organizational commitment.","[Liu Yuyu; Huang Xiaoke; Yan Su] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,liuyy123@yahoo.com.cn,"wangwangwang, yuanyaunyuan/HHN-6432-2022",,,,,,17,0,0,0,5,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,1474,1481,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000184,0

Habibie ascended to the presidency in the midst of a severe economic crisis, and with a reputation as an economic nationalist rather than reformer. Nevertheless, Habibie had the mantle of reformer thrust upon him, and important steps toward economic reform were taken during his 1998-99 presidency. Among these were reforms of domestic and foreign trade policies, the development of anti-monopoly and consumer protection laws, and the decentralisation of fiscal and regulatory authority. Through strict adherence to monetary discipline, moreover, Habibie accomplished a macroeconomic stabilisation that had eluded Soeharto in his last months as president. Other changes in economic policies and practices under Habibie, notably a populist program to distribute government largesse to cooperatives and small business and the extraction of election campaign funds from banks dependent on state authority, were steps in the wrong direction, if economic efficiency and good governance were among the goals.","Pomona Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Pomona College,"Marks, SV (通讯作者)，Pomona Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",smarks@pomona.edu,,,,,,,44,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

In previous research, it has been argued that performance benefits are a result of a greater awareness of the sources of value the product provides to the consumer, without specifically describing how value was created. Treacy and Wiersema (1993) developed the concept of value disciplines, which are three distinctive means of value provision, namely operational excellence, customer intimacy and product leadership. More recently, Narver et al. (1998) argued that market oriented firms have a clear understanding of how they provide value to customers, but this assertion has yet to be empirically tested. A new scale was developed and tested to measure the choice and clarity of value discipline. Using a sample of 343 Illinois beef producers, results show that organizational learning, innovativeness, and extreme levels of market orientation contribute to value discipline clarity while moderate levels of market orientation have the opposite effect.","[Micheels, Eric T.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Gow, Hamish R.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Michigan State University,"Micheels, ET (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 326 Mumford Hall,MC-710,1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",micheels@illinois.edu; hgow@msu.edu,"Micheels, Eric/R-2700-2019","Micheels, Eric/0000-0001-6974-6423",,,,,57,7,9,1,14,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Exchange rate arrangements have modified in their history, as a response of the lack in the adjustments process. Taking into account the complexity and uncertainty in the present monetary world, the Bretton Woods system seems to be more ordered and a question arises if this is not right for our days. The Bretton Woods was innovator because the international monetary cooperation was realised for the first time on an institutionalized base, it respects the national sovereignty principle and their members was engaged at a collective responsibility. Many economists view the present monetary system as a revival of the Bretton Woods system. If in the past the core was USA and the periphery Europe and Japan, now there is a new periphery - Asia and Latin America - but the core is the same - United States of America. In the middle is marked the third block Europe. The financial crisis demonstrates that the emergent economies integration in the global monetary system brings changes unanticipated and calls for a reform of the international monetary system.

It focuses on the economic growth strategy of the Czech Republic over the past decade and the balance that it has sought to achieve between FDI and the development of indigenous industry. This type of investment is generally associated with facilitation the transfer of newer, faster and productive technology to host countries. FDI and multinational companies brings along a more competitive environment that motivates local enterprises to perform to international standards set by the foreign firms as a survival strategy or motivate to create appropriate linkage with the multinational company and set integration in the branch. The paper also explores the case of Ireland and highlights the lessons that transition economies such as the Czech Republic can learn from its experiences regarding the promotion of FDI. These lessons include that a package of incentives is superior to a single incentive, host countries should adopt an enterprise-centred approach, sectoral direction requires project selectivity, and there are limitations to the local linkage potential in global production chains. A final warning is that FDI is not loyal to a host country and when it makes more economic sense to transfer operations to a lower cost / higher profit economy, then the FDI investor will move quickly and leave behind job losses and related difficulties.

The degree of competition is measured through markups while productivity is measured through total factor productivity (TFP) and labor productivity. All are computed by industries. Taking account of endogeneity issues and of the role of relevant control variables, the results show that in Jordan and Morocco, markup has a significant and negative impact on productivity growth. In Egypt, while markup does not seem to affect productivity growth, a decrease in the share of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in a given industry has a significant and positive impact on productivity growth. In general, the existence of State-Owned Enterprises is an obstacle to competition. We conclude that the greater the degree of competition, the higher the productivity in the three countries.","Univ Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Free University of Brussels,"Sekkat, K (通讯作者)，Univ Brussels, CP 140,50 Ave FD Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",ksekkat@ulb.ac.be,,,,,,,34,14,17,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The framework is illustrated using survey data from the International Social Survey Program from Switzerland. Although most individuals accept the fact that there are quite large pay differentials across different occupations, they would still prefer a more equal distribution of market wages. The empirical analysis further shows that financial self-interest, normative beliefs, and perceptions of how wages are determined all have an impact on the assessment of market justice. Finally, subjective inequality measures and the assessment of market justice turn out to be substantive predictors of individuals' general support for the welfare state and their party identification.

This prompts them to increase their contributions to group goals, which causes social cohesion to strengthen further. The model identifies three ways for leaders to initiate this multiplier process: increasing their own contribution, putting effort into indoctrinating members, and raising the obstacles that members face when they contribute.","Natl Def Acad, Dept Publ Policy, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 239, Japan",National Defence Academy - Japan,"Shimizu, H (通讯作者)，Natl Def Acad, Dept Publ Policy, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 239, Japan.",hshimizu@me.com,,,,,,,27,4,5,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2011,149.0,3-4,,,SI,,427,440,,10.1007/s11127-011-9880-1,0.0,,,14,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,899CF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300790000011,0

In a between-subjects design, we observe the impact of a substantial delay of risk resolution (2 days) on investment choices. Besides the resolution timing all other factors, including the timing of payout, are held constant across treatments. In addition, state-of-the-art experimental techniques from experimental economics and psychology are used for eliciting preferences and to explicitly measure emotions and personality traits. Participants put their own money at stake. Our main finding is that the timing of the resolution of risk matters for investment, modulated by the probability of investment success. Emotions are found to play a significant role in this respect and explain our main finding. Our results support recent models of decision making under risk trying to incorporate anticipatory emotions but also uncover some important shortcomings related to the dynamics of emotions.

These studies have relied on linear models, however, making their results suspect. Other papers have investigated nonlinearity over the Mexican business cycle, but have not studied the links between the Mexican and US economies. In this paper a Markov-switching model is employed to investigate the changing macroeconomic effect of the USA on Mexico. The findings show that the USA indeed appears to have a much larger impact since the passage of the North Atlantic Free Trade Association (NAFTA) than in previous years. Results also indicate that the level of foreign exchange reserves has much less predictive power for the Mexican economy since NAFTA. This suggests that the greater synchronization with the US business cycle may be more attributable to better macroeconomic management in Mexico than to the closer trade links.","[Miles, William; Vijverberg, Chu-Ping C.] Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA",Wichita State University,"Vijverberg, CPC (通讯作者)，Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, 1845 Fairmt, Wichita, KS 67260 USA.",william.miles@wichita.edu; chuping.vijverberg@wichita.edu,"Vijverberg, Chu-Ping/AAO-8199-2021",,,,,,17,9,9,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper reports on a large research project which uses a mixed method approach to explore attitudes to and perceptions of walking and cycling, and which examines the process of household decision-making for everyday travel and the constraints that this imposes. Using survey, interview and ethnographic data it is argued that many people hold ambiguous and sometimes contradictory views of walking and cycling as effective means of everyday travel, that what they do rarely matches precisely what they believe, and that the complexity and contingency associated with everyday travel for many households is a major barrier to the use of more sustainable travel modes. It is suggested that better understanding of these processes could help to inform both future transport policy and the promotion of walking and cycling for short trips in urban areas.

This investor directly allocates the wealth in each account among available assets. In practice, however, investors often delegate the task of allocating wealth among assets to portfolio managers who seek to beat certain benchmarks. Accordingly, we extend their framework to the case where the investor allocates the wealth in each account among portfolio managers. Our contribution is threefold. First, we provide an analytical characterization of the existence and composition of the optimal portfolios within accounts and the aggregate portfolio. Second, we present conditions under which such portfolios are not on the mean-variance frontier, and conditions under which they are.

According to Hsee's evaluability hypothesis, it is easier to evaluate product attributes when they are juxtaposed (i.e., presented jointly) than when they are presented in isolation from each other. Recent research has provided some support to the evaluability hypothesis for the attribute of perceived product quantity. The present research tests the hypothesis in relation to the attribute of perceived fairness. In two experiments, we show that when participants evaluate products in isolation from each other, they err in their judgment of product quantity, and, consequently, they mis-attribute fairness to the seller. In a third experiment, we further show that the inclusion of constant yet unfair price information does not affect the fairness and price judgments. These findings provide evidence for the psychological plausibility of the evaluability hypothesis for the attributes of fairness and product quantity. Moreover, they suggest that isolated product evaluation may be systematically suboptimal for consumers, even when pricing information is included. Therefore, effective consumer decision-making will benefit by allowing the joint evaluation of alternatives. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

In this context, teachers and journalists play a major role because they act as promoters for economic knowledge transfer through schools and media. This study analyzes how teachers and journalists judge economic policies and whether they are closer to an expert or a lay way of thinking. In four separate surveys, randomly chosen German adults (n = 190), economists (n = 80), social studies teachers (n = 97) and economic journalists (n = 90) were presented two policy proposals from the trade and immigration policy domain. Consistent with existing evidence, a large majority of the economists favored free trade and labor mobility and judged them as economically efficient and fair, while most of the laypeople hold contrary views. The answers from journalists and teachers generally lay in between economists and laypeople-with teachers being closer to laypeople and journalists tending more towards the economists. Interestingly however, teachers and journalists reverted to the same criteria for the judgment of economic policies as laypeople. All three groups based their judgments nearly exclusively on a policy proposal's perceived fairness, while economists strongly focused on its economic efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

We use directional distance function to estimate firm-specific environmental efficiency. A truncated regression model with bootstraping is then estimated to analyze the determinants of the environmental efficiency of firms. The analysis shows that the comprehensiveness of an EMS, pressures to reduce toxic releases cost-effectively, innovativeness of firms and the threat of costly regulations in the future lead firms to become more environmental efficient. Regression results indicate that increasing the comprehensiveness of EMS by adopting one additional practice benefits the average firm by approximately US$ 35.5 million by increasing its environmental efficiency by 0.3%.","[Khanna, Madhu] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kumar, Surender] Univ Delhi, Dept Business Econ S Campus, New Delhi 110021, India",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Delhi,"Khanna, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 326 Mumford Hall,1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",khanna1@illinois.edu; surendekumar@gmail.com,"Kumar, Surender/H-3042-2014; Kumar, Surender/AAF-6463-2021","Kumar, Surender/0000-0002-4217-7715",,,,,32,17,22,3,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The econometric analysis is based on data of 356 small and medium-sized German firms from the knowledge-intensive services and ICT services sectors. The results show that, compared to employees younger than 30 years, an older workforce is negatively related to the probability of technology adoption. On the contrary, the dispersion of the employees' age within the workforce seems not to be connected with the probability of technology adoption.

Based on a field study of two regions at different ends of the development spectrum, it shows the class-specific nature of agrarian development. Farms based on hired labour adopt more capital-intensive techniques, operate on a much larger scale and have higher yields in comparison to farms based on family labour, regardless of their size. Differentiation of the peasantry is intense where the adoption of capital-intensive technology is high. The paper concludes that the arguments of A.V. Chayanov and A.K. Sen, which seek to explain the inverse relation between farm size and productivity in terms of the superior efficiency of farms based on family labour compared to capitalist farms, are not borne out by our findings.

Our experimental results show that simply observing what others in the group do has a significant impact on behavior.

(2010) that measure the extent of achievement in each of the three policy goals in the trilemma-monetary independence, exchange rate stability, and financial openness we examine how policy configurations affect macroeconomic performances, with focus on the Asian economies. We find that the three policy choices matter for output volatility and the medium-term level of inflation. Greater monetary independence is associated with lower output volatility while greater exchange rate stability implies greater output volatility, which can be mitigated if a country holds international reserves (IR) at a level higher than a threshold (about 20% of GDP). Greater monetary autonomy is associated with a higher level of inflation while greater exchange rate stability and greater financial openness could lower the inflation rate. We find that trilemma policy configurations affect output volatility through the investment or trade channel depending on the openness of the economies. Our results indicate that policy makers in a more open economy would prefer pursuing greater exchange rate stability while holding a massive amount of IR. Asian emerging market economies are found to be equipped with macroeconomic policy configurations that help the economies to dampen the volatility of the real exchange rate. These economies' sizeable amount of IR holding appears to enhance the stabilizing effect of the trilemma policy choices, and this may help explain the recent phenomenal buildup of IR in the region.

Accompanying, and perhaps fuelling, this increase in mobility has been a substantial rise in low cost air travel provision. The UK Civil Aviation Authority and the Civil Aviation Office of the Republic of Poland statistics testify to the expansion in passenger numbers between Poland and the UK since 2004, with Ryanair being one of the main carriers. Although other modes of transport, such as coach and car travel, are still important, in some senses these Ryanair flights define this new migration. Taking as a starting point that airports and air-planes are social and cultural venues in their own right, and that migration journeys are themselves at the heart of the migration experience, this article uses interviews with Polish migrants in the UK to consider this low cost air travel for migration in more depth. Firstly it briefly charts the increase in air travel between Poland and the UK, considering the narratives of mobility cultures collected with the migrants. Secondly it investigates the collective dimension of travelling for migration on these flights and the tensions which emerge around this collectivity. Finally, it reflects on the wider costs and contexts of low cost shuttle flights as a late capitalist mode of migration transport. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we delve deeper into the mechanism behind that relationship. Specifically, we investigate the effect of trust on human and physical capital while controlling for the fact that the two types of capital are simultaneously determined. In a sample of 50 countries from 1976 to 2005, we show that trust has a positive and significant effect on human capital and a non-linear effect on physical capital. Increasing trust in a low-trust country has a greater impact on the accumulation of physical capital than an identical increase in trust in a high-trust country. We go on to investigate the interaction between institutions and trust and find that institutional reform is less effective at promoting investment in countries with high levels of trust.

It suggests that the three countries share many cultural, social, economic and political traditions and institutions, but that this shared heritage does not necessarily extend to the realms of tax reviews and the possible roads to tax reform that the countries may tread. There are some similarities in aspects of the processes of tax review that have taken place in the three countries (though rather more differences), and all three countries also share a commitment to broadly similar principles underlying the recommendations made by each of the three reviews. But the specific proposals made by each of the reviews do not share much common ground. The differences are more apparent than any similarities that may occur, an outcome (in part at least) predicated upon the very different political, economic and fiscal imperatives prevailing in each of the three countries. The paper also suggests that it is unlikely that the three reviews will have the same long-term impact or effects upon their respective national tax systems. It may be the case, the paper contends, that there is a form of trade-off between political independence (as in the Mirrlees Review) and the direct policy impact that is more apparent in countries whose reviews had strong government backing (as was the case in New Zealand) - at least in the short term. Moreover, independent reviews (such as the Mirrlees Review) may also lead to more radical proposals, which will require a longer time maturing 'on the shelf' before they may be ripe for implementation.","Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Evans, C (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",cc.evans@unsw.edu.au,"Evans, Christopher Charles/J-9165-2012","Evans, Christopher Charles/0000-0002-2978-4772",ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,14,4,4,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Due to its nature of involving implicit indirect subsidization, a LGS is mostly evaluated in terms of the economic and social benefits created, such as generation of export revenues and creation of employment opportunities. Although most government-sponsored programs do not set up clear-cut definitions for how to evaluate those benefits and what targets should be achieved, they do have an initial aim of self-financing. Since guarantee fees (premiums) represent the largest cash inflow for a guarantor and the most critical index to indicate a borrower's credit status, this paper proposes a methodology that specifically aims for this self-financing target by meeting at least default costs with income from premiums. This is done by actuarially determining a guarantee fee for each loan based on market-based information and risk-neutrality concepts. Empirical evidence shows that real cash outflows (costs of honoring defaults) are very close to estimated cash inflows (total guarantee fees), which indicates that the objective of meeting budget constraints is achieved.","[Chen, Chin-Ming] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Money & Banking, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Kuo, Chau-Jung; Sung, Chao-Hsien] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Chen, CM (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Money & Banking, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",chinming@kimo.com,,,,,,,26,11,17,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Two firms, with differing productivity levels, compete in an industry with a significant probability of a positive productivity shock. Going public, though costly, not only allows a firm to raise external capital cheaply, but also enables it to grab market share from its private competitors. We solve for the decision of each firm to go public versus remain private, and the optimal timing of going public. In equilibrium, even firms with sufficient internal capital to fund their new investment may go public, driven by the possibility of their product market competitors going public. IPO waves may arise in equilibrium even in industries which do not experience a productivity shock. Our model predicts that firms going public during an IPO wave will have lower productivity and post-IPO profitability but larger cash holdings than those going public off the wave; it makes similar predictions for firms going public later versus earlier in an IPO wave. We empirically test and find support for these predictions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

If countries are asymmetric in terms of production cost then the higher-cost exporter always prefers the discriminatory regime but the lower-cost exporter prefers the uniform regime if there is a significant cost differential. With cost asymmetry the announcement of a uniform tariff regime by the importer is not a credible strategy since there is an incentive to deviate to discrimination.

We assume that each group member accepts the assumptions of subjective expected utility theory with respect to the alternatives from which they must choose, but we do not assume, a priori, that the group as a whole accepts those assumptions. Instead, we impose a multiattribute utility independence condition on the preferences of the group with respect to the expected utilities of its actions as appraised by its members. The result is that the expected utility of an alternative for the group is a weighted average of the expected utilities of that alternative for its members. The weights must be determined collectively by the group. Pareto optimality is not assumed, though the result is consistent with Pareto optimality.","[Keeney, Ralph L.; Nau, Robert] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Keeney, RL (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",keeney@duke.edu,,,,,,,29,16,17,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We find that SWFs prefer large and poorly performing firms facing financial difficulties. Their investments have a positive effect on target firms' stock prices around the announcement date but no substantial effect on firm performance and governance in the long run. We also find that transparent SWFs are more likely to invest in financially constrained firms and have a greater impact on target firm value than opaque SWFs. Overall, SWFs are similar to passive institutional investors in their preference for target characteristics and in their effect on target performance, and SWF transparency influences SWFs' investment activities and their impact on target firm value.

Because the choice between substitute goods is a very common one, this is an important finding. The experiment uses scenarios in various consumption categories: hotel rooms, flights, and books. Subjects were either students or participants in an economics conference. The data allow to reject the hypothesis that people think only about relative price differences in favor of the hypothesis that people think about both relative and absolute price differences. Whether the price given to the subjects is that of the high-quality good or of the low-quality good makes a large difference, a result that is related to the endowment effect and the status quo bias.

The paper identifies episodes of financial turmoil in advanced economies using a financial stress index (FSI), and proposes an analytical framework to assess the impact of financial stress - in particular banking distress - on the real economy. It concludes that financial turmoil characterized by banking distress is more likely to be associated with deeper and longer downturns than stress mainly in securities or foreign exchange markets. Economies with more arm's-length financial systems seem to be more exposed to contractions in activity following financial stress, due to the greater procyclicality of leverage in their banking systems.

Knowledge transfer from individuals to groups and organization must follow knowledge creation in order to transform individual into organizational knowledge, along the epistemological dimension of the Nonaka's knowledge dynamics model. Moreover, the knowledge intensive organizations increase their fluxes of knowledge across different age layers and different departments, reducing in the same time the company knowledge loss. The academic environment is, by nature, an age layered field or a nested functional structure. Intergenerational knowledge transfer becomes any university main driving force, while understanding its dynamics is important for academic life improvement. The purpose of the paper is to present some of our research results in the field of intergenerational knowledge transfer in the academic environment of the knowledge-based economy. We performed a qualitative and quantitative research of the knowledge transfer process in the academic environment, using the Analytic Hierarchy Processes (AHP). We analyzed the faculty staff attitudes toward cooperation, competition, and innovation as main priorities in performing research, writing books and publishing scientific papers. The above-mentioned activities are based on intergenerational knowledge transfer and lead to learning processes at individual and organizational levels.

The ECM was the preferred model because it corrects for some of the limitations observed in previous studies that investigated the supply response of beef in South Africa. Using rainfall, real producers' price of beef, lamb, pork, chicken, yellow maize, imports and cattle population to represent climatic, economic, trade and demographic factors, respectively, as identified in the literature, the supply response of beef in South Africa was modelled as the number of cattle marketed for slaughtering. This article confirms that beef producers in South Africa respond to economic, climatic, trade and demographic factors in the long-run. In the short-run, however, the article shows that cattle marketed for slaughtering are responsive to climatic factors (i.e. rainfall) and imports of beef. Animal demographics, producer price of yellow maize and the producer price of beef were found not to have a short-run effect on cattle marketed for slaughtering.","[Ogundeji, A.

To this effect, the identification of those competences which are compatible with the needs of the real economy may serve as a solid basis for developing adequate curricula and obtaining remarkable educational outcomes reflected in the graduates' performance as entry level employees. It is undeniably true that the said competences must meet the standards set by the real economy or by the regulations of accreditation bodies. The process by which these standards are defined or identified requires a strong sense of coherence between the academic curriculum and the needs of employers, as basis for the graduates' comprehensive training in knowledge based economy. In this context, we set to conduct an exploratory research by means of which we may emphasize how the corporate world perceive the marketing training received by the entry-level employees as graduates of professional higher education institutions, and how to adjust the curriculum to improve graduates employability. The survey was conducted by using the face-to-face questionnaire administration. Data were collected in the Transylvania counties during October 2010, as part of a field survey. The employer's perception, as highlighted by the answers received from the surveyed corporate entities, gives us reasons to state that practical experience cannot be substituted for the academic training in knowledge based economy; it can, however, strengthen its fundamental role in establishing the guidelines of moral and professional conduct such as learning and the theoretical approach to some practical situations of the real economy. Moreover, we appreciate that a continuous correlation between the practical needs and the academic training is imperative.","[Plaias, Ioan; Pop, Ciprian-Marcel; Babut, Raluca; Dabija, Dan-Cristian] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Dabija, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",cristian.dabija@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Babut, Raluca/ABC-1612-2020; Dabija, Dan-Cristian/I-8101-2012; Pop, Marcel Ciprian/U-6186-2017","Dabija, Dan-Cristian/0000-0002-8265-175X;",,,,,35,19,19,0,36,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2011,13.0,30,,,,,448,463,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,860DP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297929000009,0

Two broad strands of theoretical literature explain collateral as arising from the existence of either ex ante private information or ex post incentive problems between borrowers and lenders. However, the extant empirical literature has been unable to isolate each of these effects. This paper attempts to do so using a credit registry that is unique in that it allows the researcher to have access to some private information about borrower risk that is unobserved by the lender. The data also include public information about borrower risk, loan contract terms, and ex post performance for both secured and unsecured loans. The results suggest that the ex post theories of collateral are empirically dominant, although the ex ante theories are also valid for customers with short borrower-lender relations that are relatively unknown to the lender.

The return impact of fund flows is stronger when funds embrace liquidity risk, when market liquidity is low, and when funding liquidity, as measured by the Treasury-Eurodollar spread, aggregate hedge fund flows, and prime broker stock returns, is tight. In keeping with an agency explanation, funds with strong incentives to raise capital, low manager option deltas, and no manager capital co-invested are more likely to take on excessive liquidity risk.

The empirical literature indicates that institutional herding positively predicts short-term returns but negatively predicts long-term returns. We offer a theoretical resolution to this dichotomy. In our model, career-concerned money managers trade with security dealers endowed with market power and exhibit an endogenous tendency to imitate past trades. This tendency is exploited by dealers and thus affects prices. In equilibrium, institutional herding positively predicts short-term returns but negatively predicts long-term returns.

Consumer, supply chain and network analyses are critical to finding an optimal solution that is sustainable enough to meet the changing environment. Industry-specific information regarding the structure and function of the beef value chain was gathered through interviews with industry leaders and experts; and specific consumer information was gathered through a consumer survey. The South African beef industry, like many other South African supply chains, is challenged by the increasing complexity and demand brought about by globalisation, increased volumes and competition, the shortage of skilled staff and pressures to meet changing customer needs. Consequently, the power has shifted from the supply side to the consumer. Although the industry has a good reputation, good management practices can further increase consumer confidence in beef.","[Labuschagne, Anita] Uitkyk Vleismark, ZA-0184 Silverton, South Africa; [Louw, Andre; Ndanga, Leah] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Labuschagne, A (通讯作者)，Uitkyk Vleismark, 165 Blvd St, ZA-0184 Silverton, South Africa.",anita@uitkykvleismark.co.za; andrelouw@up.ac.za; lzbndanga@tuks.co.za,,,,,,,29,5,8,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,MAR,2011,50.0,1,,,,,71,88,,10.1080/03031853.2011.562675,0.0,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,783XL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292118100005,0

They also pose new challenges to established firms, who need to reconfigure their capabilities. Drawing upon the resource-based view and contingency theory, we test a model of fit between environmental requirements and integrated solutions capabilities in the IT sector. We used the model to interpret the current industry structure and analyze its dynamics. The analysis suggests the existence of four different configurations and indicates that differences in fit between environmental variables and strategic choices partially account for performance differences among integrated solution providers. The results also suggest that, although the provision of bundled products and services confers some a priori advantages to IS providers over generic IT firms, these advantages are greater for firms that are able to align their capabilities to the characteristics of their operational environment.","[Ceci, Federica] Univ G DAnnunzio, Chieti, Italy; [Masini, Andrea] HEC Paris, Dept Management, Paris, France",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris,"Ceci, F (通讯作者)，Univ G DAnnunzio, Chieti, Italy.",f.ceci@unich.it; masini@hec.fr,"CECI, Federica/N-7217-2014","CECI, Federica/0000-0002-6998-8534",,,,,84,62,65,0,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The findings show that most households in our study areas are expected to be structurally chronic and structurally transient poor. This underlines the importance of asset formation for long-term poverty reduction strategies.

Using reasonable estimates of risk premiums, we find that risk-adjusted U.S. CEO pay does not appear to be large compared to that of U.K. CEOs. We also examine differences in pay and equity incentives between a sample of non-U.K. European CEOs and a matched sample of U.S. CEOs, and find that risk-adjusting pay may explain about half of the apparent higher pay for U.S. CEOs.

Illiquidity increases and the difference between spreads of long- and short-term bonds significantly widens during recessions, suggesting a flight to liquidity, wherein investors shift into the more liquid short-term bonds during economic contractions. Macroeconomic variables such as inflation and federal funds rates forecast off-the-run illiquidity significantly but have only modest forecasting ability for on-the-run illiquidity. Bond returns across maturities are forecastable by off-the-run but not on-the-run bond illiquidity.

Taking into consideration that globalization tends to quickly standardize technologies and to equalize the rates of profits, the area of competitive advantage is extended beyond the area of economic factors (product differentiation, cost reduction, etc.) in interferential areas, where factors such as social responsibility assumed by corporations become levers to increase competitiveness. Corporate social responsibility circumscribes the company's set of obligations to the stakeholders (individuals, groups or organizations that are directly or indirectly affected by the actions, goals and policies of the corporation) in a certain system of reference. The multiple groups that make up the reference society of a corporation lead to a multitude of expectations. The legitimacy of these expectations embraces various degrees of validity. Responsibility is a continuous dynamic process meant to harmonize and balance the interests of various groups and the roles they play in relation to and for the purpose of the common good. So far, no system of indicators has been unanimously accepted and no methodology has been crystallized for measuring the effect of the social effort made in the sphere of social responsibility. Nevertheless, research performed over the past years has shown that an ethical behaviour involved in the issues of the natural, social and business environment has an obvious positive influence on the reputation and sales of the corporations. The corporations' competitive strategies should include - apart from specific goals such as market share, product differentiation or smart promotion - the goal of harmonizing stakeholder expectations. In this context, the commitment to social responsibility becomes an important pillar in gaining the partners' and the public's confidence, along with a recognition that would strengthen the company's market position and its commitment to a competitive sustainable approach.","[Miron, Dumitru; Petcu, Monica; Sobolevschi, Iulia Maria] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Sobolevschi, IM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",iulia.david@kgaudit.ro,"Miron, Dumitru/AAW-4320-2020; Miron, Dumitru/C-6816-2012","Miron, Dumitru/0000-0003-0606-6329;",,,,,26,23,24,1,62,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2011,13.0,29,,,,,162,179,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,710QA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286525100012,0

During the past decade, many institutional portfolio managers added commodity derivatives as an asset class to their portfolios. This addition was part of a larger shift in portfolio strategy away from traditional equity investment and toward derivatives based on assets such as real estate and commodities. Institutional investors' use of commodity futures to hedge against stock market risk is a relatively recent phenomenon. Trading in commodity derivatives also increased along with the rapid expansion of trading in all derivative markets. This trading was directly related to the search for higher yields in a low interest rate environment. The growth was both in organized exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) trading, but the gross market value of OTC trading was an order of magnitude greater. This growth is important to note because a critical factor in the recent crisis was counterparty failure in OTC trading of mortgage derivatives.

The study also focused on sensitivity of the project toward kraft paper price, container marked price and corrugated paper marked price. Data was obtained from the user of corrugated paper, manufacturers in Eastern region, Thai Packaging Association, Thai Pulp and Paper Industries Association. The analytical formats used in this study were Net Present Value (NPV), Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The general condition of corrugated container industry in Thailand is a continuous industry from the pulp and kraft paper industry. The main materials used for production are short fiber pulp, long fiber pulp, and waste paper pulp. Short fiber pulp and waste paper pulp can be obtained domestically while long fiber pulp has to be imported. Most production capacity of pulp industry is kraft paper which has been used for manufacturing corrugated container. The large, medium and small-sized manufacturers own the market share approximately 60, 20 and 20% respectively. According to financial study, it was founded that this project has a good potential interest for investment where discount rates were 8, 10 and 12% per year, respectively, the NPVB of the project were 382.77, 297.32 and 223.10 million THB respectively and the BCR were 1.0402, 1.0339 and 1.0275 respectively. The IRR was 20.36% per year and PBP was 4.93 years. The sensitivity analysis of this project was founded that the project was capable to be invested in any cases. However, the following cases were found less interest to be invested: kraft paper price is increased by 5% and kraft paper price and marked price of corrugated paper are increased by 5% while corrugated containers' marked price is decreased by 5%. The NPVB in this study showed negative result while BCR less than 1 and IRR. less than discount rate (DR) in any cases, suggested that the cost of Kraft paper significantly affects the project. When the Kraft paper price increased, the entrepreneurs have to increase the marked prices of corrugated container and corrugated container paper in order to reduce the impacts. To improve production process with the lowest production cost can help to reduce these impacts. The production capacity, the characteristics of customers and the types of competitors are the important factors which need to be well considered in order to improve the investments as there are many types of corrugated container plants. The increase of supply in the market resulted in high competition for market share acquisition and consequently the marked price decreases. The manufacturers should seek for the methods to distinguish themselves in products and services in order to maintain the price and the numbers of customer.","[Buatama, Urasa] King Mongkuts Inst Technol Ladkrabang, Adm & Management Coll, Bangkok, Thailand",King Mongkuts Institute of Technology Ladkrabang,,kburasa@kmitl.ac.th,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9925-7,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,16.0,,,,,,119,122,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEW95,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000318459200022,0

Intercultural communication or the communication between people belonging to different cultures can be considered a pre-condition of the human co-existence. It refers to sharing the information on different levels, between people with different cultural backgrounds, including here both the national differences and those related to the involvement in different activities. In terms of interrelation, such differences can lead to misinterpretations. The process of interpretation of the entire complex of signs which inevitably accompanies communication (facial expressions, gestures, posture, vocal inflexions etc.), being achieved by each participant, has as a result the co-creation of the meanings. When the beneficiary of such a signs change are speakers of the same language, there is a chance that the co-created meanings in the process of communication to correspond to the intended destination.

Our findings suggest that state control in the period under research is correlated with decreasing, or even negative performance of companies. The efficiency of the state-owned companies was much lower than that of the privately owned.

The subject matter is framed by the phenomenon of mass communication in globalized society. The present disembeddedness of the social human world is also reflected in the emphasis on local communication, although it is implemented through the means of mass communication. The main question of this study is whether local newspapers perform the role of an intermediary in providing information about activities related to local development. This issue also indirectly affects the question of the actorship of local media in regional development. Within the empirical study, a quantitative approach to media content was used. Overall, 535 articles were analysed and official press news covering information on (a) towns and their activities enhancing the quality of life of local inhabitants; (b) projects that were implemented in terms of public interest; (c) projects of investors focused on education with the links to the sphere of public services; (d) projects of a permanent nature related to the construction of public facilities. In addition to this, semi-standardized interviews with mayors of the relevant towns, who represented publishers of local newspapers, were used. The object of the study was the newspapers issued in local areas of the selected rural regions - Susicko (Susicke noviny, Kasperskohorsky zpravodaj, Horazdovicky obzor). The results of the analysis provide information about the extent and main topics of articles with the above-mentioned issues presented in the newspapers during 2008-2010.

Global circuits have swept away the accustomed networks of information, production and marketing which had been largely established and maintained by comprehensive governmental support policies. New institutions have come into the picture establishing the links between small producers and larger markets. With state policy strengthening the domination of the market, prices and demand patterns fluctuate widely leaving small producers vulnerable to market forces and raising the level of risk and insecurity. This situation brings about a rapid de-ruralization of the population in most regions of the country. In the fertile coastal strip of the southern and western provinces, however, commercial opportunities introduced by global circuits have led to a thriving market in products, land, and labour. Farming of vegetables and fruits for domestic and European markets dominate agricultural production. Seasonal employment, in tourism and in labour-intensive crops, supplement household incomes, permitting the rural population to remain in the countryside.","[Keyder, Caglar] Bogazici Univ, Ataturk Inst Modern Turkish Hist, Istanbul, Turkey; [Keyder, Caglar] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Sociol, Binghamton, NY 13901 USA; [Yenal, Zafer] Bogazici Univ, Dept Sociol, Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Bogazici University,"Keyder, Ç (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Ataturk Inst Modern Turkish Hist, Istanbul, Turkey.",keyder@boun.edu.tr; zyenal@boun.edu.tr,,,,,,,77,77,85,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Mackie provided effective leadership and quiet inspiration for the development of Indonesian and Asian studies in three of Australia's top universities and throughout the nation. His intellectual contribution ranged across politics, international relations and economics. He urged students, fellow scholars, policy makers and the broader community to remember the historical basis of events in the region, strove to understand what 'makes things tick' in Indonesia and promoted racial tolerance in Australia. His style was low-key and personal, mentoring individuals and bringing together groups of like-minded people. While not dodging difficult issues, he was generally optimistic that sensible and sensitive approaches would enable Australia to live in greater harmony with its neighbours.","[Manning, Chris; Maxwell, John] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Manning, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

However, there is lack of research focus on the supply chain between and within the organizations. The study is conducted with the intention to examine the collaborative supply chain management in the nanotechnology industry. Therefore, specifically this paper sets out to defme the current state of Collaborative Supply Chain Management in the Malaysian Nanotechnology Industry. Even though it has been discovered through the literature that SCM is a system that improves competitiveness of the organizations, there are still problems related to it, such as inventory shortage or excess, long supplier lead times, under-utilized warehouse and bottlenecks in the supply chain, which influence supply chain effectiveness. Nanotechnology organizations should be more flexible, productive and fast in producing the product, in light of changes in customers' demand behavior. This study is cross-sectional and used a qualitative approach to get a more insightful explanation.

Therefore, only after 2000 we can state that Romania had real environmental taxes but how are often modified both as way of determination and imposing base, things that have generated lack of trust and even panic among the economic agents. In this context the paper aims to show the environmental taxes role in forming Romania's budgetary resources by studying the first registration tax.

Although the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 prohibits financial compensation for organs for transplant, we focus on the impact of laws that influence the relative cost of deceased and live organ donations on the supply of organs for transplant. First, we hypothesize that states that have relatively stringent funeral regulations, which have been associated with higher whole-body donations, will have fewer organ donations. Second, we examine the impact of two common state laws that offer financial compensation to live donors: one that allows a tax deduction for costs incurred and the other which entitles government employees up to 30 days of paid leave.

The extent of deviation from RIP is therefore an indicator of the lack of product and financial market integration. This paper investigates whether the nominal exchange rate regime has an impact on RIP. The analysis is based on 15 annual real interest rates and covers a long time span, 1870-2006. Four subperiods are distinguished and linked to fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes: the Gold Standard, the interwar float, the Bretton Woods system and the current managed float. Panel integration techniques are applied to increase the power of the tests, where cross section correlation is embedded via common factor structures. The results suggest that RIP holds as a long run condition irrespectively of the nominal exchange rate regime. However, adjustment towards RIP is affected by both the institutional framework and the historical episode. Half lives of shocks tend to be lower under fixed exchange rates and in the first part of the sample. Although barriers to trade and capital controls have been removed, they did not lead to lower half lives during the managed float. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To answer this question, we propose a simple structural model that enables us to identify the effects of liquidity facilities during financial turmoil. Specifically, we develop a model that examines the effects of the Bank of Japan's (BoJ's) commercial paper (CP) operations on the CP primary market. On the basis of the structural model, we measure the effects of CP operations as differences between the actual rates in the primary market and the counterfactual rates without the operations, and decompose the effects into three factors. We apply our model to identifying the effects of CP operations from October 2008 to May 2009, including the period after the BoJ introduced the outright purchase of CP and its special funds-supplying operation accepting CPs as collateral in addition to the CP repo operation. Our results suggest that the CP repo operation and the outright purchase of CP had marked effects initially; however, these effects were subdued subsequently. Moreover, the effects of the special funds-supplying operation were substantial and persistent from January to April 2009.","[Hirose, Yasuo] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University,"Hirose, Y (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",yhirose@econ.keio.ac.jp,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1367-0271,,,INT FINANC,Int.

We consider a three-country model, where an FTA is formed between a country exporting a final good and a country exporting an intermediate good. The FTA unambiguously leads to a reduction in the member country's tariff, but may cause the non-member country's tariff level to increase. In the case, where ETA raises the non-member country's tariff level, the FTA increases that country's welfare. In contrast, the FTA may render its member countries better off.

Wealthier individuals can bear the risk better, and invest less in self-insurance with two states of the world. Self-insurance, like insurance, is thus an inferior good. This known result does not extend to many states. The reason is that an increase in self-insurance does not necessarily reduce final wealth in good states and increase it in bad states. Self-insurance thus may not act as insurance, and wealthier individuals may not necessarily invest less in self-insurance. The paper proposes a condition under which self-insurance is inferior, and a condition under which it is normal.

The sample for the study includes high-school students. They were selected using cluster sampling method and the data were collected by face to face interviews. The scales were tested by exploratoty factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and reliability analysis and the hypotheses were tested using regression analysis. The results show that Turkish adolescents are highly skeptical in their attitudes toward advertising. It has been also found that parents and peers play an important role in shaping adolescents' skeptical attitudes. However there is no significant relationship between the extent of television watching and skeptical attitudes toward advertising. Parents and peer environments, especially concept-oriented communication among family members, positively affect the market knowledge of adolescents. The behavioral consequences of adolescents' disbelief of ads have also been tested. Turkish adolescents rely on other information sources (Such as; consumer continents, parents, peers, internet, etc.) rather than television advertisements when they make a decision to purchase any product.","Mustafa Kemal Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Isletme Bolumu, Antakya, Turkey",Mustafa Kemal University,"Ural, T (通讯作者)，Mustafa Kemal Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Isletme Bolumu, Tayfur Sokmen Kampusu, Antakya, Turkey.",tulin57@yahoo.com,"Ural, Tulin/AAX-8850-2021",,,,,,42,2,2,1,24,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

On the other hand, intensified financial linkages in a world of increasing capital mobility may also harbour the risk of cross-border financial contagion. This paper provides a survey of high-frequency indicators to monitor the development of equity market integration in Asia. The results show that after slowing down between 2002 and 2006, the equity market integration process picked up again in 2007-08. Nevertheless, the process is not complete and the degrees of integration between mature and emerging equity markets are different.

Debt issuers have significantly higher stock market liquidity than size and book-to-market matched counterparts, and differences in liquidity are largest for the worst-performing groups of issuers. When we additionally match on liquidity or when we include a liquidity factor in the model for expected returns, the evidence of underperformance disappears.

To solve this curious case we tell a detective story: evidence of a phenomenon to be explained, a parade of suspects, a process of elimination from the enquiry, and then the denouement. Given the draconian family planning policy and a common perception that there is strong son preference in rural China, we postulate two main hypotheses: income-based sex selection making it more likely that richer households have sons, and an incentive for households with sons to raise their income. Tests of each hypothesis are conducted. Taken as a whole, the tests cannot reject either hypothesis but they tend to favour the incentive hypothesis; and there is evidence in support of the channels through which the incentive effect might operate. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test these hypotheses against each other in rural China and more generally in developing countries.","[Knight, John] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Shi, Li; Deng Quheng] Beijing Normal Univ, Dept Econ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",University of Oxford; Beijing Normal University,"Knight, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",john.knight@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,18,21,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

However, during periods of higher volatility, the advantages of speedier execution, anonymity and information efficiency may be offset by arbitrage risks; as a result, larger pricing errors are observed in the E-mini markets.

We find that CEOs whose wealth is more sensitive to stock return volatility due to their option holdings are more likely to choose debt over equity as a capital-raising vehicle. More importantly, the pattern holds not only in firms that are underlevered relative to their optimal capital structure but also in overlevered firms. This evidence is inconsistent with executive stock options aligning the interests of managers and shareholders; rather, it supports the hypothesis that stock options sometimes make managers take on too much risk and in the process pursue suboptimal capital structure policies.

One of the core topics is how emotions affect decision-making. Developments in economic models of decision-making have been influenced by technological innovations and empirical findings in cognitive neuroscience. Now, a recent approach in cognitive neuroscience, often referred to as imaging genetics, promises to make significant contributions to our understanding of both behavioral and neural aspects of value-based decision-making. Recent work has demonstrated the role of neurotransmitter alterations in clinical states such as Parkinson's disease, depression and anxiety, and how this may affect decision behavior. However, these insights are limited through their focus on extreme neuropathology, which sheds little light on similar functions in healthy individuals. Here, we present and discuss studies of the role of drug-induced and genetically driven changes in neurotransmitter levels, and their effects on value-based decision-making. Following this, we argue that in healthy subjects, individual variance in decision behavior can be explained by such genetic factors, and gene-environment interactions. We suggest that this development should be used in neuroeconomic research in order to both improve behavioral models, by stressing the biological nature of individual variance, and through the improvement of our general understanding of the brain basis of value-based decision-making.

This article investigates the use of a signing bonus as a tool for firms to signal to prospective employees: when they are uncertain regarding their fit with the firm, the signing bonus can serve as a credible signal of the firm's belief of said fit. The theory suggests that we should expect signing bonuses to be more common and larger when the economy is stronger, when employees are less certain of how well they will fit at the firm, when the quality of fit (known to the firm) is higher, and when performance pay is present. Employees receiving a signing bonus work harder, so the signing bonus also serves as an incentive device. This article also presents the first broad empirical look at the use of the signing bonus across industries and time.

We model default as controlled by a Cox process with a stochastic arrival rate. When default occurs, the stock price drops to zero. Prior to default, the stock price follows a jump-diffusion process with stochastic volatility. The instantaneous default rate and variance rate follow a bivariate continuous process, with its joint dynamics specified to capture the observed behavior of stock option prices and credit default swap spreads. Under this joint specification, we propose a tractable valuation methodology for stock options and credit default swaps. We estimate the joint risk dynamics using data from both markets for eight companies that span five sectors and six major credit rating classes from B to AAA. The estimation highlights the interaction between market risk (return variance) and credit risk (default arrival) in pricing stock options and credit default swaps.","[Wu, Liuren] CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Sch Business, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Carr, Peter] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); New York University,"Wu, LR (通讯作者)，CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Sch Business, 1 Bernard Baruch Way,B10-225, New York, NY 10010 USA.",liuren.wu@baruch.cuny.edu,"Wu, Liuren/HGD-6691-2022",,,,,,64,83,91,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

These two reforms increase the number of diplomas available in higher education and expand opportunities to apply for a higher level of diploma than before. As a consequence, characteristics of graduates in terms of social background, and educational and geographic origins are modified. The individual data from Cereq's surveys Generation 1998 and Generation 2004 matched with exhaustive data files about university participants allow us to show that these developments have affected the wage situation of graduates. Indeed, characteristics related to the average composition of graduates for each diploma influence the individual wage. Moreover, these compositional characteristics of graduates seem to be more highly considered in the latest generation because of the supposedly employers' lack of information on expected skills and competencies provided by new degrees. Their influence indirectly translates into the reduction of the wage returns to diplomas once the compositional variables are taken into account. In this regard, the decrease in the wage returns to diplomas suggests that components of sorting related to the abilities of graduates come into play in the assessment of individual titles on the market, especially for diplomas affected by institutional reforms.","[Dupray, Arnaud] Ctr Etud & Rech Qualificat Cereq, F-13567 Marseille 02, France; [Moullet, Stephanie] Univ Mediterranee, Inst Reg Travail Aix en Provence, Marseille, France; [Moullet, Stephanie] CNRS, UMR6123, LEST, F-13626 Aix En Provence, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Dupray, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Etud & Rech Qualificat Cereq, 10 Pl de la Joliette,BP 21321, F-13567 Marseille 02, France.",dupray@cereq.fr; stephanie.moullet@univmed.fr,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,8,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

A random sample of 1033 residents in a regional Australian city were surveyed by mail on a number of variables including subjective well-being, sense of community, attitudes toward their political officials, civic participation, perceptions of city life, and socio-demographics. Three general findings are reported. First, income had a significant influence on well-being, but individuals' perceptions of their access to health services had a larger effect. Second, we found that the relationship between well-being and some of its determinants (e.g., health service perceptions) varied significantly between low and high levels of income at the household level and at the regional level. Finally, reference group income was not a significant predictor of well-being in any of the analyses we conducted. These results are discussed in light of the results from previous research in this area. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, efficient value-added approach firms are less likely to go insolvent, while firms characterized as efficient by the flow approach are generally more likely to fail.

The Asperger syndrome is a complex autism syndrome leading to restrictions in people's (non-)verbal communication, imagination, and acquisition and maintenance of social contacts. Exploratory consumer behaviour is defined as the behaviour to discover and to try new products or services. The results show that higher Autism-Spectrum Quotient scores, indicating the Asperger syndrome, lead to lower tendencies for exploratory consumer behaviour, both in general and on six of the seven subscales (repetitive behaviour proneness, innovativeness, risk taking, exploration through shopping, interpersonal communication, and brand switching). Asperger is not a distinct disorder, but many people have a few autism characteristics. This means that these results are relevant for a much larger group than just the people with an Asperger-syndrome diagnosis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[van Raaij, W.

On both of these questions, we answer in the affirmative, arguing that people's fairness views are based on both general rules and the context, where context refers to the set of variables and persons employed to interpret and apply the principles. The fairness rules analyzed are accountability (i.e., rewards that are proportional to contributions individuals control), efficiency, need and equality. We conclude that stakeholders typically exhibit a fairness bias, i.e., they tend, consciously or not, to interpret and apply fairness principles in a self-serving manner, whereas the views of spectators, or impartial third parties, tend to converge significantly more. Further, we argue that fairness considerations are relevant to both descriptive and prescriptive analysis in environmental economics. These fairness concerns are reflected in the behavior of private and public decision-makers and have potentially important policy implications through the overall social objective function.","[Johansson-Stenman, Olof; Konow, James] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Konow, James] Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA",University of Gothenburg; Loyola Marymount University,"Johansson-Stenman, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Olof.Johansson@economics.gu.se; jkonow@lmu.edu,,"Johansson-Stenman, Olof/0000-0003-4460-4765",,,,,86,66,71,0,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

However, in contrast to Santos-Paulino and Thirlwall (2004), who found a robustly negative impact of trade liberalization on the overall trade balance, we find only mixed evidence of such a negative impact. In particular, we find little evidence of a statistically significant negative impact using our first measure of liberalization dates, which extends Li (2004). Using a second measure of liberalization dates compiled by Wacziarg and Welch (2003), we find some evidence that liberalization worsens the trade balance, but the evidence is not robust across different estimation specifications, and the estimated impact is smaller than that reported by Santos-Paulino and Thirlwall (2004).

When ageing advances, gerontocracies and social planners gradually substitute publicly provided goods aimed at the mobile young population for publicly provided goods for the elderly. This substitution process does not only depend on the ageing itself but also on crowding effects and on the regional distribution of the elderly population. We show that fiscal competition prevents the exploitation of the young. When the share of the elderly is sufficiently large, the utility of the young is even higher in gerontocracies than in welfare maximizing societies. Due to fiscal competition, the gerontocracies will provide even more of the publicly provided good for the young than the social planner. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The result of this infiltration has been a gradual loss of bureaucratic autonomy to pursue the public interest. The web of relationships developed between private interests and the two dominant political parties has eroded both the efficacy of public administration and the dynamism of the private sector as incumbent firms and public- (or quasipublic-) sector functionaries have been using their power to prevent the birth of new firms and to raid the state coffers. The upshot of this process has been the emergence of permanently large budget and current account deficits, which have in turn driven Greece's foreign indebtedness to alarming levels, necessitating the current bailout by the EU, ECB, and IMF.","[Moutos, Thomas] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Moutos, T (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Patission 76, Athens 10434, Greece.",tmoutos@aueb.gr,"Moutos, Thomas/AAE-2552-2022",,,,,,47,10,10,1,13,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2010,66.0,2,,,,,170,U1,,10.1628/001522110X524205,0.0,,,37,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,643SY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281320500005,0

High levels of inequality have been shown to hamper further reductions in poverty as well as economic growth, and local inequality has been shown to affect such outcomes as violence and health. The study of inequality at the local level is thus crucial for understanding the economic wellbeing of a country. Local measures of inequality have been difficult to obtain, but recent theoretical advances have enabled the combination of survey and census data to generate estimates of inequality that are robust at disaggregated geographic levels. We employ this methodology to produce consistent and precise estimates of inequality for every county in Chile.

However, by treating appropriately the auxiliary state variables that characterize the timeless perspective equilibrium when evaluating policy performance, this paper shows that discretionary policymaking can be superior to timeless perspective policymaking and identifies model features that make this outcome more likely. Using standard New Keynesian DSGE models, discretion is found to dominate timeless perspective policymaking when the price/wage Phillips curves are relatively flat, due, perhaps, to firm-specific capital (or labor) and/or Kimball (1995) aggregation in combination with nominal rigidities. These results suggest that studies applying the timeless perspective might also usefully compare its performance to discretion, paying careful attention to how policy performance is evaluated.

Further, this paper depicts the turning points of hot and cold periods across the period from 1994 to 2005 for each observation. The cycles detected by the number of IPOs per month are the benchmark and then these cycles' robustness is tested by the other observations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we empirically investigate the performance of using historical volatility to forecast long-term stock return volatility in comparison with a number of alternative forecasting methods. In analyzing forecasting errors and their impact on reported income due to option expensing, we find that historical volatility is a poor forecast for long-term volatility and that shrinkage adjustment toward comparable-firm volatility only slightly improves its performance. Forecasting performance can be improved substantially by incorporating both long memory and comovements with common market factors. We also experiment with a simple mixed-horizon realized volatility model and find its long-term forecasting performance to be more accurate than historical forecasts but less accurate than long-memory forecasts.","[Jiang, George J.] Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Tian, Yisong S.] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",University of Arizona; York University - Canada,"Jiang, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, POB 210108, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",gjiang@eller.arizona.edu; ytian@ssb.yorku.ca,,,,,,,44,4,4,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Investments over transboundary water cannot be always protected by suitable contractual arrangements because countries' actions cannot be monitored and enforced by a third party. In such a case, the traditional literature predicts that cooperation rarely emerges due to the risk of ex-post opportunistic behaviours by the parties. This prediction does not provide a satisfactory representation of many real-world situations in which riparian countries have demonstrated a remarkable ability to cooperate over their shared water resources. This paper shows that it is possible to reconcile the empirical evidence with the theoretical approach if one assumes that countries display some concern for 'fairness' when negotiating, which depends on their initial level of investment. Within the proposed framework, the incentives to cooperate turn out to be higher than traditional literature predicts because, by engaging in the investment project, countries do not only increase the amount of water effectively available, but also-through their concern for fairness-the share of water obtainable at the bargaining table.","[Marchiori, Carmen] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Marchiori, Carmen] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Marchiori, Carmen] Fdn ENI E Mattei, Venice, Italy",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Fondazione Mattei,"Marchiori, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",c.marchiori@lse.ac.uk,,"MARCHIORI, Carmen/0000-0001-6793-0278",,,,,24,4,5,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The present paper investigates the impact of relationship characteristics, family ownership and their interaction effects upon the use of collateral in SME lending. We examine the determinants of collateral as well as the determinants of the choice between business and personal collateral using decision tree analysis. The results reveal that relationship characteristics have a significant influence, but not always in the direction as expected. Moreover, they do not seem to be the primary determinants in our classification models. The most important determinants in both classification models seem to be the loan amount, total assets and the family versus non-family firm distinction.

Using race-level data from NASCAR events, we find strong evidence that a major safety regulation has led to more on-track accidents and an increased risk to both spectators and pit crew members.","[Pope, Adam T.] Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Kansas City, MO 64112 USA; [Tollison, Robert D.] Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City; Clemson University,"Pope, AT (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, 1 Mem Dr, Kansas City, MO 64112 USA.",adam.pope@kc.frb.org; rtollis@clemson.edu,,,,,,,15,11,13,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2010,142.0,3-4,,,,,507,513,,10.1007/s11127-009-9548-2,0.0,,,7,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,552WW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274326200026,0

The authors correctly suggest this in-game betting market provides an opportunity to examine the efficiency of gambling markets, as the value of the security being examined can be known with a greater degree of precision than the fundamental value of securities being traded in general financial markets. While we appreciate the progress that has occurred, we believe that with some fairly simple changes, the authors may be able to improve the precision of their model to the point where a more powerful commentary on potential market efficiency could be developed. We offer suggestions on more precisely matching of the two sources of data, timing of the events, and dealing with games in which there is a clear pre-game favorite.

We formalize this notion by incorporating unemployment persistence into a two-sided escape clause model of currency crises. We show that unemployment persistence makes a currency peg more fragile and undermines the credibility of the monetary authority in a dynamic setting. The fragility is captured by a devaluation premium in expectations that increases the average inflation rate when the currency peg is more vulnerable to 'busts' than 'booms'. This interaction between macroeconomic and microeconomic rigidities suggests that a policy reform can only be consistent if it renders either exchange rates or the economy more flexible.,"[Castren, Olli] European Cent Bank, DG Econ, Frankfurt, Germany; [Takalo, Tuomas] Univ Jyvaskyla, Bank Finland, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Takalo, Tuomas] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Wood, Geoffrey] City Univ, Cass Business Sch, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales",European Central Bank; Bank of Finland; University of Jyvaskyla; University of Jyvaskyla; Bangor University; City University London,"Castrén, O (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, DG Econ, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,30,3,4,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0036-9292,,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Building on fairness heuristic theory, we predicted that particularly low trust in authorities makes people carefully attend to the fairness with which the tax office enacts procedures. This should result in positive procedural fairness effects on endorsement of norms prescribing taxpaying and, consequently, in voluntary tax compliance, particularly among citizens with low trust in authorities. Results from an experiment and a field study revealed converging support for these predictions. We conclude that high trust in authorities forms an important boundary condition to the effectiveness of procedural fairness as a tool to enhance tax compliance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In 12 of these areas, innovation is particularly concentrated in a single, large firm; we refer to such locations as company towns. We find that inventors employed by large firms in these locations tend to draw disproportionately from their firm's own prior inventions (as measured by citations to their own prior patents) relative to what would be expected given the underlying distribution of innovative activity across all inventing firms in a particular technology field. Furthermore, we find such inventors are more likely to build upon the same prior inventions year after year. However, smaller firms in company towns do not exhibit this myopic behavior: they draw upon prior inventions as broadly as their small-firm counterparts in more diverse locations. In addition, we find that inventions by large firms in company towns have less impact than those produced elsewhere, although the difference is modest, and that the impact is disproportionately appropriated by the inventing firms themselves. Finally, the geographic scope of impact realized by company town inventions is narrower, whether produced by large or small firms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We examine whether information generated from stock price volatility influences managers' incentives to engage in earnings management. Consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis, we find that suspected earnings-management firms do not appear to be more mispriced than others. In addition, using idiosyncratic volatility as a measure of private information embedded in stock price, we find that negative real earnings management, which allows REITs to circumvent the mandatory dividend payout requirement, is associated with greater information embedded in REIT stock prices. The result implies that information contained in stock price volatility motivates REIT managers to more actively avoid regulatory costs.","[Ambrose, Brent W.; Bian, Xun] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Ambrose, BW (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",bwa10@psu.edu; xxb100@psu.edu,"Ambrose, Brent/C-8531-2017","Ambrose, Brent/0000-0001-5977-3663; Bian, Xun/0000-0002-4372-9382",,,,,59,14,15,0,22,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,2691-1175,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

Thus, the bathroom can be regarded as the last domain of privacy in today's housing, and in a number of new dwellings this quality is exploited in new ways.

Using US data on manufacturing wages and import exposure, we explore whether increased competition, in the form of a heightened exposure to imports, reduces the racial wage gap. Our findings support Becker's contention. We find that import exposure helped narrow the racial wage gap by about 1.4 percentage points between 1983 and 1993. The effect is especially pronounced among the most disadvantaged: unskilled Southern workers.

In this paper we test for the relevance of financial market characteristics in explaining this divergence in the catching-up process in Europe and Asia. We assume that the two regions constitute distinct convergence clubs, with the euro area and the United States respectively at their cores. In line with the theoretical literature, we find that better developed and more integrated financial markets increase emerging markets' ability to borrow abroad. Moreover, the degree of financial integration within the convergence clubs - as opposed to the state of financial integration in the global economy - and the extent of reserve accumulation are significant factors in explaining the divergent patterns of real convergence and the current account in the regions under review.","[Herrmann, Sabine] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Winkler, Adalbert] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank; European Central Bank,,sabine.herrmann@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-3-642-12515-7,,,,2010,,,,,,,123,+,,10.1007/978-3-642-12516-4_8,0.0,,,4,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BUC56,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288879000008,0

Significance of cross-border cooperation has increased mainly in the 2007 - 2013 programming period. These facts are also reflected within the aims of regional policy of the European Community for the 2007 - 2013 programming period. One of the reasons for support of cross-border cooperation is to decrease regional disparities between central and peripheral regions of nation states. The paper is focused on the realised cross-border projects within the small villages in the South Bohemia Region. At the basis of theoretical approaches to the regional development and cross-border cooperation are explored particular cross-border projects and their influence on the regional development. The main aim of the paper is to compare impacts of two different particular cross-border projects (one of them was realised in the 2007 - 2013 programming period as a small project, has local character and could be classified as cultural, second project was realised in the 2004 - 2006 programming period as a large project, has rather non-local character of its implementation and could be classified as projects of tourism industry) on the development of two small villages in the South Bohemia Region.

As a result of the research were identified similar and dissimilar features of realised projects and also factors of success of cross-border projects were specified.

Whether the rapid demographic changes in rural areas triggered by massive migration, possibly combined with propitious land and rural development policies, will ultimately produce the conditions for a more viable, high-return agriculture attracting larger investments remains to be seen.","[Miluka, Juna] Univ New York Tirana, Dept Econ Business & Adm Sci, Tirana, Albania; [Carletto, Gero] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Davis, Benjamin] UNICEF, Nairobi, Kenya; [Zezza, Alberto] FAO, I-00100 Rome, Italy",University of New York in Tirana; The World Bank; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Miluka, J (通讯作者)，Univ New York Tirana, Dept Econ Business & Adm Sci, Tirana, Albania.",junamiluka@unyt.edu.al,,"Zezza, Alberto/0000-0003-1842-1682",,,,,40,34,42,0,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

For example, 37% of all foreign firms involved in antidumping investigations in the US faced facts available margins for the 1995-2002 period, with average antidumping duties of 31% for cooperating foreign firms, compared to 87% for those who did not cooperate. The existing literature has focused on how DOC discretion has led to foreign firm non-cooperation. This paper instead examines individual foreign firm's decisions about whether to cooperate during this same period. We find evidence that non-cooperation is consistent with a model of foreign firms rationally choosing not to cooperate, rather than solely as a result of investigating authority bias against imports.","[Moore, Michael O.] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Moore, Michael O.] George Washington Univ, Inst Int Econ Policy, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Fox, Alan K.] US Int Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20436 USA",George Washington University; George Washington University,"Moore, MO (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, 1957 E St NW,Suite 502, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",mom@gwu.edu,,,,,,,14,4,4,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

In the first part I define Macek's approach to liberalism (his understanding of the basic notions, concept of the relationship between an individual and the society, idea of the relationship between socialism and liberalism and his interpretation of Adam Smith). My conclusion is that though Macek was a conscious socialist and he had limitations in respect to libertarian interpretation of the classic liberalism of the 19th century, he was at the same time to a considerable extent influenced by liberalism and he constantly oscillated on the threshold between socialism and liberalism. In the second part of the article I contemplate possible sources of inspiration of Macek's opinions - I primarily question the extent of the influence of F. Oppenheimer and J. M. Keynes - and, moreover, I consider the general ideological context in which Macek's opinions could be embedded. In this respect I conclude that Macek was influenced both by Oppenheimer as well as Keynes but by each of them in a different manner, on a diverse level of commonness and at a different moment. However, the liberal aspect of Macek's thinking far more likely grew out of his knowledge of Oppenheimer and some Anglo-Saxon authors, who have either never or seldom been put in context with Macek, than from his knowledge of Keynes.","Charles Univ Prague, UPOL Fac Arts, CZ-15800 Prague 5, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Polásek, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, UPOL Fac Arts, U Krize 8, CZ-15800 Prague 5, Czech Republic.",martin.polasek@ff.cuni.cz,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,16,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In our second Policy Dialogue, two climate change experts present contributions to the debate. This exchange could not be more timely, given Norway's recent offer of substantial development assistance to Indonesia in return for reductions in deforestation and forest degradation. In this first contribution, Adam Schwarz canvasses abatement options and outlines barriers to abatement and its measurement. These include capacity and data constraints, obstacles posed by decentralisation, and problems in identifying and measuring the costs of abatement measures. The author urges Indonesia to embrace the opportunity a lower carbon growth trajectory presents, and argues that this will require substantial additional funding, including from developed countries, and sustained leadership.

This is not simply a question of income distribution, but also involves basic issues of citizenship and democracy, and the full incorporation of all social strata into the active life of the city, not just for its own sake but also as a means of giving free rein to the creative powers of the citizenry at large. Creativity is not something that can be simply imported into the city on the backs of peripatetic computer hackers and assorted bohemians but must be organically developed through the complex interweaving of relations of production, work, and social life in specific urban contexts.

In the cooperative ownership environment of credit unions, the owners/members gain utility via the rates offered for loans and deposits. Credit union regulators also gain utility when mergers remove risky credit unions from the industry. We measure these utility gains using the event study method of Bauer [Bauer, K., 2008.

Less attention has been paid to the possibility that lack of awareness about adverse health effects of environmental pollution could also keep the demand low. We use a household Survey from urban India to estimate the effects of schooling, exposure to mass media, and other measures of awareness on home water purification.

We argue that the main reason for the failure of China's SIP is likely to have been the weak institutional environment in place at that time. We examine China's SIP in a more recent period in which the institutional environment was greatly improved. Using a matching sample method, we find that SIP firms continued to experience negative post-SIP profitability changes in our sample period. However, their performance decline was significantly less than that of their matched non-SIP SOEs. We also find that the introduction of the independent director rule helped to improve firm performance. Our results reconcile the findings of the SIP effect in China with international evidence and illustrate the importance of a developed capital market to ensuring the success of privatization schemes.

Optimal compensation designs maximize integrity at minimum cost. These designs are very low powered, i.e., while specifying a lower bound for performance and increasing pay with performance, they increase compensation at a rapidly decreasing rate. Thus, integrity considerations engender optimal compensation packages that closely resemble the very pervasive 80/120 bonus plans, exactly the sort of compensation that Jensen (2003) argues should compromise integrity. Under optimal designs, expected compensation increases linearly with firm size, and increases in the market/book ratio. Moreover, given optimal compensation, CEO asset diversion is limited to high market-to-book firms that have received negative productivity shocks.","[Noe, Thomas H.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Noe, Thomas H.] Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",University of Oxford; Tulane University,"Noe, TH (通讯作者)，Said Business Sch, Pk End St, Oxford OX1 1HP, England.",thomas.noe@sbs.ox.ac.uk,"Noe, Thomas/ABB-8061-2021","Noe, Thomas/0000-0003-4068-1202",,,,,28,3,5,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We propose a particularly method of privatization via auctions, where potentials investors submits a bid with equity shares and debt shares.

Also, only when U.S. Census measures are used is there evidence consistent with theoretical predictions that more-concentrated industries, which should be more oligopolistic, are populated by larger and fewer firms with higher price-cost margins. Further, the significant relations of Compustat-based industry concentration measures with the dependent variables of several important prior studies are not obtained when U.S. Census measures are used. One of the reasons for this occurrence is that Compustat-based measures proxy for industry decline.

The econometric analysis shows that more concentrated ownership can speed up growth, for countries approaching the technological frontier, provided that labor market regulation is sufficiently tight. In the absence of employment regulation, the logic of financial markets discipline applies and dispersed ownership appears as more favorable for growth. Based on econometric results, I calculate impact coefficients that allow to evaluate the growth points gained/lost following given variations in OC. This exercise reveals that a reform in the domain of ownership structure would have yielded, over the investigated period, sizeable effects in terms of growth. Importantly, these effects would have been unequally distributed across countries: Anglo-Saxon countries would have taken more advantage of deregulation (i.e. increased dispersion of ownership in a context of deregulated labor markets) while continental European countries would have benefited more from increased concentration of ownership in a context of reinforced labor regulation.","Univ Paris 13, CEPN, EEP, CEPREMAP, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France",Universite Paris 13,"Gatti, D (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, CEPN, EEP, CEPREMAP, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",gatti@pse.ens.fr,"Gatti, Donatella/GRO-6034-2022","Gatti, Donatella/0000-0003-2836-4335",,,,,54,8,9,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The networks compile personal identifying data (PID) so as to match transactors to transactions histories. Technological limitations cause the networks' data management practices to impact each other's incidence and costs of identity theft. Too much data collection and too little security arise in equilibrium with noncooperative networks compared to the efficient allocation. A number of potential remedies are analyzed: (1) reallocations of data-breach costs, (2) mandated security levels, and (3) mandated limits on the amount of data collected.

J,"Sotomayor, OJ",,,,"Sotomayor, Orlando J.",,,Changes in the Distribution of Household Income in Brazil: The Role of Male and Female Earnings,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,poverty; inequality; female labor force participation; Latin America; Brazil,INEQUALITY; WAGES,Annual survey data spanning three decades and a non-parametric technique for constructing counterfactual distributions are employed to analyze the relationship between earnings and the distribution of household income in Brazil. Results show that significant changes in the structure of female earnings reflecting rising wages and participation rates had limited equalizing consequences but considerable poverty-reducing effects. These developments counterbalanced poverty-increasing changes in the structure of male earnings. A stable macroeconomic environment was associated with a consistent but a limited fall in inequality and a strong decline in poverty mainly related to rising earnings among women at the lower end of the household income distribution.
