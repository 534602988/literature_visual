With millions more individuals gaining eligibility for adult Medicaid dental benefits, generating an unbiased estimate of the elasticity of demand for dental services is critical. The causal relationship between access to adult Medicaid dental benefits and usage of dental services for low-income adults is estimated, using difference-in-differences estimation procedures to exploit the state-level variation in adult Medicaid dental benefits. Results suggest that adult Medicaid dental benefits increase the probability of a dental visit within 12 months by 16.4-22 percent. A variety of robustness checks are invoked to confirm the finding.

The value of the information, however, is directly related to the completeness of the data entered for each patient over the course of time. The Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) is a Shire Human Genetic Therapies-sponsored, physician-directed registry of patients with Fabry disease, a rare, multisystem, lysosomal storage disorder, established in 2001. Objective and Methods: In 2005, measures were introduced to improve the completeness of data capture, including a focus on centers with 20 or more patients enrolled in the FOS, concentration on a limited number of core variables (i.e., serum creatinine, urinary protein, left ventricular mass [echocardiography], blood pressure [systolic and diastolic], pain, quality of life, and other Fabry disease-related signs and symptoms, as well as height and weight) and the introduction of Clinical Project Associates (CPAs) to facilitate data management by participating treatment centers. Results: An analysis of random samples of approximately 25% of patients in the registry in 2008 showed significant increases in data capture for most of the core variables examined. Conclusions: We conclude that the measures introduced in 2005 significantly improved the value of the information in the registry, which has contributed greatly to our understanding of patients' real-world experience with enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease.","[Clarke, Joe T.

The results show that community-level access to clean water is significantly associated with both water-relevant and irrelevant disease symptoms, which suggests that the correlation between community-level access to clean water and child health is at least partially due to endogenous project placement potentially with respect to unobserved community wealth. The paper concludes that the OLS estimates have a potential endogeneity bias problem and that IV estimates under this strategy is subject to endogenous project placement and is not valid.

Methods: A Markov model was developed for chronic hepatitis B (hepatitis B antigen e [HBeAg] positive and negative) with 40 years' time horizon. Costs and benefits were discounted at 5%. Annual rates of disease progression, costs due to complications, and the efficacy of medicines were obtained from the literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis evaluated uncertainties. Results: For HBeAg positive patients, peginterferon (48 weeks) resulted in an increase of 0.21 discounted life-years gained compared to interferon (24 weeks). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) converted to US dollars using the 2009 purchasing power parity conversion factor was US$ 100,752.24 per life-year gained. For HBeAg negative patients, it was observed that interferon (48 weeks) compared with long-term lamivudine presented an increase of 0.45 discounted life-years gained and ICER of US$ 15,766.90 per life-year gained. In the sensitivity analysis, the ICER was more sensitive to variation in the probability of transition from chronic hepatitis B to compensated cirrhosis, discount rate, and medicine prices. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve for HBeAg positive (pegylated interferon vs. conventional interferon) and negative (conventional interferon vs. lamivudine) showed that conventional interferon was cost-effective until three times the gross domestic product per capita. Conclusions: For patients with chronic hepatitis B with elevated aminotransferase levels in the pretreatment and no cirrhosis who were HBeAg positive, pegylated interferon (48 weeks) provided more life-years gained when compared to conventional interferon (24 weeks), and the ICER surpasses the country's buying power, which makes conventional interferon the chosen alternative. For HBeAg negative patients, conventional interferon (48 weeks) compared to lamivudine provided more life-years gained at a favorable ICER.","[Almeida, Alessandra Maciel; Cherchiglia, Mariangela Leal; Gurgel Andrade, Eli Iola; Araujo de Oliveira, Gustavo Laine] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Prevent & Social Med, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [da Silva, Anderson Lourenco; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Social Pharm, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Almeida, AM (通讯作者)，Prof Antonio Aleixo St 760-602, BR-30180150 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",alessandraalm@gmail.com,"de Oliveira, Gustavo Laine Araújo/V-2521-2019; Andrade, Eli Iola Gurgel/AAP-9854-2021; Cherchiglia, Mariangela/Z-3216-2019; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis/G-2583-2012","de Oliveira, Gustavo Laine Araújo/0000-0003-4811-7753; Cherchiglia, Mariangela/0000-0001-5622-567X; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis/0000-0002-5880-5261",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq [551412/2007-0]; Edital MCT/CNPq/MS-SCTIE-DECIT/CT-Saude [033/2007]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais - FAPEMIG [4611-5.01/07],Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Edital MCT/CNPq/MS-SCTIE-DECIT/CT-Saude(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais - FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)),"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq (process No. 551412/2007-0) Edital MCT/CNPq/MS-SCTIE-DECIT/CT-Saude No. 033/2007, and Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais - FAPEMIG (Process No. 4611-5.01/07).",,33,3,4,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,S,,,S24,S28,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.011,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BE,21839893.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081000007,0

The methods used can produce very different results and there is currently no consensus on which is the most appropriate approach. Objective: The objective of the current study was to compare the accuracy of five different methods within the same dataset. Method: Data collected during five Welsh Health Surveys were subgrouped by health status. Mean short-form 6 dimension (SF-6D) scores for cohorts with a specific health condition were used to estimate mean SF-6D scores for cohorts with comorbid conditions using the additive, multiplicative, and minimum methods, the adjusted decrement estimator (ADE), and a linear regression model. Results: The mean SF-6D for subgroups with comorbid health conditions ranged from 0.4648 to 0.6068. The linear model produced the most accurate scores for the comorbid health conditions with 88% of values accurate to within the minimum important difference for the SF-6D. The additive and minimum methods underestimated or overestimated the actual SF-6D scores respectively. The multiplicative and ADE methods both underestimated the majority of scores. However, both methods performed better when estimating scores smaller than 0.50. Although the range in actual health state utility values (HSUVs) was relatively small, our data covered the lower end of the index and the majority of previous research has involved actual HSUVs at the upper end of possible ranges. Conclusions: Although the linear model gave the most accurate results in our data, additional research is required to validate our findings.","[Ara, Roberta; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Ara, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",r.m.ara@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",University of Sheffield,University of Sheffield,Source of financial support: The research described in this article was funded by the University of Sheffield.,,23,17,19,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,,,,740,745,,10.1016/j.jval.2010.12.011,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BG,21839413.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081300016,0

The statistical analysis of the randomized, controlled trial (RCT) outcomes should be the same for both purposes. The question addressed by this article is the following: for survival outcomes, what is the relationship between the statistical analyses used to support inference and the statistical model used to support decision making based on cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)? Methods: We performed a review of CEAs alongside trials and CEAs based on a synthesis of RCT results, which were submitted to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Technology Appraisal program and included survival outcomes. We recorded the summary statistics and the statistical models used in both efficacy and cost-effectiveness analyses as well as procedures for model diagnosis and selection. Results: In no case was the statistical model for efficacy and CEA the same. For efficacy, relative risks or Cox regression was used. For CEA, the common practice was to fit a parametric model to the control arm, then to apply the hazard ratio from the efficacy analysis to predict the treatment arm. The proportional hazards assumption was seldom checked; the choice of model was seldom based on formal criteria, and uncertainty in model choice was seldom addressed and never propagated through the model. Conclusions: Both inference and decisions based on CEAs should be based on the same statistical model. This article shows that for survival outcomes, this is not the case. In the interests of transparency, trial protocols should specify a common procedure for model choice for both purposes. Further, the sufficient statistics and the life tables for each arm should be reported to improve transparency and to facilitate secondary analyses of results of RCTs.","[Guyot, Patricia; Welton, Nicky J.; Ades, A.

The aim of this paper is to test robustly stationarity, the key axiom of the Discounted Utility model, and to test whether the quasi-hyperbolic or generalised hyperbolic model provides a better description of individual time preferences for health outcomes when stationarity is violated. Very little is known about the descriptive validity of the quasi-hyperbolic model. The different models can lead to different predictions and it is therefore crucial to test which functional form is more descriptively valid. An axiomatic approach is used. Intertemporal preferences were elicited from 203 university students. The results showed that stationarity is violated. Individuals discounted both initial delay and further delays between outcomes at a decreasing rate. This suggests that the quasi-hyperbolic model may not be appropriate to use in intertemporal analyses of health behaviour.

Time-to-death (TTD) has commonly been used to project LTCE because it was a better predictor than age. We reconsider the roles of age and TTD by controlling for disability and co-residence and illustrate their relevance for projecting LICE. We analyze spending on institutional and homecare for the entire Dutch 55+ population, conditioning on age, sex. TTD, cause-of-death and co-residence. We further examined homecare expenditures for a sample of non-institutionalized conditioning additionally on disability. Those living alone or deceased from diabetes, mental illness, stroke, respiratory or digestive disease have higher LTCE, while a cancer death is associated with lower expenditures. TTD no longer determines homecare expenditures when disability is controlled for. This suggests that TTD largely approximates disability. Nonetheless, further standardization of disability measurement is required before disability could replace TTD in LTCE projections models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The nutrition transition in developing countries is associated with a major shift from the consumption of staple crops and whole grains to highly and partially processed foods. This study examines the contribution of processed foods consumption to the prevalence of overweight/obesity in Guatemala using generalized methods of moments (GMM) regression. The results show that all other things remaining constant, a 10% point increase in the share of partially processed foods from the total household food expenditure increases the BMI of family members (aged 10 years and above) by 3.95%. The impact of highly processed foods is much stronger. A 10% point increase in the share of highly processed food items increases the BMI of individuals by 4.25%, ceteris paribus. The results are robust when body weight is measured by overweight/obesity indicators. These findings suggest that increasing shares of partially and highly processed foods from the total consumption expenditure could be one of the major risk factors for the high prevalence of overweight/obesity in the country.

We decompose the total daily return variability into the continuous sample path variance, the variation arising from discontinuous jumps that occur during the trading day, as well as the overnight return variance. Our empirical results, based on long samples of high-frequency equity and bond futures returns, suggest that the dynamic dependencies in the daily continuous sample path variability are well described by an approximate long-memory HAR-GARCH model, while the overnight returns may be modeled by an augmented GARCH type structure. The dynamic dependencies in the non-parametrically identified significant jumps appear to be well described by the combination of an ACH model for the time-varying jump intensities coupled with a relatively simple log-linear structure for the jump sizes. Finally, we discuss how the resulting reduced form model structure for each of the three components may be used in the construction of out-of-sample forecasts for the total return volatility.

The natural resource becomes economically interesting only if fulfilling the following two conditions: There are technologies that enable mining and the utilization of natural resource; There are prices and conditions that enable a meaningful usage of the resource. The availability of condition two is being checked by the projects' financial analyses of the exploration of natural resources and mining. The main task is to find out what kind of methods is available for use in exploration of the oil deposit and what strategy of follow-up mining to choose so that the expected NPV of the whole process (the exploration and mining) is the highest one. If the expected NPV is positive, the natural resource localized in the deposit justifies the economic resource and is therefore usable in practice. In the contribution we draw on a typical decision tree of a project that analyzes exploration and mining. We identify the basic subjective factors (for example various types of options or price and maturity of mining rights), the absence of which, or on the other hand, high price and inappropriate timing deprives a natural resource of economization. The mathematic models, that are effective tools for directing the transfer of the natural resources to the economical ones, derive from the detailed analyses of the relevant substructure of a decision tree.

While it elegantly accounts for the success of strict sectarian religious groups in recruiting members and maintaining commitment, it is less satisfactory when attempting to account for groups requiring neither extreme nor zero sacrifice. Moderate groups are always a suboptimal choice for rational, utility maximizing agents within the original representative agent model. The corner solutions of zero and absolute sacrifice, however, are rarely observed empirically compared to the moderate intermediate. In this paper, we extend the original model to operate within an agent-based computational context, with a distribution of heterogeneous agents occupying coordinates in a two dimensional lattice, making repeated decisions over time. Our model offers the possibility of successful moderate groups, including outcomes wherein the population is dominated by moderate groups. The viability of moderate groups is dependent on extending the model to accommodate agent heterogeneity, not just within the population of agents drawn from, but heterogeneity within groups. Moderate sacrifice rates mitigate member free riding and serve as a weak screening device that permits a range of agent types into the group. Within-group heterogeneity allows agents to benefit from the differing comparative advantages of their fellow members. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Payments for environmental services, or PES, has been the predominant name. However, critics have challenged both the payments and environmental components of this nomenclature, most commonly proposing markets, compensation, or rewards as alternatives for the former, and ecosystem for the latter. Additional questions arise regarding what to call the agents directly involved in the transaction: sellers and buyers, or stewards and beneficiaries? For some, concerns about this terminology have emerged from so-called pro-poor PES debates that ask if actors could and should incorporate poverty alleviation goals into PES instruments. This review of the modulating use of terms and the arguments about which best fit theory and experience points to the key policy and ethical issues at stake as PES programs face critical and timely questions about the direction they will head. The author contends that the choices of terms will influence that direction and proposes a new alternative rewards for ecosystem service stewardship (RESS)-that better encompasses pro-poor options.","[Shelley, Barry G.] Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, Grad Programs Sustainable Int Dev, Waltham, MA USA",Brandeis University,"Shelley, BG (通讯作者)，11 Doris Ave, Brockton, MA 02301 USA.",bshelley@brandeis.edu,,,,,,,39,19,21,1,65,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0077-8923,,978-1-57331-820-4,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2011,1219.0,,,,,,209,225,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05941.x,0.0,,,17,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Book Citation Index– Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index– Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BUD51,21332501.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000288933600012,0

The focus was laid on theoretical analyzation of the process of mechanical disintegration and characteristics of available disintegration machinery, biodegradable materials and waste suitable for stabilization on the experimental machinery Biomass stabilizator Olsovec (SBM). The practical part of the research was found on carrying out the necessary measurements to be able to assess the influence of different levels of disintegration on the process of stabilization of biodegradable material. Available biodegradable materials were disintegrated in the initial part of the machinery Biomass stabilizator Olsovec (grinder-stirrer) and on the same machinery underwent the process of stabilization which is guaranteed by the hydrothermic reaction. To assess the rate of stabilization we considered input and output temperature, dry matter, relative humidity, individual size fractions and the parameter ChSK(Cr) of studied biodegradable materials. The parameter ChSK(Cr) was measured photometrically by COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) Cell test. The experimental machinery SBM Olsovec is still being in the stage of technical development. During the process of stabilization occurred recondenzation of vapours released from the processed materials. Also the used method COD Cell Test appropriate for assesing the quality of waste water had an impact on the accuracy of results. The level of mechanical disintegration influences the process of stabilization and affects the quality of output products. Too high level of desintegration is not suitable for processing on the SBM Olsovec and neither an insufficient one because the machinery is not technologically constructed for that. The technical optimalization considering the experimental machinery should consist in mechanical pre-treatment of feedstock.","[Vocilkova, P.; Marecek, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agr Food & Environm Engn, Fac Agron, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Vocilková, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agr Food & Environm Engn, Fac Agron, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xvocilko@mendelu.cz,"Mareček, Jan/K-7285-2018",,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,981,985,,,,,,5,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341783400120,0

Our regularity conditions are relatively straightforward to verify and also weaker than those available in the literature. The first-stage nonparametric estimation may depend on finite dimensional parameters. We characterize: (1) conditions under which the first-stage estimation of nonparametric components do not affect the asymptotic distribution, (2) conditions under which the asymptotic distribution is affected by the derivatives of the first-stage nonparametric estimator with respect to the finite-dimensional parameters, and (3) conditions under which one can allow non-smooth objective functions. Our framework is illustrated by applying it to three examples: (1) profiled estimation of a single index quantile regression model, (2) semiparametric least squares estimation under model misspecification, and (3) a smoothed matching estimator.

The best GMM estimator has the merit of computational simplicity and asymptotic efficiency. It is asymptotically as efficient as the ML estimator under normality and asymptotically more efficient than the Gaussian QML estimator otherwise. Monte Carlo studies show that, with moderate-sized samples, the best GMM estimator has its biggest advantage when the disturbances are asymmetrically distributed. When the diagonal elements of the spatial weights matrix have enough variation, incorporating kurtosis of the disturbances in the moment functions will also be helpful. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We consider a general MIUF model with two alternative timings in monetary payments: the Cash-In-Advance timing, in which the cash available to buy goods is money in the consumers' hands after they leave the bond market but before they enter the goods market, and the Cash-After-the-Market timing, in which agents hold money for transactions after leaving the goods market. We consider three standard specifications of preferences: the additively separable formulation, the Greenwood-Hercovitz-Huffman (GHH) (Greenwood et al., 1988) formulation and the King-Plosser-Rebelo (KPR) (King et al., 1988) formulation. First, we show that for all the three types of preferences, local indeterminacy occurs under the CIA timing with a low enough interest rate elasticity of money demand. Second, we show that with the CAM timing, although determinacy always holds under separable preferences, local indeterminacy can occur with GHH and KPR preferences. We thus prove that compared to aggregate models, two-sector models provide new rooms for local indeterminacy when non-separable standard preferences are considered. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This DMC approach is employed to compute Bayesian marginal posterior densities, moments, intervals and other quantities, using data simulated from known models and also using data from an empirical example involving firms' sales. The results obtained by the DMC approach are compared to those yielded by the use of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. It is concluded from these comparisons that the DMC approach is worthwhile and applicable to many SUR and other problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The first hypothesis is that smokers have higher individual discount rates than non-smokers. The second hypothesis is that smokers are more likely to have time inconsistent preferences than non-smokers, where time inconsistency is indicated by a hyperbolic discounting function. We control for the concavity of the utility function in our estimates of individual discount rates and find that male smokers have significantly higher discount rates than male non-smokers. However, smoking has no significant association with discount rates among women. This result is robust across exponential and hyperbolic discounting functions. We consider the sensitivity of our conclusions to a statistical specification that allows each observation to potentially be generated by more than one latent data-generating process.

Convergence rates are obtained and it is shown that for low-dimensional cases, much of the beneficial impact is realized even if only data on ordinary first-order partials are available. In instances where root-n consistency is attained, smoothing parameters can often be chosen very easily, without resort to cross-validation.

We construct an M-estimator which achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound recently derived by Komunjer and Vuong (forthcoming). Our efficient M-estimator is obtained by minimizing an objective function which depends on a nonparametric estimator of the conditional distribution of the variable of interest rather than its density. The estimator is new and not yet seen in the literature. We illustrate its performance through a Monte Carlo experiment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Their base case estimate, excluding post-marketing studies, was $802 million (in $US 2000). Strikingly, almost half of this cost (or $399 million) is the cost of capital (COC) used to fund clinical development expenses to the point of FDA marketing approval. The authors used an 11% real COC computed using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). But the CAPM is a single factor risk model, and multi-factor risk models are the current state of the art in finance. Using the Fama-French three factor model we find that the cost of drug development to be higher than the earlier estimate.

This paper discusses the identification and consistent estimation of the unknown functions H. M. G and F, where r (x, z) = H [M (x, z)], M (x, z) = G (x) + F (z), and H is strictly monotonic. An estimation algorithm is proposed for each of the model's unknown components when r (x, z) represents a conditional mean function. The resulting estimators use marginal integration to separate the components G and F. Our estimators are shown to have a limiting Normal distribution with a faster rate of convergence than unrestricted nonparametric alternatives. Their small sample performance is studied in a Monte Carlo experiment. We apply our results to estimate generalized homothetic production functions for four industries in the Chinese economy.

This study determined real-life alteration in treatment decision and economic implications of Oncotype DX use in women with ER+ LN- ESBC. Methods: Clalit Health Services (CHS, Tel Aviv, Israel), determined the proportion of women in low, intermediate and high-risk groups in the first 368 Oncotype DX assays performed, the change of adjuvant therapy recommendation following the recurrence (RS) results from Oncotype DX use, and associated chemotherapy costs. The risk of recurrence-free survival was derived from prespecified statistical protocols of NCI-sponsored trials conducted by NSABP (B-14 and B-20). Utilities were literature based. A 3% discount rate was employed. Results: Oncotype DX altered recommendations of 40% of patients, 84% of whom were changed from hormone + chemotherapy to hormonal therapy alone. Among high-risk women, 8% switched actual treatment Irons hormonal therapy to hormone + chemotherapy. By reducing the chemotherapy disutility, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) increased 0.170 years. Use of Oncotype DX costs $10,770 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses revealed that risk reduction in the low-risk population, the cost of adverse events, and the relative risk reduction of recurrence were the most influential variables. Conclusion: Oncotype DX resulted in net QALY gain and increased overall costs, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $10,770. For CHS, Oncotype DX represents an effective and affordable approach to favorably affect the lives of women with ESBC.","[Doberne, Julie; Hornberger, John] Cedar Associates LLC, Menlo Pk, CA USA; [Klang, Shmuel H.; Hammerman, Ariel; Liebermann, Nicky] Clalit Hlth Serv, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Efrat, Noa] Kaplan Med Ctr, Rehovot, Israel; [Hornberger, John] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Clalit Health Services; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Kaplan Medical Center; Stanford University,"Hornberger, J (通讯作者)，275 Middlefield Rd,Ste 200, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",jhornberger@cedarecon.com,"Hornberger, John/M-4932-2019; Hammerman, Ariel/AAG-4399-2020","Hammerman, Ariel/0000-0002-4396-5246","Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Kiryat Nordau, Netanya, Israel","Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Kiryat Nordau, Netanya, Israel","Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Kiryat Nordau, Netanya, Israel.",,30,95,98,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN-JUL,2010,13.0,4,,,,,381,387,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00724.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,625DD,20412544.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000279872300007,0

EVPIs can be computed via Monte Carlo methods. An outer loop samples values of the parameters of interest, and an inner loop samples the remaining parameters from their conditional distribution. This nested Monte Carlo approach can result in biased estimates if small numbers of inner samples are used and can require a large number of model runs for accurate partial EVPI estimates. We present a simple algorithm to estimate the EVPI bias and confidence interval width for a specified number of inner and outer samples. The algorithm uses a relatively small number of model runs (we suggest approximately 600), is quick to compute, and can help determine how many outer and inner iterations are needed for a desired level of accuracy. We test our algorithm using three case studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the fair allocation of resource and compensations among generations. Fairness is defined by core lower bounds and aspiration upper bounds. The core lower bounds require that every coalition of generations obtains at least what it could achieve by itself. The aspiration upper bounds require that no coalition of generations enjoys a higher welfare than it would achieve if nobody else extracted the resource. We show that, upon existence, the allocation that satisfies the two fairness criteria is unique and assigns to each generation its marginal contribution to the preceding generation. Finally, we describe the dynamics of such an allocation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a simple density estimate that is particularly useful for studying the stationary density of nonlinear time series models. Under a general dependence structure, we establish the root it consistency of the proposed density estimate. For parameter estimation, a Bahadur type representation is obtained for the conditional maximum likelihood estimate. The parameter estimate is shown to be asymptotically efficient in the sense that its limiting variance attains the Cramer-Rao lower bound. The performance of our density estimate is studied by simulations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As of 2006, the program, which started in 2003, covered around 60% of those eligible. Those who were covered (about 20% of the population) were disproportionately poor, and around 80% of those covered were eligible. Estimates of the program's impact were obtained using a method that takes into account unobserved heterogeneity - including unobserved idiosyncratic returns - but requires minimal assumptions. The downside is that it provides an estimate only of the program's impact on those covered by it; it cannot therefore answer the question of how those currently uncovered will fare when they are eventually covered. The results suggest that HCFP hits had no impact on use of services, but has substantially reduced out-of-pocket spending.

In order to understand their malaria illness experience and to develop appropriate strategy for extending services to them a study was carried out in Northern Nigeria. Nomadic Fulani rank malaria as their commonest health problem which they associate with early rains and ripening corn. However, they draw distinction between paboje (87.6% %) believed to be natural affliction of the nomadic Fulani which disappears without treatment and the more virulent djonte (non-Fulani malaria) that endures beyond the third recurrence (seventh day) when they may seek help (94.8%). Household head's consent is important before a child can be taken to a health facility. Interference with work (93.8%) and the high cost (US$8) of treatment per episode are of major concern. Although 79.4% know the location of the nearest health facility, only 5.8% patronize them. Home-made nets (92.8%) and repellent fumes (68%) are used for protecting children from mosquito bites. They are willing to participate in camp management of malaria, contributing to supply (65.7%) and training (38.1%) but would not want their nomadic way of life altered (65.3%). Appreciation of the malaria illness experience of the nomadic Fulani is necessary before the health system can approach them with an acceptable malaria intervention programme.","[Akogun, O.] Common Heritage Fdn, Yola, Nigeria",,,,"Akogun, Oladele/O-3005-2019",,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,1257,1261,,,,,,5,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291664400138,0

Forty patients (19%) also had clinically significant macular edema. Methods: Principal component analyses identified factor structure, and Cronbach's alpha assessed internal consistencies. Construct validity was examined by testing the additional impact of macular edema and expected relationships of RetDQoL scores with visual impairment, stage of diabetic retinopathy, subscales of the SF-12, and scores of the Retinopathy Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (RetTSQ). Analyses were conducted using the RetDQoL's AWI score (average weighted impact of diabetic retinopathy on 26 life domains) and its two overview items (present QoL in general and retinopathy-specific QoL). Content validity was investigated using an open-ended question to identify any additional items needed. Results: A forced one-factor solution of the 26 specific weighted impact ratings showed all items except working life (applicable to 27%) to load >0.55, and Cronbach's alpha was 0.96, showing very high reliability. Greater impairment, worse diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema were associated with greater negative impact on scores. AWI correlated as expected more highly with retinopathy-specific QoL (r = 0.71, P < 0.01) than with present QoL (r = 0.28, P < 0.01). RetDQoL scores correlated moderately with SF-12 subscales (r = 0.22-0.51, P < 0.01) and RetTSQ scores (r = 0.27-0.51, P < 0.01). For six domains, >60% of patients reported no impact. No additional domains were needed. Conclusions: The RetDQoL is valid and reliable for patients with diabetic retinopathy with or without macular edema. It may be shortened if findings are confirmed cross-culturally.","[Bradley, Clare] Univ London, Dept Psychol, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Bradley, C (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Psychol, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",c.bradley@rhul.ac.uk,"Brose, Leonie S./H-6690-2019","Bradley, Clare/0000-0002-4079-0364",Eli Lilly and Company Limited,Eli Lilly and Company Limited(Eli Lilly),"Eli Lilly and Company Limited funded the DIMICO study and contributed to the funding of the analyses reported here, The first author, L.B., is supported by a studentship grant from Health Psychology Research Ltd, which has a licence from the senior author, C.B., to sublicense the questionnaires.",,21,12,12,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2010,13.0,1,,,,,119,127,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00589.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,541PI,19695003.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000273429000020,0

However, mullet roe has gradually become a symbol of the Jiading and Ziquan Townships, the major areas of mullet roe production in Taiwan, through the Mullet Culture Festival.

Great differences can be found between northern and southern ingredients and culinary skills, even though there have been common characteristics shared among food and eating in various regions through internal migration of the population and importation of cooking elements from elsewhere in the world. Regarding the regional variations, Chinese food has been commonly classified into four major regional cuisines, in terms of east, west, north and south. The northern cuisine, which is famous for its cooking skills, is represented by the early establishment of Shangdong cuisine which influenced the Imperial Court cuisine as well as the later Beijing cuisine; western cuisine is represented by Sichuan cuisine, which is hot and spicy; eastern cuisine, which emphasizes on the cutting skills, is represented by the Jiangsu cuisine which influenced the Shanghai cuisine established in the 1920s when Shanghai became the modern financial center in the new China; and southern cuisine is represented by Guangdong cuisine, with an emphasis upon freshness. Apart from studying Chinese foodways as regional traditions, I suggest we can see it as a kind of intangible heritage we would like to preserve and pass down to our future generations. In particular, the ways how ingredients were produced, procedures taken when the food is prepared, and knowledge of cooking skills was inherited from the past should not be overlooked in the 21(st) century. In this paper, I aim to investigate Chinese foodways in relation to the preservation regarding culinary resource in the production system, the cooking recipes and learning system inherited through restaurants, in order to have a better understanding of food heritage in the many fast changing societies in the modern Chinese world.","[Cheung, S.

The model framework corresponds to an integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) setting where the discrete choice model includes latent variables that capture attitudes and perceptions of the decision makers. The latent variable model is composed of a group of structural equations describing the latent variables as a function of observable exogenous variables and a group of measurement equations, linking the latent variables to observable indicators. An empirical study has been developed for the Greek Aegean island area. Data were collected from 900 HHs in Greece contacted via telephone. The HHs were presented hypothetical scenarios involving policy variables, where 2010 was the reference year. ICLV binary logit (BL) and mixed binary logit (MBL) relocation choice models were estimated sequentially. Findings suggest that MBL models are superior to BL models, while both the policy and the latent variables significantly affect the relocation decision and improve considerably the models' goodness of fit.

New recommendations have recently been published in 2009. The cost implications of expanding this list of RFs to include other evidence-based RFs like passive smoke exposure (PSE), crowded living conditions (CLCs), and young chronological age (YCA) are unclear. Methods: We estimated the Prevalence of RSV RFs in a US sample of infants 32 to 35 wGA referred for prophylaxis from nine specialty pharmacy providers during the 2007-2008 season. We estimated the percent eligible for RSV prophylaxis under various potential RF coverage policies. Using a budget impact model, we calculated the per-member-per-month (PMPM) cost for each policy in 2007 USD for a hypothetical one million member plan. Results: Infants 32 to 35 wGA represented 0.08% of the plan. Approximately 20.2% of these infants met at least two or more of five AAP RFs. Expanding this list to include one additional RF of PSE, CLC, or YCA increased the percent of infants potentially prophylaxed to 29.9%, 23.9%, and 47%, respectively. Adding all three RFs to the list (two or more of eight) increased the percent of infants potentially prophylaxed to 55.6%, and increased payer costs by 9 cents PMPM. Conclusion: Expanding the AAP RF criteria to include PSE, CLC, and YCA would identify more 32 to 35 wGA infants at high risk for severe RSV disease at an acceptable budget impact.","[Krilov, Leonard R.] Winthrop Univ Hosp, Div Pediat Infect Dis, Childrens Med Ctr, Mineola, NY 11501 USA; [Krilov, Leonard R.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Palazzi, Debra L.] Texas Childrens Hosp, Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Fernandes, Ancilla W.; Mahadevia, Parthiv J.] MedImmune Inc, Hlth Outcomes & Pharmacoecon, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [Klein, Robert W.] Med Decis Modeling Inc, Indianapolis, IN USA",Northwell Health; North Shore University Hospital; Steven & Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York; Winthrop University Hospital; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Baylor College of Medicine; AstraZeneca; Medimmune; Medical Decision Modeling Inc.

This change allows the incorporation of systematic (nonrandom) error covariance heterogeneity across individuals, while maintaining a closed form for the calculation of choice probabilities. Also explored is a latent class model of nested models, which can similarly express heterogeneity. The heterogeneous models are compared to a similar model with homogeneous covariance in a realistic scenario, and are shown to significantly outperform the homogeneous model, and the level of improvement is especially large in certain market segments.

That is, the received history of Wales and Welshness is characterised by adaptability and hybridity, not by authenticity. This will be demonstrated by a critical engagement with recent strategies for the selling of place in a post-industrial commodification of heritage as an economic strategy. They constitute a third space out of which a new hybrid Welsh culture will emerge that is not grounded in a mythic essentialist past, but in a dynamic present in a globalizing world. Accordingly, three dominant heritage chronotopes will be unpacked to engage the complex discourses of identity formation: a romantic mythology; a rural idyll; a proletariate culture. It is argued that this study of the reconstruction of Welshness is of relevance to the contemporary re-definition of the concepts of Englishness, Scottishness, - and even Europeaness. Further, the consequent landscape of heritage reifies in material form and commemorative practice a didactic set of sites of meaning central to contemporary identity-politics. In particular, it is argued here that the collection, organization, and representation of the material relics of industrial heritage should be accompanied by consideration of past values, social structures, ideologies, and senses of community. Indeed, the reconstruction of past industrial landscapes, soundscapes, and smellscapes are reminders of the ecological atrocities committed on land, water, air, and people, and the emergence of a rich community identity as a strategy of survival. It prompts a crucial question: How do contemporary heritage practices fit current economic and social verities?","[Osborne, B.] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,,,,,,,,,103,0,0,0,11,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,1101,1112,,,,,,12,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291664400121,0

The knowledge of the specificities and the criticalities of the Venetian territory, guide the research - begun in March 2009 and financed with F.S.E. found- in the definition of new cultural itineraries, integrated with the network of runs and connected to retraining actions of the places of archaeology and landscape interest. The attention turns to the territory of Rovigo's province, delimited and innervated by navigable flows that strongly have characterized the construction as the agricultural and industrial use of the ground. Among rivers Po and Adige there are unusual intersections with different scales, just where the futures motorway (Nogara-Adriatic Sea, south Valdastico, New Romea) ploughing a predominantly agricultural territory, they intercept both an important water network and a considerable heritage of industrial archaeology. If the referable recoveries to the classical archaeology as those imputable to preceding historical periods, in the Polesine they rarely represent visible consistencies, the excavations, with the exception of few cases, they have brought to the light fragments of installations often removed from the places where they were found again to be recomposed and shown for the public inside the local museums. Numerous places and artefacts remember the industrial past of the region: ex sugar or tobacco factories, hemp-mill, but also ex furnaces and dewatering pumps, otherwise tied up to the geomorphology of the places. In such cases, after the abandonment and in absence of a project considering the heritage in its whole, politics of recovery are often made to turn these buildings into museums of themselves. On the guide of the problems in relief, the research is instead individualizing a series of possible correlated actions. The few visible archaeological sites are already integrated in the cultural routes that this work is delineating. For the remaining areas - both the tied up ones where the ruins make to suppose the presence of other manufactures as well those where the archaeological consistence is reasonably alone hypothesized but not yet verified - it is prefiguring measures of safeguard and strategies of revaluation that simultaneously extend instead both to the maintenance than not brought still to the light that to increase the recognizable characters of sites. The nature represents, in such sense, together with the rural vocation of the region, an important tool of project. Different sceneries are verifying in progress within some study cases. One of them is constituted by the lay-out of a abandoned railway line, departing from Adria, and crossing the widest tied up archaeological area of the Rovigo's Province, reaching Ariano Polesine. On the other side, more on west, the anticipated extension of the South Valdastico connotes another section of the Polesine, where the research only underline the ways of qualification of a territory with the right relationships between new infrastructures and different archaeologies of a Venetian landscape.","[Vanore, M.] Univ Iuav, Venice, Italy",IUAV University Venice,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,641,650,,,,,,10,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291664400071,0

This analysis develops a dynamic life-cycle model to conduct a multiindication evaluation using the case of trastuzumab licensed in the United States for both early-stage and metastatic (or late-stage) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer therapy (early breast cancer [EBC]; metastatic breast cancer [MBC]), approved in 2006 and 1998, respectively. Methods: This dynamic model combined information on expected incremental cost-utility ratios for specific indications with an epidemiologically based projection of utilization by indication over the product life cycle-from 1998 to 2016. Net economic value was estimated as the cumulative quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained over the life cycle multiplied by a societal valuation of health gains ($/QALY) minus cumulative net direct treatment costs. Sensitivity analyses were performed under a range of assumptions. Results: We projected that the annual number of EBC patients receiving trastuzumab will be more than three times that of MBC by 2016, in part because adjuvant treatment reduces the future incidence of MBC. Over this life cycle, the estimated overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $35,590/QALY with a total of 432,547 discounted QALYs gained. Under sensitivity analyses, the overall ICER varied from $21,000 to $53,000/QALY, and the projected net economic value resulting from trastuzumab treatment ranged from $6.2 billion to $49.5 billion. Conclusions: Average ICERs for multiindication compounds can increase or decrease over the product life cycle. In this example, the projected overall life-cycle ICER for trastuzumab was less than one half of that in the initial indication. This dynamic perspective-versus the usual static one-highlights the interdependence of drug development decisions and investment incentives, raising important reimbursement policy issues.","[Garrison, Louis P., Jr.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Garrison, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Hlth Sci Bldg, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lgarrisn@u.washington.edu,,,"Genentech, Inc.","Genentech, Inc.(Roche HoldingGenentech)","This research was supported by unrestricted funding to the University of Washington from Genentech, Inc.

Methods: Baseline data from two UK trials were used that reflected the range of arthritis states/severity found in routine practice. EQ-5D profiles resulting in negative valuations (i.e., states WTD) based on UK weights were identified. EQ-5D scores for these profiles from alternative valuation sets, including a reanalysis of the UK weights, were compared. The health status and characteristics of patients, and factors associated with patients in the low distribution of the EQ-5D and those with WTD EQ-5D scores were identified. Results: Seven hundred patients were included in the analysis. Sixty-two (9%) patients occupied states WTD. Patients occupied 9 of the possible 84health profiles with negative scores (53% occupied one profile); this profile was not rated WTD by any of the alternative EQ-5D scoring algorithms. All WTD profiles included severe pain/discomfort plus moderate problems in >= 3 other domains. Patients with WTD valuations reported higher levels of pain, and feeling downhearted and low on alternative health status measures. Conclusions: Pain was the predominant factor in the WTD EQ-5D profiles occupied by arthritis patients. Patients occupying states WTD have poorer health-related quality of life than patients in low better than death states. Valuations of profiles vary according to how sets of preference weights for health profiles were developed. Further research should explore whether WTD valuations are supported by qualitative evidence and reflect the patient's health and experience of disease.","[Harrison, Mark J.; Davies, Linda M.; McCoy, Melanie J.; Farragher, Tracey M.; Verstappen, Suzanne M.

To address the poor state of health care, the Chinese government unveiled the New Cooperative Medical System in 2002. Because local governments have been given significant control over prop-ram design, fundamental characteristics of the program vary from one county to the next. These differences may influence the decision to seek health care as well as the choice of hospital conditional oil that initial decision. In this paper, we use a nested logit model to analyze household survey data from 25 Counties to analyze the determinants of such health-seeking behavior. We find that age, the share of household expenditures allocated to food consumption (a measure of relative income), and the presence of other sick people in the household negatively affect the decision to seek health care while disability has a positive influence. Further, conditional oil seeking treatment, the reimbursement scheme in place in each County and the average daily expenditure associated with hospitalization strongly influence hospital choice.

We adopt a life-course perspective to study the economics of smoking behavior in China. We use data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) to follow individuals over their whole lives and to analyze their decisions to both start and stop smoking. We extend the small but growing body of economic research on smoking in China. Our life-course approach emphasizes that current smoking participation reflects a decision to start and a series of past decisions to not quit. We explore how the determinants of smoking initiation differ from the determinants of smoking cessation. We find results, consistent with some previous empirical evidence, that Chinese smoking is not strongly related to the price of cigarettes. Based on our results, we offer some speculative hypotheses that, we hope, might guide future research oil the economics of smoking in China. It seems especially useful to compare the broad patterns we document with the experiences of other countries.

We focus on the development of simulation-based exact procedures - whose level can be controlled in finite samples as well as on large-sample procedures which remain valid under non-regular conditions. We consider Wald-type, score-type and likelihood-ratio-type tests based on a simple moment estimator, which can be easily simulated. We also propose a C(alpha)-type test which is very easy to implement and exhibits relatively good size and power properties. Besides usual linear restrictions on the SV model coefficients, the problems studied include testing homoskedasticity against a SV alternative (which involves singular moment conditions under the null hypothesis) and testing the null hypothesis of one factor driving the dynamics of the volatility process against two factors (which raises identification difficulties). Three ways of implementing the tests based on alternative statistics are compared: asymptotic critical values (when available), a local Monte Carlo (or parametric bootstrap) test procedure, and a maximized Monte Carlo (MMC) procedure. The size and power properties of the proposed tests are examined in a simulation experiment. The results indicate that the C(alpha)-based tests (built upon the simple moment estimator available in closed form) have good size and power properties for regular hypotheses, while Monte Carlo tests are much more reliable than those based on asymptotic critical values. Further, in cases where the parametric bootstrap appears to fail (for example, in the presence of identification problems), the MMC procedure easily controls the level of the tests. Moreover, MMC-based tests exhibit relatively good power performance despite the conservative feature of the procedure. Finally, we present an application to a time series of returns on the Standard and Poor's Composite Price Index. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, for non-elliptically distributed financial returns, we propose copula-based multivariate GARCH (C-MGARCH) model with uncorrelated dependent errors, which are generated through a linear combination of dependent random variables. The dependence structure is controlled by a copula function. Our new C-MGARCH model nests a conventional MGARCH model as a special case. The aim of this paper is to model MGARCH for non-normal multivariate distributions using copulas. We model the conditional correlation (by MGARCH) and the remaining dependence (by a copula) separately and simultaneously. We apply this idea to three MGARCH models, namely, the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model of Engle [Engle, R.F., 2002. Dynamic conditional correlation: A simple class of multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models. journal of Business and Economic Statistics 20, 339-350], the varying correlation (VC) model of Tse and Tsui [Tse, Y.K., Tsui, A.K., 2002. A multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model with time-varying correlations. Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 20, 351-362], and the BEKK model of Engle and Kroner [Engle, R.F., Kroner, K.F., 1995. Multivariate simultaneous generalized ARCH. Econometric Theory 11, 122-150]. Empirical analysis with three foreign exchange rates indicates that the C-MGARCH models outperform DCC, VC, and BEKK in terms of in-sample model selection and out-of-sample multivariate density forecast, and in terms of these criteria the choice of copula functions is more important than the choice of the volatility models.

Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common curable sexually transmitted disease. To design effective screening programs, it is important to fully capture the benefits of screening to patients. Thus, the value of experience factors must be considered alongside health outcomes. A self-complete discrete choice experiment questionnaire was administered to women attending a family planning clinic. Chlamydia screening was described by five characteristics: location of screening; type of screening test; cost of screening test; risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease if chlamydia is untreated; and support provided when receiving results. One hundred twenty-six women completed the questionnaire. Respondents valued characteristics of the care experience. Screening was valued at 15; pound less invasive screening tests increase willingness to pay by 7 pound, and more invasive tests reduce willingness to pay by 3.50 pound. The most preferred screening location was the family planning clinic, valued at 5 pound. The support of a trained health-care professional when receiving results was valued at 4 pound. Respondents under 25 years and those in a casual relationship were less likely to be screened. Women valued experience factors in the provision of chlamydia screening. To correctly value these screening programs and to predict uptake, cost-effectiveness studies should take such values into account. Failure to do this may result in incorrect policy recommendations.","[Watson, Verity; Ryan, Mandy] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Watson, Emma] Stockport NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Microbiol, Stockport, Lancs, England",University of Aberdeen,"Watson, V (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Polwarth Bldg, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland.",v.watson@abdn.ac.uk,,"Watson, Verity/0000-0002-3824-5076","The Scottish Hospitals Endowment Research Trust, University of Aberdeen; Health Foundation; Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health Directorate; Chief Scientist Office [HERU2, HERU1] Funding Source: researchfish","The Scottish Hospitals Endowment Research Trust, University of Aberdeen; Health Foundation; Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health Directorate(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland); Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland)","The Scottish Hospitals Endowment Research Trust, University of Aberdeen, the Health Foundation, and the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health Directorate.",,10,19,19,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4,,,,,621,623,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00451.x,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,18783389.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000266467800032,0

However, to truly understand the effect of migration one must compare the mental health of migrants to what their mental health would he had they stayed in their home Country. The existing literature is notable to do this, New Zealand allows a quota of Tongans to immigrate each year with a random ballot used to choose amongst the excess number Of applicants. Experimental estimates of the mental health effects of migration are obtained by comparing the mental health of migrants who were Successful applicants in the random ballot to the mental health of those who applied to migrate under the quota, but whose names were not drawn.

The results for male GPs indicate that there is little age effect on hours of direct patient care, especially among physicians aged 35-55, there is no strong cohort effect oil hours of direct patient care, but there is a secular decline in hours of direct patient care over the period. The results for female GPs indicate that female physicians on average work fewer hours than male physicians, there is a clear age effect on hours of direct patient care, there is no strong cohort effect, and there has been little secular change in average hours of direct patient care. The changing behaviour of male GPs accounted for a greater proportion of the overall decline in hours of direct patient care from the 1980s through the mid-1990s than did the growing,proportion of female GPs in the physician stock.

Using a Bayesian decision-theoretic approach, an analytic framework has been developed to inform these separate but related decisions, establishing the expected value of both perfect information (EVPI) and perfect implementation (EVPIM). We applied this framework to inform decision-making about resource allocation to metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (mHRPC) in the UK. Based on available evidence on the cost-effectiveness of all plausible treatments for mHRPC, we determined which treatment option(s) were cost-effective and explored the uncertainty surrounding this decision. Given the decision uncertainty and the variation in care provided by health-care professionals, we then determined the EVPI and EVPIM. Finally, we performed sensitivity analyses to explore the influence of alternative assumptions regarding various decision parameters on the efficiency of resource allocation. Depending on the cost-effectiveness threshold (lambda), we identified mitoxantrone plus prednisone/prednisolone and docetaxel plus prednisone/prednisolone (3 weekly) as the optimal treatments for mHRPC. Given current clinical practice, there appears to be considerable scope for improving the efficiency of health-care provision: the EVPI (estimated to be over 13 pound million) indicates that acquiring further information could be cost-effective; and the EVPIM (estimated to be over 4 pound million) suggests that investing in strategies to implement the treatments regimens being identified as optimal is potentially worthwhile. Through sensitivity analyses, we found that the EVPI and EVPIM are mainly driven by lambda, the number of treatment options being considered, the current level of implementation, and the size of the eligible patient population. The application demonstrates that the framework provides a simple and useful analytic tool for decision-makers to address resource allocation problems between health-care provision, further research, and implementation efforts.","[Hoomans, Ties] Maastricht Univ, Dept Hlth Org Policy & Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Fenwick, Elisabeth A.

This study aims to estimate the positive and negative consequences on mortality, years of potential life (YPL), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), resource utilization, and societal costs attributable to moderate alcohol consumption in Germany in 2002. The concept of attributable risks and a prevalence-based approach was used to calculate age- and sex-specific alcohol attributable mortality and resource utilization for a wide range of disorders, and avoided mortality and resource utilization for diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cholelithiasis. The literature provided prevalence of moderate alcohol consumption in Germany by age and sex and relative risks. Direct costs were calculated using routine utilization and expenditure statistics. Indirect costs were calculated using the human capital approach. Due to moderate alcohol consumption, 14,457 lives, 205,691 YPL, and 179,964 QALYs were lost, whereas 29,918 lives, 300,382 YPL, and 258,284 QALYs were gained. Up to an age of 55 to 60 (62.5-67.5) years, more lives were lost than gained among men (women), whereas in older age groups more lives were gained than lost. Moderate alcohol consumption caused 3049 million of direct and 2630 million of indirect costs, whereas 2094 million of direct and 2604 million of indirect costs were avoided. Despite considerable uncertainty, moderate alcohol consumption seems to result in an overall net effect of gained lives, YPL, and QALYs, realized among the elderly, but overall increased societal costs. Thus, moderate alcohol consumption should still be seen critical, especially among youths.","[Konnopka, Alexander] Univ Leipzig, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Dept Psychiat, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University,"Konnopka, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Dept Psychiat, Liebigstr 26, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",alexander.konnopka@medizin.uni-leipzig.de,"König, Hans-Helmut/P-1211-2018",,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01ZZ0106],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),Source of financial support: This study was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (grant number 01ZZ0106).,,35,11,12,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,253,261,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00444.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,20667060.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000263467500010,0

A total of 138 men (mean age 58 years) viewed a CDM module for prostate cancer with and without prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening. Participants rated their hypothetical quality of life with potential prostate cancer treatment complications using a CDM-based VAS decision tool. They were then asked to estimate how many years they would be willing to trade to be free of treatment complications using a CDM-based TTO decision tool. The consistency between VAS and TTO scores and the relationship between scores and preferences for PSA screening test and hypothetical treatment choice for prostate cancer were then evaluated. There was a significant relationship between the VAS and TTO ratings (regression P < 0.001). The TTO tool was sensitive to age. Mean scores with standard deviations for those less than 58 years compared to those 58 years and more were 7.78 (1.75) and 8.41 (1.52), respectively (P = 0.04). Using the VAS tool, men who chose PSA screening had higher quality of life ratings compared to men who did not choose PSA screening: 7.73 (1.78) and 6.59 (2.39), respectively (P = 0.01). Similar results were found with the TTO decision tool: 8.33 (1.45) and 7.04 (2.00), respectively (P = 0.005). Men who would hypothetically prefer treatment for moderately differentiated prostate cancer also had higher TTO scores compared to men who preferred watchful waiting: 8.54 (1.39) and 7.85 (1.73), respectively (P = 0.04). CDM-based for prostate cancer, VAS and TTO ratings were consistent and were concordant with patient preferences for screening; TTO ratings were also concordant with treatment choice. The use of the CDM-based TTO ratings to adjust for quality of life in decision analytic modeling needs to be explored.","[Bhatnagar, Vibha] Univ Calif San Diego, VA Med Ctr San Diego, Dept Family & Prevent Med, Sch Med, San Diego, CA 92131 USA; [Bhatnagar, Vibha] Dept Vet Affairs, Hlth Serv Res & Dev, San Diego, CA USA; [Frosch, Dominick L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Frosch, Dominick L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Hlth Serv Res, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Hamori, Charles J.] Kaiser Permanente, Dept Prevent Med, San Diego, CA USA; [Lenert, Leslie] Ctr Dis Control, Natl Ctr Hlth Informat, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; [Kaplan, Robert M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Kaiser Permanente; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Bhatnagar, V (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, VA Med Ctr San Diego, Dept Family & Prevent Med, Sch Med, 3350 La Jolla Village Dr,111N-1, San Diego, CA 92131 USA.",vbhatnag@ucsd.edu,"KAPLAN, Robert/AAK-7342-2021",,"CDC, Department for Veterans Affairs [U57/CCU920678-04-1]","CDC, Department for Veterans Affairs(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA)","Source of financial support: CDC U57/CCU920678-04-1, Department for Veterans Affairs.",,58,5,5,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,101,108,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00407.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,18637139.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000262696800016,0

The Herpes Outbreak Impact Questionnaire (HOIQ) and the Herpes Symptom Checklist (HSC) were designed to be acceptable to clinical professionals and to reflect patients' experience. Scale content was derived via literature review and interviews with RGH patients and physicians. Questionnaires were assessed for face/content validity in the UK and the language checked for acceptability in the United States. The US measures were assessed for face/content validity with patients. Scaling/psychometric properties were determined via web survey. Participants completed the questionnaires twice during an outbreak, with 24 to 72 hours between administrations. Respondents found the questionnaires relevant and easy to understand and complete. Application of Rasch analysis resulted in the removal of two HOIQ items. Both scales were found to be unidimensional. Item stability testing for the HOIQ indicated that the measure is reproducible. Internal consistency was good (alpha: time 1 = 0.87, time 2 = 0.91). Discriminative validity was demonstrated by the measure's ability to distinguish between individuals who differed by self-reported severity of outbreak. The HOIQ and HSC were both responsive to change over time. The HSC and the HOIQ can determine the impact of a herpes outbreak effectively. They are designed to be used daily during such outbreaks and to determine the effectiveness of RGH treatment.","[Doward, Lynda C.; McKenna, Stephen P.; Meads, David M.] Galen Res, Manchester M15 6SE, Lancs, England; [McKenna, Stephen P.] Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Psychol, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England; [Kahler, Kristijan; Frech, Feride] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA",University of Central Lancashire; Novartis,"Doward, LC (通讯作者)，Galen Res, Enterprise House,Manchester Sci Pk,Lloyd St N, Manchester M15 6SE, Lancs, England.",ldoward@galen-research.com,"Doward, Lynda/IXD-2462-2023","Doward, Lynda/0000-0002-6236-469X",Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.,Source of financial support: This research was supported by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.,,21,3,4,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,139,145,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00424.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,18647252.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000262696800021,0

Respondents participated in three face-to-face interviews over a period of 4 months. Reliability was measured both at the input level, where the consistency of matches made by respondents to the Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) question between replications was determined, and at the output level, where the parameters of the conjoint model were estimated and tested for joint significance and willingness to pay (WTP) confidence intervals were calculated. Input level: Of the 1661 choices made in survey 1, 1316 were repeated in survey 2. Based on the observed number of consistently repeated choices and the expected number by chance, a fair agreement between the choices in the two surveys (chi(2) = 324) was found. Of the 998 consistently repeated choices from survey 1 to survey 2, 818 were repeated in survey 3. There was again a high level of consistency between the choices in surveys 1 and 2 and the final choice in survey 3. Output level: The confidence intervals for WTP figures in surveys 1 and 2 and 1 and 3 were overlapping, implying that the DCE was reliable at the output level over time.

Secondly, a flexible simulation and analysis environment is built to evaluate the security of different SCA leakages. Finally, an illustrative experiment, which performs a design-time SCA evaluation on the crypto-chip with AES-128 core, is given.

The method involves constructing t and Wald statistics using a cluster covariance matrix estimator (CCE). We use an approximation that takes the number of clusters/groups as fixed and the number of observations per group to be large. The resulting limiting distributions of the t and Wald statistics are standard t and F distributions where the number of groups plays the role of sample size. Using a small number of groups is analogous to 'fixed-b' asymptotics of Kiefer and Vogelsang (2002, 2005) (IN) for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent inference. We provide simulation evidence that demonstrates that the procedure substantially outperforms conventional inference procedures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Bester, C.

It has been observed that instrumental variable estimators may behave poorly if the number of instruments is large. This problem can be addressed by shrinking the influence of a subset of instrumental variables. The procedure can be understood as a two-step process of shrinking some of the OLS coefficient estimates from the regression of the endogenous variables on the instruments, then using the predicted values of the endogenous variables (based on the shrunk coefficient estimates) as the instruments. The shrinkage parameter is chosen to minimize the asymptotic mean square error. The optimal shrinkage parameter has a closed form, which makes it easy to implement. A Monte Carlo study shows that the shrinkage method works well and performs better in many situations than do existing instrument selection procedures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

They distinguish 'happy addicts' a 'la Becker-Murphy from 'unhappy addicts' who state that smoking is a mistake and call for some help to quit. When evaluating tobacco control policies, it might be important to distinguish their effects on those two types of population. Indeed, such policies are welfare improving only if they help unhappy addicts to quit. We investigate the effect of the French workplace smoking ban on a sample of presumably 'unhappy addicts', smokers who consult tobacco cessation services. We show that the ban caused an increase in the demand for such services, and that this increase was larger in cold and rainy areas. It also induced an increase in the percentage of successful attempts to quit. Workplace smoking bans might be welfare improving since they seem to help 'unhappy addicts' to reconcile their behavior with their preferences.

Using detailed work and fertility histories from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, estimates are identified by comparing the outcomes of children born after a displacement to the outcomes of those born before. This analysis reveals that husbands' job losses have significant negative effects on infant health.

When disease progresses the patients' call on formal health care services and on social support grows which imposes increasing costs of care. The aim of this study was to investigate the costs for patients with mild and moderate dementia in community setting in Germany. Methods: We assessed total costs of care and individual cost components for 383 community-living dementia patients alongside a cluster-randomized trial from societal and health insurance perspective. Utilization of formal health care services was based on insurance claims data and time dedicated to informal care was assessed within caregiver interviews. We estimated costs using a two-part regression model adjusting for age, gender and cluster-effects. Results: Costs of care equal (sic)47,747 (Euros) from societal perspective which is almost the 4.7-fold of health insurance expenditures. Valued informal care covers 80.2% of societal costs and increases disproportionally when disease progresses. In moderate dementia the corresponding amount exceeds the one in mild dementia by 69.9%, whereas costs for formal health care services differ by 14.3%. Conclusion: Due to valued informal care, costs of care for community-living patients with moderate dementia are significantly higher than for patients with mild dementia. Informal care is a non-cash item saving expenditures for professional care. To relieve social security system and family care-givers as well as to allow dementia patients to stay at home as long as possible, concepts fostering community-based dementia care and support to family caregivers need to be further developed.","[Schwarzkopf, Larissa; Menn, Petra; Kunz, Simone; Holle, Rolf; Leidl, Reiner] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth GmbH, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Lauterberg, Joerg] Fed Assoc AOK, Berlin, Germany; [Marx, Peter] Pfizer Deutschland GmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Mehlig, Hilmar] Eisai GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany; [Wunder, Sonja] AOK Bavaria Hlth Insurer, Nurnberg, Germany; [Donath, Carolin; Graessel, Elmar] Univ Hosp Erlangen, Clin Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Erlangen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Pfizer; Eisai Co Ltd; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Schwarzkopf, L (通讯作者)，German Res Ctr Environm Hlth GmbH, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Ingolstaedter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",l.schwarzkopf@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Leidl, Reiner M/B-7209-2009; Schwarzkopf, Larissa/O-5157-2015; Holle, Rolf/D-9333-2013; Leidl, Reiner/GQY-7389-2022","Leidl, Reiner M/0000-0002-7115-7510; Schwarzkopf, Larissa/0000-0002-9402-7700; Donath, Carolin/0000-0001-9502-861X","Federal Association of the AOK, Berlin; AOK Bavaria - Health Insurer, Nuremberg; Eisai GmbH, Frankfurt Main; Pfizer Germany GmbH, Berlin","Federal Association of the AOK, Berlin; AOK Bavaria - Health Insurer, Nuremberg; Eisai GmbH, Frankfurt Main; Pfizer Germany GmbH, Berlin","The IDA project was initiated and financed by the Federal Association of the AOK, Berlin; the AOK Bavaria - Health Insurer, Nuremberg; Eisai GmbH, Frankfurt Main; and Pfizer Germany GmbH, Berlin.

Attractively, this MIP approach naturally applies to settings with any number of observations and any number of agents. This is in contrast with existing approaches in the literature. We also demonstrate the versatility of our MIP approach in terms of dealing with alternative types of assignable information. Finally, we illustrate our methodology on a data set drawn from the US economy. In this application, an important focus is on the discriminatory power of the rationalizability tests under study.

The model shows that the discontinuity of demand as well as the demand polarization proposed by Becker (1991), A Note on Restaurant Pricing and Other Examples of Social Influences on Price, depend crucially on the heterogeneity of consumers' preferences and on the level of product differentiation. When the two products are sufficiently similar, it turns out that the market is shared asymmetrically as suggested by Becker (1991). By contrast, when the products are different and the preferences of the consumers are sufficiently heterogeneous, the market is shared symmetrically as in Hotelling's (1929) model.

We investigate the cases in which the representing sets of utility functions are either arbitrary or finite, and those cases in which the maps contained in these sets are required to be (semi)continuous. With the exception of the case where the representing set is required to be finite, we find that the requirements of such representations are surprisingly weak, pointing to a wide range of applicability of the representation theorems reported here. Some applications to decision theory under uncertainty and consumer theory are also considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It has previously been shown that when manufacturers are price-takers, reimbursement decisions made in reference to stratified cost-effectiveness analysis lead to a more efficient allocation of resources than decisions based on whole-population cost-effectiveness analysis. However, we demonstrate that when manufacturers are price setters, reimbursement or VBP based on stratified cost-effectiveness analysis may not be optimal. Using two examples - one considering the choice of thrombolytic treatment for specific patient subgroups and the other considering the extension of coverage for a cancer treatment to include an additional indication - we show that combinations of extended coverage and reduced price can be identified that are advantageous to both payers and manufacturers. The benefits of a given extension in coverage and reduction in price depend both upon the average treatment benefit in the additional population and its size relative to the original population. Negotiation regarding trade-offs between price and coverage may lead to improved outcomes both for health-care systems and manufacturers compared with processes where coverage is determined conditional simply on stratified cost-effectiveness at a given price.

These similarity models suggest various measures over the risky pairs that define decision costs and benefits. This paper assesses the empirical modeling success of these similarity measures in explaining risky choice patterns showing EU independence violations. We also compare model fit for these similarity models relative to EU and to a selected generalized EU model. Although the candidate models exhibit some degree of substitutability, our results indicate support for models that use relatively simple measures as instruments for similarity.

A decision scheme is weakly strategy-proof if it is never possible for a voter to increase expected utility (for some vNM utility function consistent with her ordinal preferences) by misrepresenting her preferences when her belief about the preferences of other voters is generated by a model in which the other voters are i.i.d. draws from a distribution over possible preferences. We show that if there are at least three alternatives, a decision scheme is necessarily a random dictatorship if it is weakly strategy-proof, never assigns positive probability to Pareto dominated alternatives, and is anonymous in the sense of being unaffected by permutations of the components of the profile.

Our proposed test statistic is based on the distance between two shrinkage extremum estimators. The two estimators converge in probability to the same limit when identification is strong, and their asymptotic distributions are different when identification is weak. The proposed test is consistent not only for the alternative hypothesis of no identification but also for the alternative of weak identification, which is confirmed by our Monte Carlo results. We apply the proposed technique to test whether the structural parameters of a representative Taylor-rule monetary policy reaction function are identified. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, this notion of utility smoothing allows us to axionnatize a representation that captures an extreme dislike of losses. When applied to a consumption-saving problem, the nonmonotone preferences induced by our model never suggest a monotonically decreasing consumption profile. Furthermore, an optimal consumption sequence need not be monotonically increasing. Our model may suggest spreading large and small consumption allocations over time if the volatility involved in a utility sequence is sufficiently low. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Remarkably, satiation is allowed to occur only inside the set of feasible and individually rational allocations. One important class of its applications is new developments of asset pricing models where Knightian uncertainty makes preferences incomplete while the absence of a riskless asset makes them satiable.

Polyphenolic compounds are effective antioxidants regarding their ability to reat with free radicals of fatty acid and oxygen (free radical scavening effect).

Costs are highly variable depending on MS stage. This study was designed to assess the economic burden of Medicare-eligible patients by MS type in the United States using a claims-based classification algorithm to examine cost variation by disease stage. Methods: A sample of 2003 to 2006 Medicare patients was selected. Cases were classified as pre-existing progressive MS or pre-existing relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS); the latter were further subdivided into relapsing, remitting, or stable. Results: The sample had 5044 MS subjects, of whom 34.4% had prevalent progressive MS and 65.6% had prevalent RRMS. There were many chronic, comorbid conditions. The mean all-cause Medicare expenditures (not including self-administered medications) per person-year for MS in 2006 were $23,630 for prevalent progressive patients and $5887 for prevalent RRMS patients. Within the RRMS type, Medicare expenditures per person per month in 2006 were $1418 for relapsing patients, $608 for remitting patients, and $331 for stable patients. Conclusions: There are substantial cost advantages to Medicare for keeping RRMS patients in a stable health state and in keeping them from advancing in disability severity. The overall cost advantage would be diminished by the large cost burden of comorbidity, which would likely remain fixed with improved MS therapies.

Efficient care for recovering functional status is emphasized among policy makers. We investigated whether rehabilitation and its early initiation provided for CVD patients produced functional recovery in acute care hospitals. Methods: Using a Japanese administrative database during a 4-month interval from 2004 to 2008 in patients ages >= 15 years, we measured the demographics, consciousness level at admission, comorbidities, complications, procedures, ventilation administration, initiation day of rehabilitation, and hospital characteristics. Outcomes included total charges (TC) and functional status measured by the Barthel index (BI). Multivariate analysis measured the impact of rehabilitation and its early initiation on outcomes. To reduce the selection bias of rehabilitation and the ecological fallacy, we used propensity score matching and the linear mixed model. Results: Excluding 488 deceased patients, we analyzed 45,014 CVD patients. Rehabilitation at a generalized unit produced greater BI improvement than no rehabilitation or at intensive care units. A longer hospitalization, but not a 1-day delay of rehabilitation initiation, resulted in less BI improvement and more TC. A higher patient volume and academic hospitals were associated with more TC but not with BI improvement. Conclusions: Rehabilitation, but not the timing of rehabilitation, might accompany functional recovery in acute care hospitals. Because the hospital mix or medical units can explain the variation in the quality of rehabilitation, policy makers, along with monitoring unnecessary long hospitalizations, should encourage a referral policy for rehabilitation-intensive facilities and develop effective rehabilitation using technology to optimize functional outcomes.

Past international research has amply shown that we cannot afford to wait for a development path that automatically takes us on a sustainable future. Whether we look at global or local problems, the international debate increasingly points to the importance of popular support for environmental protection by a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Because environmental sustainability questions the way we produce, consume, and distribute the product of our work, an economic analysis that is limited to one market is insufficient. In addressing Bromley's question, How do we wish the future to unfold for us? this paper argues for the need to devote resources to understanding the spillovers between institutional settings and preferences toward the provision of global public goods. Here, this review focuses on labor-market institutions, as labor markets are traditionally the context in which inequality is created at the local and global levels. Labor-market institutional design, via its impact on risk and uncertainty and inequality, may have sizable implications on the provision of environmental care.","Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Magnani, E (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Australian Sch Business, High St,Gate 2,Kensington Campus, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",E.Magnani@unsw.edu.au,,"Magnani, Elisabetta/0000-0002-7570-3187",,,,,75,1,2,0,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER STREET, HOBOKEN, NJ, UNITED STATES",0077-8923,,978-1-57331-820-4,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2011,1219.0,,,,,,197,208,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05939.x,0.0,,,12,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Book Citation Index– Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index– Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BUD51,21332500.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000288933600011,0

Methods: A Markov model was used to calculate costs and benefits of nucleos(t)ide strategies in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative patients with hepatitis B virus mono-infection and compensated liver disease. The model included 18 disease states representing CHB progression. Quality-of-life data and costs for severe disease states were based on published studies, while monitoring costs for other disease states were based on expert opinion. Transition probabilities for movements between states were based on a meta-analysis, clinical trials, and natural history studies. Results: First-line TDF generated the highest net benefits of all 211 nucleos(t)ide strategies evaluated at a threshold of 20,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. First-line TDF cost 19,084 pound/QALY gained compared with giving lamivudine (LAM) first-line and switching to TDF when LAM resistance occurs. First-line TDF was also more effective and less costly than first-line entecavir (ETV), and showed extended dominance over first-line adefovir and strategies reserving adefovir, ETV, or combination therapy until after LAM resistance develops. For patients who have developed LAM resistance, TDF was also the most cost-effective treatment, generating greater net benefits than any other second-line strategy. Conclusions: First-line TDF is the most cost-effective treatment for patients with CHB at a 20,000 pound to 30,000 pound/QALY ceiling ratio, costing 19,084 pound/QALY gained compared with the next best alternative.","[Dakin, Helen; Bentley, Anthony] Abacus Int, Bicester OX26 6AA, Oxon, England; [Dakin, Helen] Univ Oxford, Dept Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Dusheiko, Geoff] Royal Free Hosp, Ctr Hepatol, London NW3 2QG, England",University of Oxford; University of London; University College London; Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust; UCL Medical School,"Dakin, H (通讯作者)，Abacus Int, 4 Market Sq, Bicester OX26 6AA, Oxon, England.",helen.dakin@abacusint.com,"Dakin, Helen A/X-2860-2018","Dakin, Helen A/0000-0003-3255-748X","Gilead Sciences Ltd, Cambridge, UK","Gilead Sciences Ltd, Cambridge, UK","This research was funded by Gilead Sciences Ltd, Cambridge, UK.",,73,34,36,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,922,933,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00782.x,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20825619.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000285066200010,0
J,"Morton, A",,,,"Morton, Alec",,,BRIDGING THE GAP: HEALTH EQUALITY AND THE DEFICIT FRAMING OF HEALTH,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,QALY; DALY; health equity,POVERTY; UTILITY; CARE,"The analyst tasked with measuring population health, with appraising healthcare investments, or allocating healthcare resources, may frame their task in one of two possible ways: either as being concerned with health assets (e.g. health expectancy or stock of QALYs), or with health deficits (a 'health gap', analogous to the poverty gap). In this paper, we discuss the consequences of taking the asset or the deficit concept as one's basic building block in developing a health measurement system when one has concerns about equitable distribution. We conclude that building metrics from a primitive health gap concept is possible and indeed may offer insights not otherwise easily accessible.

We consider alleviating such forecast failure by updating, intercept corrections, differencing, and estimating the future progress of an 'internal' break. Updating leads to a loss of cointegration when an EqCM suffers an equilibrium-mean shift, but helps when collinearities are changed by an 'external' break with the EqCM staying constant. Both mechanistic corrections help compared to retaining a pre-break estimated model, but an estimated model of the break process could outperform. We apply the approaches to EqCMs for UK M1, compared with updating a learning function as the break evolves. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Castle, Jennifer L.; Fawcett, Nicholas W.

This analysis evaluates the long-term cost-effectiveness of the preventive approach underpinning the Caries Management System, used in the general practice setting and modeled to the Australian population. Methods: An individual patient-simulation Markov model was developed to compare the long-term costs and outcomes of the Caries Management System versus standard dental care in a hypothetical sample representative of the Australian population. Eight Markov submodels were developed, representing eight molar teeth (excluding wisdom teeth), each consisting of 11 health states simulating the incidence and progression of dental caries, and future interventions such as fillings and crowns. Transition probabilities and costs assigned to health states were based on claims data from the second largest private health insurer in Australia. The economic evaluation was performed from the Australian private dental practitioner perspective. The incremental cost per DMFT avoided was calculated at three time points: 2 years, 3 years, and lifetime. Univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the results. Results: The incremental cost per DMFT avoided at 2 years, 3 years, and lifetime was estimated to be $1287.07, $1148.91, and $1795.06, respectively. Conclusion: The analysis suggests that the Caries Management System is most cost-effective in patients with a high risk of dental caries.","[Warren, Emma] HERA Consulting Australia, Balmain, NSW 2041, Australia; [Pollicino, Christine] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Curtis, Bradley; Evans, Wendell; Sbaraini, Alexandra; Schwarz, Eli] Univ Sydney, Fac Dent, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Warren, E (通讯作者)，HERA Consulting Australia, 21 Stephen St, Balmain, NSW 2041, Australia.",emma@heraconsulting.com.au,"Ackland, Julie/C-8607-2012; Balasubramanian, Madhan/E-7255-2010",,Oral Health Foundation; NHMRC [402466]; Dental Board of NSW; Australian Dental Research Foundation; Australian Dental Association (NSW); Colgate; Australian Healthcare Management; GC (Australia); MBF (Australia),Oral Health Foundation; NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Dental Board of NSW; Australian Dental Research Foundation; Australian Dental Association (NSW); Colgate; Australian Healthcare Management; GC (Australia); MBF (Australia),"This research has received funding from the Oral Health Foundation, NHMRC (project grant 402466), The Dental Board of NSW, and the Australian Dental Research Foundation.

We reexamine this issue mainly focussing at a flexible semiparametric estimation method that allows the parameters of the model to depend on a state variable. Using the age structure of the population as the state variable, we find that the income elasticity increases with population ageing, while other explanatory variables are not significantly influenced by it. Additionally we find that the HCE relationship becomes more and more unstable in ageing economies. These results explain the difficulty to identify both the influence of population ageing and income on HCE in previous studies. Furthermore they indicate that international convergence of HCE across countries crucially depends on the convergence of the population age structure. We also discuss the policy implications of our results regarding the design of a fair health-care financing system and the evolution of HCE to avoid budgetary problems.

The assignment game. I. The core, International journal of Game Theory 1, 11-130] agents are allowed to form one partnership at most. That paper proves that, in the context of firms and workers, given two stable payoffs for the firms there is a stable payoff which gives each firm the larger of the two amounts and also one which gives each of them the smaller amount. Analogous result applies to the workers. Sotomayor [Sotomayor, M., 1992. The multiple partners game. In: Majumdar, M. (Ed.), Dynamics and Equilibrium: Essays in Honor to D. Gale. Mcmillian, pp. 322-336] extends this analysis to the case where both types of agents may form more than one partnership and an agent's payoff is multi-dimensional. Instead, this note concentrates in the total payoff of the agents. It is then proved the rather unexpected result that again the maximum of any pair of stable payoffs for the firms is stable but the minimum need not be, even if we restrict the multiplicity of partnerships to one of the sides.

The variance decomposition analysis of shocks reveals that at business cycle horizons permanent shocks explain the bulk of the variations in output, while transitory shocks explain the bulk of the variations in health expenditures. We undertake a shock decomposition analysis for private health expenditures versus public health expenditures and interestingly find that while transitory shocks are more important for private sector expenditures, permanent shocks dominate public health expenditures.

A scientifically valid method for assessing patients' benefit risk trade-off preferences is needed to compare risks and benefits in a common metric. Objectives: The study aims to quantify the maximum acceptable risk (MAR) of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) that women with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are willing to accept in exchange for symptom relief. Methods: Research design: A stated-choice survey was used to elicit trade-off preferences among constructed treatment profiles, each defined by symptom severity and treatment-related AEs. Symptom attributes included frequency of abdominal pain and discomfort, frequency of diarrhea, and frequency of urgency. AE attributes included frequency of mild-to-moderate constipation and the risk of four possible serious AEs. Subjects: A Web-enabled survey was administered to 589 female US residents at least 18 years of age with a self-reported diagnosis of diarrheapredominant IBS. Measures: Preference weights and MAR were estimated using mixed-logit methods. Results: Subjects were willing to accept higher risks of serious AEs in return for treatments offering better symptom control. For an improvement from the lowest to the highest of four benefit levels, subjects were willing to tolerate a 2.65% increase in impacted-bowel risk, but only a 1.34% increase in perforated-bowel risk. Conclusions: Variation in MARs across AE types is consistent with the relative seriousness of the AEs. Stated-preference methods offer a scientifically valid approach to quantifying benefit risk trade-off preferences that can be used to inform regulatory decision-making.","[Johnson, F.

We propose a pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator (PMLE) of the parametric component that maximizes the likelihood with a preliminary estimator of the unspecified term plugged in. It is demonstrated how models and estimators can be used in a two-step specification testing strategy of semiparametric and fully parametric models, and shown that approximate/simulated versions of the PMLE inherit the properties of the actual but infeasible estimator. A simulation study investigates the finite sample performance of the PMLE. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We then obtain approximate decision rules for employment and childcare use, and estimate these jointly with the child's cognitive ability production function.

The loss of chloroquine due to the spread of parasite resistance is largely responsible for the resurgence of malaria. A new class of antimalarial drugs called artemisinins are available, but are unaffordable to most people in malaria-endemic countries and may quickly face the same fate as chloroquine unless they are combined with a partner drug. Subsidies for artemisinin combination treatments may be warranted on second-best grounds as they deter use of single-ingredient drugs, for which externalities from the risk of resistance evolution are larger. Furthermore, by expanding total effective drug use, subsidies reduce infection transmission externalities among individuals. However, use of combination treatments could still lead to drug resistance and the subsidies themselves entail welfare consequences. This paper develops a conceptual and numerical framework for understanding the conditions under which subsidies for artemisinin combinations can be justified on economic efficiency grounds.

Two estimators are introduced together with a set of sufficient conditions that ensure their root n-consistency, asymptotic normality and efficiency. Under mild assumptions, these conditions are satisfied for the Marginal Mean Treatment Effect and the Marginal Quantile Treatment Effect, estimands of particular importance for empirical applications. Previous results for average and quantile treatments effects are encompassed by the methods proposed here when the treatment is dichotomous. The results are illustrated by an empirical application studying the effect of maternal smoking intensity during pregnancy on birth weight, and a Monte Carlo experiment. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and thick tails interact to generate a spectrum of autocorrelation patterns consistent with the observed persistence in memory of many economic and financial time series. Depending upon the type of transformation considered and whether it is observed with noise, the autocorrelations are given by unity, random constants, or hyperbolically decaying deterministic functions, possibly with some independent noise, and thus may decay slowly or even not at all. Along with other sample characteristics, such patterns suggest that these three ingredients may generate the ubiquitous evidence for long memory. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The Panel's assumption that respondents in health state valuation (HSV) exercises take income losses into account could not be countered since there was no evidence regarding what people consider in HSV exercises. If they do consider income losses and if this changes HSVs, then all economic evaluations that have included PC in the numerator may have double-counted these costs. Alternatively, if respondents do not consider income losses then all past economic evaluations that have not included PC in the numerator have failed to account for sizeable societal costs. Objectives: Through a review we aim to recapture the debate surrounding the appropriate method for including PC in health economic evaluations, to identify empirical evidence addressing the assumptions of the Panel, and recommend a future research agenda. Methods: Through a review we identify, outline, and critically appraise the existing empirical studies that attempt to address whether respondents include income effects in HSV exercises. Results and conclusion: Seven empirical studies were identified. Overall, it seems that not explicitly mentioning the inclusion of income will induce a minority of respondents to include these effects and this appears not to influence results. More empirical work is needed, using generic instruments, larger samples, and using the interview method of administration.","[Tilling, Carl; Tsuchiya, Aki; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Krol, Marieke; Brouwer, Werner] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus MC, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Krol, Marieke; Brouwer, Werner] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus MC, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; University of Sheffield,"Tilling, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",c.tilling@sheffield.ac.uk,"Tsuchiya, Aki/A-2167-2010; Krol, Marieke/HGA-7950-2022; Brouwer, Werner/HSB-9241-2023; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Tsuchiya, Aki/0000-0003-4245-5399; Brouwer, Werner/0000-0002-0476-8397; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Krol, Marieke/0000-0002-6153-0828",Medical Research Council [MC_U145080960] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [MC_U145080960] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_U145080960] Funding Source: Medline,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,39,37,39,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2010,13.0,2,,,,,298,305,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00614.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,557KP,19804433.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274668300018,0

As a case study, the town of Lapethos, district of Kyrenia in North Cyprus is taken. Lapethos - founded in Neolithic times and since the 4(th) century B.C. is considered as one of the nine most important cities of the Island and now holds on its' shoulders the same problems as do all the cities of the developing counties. Second reason of choosing Lapethos as a case study - is its richness in cultural heritage. A street of Lapethos has been analyzed (buildings architectural styles and construction period, as well as the changes acquired during the time), with the scope to identify its significance. As a result of the conducted research, reasons for town preservation have been pointed out; methods in the field protecting Lapethos cultural heritage and its sustainable development were suggested.","[Cazacova, L.; Cazacova, N.; Erdelhun, A.; Ulbar, U.] European Univ Lefke, Lefke, Cyprus",Lefke Avrupa University,,,,,,,,,15,0,0,1,7,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,777,786,,,,,,10,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291664400085,0

Our estimate of elasticity of enrollment with respect to premium, -1.45, is larger in magnitude than has been found in the Medicare HMO market. This high degree of beneficiary price sensitivity for PDPs is consistent with relatively low product differentiation, low fixed costs of entry in the PDP market, and the fact that, in contrast to changing HMOs. beneficiaries can select a PDP without disrupting doctor-patient relationships.

After expiration, the monopolist behaves competitively in a generic industry having open access to the common pool of antibiotic efficacy and infection. The monopolist manages endogenously the levels of antibiotic efficacy as well as the infected population, which represent quality and market size respectively and achieves, at least temporarily, higher such levels than a hypothetically myopic monopolist who does not take into account the dynamic externalities. The pricing policy and the biological system is characterized by the turnpike property. Before the patent vanishes, the monopolist behaves more and more myopically, leading to a continuous decrease in the price of the antibiotic. Once the generic industry takes over, a discontinuous fall in price occurs. Whether a prolongation of the patent is socially desirable depends on the relative levels of antibiotic efficacy and infection. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The vast majority of natural antioxidants are being taken in by humans as a part of complex mixtures and therefore, the term Total Antioxidant Activity (TAA) has been introduced. The aim of this work was to determine the total TAA of grain in selected varieties of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) treated by zinc fertilizer in two growth stages and subsequently, compare the TAA to the qualitative parameters of malt. One of the most often used methods for establishing TAA is the TEAC (Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity) method that indicates the antioxidant activity of a sample that is equivalent to a specific amount of the standard of Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2- carboxylic acid). The extracts were obtained by mashing 25 g of homogenized grist with the supplement of 225 ml of distilled water at a temperature of 45 degrees C for the duration of 15 minutes. TEAC was determined on the basis of the samples' capacity to eliminate synthetic radicals DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl). The absorbance decrease was measured at the 515 nm wave length after 10 minutes from the beginning of the reaction. The highest average TEAC value was found in the Aksamit variety (1.34 mu mol . g(-1)), the lowest one was found in the Radegast variety (1.05 mu mol . g(-1)). The inter-variety difference for the measured TEAC values represented almost 30 %, the difference in varieties treated by zinc fertilizer was 10 %. Very weak or weak correlations were found between TEAC and the extract content (r=-0.3*), the final attenuation (r=0.34*), soluble nitrogen content (r=-0.43*), beta-glucans content (r=0.49*) and malting quality index (MQI, r=-0.33*).","[Marecek, V; Cerkal, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Marecek, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",vit.mareck@mendelu.cz,"Cerkal, Radim/C-2530-2009",,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,716,722,,,,,,7,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341786800090,0

Samples of goat and cow pasteured milk were inoculated by chosen microorganisms as Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecium a Escherichia coli. The number of microorganisms was monitored in process of cultivation for 3 days on 6 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C according the recommendation or standards.

It is evident that after 3 days of cultivation, when total counts of microorganism were compared with total counts of microorganisms of the check sample no matter variety of inoculated bacteria, the similar efect was reached. It depends on a variety of bacteria which is dominant in milk and what changes will happen. In both kinds of milk similar increase was noted although there is a possibility that goat milk represent a better substratum for microbial expansion.","[Nemcova, M.; Kalhotka, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Nemcová, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xnemco13@node.mendelu.cz,"Kalhotka, Libor/I-8496-2018",,,,,,10,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,742,749,,,,,,8,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341786800094,0

The method is based on creation/formation of stationary neutralization reaction boundary in the column, where ampholytes are selectively focused. Non-symmetrical pH field step gradient was realized by addition /use/ of ampholyte with convenient properties to the buffer on one side of the neutralization reaction boundary, whereas the second side contained only simple non-ampholytic buffers. Such electrolyte system has more convenient properties for the focusing over classical simple buffer systems. The pH span of this system can be easily lowered on one half, i.e. from neutral to alkaline, and/or acidic region, which brings more selectivity in focusing, whereas the buffered systems must cover all pH from alkaline to acidic region. The electrolytes can be set up such a way, that the pH on the ampholyte side can be constant, whilst the pH on the buffered side can be changed, still keeping boundary stationary. This is great advantage especially during the continuous dosing, where dosing electrolyte must have constant pH to keep the reproducibility /- constant fluxes of dosed ions/ and opposite-primary electrolyte can variate pH to set up selectivity. For the verification of the method, synthetic low-moleculal pI markers were selectively preconcentrated from the mixture and analyzed by ITP [1]. At pH 6.95 of dosing electrolyte, ampholyte of pI 8.6 was preconcentrated 14.4 times, ampholyte of pI 7 was preconcentrated 4.1 times and ampholyte of pI 6.2 was preconcentrated only 1.4 times in the time of 7000sec.","[Sisperova, E.; Glovinova, E.; Pospichal, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Chem & Biochem, Fac Agron, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Sisperová, E (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Chem & Biochem, Fac Agron, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",el.siska@seznam.cz,"Pospichal, Jan/J-4145-2018",,,,,,2,0,0,1,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,992,998,,,,,,7,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341786800130,0

Total annual costs per patient plus the cost for specific services (e.g. clinic visit, radiograph, laboratory, inpatient admission) were compared using scatterplots, correlations. mean difference, and standard deviation of individual differences. Analysis are based upon 2001 costs for 14915 patients at 72 facilities. Correlations ranged from 0.24 for the cost of outpatient encounters to 0.77 for the cost of inpatient admissions. and 0.85 for total annual cost. The mean difference between costing methods was $707 ($4168 versus $3461) for total annual cost. The standard deviation of the individual differences was $5934. Overall, the agreement between the two costing systems varied by the specific cost being measured and increased with aggregation. Administrators and researchers conducting cost analyses need to carefully consider the purpose, methods, characteristics, strengths. and weaknesses when selecting a method for assessing cost.

The proposed model offers a more flexible structure of cointegration where the value of cointegrating coefficients may be affected by informative covariates and thus may vary over time. The model may be viewed as a stochastic cointegration model and includes the conventional cointegration model as a special case. The proposed new model provides a useful complement to the conventional fixed coefficient cointegration models. Both kernel and local polynomial estimators are investigated. Inference procedures for instability of cointegrating parameters and a test for cointegration are proposed based on the functional-coefficient estimates. Limiting distributions of the estimates and testing statistics are derived. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A recent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence appraisal focussed on the indirect comparison of docetaxel with erlotinib in second-line treatment of NSCLC based on trials including a common comparator. We compared the results of this analysis to a network meta-analysis including other trials that formed a network of evidence. We also examined the importance of allowing for the correlations between the estimated treatment effects that can arise when analysing such networks. Results: The analysis of the restricted network including only trials of docetaxel and erlotinib linked via the common placebo comparator produced an estimated mean hazard ratio (HR) for erlotinib compared with docetaxel of 1.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-2.97). In contrast, the network meta-analysis produced an estimated HR for erlotinib compared with docetaxel of 0.83 (95% CI 0.65-1.06). Analyzing the wider network improved the precision of estimated treatment effects, altered their rankings and also allowed further treatments to be compared. Some of the estimated treatment effects from the wider network were highly correlated. Conclusions: This empirical example shows the importance of considering all potentially relevant data when comparing treatments. Care should therefore be taken to consider all relevant information, including correlations induced by the network of trial data, when comparing treatments.","[Hawkins, Neil; Scott, David A.; Woods, Beth S.] Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Oxford OX2 0JJ, England; [Thatcher, Nicholas] Christie Hosp, NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Med Oncol, Manchester, Lancs, England",Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Christie NHS Foundation Trust; Christie Hospital,"Hawkins, N (通讯作者)，Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Seacourt Tower,West Way, Oxford OX2 0JJ, England.",neil.hawkins@oxfordoutcomes.com,,"Woods, Bethan Sarah/0000-0002-7669-9415; Hawkins, Neil/0000-0003-3199-221X; Scott, David Alexander/0000-0001-6475-8046","Roche Products Ltd, UK","Roche Products Ltd, UK","This research was part-funded by Roche Products Ltd, UK.",,31,37,41,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2009,12.0,6,,,,,996,1003,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00541.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,474SP,19402854.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000268304600018,0

Health aid has a beneficial and statistically significant effect on infant mortality: doubling per capita health aid is associated with a 2 percent reduction in the infant mortality rate. For the average country, this implies that increasing per capita health aid by US$1.60 per year is associated with 1.5 fewer infant deaths per thousand births. The estimated effect is small, relative to the 2015 target envisioned by the Millennium Development Goals. It implies that achieving the MDG target through additional health aid alone would require a roughly 15-fold increase in current levels of aid. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The Rasch rating scale, a one-parameter logistic item response model, may enhance FKSI-DRS interpretation and validate its measurement properties. We applied the Rasch model to FKSI-DRS data from a randomized phase 3 trial in which first-line sunitinib therapy showed superiority to interferon-alfa in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Of 750 enrolled patients, 668 patients completed the questionnaire on cycle 1, day 28 and were evaluated in the current study. The nine FKSI-DRS items were analyzed to enhance interpretation of the summary score by using an item characteristic curve that related score to probability of reporting specific symptoms. The Rasch model fitted the FKSI-DRS well: 8 of 9 items had acceptable infit and outfit statistics (< 1.5, > 0.5); item difficulty spanned a wide range (-3.23 to 1.64 logits); and the five response categories performed adequately. The item characteristic curve offered enhanced interpretation of FKSI-DRS: For example, an FKSI-DRS score of 27 (mean baseline score for total sample) indicated a 47% chance of reporting no to lack of energy, although a two-point difference between sunitinib and interferon-alfa, averaged across all assessments (29 vs. 27), corresponded to sunitinib achieving a 28% increase (13% absolute difference) in the probability of reporting no to lack of energy (60% vs. 47%). Data suggest that the FKSI-DRS is an adequate measure of symptom status in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The Rasch model supports its validation and enhances its interpretation.","[Luo, Xuemei] Pfizer Inc, Global Outcomes Res, New London, CT 06320 USA; [Cappelleri, Joseph C.] Pfizer Inc, Biostat, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Cella, David] Evanston NW Healthcare, Psychiat & Behav Sci, Evanston, IL USA; [Li, Jim Z.] Pfizer Inc, Global Outcomes Res, La Jolla, CA USA; [Charbonneau, Claudie] Pfizer Inc, Global Outcomes Res, New York, NY USA; [Kim, Sindy T.; Chen, Isan] Pfizer Inc, Oncol Clin Dev, Jolla, CA USA; [Motzer, Robert J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Div Solid Tumor Oncol, New York, NY 10021 USA",Pfizer; Pfizer; NorthShore University Health System; Pfizer; Pfizer; Pfizer; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,"Luo, XM (通讯作者)，Pfizer Inc, Global Outcomes Res, 50 Pequot Ave,MS 6025-A3221, New London, CT 06320 USA.",xuemei.luo@pfizer.com,"li, jim/JXM-2034-2024","Motzer, Robert/0000-0001-6925-2327",Pfizer Inc,Pfizer Inc(Pfizer),Sources of financial support: This study was funded by Pfizer Inc.,,23,8,10,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4,,,,,580,586,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00473.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,19900256.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000266467800026,0

We examine the effects of providing consumers with quality information in the context of fertility clinics providing Assisted Reproductive Therapies (ART). We report three main findings. First, clinics with higher birth rates had larger market shares after the adoption of report cards relative to before. Second, clinics with a disproportionate share of young, relatively easy-to-treat patients had lower market shares after adoption versus before. This Suggests that consumers take into account information On patient mix when evaluating clinic outcomes. Third, report cards had larger effects on consumers and clinics from states with ART insurance coverage mandates. We Conclude that consumers respond to quality report cards when choosing among providers of ART. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Bundorf, M.

We introduce a screening model of the hard drug market in which dealers use payment and punishment options to screen between high and low risk users. We show that, if a free drug program selects Sufficiently many high-risk drug users, the pure-strategy separating market equilibrium ceases to exist and a symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium results, in which drug users derive a higher expected utility. This encourages new drug users to enter the market. The novelty of the paper is the transmission mechanism for this effect, which is via the influence on market price. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As adopted children are genetically unrelated to the nurturing parents, the educational effect on them is most likely to be the nurturing effect. We find that the mother's education is an important determinant of the health of adopted children even after we control for income, the number of siblings, health environments, and other socioeconomic variables. Moreover, the effect of the mother's education on the adoptee sample is similar to that on the own birth sample, which suggests that the main effect of the mother's education on child health is in post-natal nurturing. We also find suggestive evidence that the effect is Causal. Our work provides new evidence to the general literature that examines the determinants of health and that examines the intergenerational immobility of socioeconomic status. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, limited data are available on the relative costs and clinical outcomes following these diagnostic procedures. The objective of this study is to assess and compare costs associated with diagnostic imaging in peripheral vascular occlusive disease (PAOD). US veterans (n = 19,209) with CE-MRA or DSA for the assessment of PAOD from fiscal year (FY) 1999 to FY 2004. Main outcome measure(s) using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) costing algorithms, cost, and log-cost of interventions (e.g., revascularization, stent, angioplasty), amputations or mortality rates within 30/90 days and 1 year of DSA or CE-MRA were compared, and adjusted for patient characteristics and disease severity using multivariate regression. Imaging modality selection bias was evaluated with propensity score, instrumental variables, and Heckman methods using untransformed costs and log-costs with smearing retransformation. Initial CE-MRA imaging was significantly more likely among patients with prior renal disease or bypass surgery [odds ratio (OR) > 2; P < 0.001], and less likely among patients with prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), claudication, or other cardiovascular disease (OR < 0.7; P < 0.001). After adjusting for endogenous choice of initial imaging modality, 30-day treatment costs were US$3500-$4300 lower (P < 0.001) for patients with initial CE-MRA. Eighty-two percent of DSA imaging patients had no additional procedures or events within 30 days, and 65% at 90 days. Less than 3.2% (3.6%) of patients had any repeat imaging within 30 (90) days of initial imaging. Relative to DSA, CE-MRA imaging was associated with substantial treatment episode savings, beyond the US$950 direct savings in imaging cost per procedure. Substituting CE-MRA for DSA among those not planning or requiring any follow-up procedures within 30 days, could have reduced outpatient imaging costs by up to 55%, and reduced VA system costs by US$13.2 million over the six-year period.","[Hay, Joel W.] Univ So Calif, Dept Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Lawler, Elizabeth; Gaziano, John Michael; Scranton, Richard E.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Aging, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lawler, Elizabeth; Gaziano, John Michael; Scranton, Richard E.] VA Boston Healthcare Syst, Boston, MA USA; [Yucel, Kent] Tufts Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA USA; [Guo, Amy; Balzer, Thomas] Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ USA; [Balzer, Thomas] Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceut, Wayne, NJ USA",University of Southern California; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Harvard University; VA Boston Healthcare System; Tufts Medical Center; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals,"Hay, JW (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Dept Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, CHP 140,1540 E Alcazar St, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",jhay@usc.edu,,,,,,,15,12,12,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,262,266,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00438.x,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,18657093.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000263467500011,0

The lowest rate of ammonia emission was recorded from manure with lesser proportion of free urine. The highest amount of ammonia emits from liquid manure - 198,4 +/- 5,8 mg/(m(2) h); emission from semi-liquid manure is equal to 125,1 +/- 3,5 mg/(m(2)h) and from thick manure - 92,0 +/- 2,9 mg/(m(2)h). Linear dependence of gas emission on temperature conditions was determined. Temperature increment of I degrees C causes increase of carbon dioxide emission by 17,6 mg/(ml h) on average, whilst for ammonia from liquid manure - by 4,5 mg/(m(2)h), at temperature range from 14,5 to 48,5 degrees C. The regression equation was proposed for predicting correlation of ammonia and carbon dioxide gaseous emissions from different cattle manure. Ammonia emission is more intensive at a higher rate of CO(2) emission and correlation of these factors is linear. When carbon dioxide emission increases by 12,2 times, ammonia emission from liquid manure increases by multiplication factor 6,4 and from thick manure - by 4,6. We proposed the following measures for reduction of atmosphere pollution with ammonia: lower temperature in a barn, moving out cattle manure and especially urine from a barn as soon as possible and intensive littering. However, mixing manure with litter is not advisable. The most important thing in manure handling is aiming for reduction of fresh manure contacts with air and unbreaked crust on a surface. It was determined that calculation of air circulation on terms of water vapour content was sufficient for designing of cattle-housing ventilation systems. If low level of air humidity in a barn will be ensured, low concentrations of carbon dioxide and ammonia will be guaranteed as well.","[Bleizgys, Rolandas; Prakupimaite, Indre] Lithuanian Univ Agr, Dept Heat & Biotechnol Engn, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas R, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,Rolandas.Bleizgys@lzuu.lt; Indre.Prakupimaite@lzuu.lt,,"Bleizgys, Rolandas/0000-0002-6100-8052",,,,,19,0,0,0,2,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,289,293,,,,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Engineering, Environmental; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Engineering; Public Administration,BNL17,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845700051,0

Measuring unfair inequalities implies that a distinction is introduced between causal variables leading to ethically legitimate inequalities and causal variables leading to ethically illegitimate inequalities. An example of the former could be life-style choices, an example of the latter is social background. We show how to derive measures of unfair inequalities in health and in health care delivery from a structural model of health care and health production: direct unfairness, linked to the variations in medical expenditures and health in the hypothetical distribution in which all legitimate sources of variation are kept constant; fairness gap, linked to the differences between the actual distribution and the hypothetical distribution in which all illegitimate Sources of variation have been removed. These two approaches are related to the theory of fair allocation. In general they lead to different results. We propose to analyse the resulting distributions with the traditional apparatus of Lorenz curves and inequality measures. We compare our proposal to the more common approach using concentration curves and analyse the relationship with the methods of direct and indirect standardization. We discuss how inequalities in health care can be integrated in all overall evaluation of social inequality. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To get a broad view of the techniques used, a few operations have been adopted at each of the corresponding steps of classical TOPSIS, such as evaluation matrix, normalization, distance measures etc. Finally, an example of construction project management performance evaluation is shown to highlight the procedure of the proposed model.","[Li, Chenghua] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Xian 710055, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology,,Li_chenghua@126.com,"Li, Chenghua/L-9825-2019","Li, Chenghua/0000-0003-2978-8762",,,,,15,0,0,0,1,ALFRED UNIV,ALFRED,"ONE SAXON DR, ALFRED, NY 14802 USA",,,978-0-9800510-2-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2496,2502,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJZ06,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267479301073,0

By 2025, the estimated total world population will be of the order of 7.9 billion. Water plays a central role in any systematic appraisal of life sustaining requirements. Water also strongly influences economic activity (both production and consumption) and social roles. Fresh water is distributed unevenly, with nearly 500 million people suffering water stress or serious water scarcity. Two-thirds of the world's population may be subjected to moderate to high water stress in 2025. It is estimated that by 2025, the total water use will increase by to 40%. The resources of water supply and recreation may also come under stress due to changes in climate such as water balance for Lake Balaton (Hungary). Conventional urban water systems such as water supply, wastewater, and storm water management are also currently going through stress and require major rethinking. To maintain urban water systems efficiently in the future, a flexibility approach will allow incorporation of new technologies and adaptation to external changes (for example society or climate change). Because water is an essential resource for sustaining health, both the quantity and quality of available water supplies must be improved. The impact of water quality on human health is severe, with millions of deaths each year from water-borne diseases, while water pollution and aquatic ecosystem destruction continue to rise. Additionally, emerging contaminants such as endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs), pharmaceuticals, and toxins in the water body are also of a great concern. An innovative ferrate(VI) technology is highly effective in removing these contaminants in water. This technology is green. which addresses problems associated with chlorination and ozonation for treating pollutants present in water and wastewater. Examples are presented to demonstrate the applications of ferrate(VI) technology to meet the demand of water in this century.","[Sharma, Virender A.] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Chem, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",Florida Institute of Technology,,vsharma@fit.edu,"Sharma, Virender K/N-9306-2016","Sharma, Virender K/0000-0002-5980-8675",,,,,21,2,3,0,21,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-0694-0,AIP CONF PROC,,,2009,1157.0,,,,,,128,137,,,,,,10,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BLH26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000270167600016,0

The approximation converges to the true likelihood as the simulation size goes to infinity. In addition, the approximating likelihood is continuous as a function of the unknown parameters under rather general conditions. The approach advocated is fast and robust, and it avoids many of the pitfalls associated with current techniques based upon importance sampling. We assess the performance of the method by considering a linear state space model, comparing the results with the Kalman filter, which delivers the true likelihood. We also apply the method to a non-Gaussian state space model, the stochastic volatility model, finding that the approach is efficient and effective. Applications to continuous time finance models and latent panel data models are considered. Two different multivariate approaches are proposed. The neoclassical growth model is considered as an application. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This methodological systematic review describes the extent to which EQ-5D has been used in the evaluation of children's health care, assesses psychometric properties, and makes recommendations for future good practice. Methods: Systematic searches of databases and the Internet to identify studies published during 2000-2010 that either used EQ-5D with children younger than age 19 years as an outcome measure or reported psychometric data. Study characteristics, including measures and psychometric data, were extracted into tables for analysis. Results: We identified 29 studies that used four versions of the EQ-5D: adult EQ-5D, EQ-5D-Y, Dutch EQ-5D child, and extended with cognitive dimension, EQ-5D+C. Twelve of 29 studies did not specify the EQ-5D version used. Existing literature lacks detail on the specific use of EQ-5D and its potential effects on findings. Version use and psychometric properties were inadequately reported. There are large gaps in current knowledge of psychometric properties across all versions when used with children. Conclusions: For reasons of comparability with resource use across adult and children's services, there are arguments for continued use of EQ-5D in studies with children. We recommend use of EQ-5D alongside children-specific quality of life measures and disease-specific measures. Researchers are encouraged to undertake methodological and philosophical analyses to better understand and improve evidence as to how adults who make decisions about resource allocation can best take account of children in decision making.","[Edwards, R.

The application is obstetrics, where always both a mother's and a child's health are at stake. Methods: An open-ended contingent valuation method (CVM) as a direct WTP elicitation method, and the discrete choice experiment (DCE) as an indirect WTP elicitation method. Vignettes to be valued were based on clinical patient data. Participants were 88 laypersons who received their questionnaires by postal mail. Results: The DCE task was completed faster (p=0.006) and was regarded easier (p<0.001) than the CVM task. Test-retest for CVM was substantial (ICC=0.76), and for DCE moderate (k=0.49). Female sex (p<0.001), age >= 50 years (p=0.013), higher income (p<0.001), and higher education (p<0.001) were associated with higher WTP. Correlation between CVM and DCE was 0.79 (Kendall's Tau-b; p<0.001). The implied WTP as derived with DCE was between 2.3 and 10.2 times higher than with CVM. The relationship between the WTPs was linear. Conclusion: It is yet unclear what lies behind the numbers of DCE. DCE has no methodological benefits over the conventional CVM when eliciting WTP for complex health outcomes in obstetrics.

Building on the specific features of the French Health insurance system, this paper shows that variation in the monetary costs of the diagnosis procedure may have a very significant impact on how parents solve this ethical dilemma. The French institutions make it possible to compare otherwise similar women facing very different reimbursement schemes and we find that eligibility to full reimbursement has a largely positive effect on the probability of taking an amniocentesis test. By contrast, the sole fact of being labelled 'high-risk' by the Health system seems to have, as such, only a modest effect on subsequent choices. Finally, building on available information on post-amniocentesis outcomes, we report new evidence suggesting that amniocentesis increases the risk of premature birth and low weight at birth.

Ignoring deaths or using Inverse Probability Weights (IPWs) to re-weight the sample for mortality-related attrition can produce misleading results. Incorporating deaths into the longitudinal analysis of income-related health inequalities provides a more complete picture in terms of the evaluation of health changes in respect to socioeconomic status. We illustrate our work by investigating health mobility from 1999 till 2004 using the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). We show that for Scottish males explicitly accounting for the dead rather than using IPWs to account for mortality-related attrition changes the direction of the relationship between relative health changes and initial income position, from negative to positive, while for other groups it significantly increases the strength of the positive relationship. Incorporating the dead may be vital in the longitudinal analysis of health inequalities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using a representative panel of self-employed GPs over the years 1993-2004, this paper tests whether these low-income GPs choose to work less than all other GPs or whether they are constrained to do so. The test is based on measuring reactions to positive and negative demand shocks. As low-income GPs do not increase activity in response to a positive demand shock but decrease activity in response to a negative demand shock, it appears that their low-income status is attributable to a strong preference for leisure.

Discussion groups help participants reflect critically upon their own reasoning processes and go some way towards revealing underlying values rather than unreflective preferences. As a part of the exercise, participants were asked to allocate a hospital budget. After discussion and deliberation only three out of 41 chose to allocate all of the money to the low-cost patients. Reasons were not based on conceptual confusion or lack of insight into the implications of the different strategies, but rather on views about fairness, including the importance of giving all groups a 'chance' of being treated and of not removing 'hope' from high-cost patients. The results suggest that as costs rise people are willing to pay more than the minimum cost of a quality-adjusted life year for equity reasons, indicating that caution must be exercised in estimating a single monetary value for a QALY.

We combine cross-sectional survey data with information from the Dutch national hospital register. Four different indicators of health (self-perceived health, long-term impairments, ADL limitations and comorbidity) are considered. We find that for ages 50 to 70, differences in hospital costs between good health and bad health are substantial and persist during the whole time period. However, for higher ages expected hospital costs for individuals in bad health decline rapidly and become lower than those for people in good health after about six to seven years. The higher mortality rate among people in bad health is the primary cause here. Our results are confirmed for all four health indicators. We conclude that relying on better health to contain healthcare expenditures is too optimistic, and the interaction between health and mortality should be taken into account when projecting healthcare costs. Healthy ageing is important, but more for health gains than for cost savings.

We interpret CER as infusing evidence on product quality into markets, shifting the relative demand for products in CER studies. We analyze how shifts in demand affect health and health care spending and demonstrate that CER may raise or lower overall health when treatments have heterogeneous effects, but payers respond with product-specific coverage policies. Among patients with schizophrenia, we calibrate that subsidy policies based on the clinical trial CATIE may have reduced overall health by inducing some patients to switch away from schizophrenia treatments that were effective for them towards winners of the CER.

Methods: Inclusion criteria for this is a 1-year prospective study included being 18 years of age or older and clinically stable receiving chronic dialysis. Quality of life was measured using the SF-12 and the Kidney Disease Quality of Life questionnaires at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Patients who completed the surveys for all three periods were evaluated. Differences in quality of life scores were measured using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Results: One hundred eighty-nine of 249 (76%) HD patients and 161 of 228 (71%) PD patients completed all three surveys. The PD group was older and a larger number had diabetes. PD patients consistently had higher scores than HD patients at all three measurement periods for patient satisfaction (P = 0.002, P = 0.005, and P = 0.005, respectively), encouragement/support from staff (P = 0.003, P = 0.017, and P = 0.029, respectively), and burden of kidney disease (P = 0.003, P = 0.017, and P = 0.057, respectively). The HD group had a greater percent of patients who clinically improved from baseline to 12 months compared to PD patients for sleep quality, social support, encouragement/support from staff, and overall health. Scores for other dimensions of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life and SF-12 questionnaires were not significantly different between the PD and HD groups. Conclusions: The results provide evidence that PD and HD patients have equivalent health-related quality of life in several domains, although the former performed better in some quality of life domains despite being older and having more comorbidities.","[de Abreu, Mirhelen Mendes] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Med, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Walker, David R.] Baxter Healthcare Corp, McGaw Pk, IL USA; [Sesso, Ricardo C.] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Div Nephrol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Ferraz, Marcos B.] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo Ctr Hlth Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Baxter International Inc; Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP),"de Abreu, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Med, Av Washington Luis,Km 235,SP 310, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",mirhelen@ufscar.br,"Sesso, Ricardo C C/B-4767-2013","Sesso, Ricardo/0000-0002-1062-0073",Baxter Healthcare Corporation,Baxter Healthcare Corporation,The authors indicated that this study was sponsored by Baxter Healthcare Corporation.,,14,30,34,0,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,S,,,S119,S121,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.016,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BE,21839882.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081000026,0

Physicians who own ASCs could treat their most profitable patients at their ASCs and less profitable patients at hospitals. This paper asks if the profitability of an outpatient surgery impacts where a physician performs the surgery. Using a sample of Medicare patients from the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery, we find that higher profit surgeries do have a higher probability of being performed at an ASC compared to a hospital. After controlling for surgery type, a 10% increase in a surgery's profitability is associated with a 1.2 to 1.4 percentage point increase in the probability the surgery is performed at an ASC.

A recursive construction allows the definition of priors whose marginals have a general stick-breaking form. The processes with Poisson-Dirichlet and Dirichlet process marginals are investigated in some detail. We develop a general conditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for inference in the wide subclass of these models where the parameters of the marginal stick-breaking process are nondecreasing sequences. We derive a generalised Polya urn scheme type representation of the Dirichlet process construction, which allows us to develop a marginal MCMC method for this case. We apply the proposed methods to financial data to develop a semi-parametric stochastic volatility model with a time-varying nonparametric returns distribution. Finally, we present two examples concerning the analysis of regional GDP and its growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Griffin, J.

Using the idea of Coase Theorem, we show that when the resale market is a sequential bargaining model with no commitment, the auctioneer's revenue is substantially reduced, and the ranking is the opposite of Hafalir and Krishna (2009). We establish a version of the Coase Theorem in the context of the auctions with resale. When Coase Theorem holds, we show that the revenue of the auction with resale is lower than the revenue of the same auction without resale. We also provide the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium for our model of auctions with resale. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In response to the dramatic rise in methamphetamine use and its associated burden, a broad range of legislations has been passed to combat the problem. In this paper, we assess the impact of retail-level laws intended to restrict chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine (methamphetamine precursor laws) in reducing indicators of domestic production, methamphetamine availability, and the consequences of methamphetamine use. Specifically, we examine trends in these indicators of methamphetamine supply and use over a period spanning the implementation of the federal Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act (MAPA) (October 2000) and a more stringent state-level restriction enacted in California (January 2000). The results are mixed in terms of the effectiveness of legislative efforts to control methamphetamine production and use, depending on the strength of the legislation (California Uniform Controlled Substances Act versus federal MAPA), the specification of the comparison group, and the particular outcome of interest. Some evidence suggests that domestic production was impacted by these legislative efforts, but there is also evidence that prices fell, purities rose, and treatment episodes increased.

THE EFFECT OF HOUSEHOLD ENVIRONMENT ON HEALTH,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,childhood obesity; cigarette; tobacco; prices; taxes,FOOD INSECURITY; SMOKING; OBESITY; OVERWEIGHT; SEVERITY; WEIGHT,"Several recent studies demonstrate a positive effect of cigarette prices and taxes on obesity among adults, especially those who smoke. If higher cigarette costs affect smokers' weights by increasing calories consumed or increasing food expenditures, then cigarette taxes and prices may also affect obesity in children of smokers. This study examines the link between child body mass index (BMI) and obesity status and cigarette costs using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-79 (NLSY79). Controlling for various child, mother, and household characteristics as well as child-fixed effects, I find that cigarette taxes and prices increase BMI in the children of smoking mothers. Interestingly, and unlike previous research findings for adults, higher cigarette taxes do not increase the likelihood of obesity in children. These findings are consistent with a causal mechanism in which higher cigarette costs reduce smoking and increase food expenditures and consumption in the household.

Skewness affinity is shown to be equivalent to the marginal rate of substitution between mean and variance of wealth being decreasing in the skewness. This property allows us to characterize the comparative static effect of increases in the skewness in quasilinear decision problems. Over domains of skewness-comparable lotteries skewness affinity is equivalent to the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility index of relative temperance being smaller than three. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The decision to adopt a technology also influences the prospects of acquiring further evidence because the incentives to conduct research are reduced and the ethical basis of further clinical trials maybe undermined. In these circumstances the decision maker must consider whether the benefits of immediate access to a technology exceeds the value of the evidence which maybe forgone for future patients. We outline how these expected opportunity losses can be established from the perspective of a societal decision maker with and without the remit to commission research, and demonstrate how these considerations change the appropriate decision rules in cost-effectiveness analysis. Importantly, we identify those circumstances in which the approval of a technology that is expected to be cost-effective should be withheld, i.e. when an 'only in research' recommendation should be made. We demonstrate that a sufficient condition for immediate adoption of a technology can provide incentives for manufacturers to reduce the price or provide additional supporting evidence. However, decisions based solely on expected net benefit provide no such incentives, may undermine the evidence base for future clinical practice and reduce expected net health benefits for the patient population.

The method proceeds from Bayesian estimates of parameters and impulse response functions. In order to analyze changes in parameter estimates and impulse response functions in time, a number of estimation procedures are carried out. Each estimation involves the same baseline model with the same prior setting and varies only in the time-frame of the data set. Resulting changes in the estimates of parameters and different shapes of impulse response functions may point to changes in behavior of the system caused only by using different data span.

We show that n-player bargaining problems have a unique self-supporting outcome under the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution. For all possible loss aversion coefficients we determine the bargaining solutions that give exactly these outcomes, and characterize them by the standard axioms of Scale Invariance, Individual Monotonicity, and Strong Individual Rationality, and a new axiom called Proportional Concession Invariance (PCI).

This gives us a prove about impact of risk premium and financial accelerator on the output. Furthermore, it determines also effect of shocks on observed variables.

BESD is the correlation coefficient and represents a percentage difference in outcome attributable to an intervention. Both d and BESD are in arbitrary units; neither measures the absolute change resulting from intervention. The method used to estimate absolute change from BESD assumes both a 50-50 split of the outcome and a balanced design. Consequently, inaccurate assumptions underpin most meta-analytic estimates of the gain resulting from an intervention (and of its cost effectiveness). This article develops an exact formula without these assumptions. Methods: The formula is developed algebraically from 1) the formula for the correlation coefficient represented as a 2-by-2 contingency table constructed from the relative size of the treatment and control groups and the percentage of people who would have the condition absent intervention, and 2) the BESD correlation coefficient formula showing change in success probability with treatment. Results: Simulation reveals that BESD only approximates the reduction in the outcome an intervention might well achieve when the problem outcome occurs in 35%-65% of cases. For less common outcomes, BESD substantially overestimates the impact of an intervention. Even when BESD accurately estimates the likely percentage change in outcome, it paints a misleading picture of the proportion of cases that will achieve a positive outcome.

Yet, our ability to increase the global supply of conventional crude oil much beyond current levels is doubtful, which may pose a problem for continued economic growth. Our research indicates that, due to the depletion of conventional, and hence cheap, crude oil supplies (i.e., peak oil), increasing the supply of oil in the future would require exploiting lower quality resources (i.e., expensive), and thus could occur only at high prices. This situation creates a system of feedbacks that can be aptly described as an economic growth paradox: increasing the oil supply to support economic growth will require high oil prices that will undermine that economic growth. From this we conclude that the economic growth of the past 40 years is unlikely to continue in the long term unless there is some remarkable change in how we manage our economy.","[Murphy, David J.; Hall, Charles A.

Previous political system has distorted not just the environment but also the local rural economy completely. The tourism issue gained on the importance as one of priorities of national economy, when Slovakia became the part of the EU. By proper execution, there are much fewer negative impacts on the environment than by other branches of the industry. Existing risks connected with the disturbance and the devastation of natural environment by mass, uncoordinated tourism, oriented only on higher profits cannot be forgotten. The research area is situated in the middle part of the district Trebisov. It is characteristic rural area lying in the Eastern Slovak lowland and the edge of Zemplin Mountains, with the lonely standing volcano hills of the name Avas and Velky vrch. In spite of the high quality of natural potential, the development of the tourism in the micro-region is in the stagnation. This paper can serve as an example of the implement tool which offers a general overview for natural assumes to the development of the tourism in a connection with environmental planning and management.

Because of its effectiveness, screening has been adopted or is planned in a number of other countries. In most countries, the screening method (e.g., fecal occult blood test [FOBT], sigmoidoscopy) is followed by colonoscopy, for verification. In other countries (e.g., United States, Germany), colonoscopy is the preferred first-line investigation method. However, because colonoscopy is considered to be invasive, might be poorly tolerated, and can be associated with complications, the idea of adopting colonoscopy as the primary screening method suffers. Negative effects of screening methods can reduce participation in programs and thereby negate the desired effect on individual and societal health. At present, there is no generally accepted method either to assess the perception and satisfaction of patients screened or the outcome of the screening procedures in CRC. In this review, we discuss the past development and present availability of instruments to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the scarce studies in which such instruments have been used in screening campaigns, and the findings. We suggest the creation of a specific instrument for the assessment of HRQoL in CRC screening. Copyright (C) 2011, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

We describe the process of conversion-symptoms identification based on data provided by MMPI-2 (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory). Linguistic fuzzy rules are introduced to represent the expert knowledge of the process in three stages - protocol validity, data appropriateness, and conversion V obviousness. Finally, a fuzzy-rule-base aggregation of the three evaluations of a MMPI-2 profile is introduced. Sugeno's fuzzy inference algorithm is used. A fuzzy classification of conversion-symptom presence into three categories (present, possibly present and not present) is performed in this step.

In days with low airflow speed was the value in average 0.10 m/s and the proportion of cows lying was 66.50%. In the days with maximal airflow speed was an average speed 0.65 m/s and the proportion of lying cows 69.10%. The difference in proportions of lying cows was not statistically significant (p <0.05). Evaluation of data by using correlation coeficients did not show on direct relationship between airflow speed and the number of lying cows in the case of both (minimum resp. maximum) airflow speed (r= 0.04, resp.-0.02).","[Zejdova, P.; Falta, D.; Vecera, M.; Polak, O.; Studeny, S.; Chladek, G.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Zejdová, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",PetraZejdova@seznam.cz,"Falta, Daniel/AAT-9509-2020; Chládek, Gustav/K-3994-2018; Falta, Daniel/J-5001-2018; Večeřa, Milan/L-1560-2018; Polák, Ondřej/D-4411-2016","Falta, Daniel/0000-0002-7679-923X; Chládek, Gustav/0000-0002-4223-0934; Falta, Daniel/0000-0002-7679-923X; Večeřa, Milan/0000-0002-3363-0717;",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,323,329,,,,,,7,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341783400039,0

This hypothesis states that individual health as well as socioeconomic outcomes, such as educational attainment, employment status, and wages, are affected by the health of that individual while in utero. Repeated cross sections from the Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego (PME), a labor market survey from Brazil, are used to test this hypothesis. I find evidence to support the Fetal Origins Hypothesis. In particular, compared to individuals born in the few years surrounding the Influenza Pandemic, those who were in utero during the pandemic are less likely to be college educated, be employed, have formal employment, or know how to read and have fewer years of schooling and a lower hourly wage. These results underscore the importance of fetal health especially in developing countries.

We investigate the question of whether surplus maximization can be useful beyond the quasilinear case. We use two different surplus concepts, the equivalent and the compensating surplus. The first one is a utilitarian social welfare function and the second one a measure of inefficiency. We show that social welfare maximization can be at odds with constrained efficiency. In particular, a unique Dreze equilibrium can maximize welfare although it is not minimally constrained efficient. The Dreze equilibrium can also minimize welfare although it entails no efficiency losses. We argue that the two surplus concepts should be used together and that they can help to distinguish between different Dreze equilibria on welfare and efficiency grounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

For example, a cutoff value at 20,000 per QALY is sometimes mentioned in various discussions, however it has no formal status at all. Yet, since 2005, all new innovative do have to go through a cost-effectiveness evaluation though, with the assessment being focused on the methodology rather than on the exact cost-per-QALY outcome. Objective: Our objective was to estimate the potential impacts on Dutch drug expenditures had a formal threshold been applied in recent years. Methods: We analyzed national Dutch prescription data for the period 2005-2007, with respect to the costs of specific newly introduced drugs with reported positive cost-effectiveness ratios. Various threshold values were investigated. Results: In particular, our analysis suggests that modest, though annually increasing, reductions in Dutch drug expenditures could have been achieved in the recent period 2005-2007 if a threshold for cost-effectiveness at, for example, 20,000 per QALY been applied in The Netherlands. At thresholds of 0 and 20,000 estimated reductions in drug expenditures reflect approximately 0.25% of total Dutch drug expenditures and for thresholds of 50,000 and 80,000 this is only 0.01%. Conclusions: Modest reductions in drug expenditures can be achieved if a formal threshold would be applied in The Netherlands. Potential reductions may be expected to increase in next years as expenditures for listed drugs increase further and new drugs become listed. Finally, we argue that for optimal and fair allocation of resources the in the health-care sector, application of a straightforward threshold is eminent and should not be postponed anymore.","[Boersma, Cornelis; Broere, Adriaan; Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Unit PharmacoEpidemiol & Pharmacoecon PE2, Dept Pharm, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Postma, MJ (通讯作者)，A Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.j.postma@rug.nl,,"Boersma, Cornelis/0000-0002-1190-2638; Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653",,,,,14,33,34,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2010,13.0,6,,,,,853,856,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00736.x,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,648BZ,21054659.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281666700021,0

The aims of this study were to assess the cost-effectiveness of the addition of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) compared with conventional management alone (CMM) in patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and to determine the cost-effectiveness of nonrechargeable versus rechargeable SCS implanted pulse generators (IPGs). Methods: A decision analytic model was used to synthesize data on CRPS patient outcomes and health-care costs over a 15-year time horizon from the perspective of the UK National Health Services. Data were sourced from two SCS randomized controlled trials. Results are expressed as an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in 2008 GBP. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness of SCS compared with CMM was 3562 pound per QALY, a finding that was robust across sensitivity analyses with an 87% probability that SCS is cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of 30,000 pound. When the longevity of an IPG is 4 years or less, a rechargeable (and initially more expensive) IPG is more cost-effective than a nonrechargeable IPG. Conclusions: In selected patients with CRPS, SCS is cost-effective as an adjunct to CMM. Despite their initial increased expense, rechargeable IPGs should be considered when IPG longevity is likely to be short. These findings support policymakers to extend the use of SCS as a good value for money treatment for CRPS.","[Taylor, Rod S.] Univ Exeter, Peninsula Med Sch, Peninsula Clin Trials Unit, Exeter EX2 5DW, Devon, England; [Taylor, Rod S.] Univ Plymouth, Peninsula Med Sch, Exeter EX2 5DW, Devon, England; [Kemler, Marius A.] Martini Hosp, Dept Plast Surg, Groningen, Netherlands; [Raphael, Jon H.] Birmingham City Univ, Fac Hlth, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Bentley, Anthony] Abacus Int, Bicester, Oxon, England",University of Exeter; University of Plymouth; University of Exeter; Martini Hospital; University of Groningen; Birmingham City University,"Taylor, RS (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Peninsula Med Sch, Peninsula Clin Trials Unit, Noy Scott House,3rd Floor,Barrack Rd, Exeter EX2 5DW, Devon, England.",rod.taylor@pms.ac.uk,"Taylor, Rod/R-9581-2019","Taylor, Rod/0000-0002-3043-6011; Kemler, Marius/0000-0003-0306-1565","Medtronic, Inc.","Medtronic, Inc.(Medtronic)","This study was sponsored by Medtronic, Inc.

For example, the field evaluation program in Ontario is modestly funded at about $250,000 per field study for core support for PATH and an additional $250,000 per evaluation for the field work itself ( e. g., research nurses, primary data collection). Although $500,000 per evaluation is a very reasonable cost for conducting primary data collection studies, the overall cost of such a program can become large if there are a number of CFFEs undertaken each year. However, given the political will, there are a number of potential funding sources. For example, although it is well recognized that it is difficult to remove ineffective or obsolete technologies from a health-care system, there is potentially a large source of funds that can be generated through the adoption of an evidence-based process that includes removal of these technologies. Another potential source of funding for field evaluations is from the cost-savings generated by controlled diffusion of a new technology. As demonstrated for DESs, this strategy generated millions of dollars of cost avoidance that could prudently be re-invested back in the CFFE evidence-generating process rather than simply being absorbed by the health-care system. Another potential source of funding is from reduced out-of-province procedures. For example, instead of paying for procedures that are conducted in the United States because they are determined to be medically necessary but not available in Ontario, these procedures could be made available in Ontario as part of a CFFE. Finally, financing through cost-sharing in the form of unrestricted grants, or provision of the technology or the supplies associated with the use of technology, on an experimental basis by technology manufacturers could be encouraged. As part of the PATH's CFFE process, industry stakeholders are consulted for advice around possible study designs and use of the technology during the evaluation ( e. g., training and level of experience). Possible financial or in kind support from industry stakeholders is facilitated if they are consulted early, and throughout, the CFFE process.; Funding and support for the PATH Research Institute is provided by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) and the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC).

Instrumental variable (IV) models used measures of social support as instruments for MI. Unadjusted work rates were higher for immigrants (vs US-born adults). Regressions show that MI is associated with lower rates of work among US-born males but not immigrant males and females; M/D is associated lower rates of work among US-born males and females, and among immigrant males.

Methods: Data were obtained from four waves of the HIV/AIDS Hospital Survey from the period 2001 to 2004. The sample was composed of 3376 individuals between 16 and 64 years. Assessment of employment participation was performed using a probit model on a wide ranee of socioeconomic and lifestyle-related variables. Results: The main variables explaining the probability of participation in the labour market were age, ecnder, education level, CD4 cell count, health status, time since HIV diagnosis, psychological impact of contracting the disease or its proeression, the most likely means of transmission and intravenous drug use (IDU). The significance of each of these variables differs for men and women as well as for injecting drug users (IDUs) and non-IDUs. Conclusions: The employment status of HIV-positive individuals is directly related to their health status and other personal characteristics. Policies to improve the well-being of HIV-positive individuals should not be limited to any one sector as their needs require strategies with a multidisciplinary approach.

No studies, however, have directly examined discrimination in health-care financing strategies in the case of severe illness of Sons versus daughters. In this paper, we hypothesize that households Who face tight budget constraints are more likely to spend their meager resources on hospitalization or boys rather than girls. We use the 60th round of the Indian National Sample Survey (2004) and a multinomial logit model to test this hypothesis and to throw, some light on this important but overlooked issue. The results reveal that boys are much more likely to be hospitalized than girls. When it comes to financing, the gap in the usage of household income and savings is relatively small, while the gender gap in the probability of hospitalization and usage of more onerous financing strategies is very high. Ceteris paribus, the probability of boys to be hospitalized by financing from borrowing,, sale of assets, help from friends, etc. is much higher than that of girls. Moreover, in line with our theoretical framework, the results indicate that the gender gap intensifies as we move from the richest to poorest households.

In this paper, we consider the estimation of a generalized quantile regression model when data are Subject to fixed or random censoring. Through a discretization technique, we transform the censored regression model into a sequence of binary choice models and further propose an integrated smoothed maximum score estimator by combining individual binary choice models, following the insights of Horowitz (1992) and Manski (1985). Unlike the estimators of Horowitz (1992) and Manski (1985), our estimators converge at the usual parametric rate through an integration process. In the case of fixed censoring, our approach overcomes a major drawback of existing approaches associated with the curse-of-dimensionality problem. Our approach for the fixed censored case can tie extended readily to the case with random censoring for which other existing approaches are no longer applicable. Both of our estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. A simulation study demonstrates that our estimators perform well in finite samples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The model is rewritten as a particular hidden model: Z(i) = X-i + epsilon(i), Xi+1 = b(X-i) + sigma(X-i)xi(i+1), where (xi(i)) and (epsilon(i)) are independent sequences of i.i.d. noise. Moreover, the sequences (X-i) and (epsilon(i)) are independent and the distribution of epsilon is known. Then, our aim is to estimate the functions b and sigma(2) when only observations Z(1), ...., Z(n) are available. We propose to estimate bf and (b(2) + sigma(2))f and study the integrated mean square error of projection estimators of these functions on automatically selected projection spaces. By ratio strategy, estimators of b and sigma(2) are then deduced. The mean square risk of the resulting estimators are studied and their rates are discussed. Lastly, simulation experiments are provided: constants in the penalty functions defining the estimators are calibrated and the quality of the estimators is checked on several examples.

In the cure scenario, the patient does not know whether a loss can be recovered. In the prevention scenario, the patient faces a threat but does not know whether this threat is real enough to justify preventive action. The patient wants to induce the physician both to give an accurate diagnosis and to put appropriate effort into cure or prevention. It is shown that in the cure scenario, a contingent fee solves both these incentive problems. In the prevention scenario, however, putting up with low effort makes it easier to get an accurate diagnosis, and the use of contingent fees should be limited. These results are interpreted as providing a rationale for observed exceptions to legal and ethical restrictions on the use of contingent fees. Indeed, such exceptions are often granted for cases that fit the cure scenario. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This triggered the development of residential and recreational use in alpine and rural areas, creating a new form of cultural landscape and towns. New towns and villages were built from scratch for the sole purpose of recreation. Reichenau an der Rax stands for several small villages in this area which were developed into health and summer (Sommerfrische) resorts during the late nineteenth century. Austrian architects and entrepreneurs designed leafy, generously laid out towns in Semmering area. The designs aimed to attract wealthy city people and nobility and were hardly based on sustainable criteria but often provided usable open space patterns. The two World Wars stopped the further development of these summer resorts. Post-war town planning dismissed the luxurious plans and turned to more affordable concepts focusing on providing housing for the local community or on building modern recreational infrastructure. They often relied on the high quality of the historic open space structures but at the same time destroyed them in parts. Post-war and current town planning had and still has to deal with issues resulting from the unsustainable approach in the nineteenth century. This paper will focus on the question if and how planning authorities mastered and are mastering the balancing act between preserving the historic areas of the summer resorts and developing it sustainably based on modern criteria. The importance of land use and town planning instruments in terms of the preservation of historic towns and villages will be analysed and lessons learned from these examples will be presented.","[Fuchs, B.] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci Vienna, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Inst Landscape Planning, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,2,18,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,507,514,,,,,,8,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291664400057,0

This paper aims to recognize this distinguished experience to maintain sustainability between the Omani heritage & contemporary vernacular architecture. A summary concerning the origins of Omani architecture will be presented. Then the identity as one of he important features of Omani society, culture, and architecture will be clarified. The preservation of Omani heritage as a reference will be demonstrated, followed by an example of a contemporary vernacular architectural project. The results and analysis of a questionnaire concerning the Omanis' level of satisfaction of contemporary architecture will be discussed. The research methodology depends on collecting data through references, field studies, a questionnaire and interviews.

Who we listen to and how we listen are important to what narratives are highlighted through research. This study involves local residents as well as international tourists and people in the marine tourism industry and marine sciences in the Azores, Portugal in comparison with Newfoundland, Canada. The researchers dance between stepping out of the way in order to make room for voices and perspectives often ignored or silenced in educational and tourism stories of whales and the ocean, and stepping in to help uncover otherwise hidden forces of imperialism, and other oppressions. This study about perceptions of the ocean explores whose expression of heritage provides the driving force for commerce, business, leisure and politics. It also looks at the dynamic nature of heritage as it responds to changes in work, play and politics. Using various interview techniques including photo elicitation and focus groups, we gather rich narratives of visiting, living near and working in the sea. Multiple frames of lived experiences, ethics and politics support the narratives told. Some frames support the perceptions of diverse groups of people, while others privilege the stories of only a few. This study explores local power dynamics and global forces by asking about the ways in which people have learned about the ocean as well as how people decide what is relevant to their learning and what is important to sustain.","[Neilson, A.

The weed infestation was evaluated once, in the spring barley crop, before the herbicidal application, evaluated using counting method. From the results it's clear the multiyear crop monoculture has the highest weed infestation together with most diverse weeds varieties. Mostly the varieties harming the spring cereals were present (Avena fatua, Galium aparine and Viola arvensis). The spring barley crop (7 crop pattern trial) was infested mostly with perennial weeds Artemisia vulgaris, Arctium tomentosum, Cirsium arvense, Malva neglecta, Plantago major and the annual Veronica polita. At the spring barley crop, from the five crop pattern trial, there were mostly present late spring weed varieties (Chenopodium album a Amaranthus sp. K, Galium aparine and Fallopia convolvulus). The crop rotation is significantly influencing the weed infestation intensity and its variety diversity. With the higher concentration of cereal crops is growing the share of varieties such as Galium aparine.","[Neischl, A.; Zelena, V] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Plant Biol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Winkler, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrosys & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Neischl, A (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Plant Biol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",alexandr.neischl@syngenta.com,"Winkler, Jan/J-3521-2018","Winkler, Jan/0000-0002-5700-2176","Internal Grant Agency, AF MENDELU [TP 11/2010]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM6215648905]","Internal Grant Agency, AF MENDELU; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","The results in paper are output of project of Internal Grant Agency, AF MENDELU, No. TP 11/2010 Modification of crop management practices in areas threatened by drought.

In short it must recognise the intergenerational legacy of the built environment. A continuum of options is reviewed. The aim of this is to establish some broad principles as to how we both value and mould the tangible and intangible aspects of heritage into a sense of place that (to paraphrase Brundtland (1987) meets the opinions and aspirations of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to adapt it to meet their own aspirations and priorities.","[Russell, H.

The index is designed to reflect the perspective of cancer patients in a specific clinical context so as to best inform clinical decisions. Methods: We applied the UBQ-C scoring algorithm to trials of chemotherapy for advanced (n = 325) and early (n = 126) breast cancer. The algorithm converts UBQ-C subscales into a subset index, and combines it with a global health status item into an overall HRQL index, which is then converted to a utility index using a power transformation. The optimal subscale weights were determined by their correlations with the global scale in the relevant data set. The validity of the utility index was tested against other patient characteristics. Results: Optimal weights (range 0-1) for the subset index in advanced (early) breast cancer were: physical function 0.20 (0.09); social/usual activities 0.23 (0.25); self-care 0.04 (0.01); and distresses 0.53 (0.64). Weights for the overall HRQL index were health status 0.66 (0.63) and subset index 0.34 (0.37). The utility index discriminated between breast cancer that was advanced rather than early (means 0.88 vs. 0.94, P < 0.0001) and was responsive to the toxic effects of chemotherapy in early breast cancer (mean change 0.07, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The scoring algorithm for the UBQ-C utility index can be optimized in different clinical contexts to reflect the relative importance of different aspects of quality of life to the patients in a trial. It can be used to generate sensitive and responsive utility scores, and quality-adjusted life-years that can be used within a trial to compare the net benefit of treatments and inform clinical decision-making.","[Grimison, Peter S.; Simes, R.

To examine whether immigrants affected employers' decisions to offer health benefits the study estimates immigration effects on natives' probability of being offered, eligible for, and a policy-holder of health insurance. Although in many cases the effects are statistically significant, most effects are very small. The increase in immigrant labor supply from 1995 to 2005 increases natives' uninsurance rates by about 0.7 percentage points and reduces the natives' probability of being offered and a holder of coverage by 0.8 and 1.9 percentage points, respectively. Immigrants' weaker preferences for coverage relative to natives' may be the key factor in this result. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Answering the question of which age groups are appropriate to target for catch-up vaccination with the newly licensed quadrivalent HPV vaccine (types 6/11/16/18) will be important for developing vaccine policy recommendations. Objectives: To assess the value of varying female HPV vaccination strategies by specific age groups of a catch-up program in the United States. Methods: The authors used previously published mathematical population dynamic model and cost-utility analysis to evaluate the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of alternative quadrivalent HPV (6/11/16/18) vaccination strategies. The model simulates heterosexual transmission of HPV infection and occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical cancer, and external genital warts in an age-structured population stratified by sex and sexual activity groups. The cost-utility analysis estimates the cost of vaccination, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of HPV diseases, and quality-adjusted survival. Results: Compared with the current screening practices, vaccinating girls and women ages 12 to 24 years was the most effective strategy, reducing the number of HPV6/11/16/18-related genital warts, CIN grades 2 and 3, and cervical cancer cases among women in the next 25 years by 3,049,285, 1,399,935, and 30,021; respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this strategy when compared with vaccinating girls and women ages 12 to 19 years was $10,986 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Conclusion: Relative to other commonly accepted health-care programs, vaccinating girls and women ages 12 to 24 years appears cost-effective.","[Elbasha, Elamin H.; Dasbach, Erik J.; Insinga, Ralph P.; Haupt, Richard M.; Barr, Eliav] Merck & Co Inc, Merck Res Labs, N Wales, PA 19454 USA",Merck & Company,"Elbasha, EH (通讯作者)，Merck & Co Inc, Merck Res Labs, UG1C-60,POB 1000, N Wales, PA 19454 USA.",elamin_elbasha@merck.com,"Dasbach, Erik/AAP-6801-2021",,"Merck Co., Inc.","Merck Co., Inc.(Merck & Company)","Source of financial support: This study was supported by Merck & Co., Inc.",,65,23,24,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,697,707,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00512.x,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19490561.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267130200010,0

We investigate the basic structure of equilibria in such models: the existence of equilibria and the global structure of the set of equilibria. Specifically, we focus on models with a conservation law, which typically holds in economies having some assets, such as money. In such models, under certain regularity conditions the set of equilibria is one-dimensional and each connected component of it is a piecewise smooth one-dimensional manifold being homeomorphic to either the unit circle or the unit interval. Moreover, in an endpoint of an interval all agents have the same amount of assets. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We extend the usual Bartlett-kernel heteroskedasticity, and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimator to deal with long memory and anti persistence. We then derive asymptotic expansions for this estimator and the memory and autocorrelation consistent (MAC) estimator introduced by Robinson [Robinson, P. M., 2005. Robust covariance matrix estimation: HAC estimates with long memory/antipersistence correction. Econometric Theory 21, 171-180]. We offer a theoretical explanation for the sensitivity of HAC to the bandwidth choice, a feature which has been observed in the special case of short memory. Using these analytical results, we determine the MSE-optimal bandwidth rates for each estimator. We analyze by simulations the finite-sample performance of HAC and MAC estimators, and the coverage probabilities for the studentized sample mean, giving practical recommendations for the choice of bandwidths.

Moreover, we analyze whether manufacturers adapt prices of their products that are not subject to reference pricing as a consequence of changes in reference prices of their products that are subject to reference pricing. We use econometric panel data methods based oil a large panel data set of nearly all German prescription drugs on a monthly basis between October 1994 and July 2005. They provide information on ex-factory prices, reference prices, manufacturers, type of prescription drug, and market entries and exits. Our results show that there is no full price adjustment: A 1%-change in reference prices leads to a 0.3%-change in market prices. Price adjustment, however, is fast - it mostly happens in the first month. Furthermore, the first introduction of a reference price reduces market prices of the affected products by approximately 7%.

In this paper we investigate the relative accuracy of mature smokers' risk perceptions about future survival, and a range of morbidities and disabilities. Using data from the survey on smoking (SOS) conducted for this research. we compare subjective beliefs elicited from the SOS with corresponding individual-specific objective probabilities estimated from the health and retirement study. Overall, consumers in the age group studied, 50-70, are not overly optimistic in their perceptions of health risk. If anything, smokers tend to be relatively pessimistic about these risks. The finding that smokers are either well informed or pessimistic regarding a broad range of health risks suggests that these beliefs are not pivotal in the decision to continue smoking. Although statements by the tobacco companies may have been misleading and thus encouraged some to start smoking, we find no evidence that systematic misinformation about the health consequences of smoking inhibits quitting.

In Bertrand oligopoly, we identify price harmonics as a function of firm unit costs and locations. The sum of oligopoly profits is larger when costs and/or locations are more dispersed in the 'dihedral majorization' sense. This also tends to be the case in which prices are more variable. We study how phase shifts between cost parameters and inter-firm distance parameters change production and oligopoly profits. An exact characterization of production patterns is developed in terms of the eigenvalues for what we call the price harmonics matrix. The same techniques are applied to Cournot oligopoly with spatial externalities on circular city. Solutions are compared with first-best. Production patterns can differ markedly when cost spillovers are negative. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Chopped just after hewing, osier willow chops are sufficiently moist 40 to 55%. In order to store chop safely in mound, it is purposeful to reduce its moisture content to 18 - 20%. For drying off wood chops in mound using active ventilation at the lowest possible costs, one must determine the relationship between air pressure losses and comparative intensity of ventilation in aired chop mound. Objectives of the research are to determine physical-mechanical properties of osier willow chop, having influence on drying process and fuel production; to examine characteristic of chop bulk's aerodynamic resistance at variable moisture content of osier willow. Experimental research was carried out on two years grown osier willow. The wood was chopped with disc shredder AL-KO NEW TEC 2400 R or with the drum shredder AL-KO SILENT POWER 4000. Physical-mechanical properties of osier willow chop moisture content, its density were determined and fractions were assessed. It was determined that moisture content has not significant influence on aerodynamic resistance of osier willow chop layer in a mound. Uneven distribution of air flow in an osier willow chops mound forms the barrier to air supply in a ventilated bulk. Aerodynamic resistance in a porous layer is caused by fluttering phenomenon under air pressure in a layer and by constant or increasing velocity of air filtration.","[Ciganas, Nerijus; Raila, Algirdas; Zvicevicius, Egidijus; Novosinskas, Henrikas] Lithuanian Univ Agr, Fac Agr Engn, Dept Heat & Biotechnol Engn, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,nciganas@yahoo.com; algirdas.raila@lzuu.lt; egidijus.zvicevicius@lzuu.lt; henrikas.novosinskas@lzuu.lt,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,294,300,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Engineering, Environmental; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Engineering; Public Administration,BNL17,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845700052,0

Few studies have examined individual-level intra urban exposure contrasts effects on birth outcomes. We evaluated the impacts of NO2 exposure on low birth weight risk in Kaunas cohort study using modelled air quality data and logistic regression. The relationship between LBW and modelled ambient levels of NO2. using Airviro, a dispersion model developed by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, was evaluated in Kaunas city. We used the ambient air monitoring data from the Kaunas Air Pollution monitoring stations for the Gaussian model validation. The Cohort Database consisted of live singleton births. Maternal exposures to NO2 pollution were assigned to women living in Kaunas city at the time of birth using geographic information systems (GIS). NO2 exposure effect was evaluated as a categorical variable and relative risks were estimated from logistic regression, adjusted for confounding variables. The model predicted NO, concentrations were by 4.15-3.12% higher than those monitored. After adjustment for gestation age, smoking, family status, education and body mass index, moderate NO2 exposure was associated with a 1.6 times increase in LBW risk (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.79-3.18) and odds ratios (OR) were nearly twice as high in the highest exposure stratum (OR 2.35; 95% Cl 0.96-5.75) as the lowest exposure stratum. Findings from our study suggest a general association between NO2 concentrations predicted from Airviro model and those monitored by stationary stations. Little association between modelled traffic-related NO2 pollution and LBW was observed in a population-based cohort with relatively low ambient air pollution exposure.","[Grazuleviciene, Regina; Dedele, Audrius] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Environm Studies, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,a.dedele@gmf.vdu.lt; r.grazuleviciene@gmf.vdu.lt,"Grazuleviciene, Regina/AAR-4539-2021","Grazuleviciene, Regina/0000-0002-0210-8053",,,,,24,0,0,0,7,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,229,234,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Engineering, Environmental; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Engineering; Public Administration,BNL17,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845700041,0

The same holds for the actual inclusion in HSV of the effects of ill health on leisure. This study aims to test whether respondents to HSV using time trade-off (TTO) questions include income and leisure effects without instructions. Moreover, it tests the consequences of explicit instructions to include or exclude income effects. Three questionnaires were administered among the general public. Respondents were asked to value three distinct EuroQol descriptive system health states using TTO. In version 1, respondents were asked afterwards whether they included income effects. In versions 2 and 3, respondents were instructed upfront to include or exclude income effects. They were furthermore asked whether they included leisure effects. A total of 222 respondents completed the questionnaire. In version 1, 64% of the respondents spontaneously included income effects, not resulting in differences in mean valuations. In versions 2 and 3, 88% included leisure time, resulting in a significantly lower TTO value in one health state. With explicit instructions, respondents instructed to include income gave lower HSV for the worst health state presented. Respondents in our sample did not consistently include income effects and leisure effects. Including income effects only had (some) effect on TTO valuations after an explicit instruction. If these results are confirmed in future research, this implies that income effects may be best captured on the cost-side of the CE ratio. Spontaneous inclusion or exclusion of leisure time appeared to be more influential.","[Krol, Marieke; Brouwer, Werner] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus MC, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Krol, Marieke; Brouwer, Werner] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus MC, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Sendi, Pedram] Univ Basel Hosp, Div Hlth Econ, Inst Clin Epidemiol, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; University of Basel,"Krol, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus MC, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",h.krol@erasmusmc.nl,"Brouwer, Werner/HSB-9241-2023; Krol, Marieke/HGA-7950-2022; Sendi, Pedram/AAC-2067-2019","Brouwer, Werner/0000-0002-0476-8397; Krol, Marieke/0000-0002-6153-0828",,,,,23,15,15,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,172,180,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00406.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,18647262.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000262696800026,0
