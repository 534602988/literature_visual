Drawing from three case studies on black and minority ethnic (BME) workers and trade unions in the UK the article looks at how the rhetoric of community unionism has been adopted in an uneven manner by trade unions: the article suggests that: (a) community initiatives are variable, (b) they lack a structure and clear vision, (c) the question of BME engagement is rarely central in many projects, and (d) the ambivalent role of the state is a significant factor in many of these initiatives. This state role is downplayed in much of the literature, thus raising dilemmas in terms of community initiatives.","[Lucio, Miguel Martinez] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Perrett, Robert] Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Bradford BD9 4JL, W Yorkshire, England",University of Manchester; University of Bradford,"Lucio, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Booth St W, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",Miguel.Martinezlucio@manchester.ac.uk; r.perrett@bradford.ac.uk,,"Martinez Lucio, Miguel/0000-0001-7090-9007",,,,,49,40,40,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Examining aggregate monthly data for US domestic air travel, we have identified causal relationships among fare, complaints, and levels of delay. An analytical framework is proposed that formalizes these relationships in an integrated manner. This integrated framework is then estimated in a set of simultaneous equations by using 118 months of data from January 1997 to October 2006. Results show that complaints are influenced by levels of delays. However, complaints are positively influenced by average yield. These findings lead us to support the central hypothesis that complaints are responsive to levels of delays, but they tend to vary according to fare. That is, air travelers are less likely to complain in return for lower fares, even when faced with the same or even higher levels of delays. These findings have important policy implications, including the passengers' bill of rights and regulator's choice between market and operational performances.

Both secondary and primary data were used. At macro level there are clear evidences of an increase in trade between Ethiopia on the one hand and China and India on the other, though the trade balance disfavours Ethiopia. China has displaced other countries as export destinations for Ethiopia. Similarly, the presence of China and India is also felt in the areas of investment and aid. At local level, Chinese imports of footwear have forced local enterprises to downsize their activity and lose assets and money. At the same time, however, firms have followed both the high road of competition (design and quality improvement, investment in machinery, product specialisation) and the low road of competition (lowering price and profit, reducing raw materials and inputs, and joining the informal sector) to withstand the impact of Chinese imports. The long-term effect of Chinese imports is to crowd out local efforts of using the sector as the basis for industrialisation. Government, non-government organisations and local producers should work together in order to withstand the negative impacts of footwear imports by raising the competitiveness of the local producers.","Univ Addis Ababa, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Gebre-Egziabher, T (通讯作者)，Univ Addis Ababa, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",,"Gebre-Egziabher, Tegegne/HLW-5265-2023",,,,,,11,11,11,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2009,32.0,11,,,,,1613.0,1637,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01252.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,528KV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272445000006,0

We find that, under a symmetric externality assumption, our static model admits a potential function, which allows us to identify a stationary state that is uniquely absorbing and globally accessible under the perfect foresight dynamics whenever the degree of friction in relocation decisions is sufficiently small. In particular, when trade barriers are low enough, full agglomeration in the country with the highest barrier is the unique stable state for small frictions.

The sharp increase in volatility of REITs prices over the past few years has spurred a relatively new concern amongst academics, managers and investors about the consequences of, and causes of, property risk premium on discount to NAV. The two interrelated questions arising from the recent increase in volatility of REITs prices are: Is the increased volatility responsible for the observed widening in discount to NAV? What does the observed private and public risk premium tell us about discount to NAV? We attempt to address these questions by analysing risk premiums in private and public real estate markets. The analysis is conducted in the most recent years of high stock price volatility. Our analysis reveals two major results: a tendency for discount to NAV to revert to the long term mean value of 20% and, more significantly, a lower risk premium in equivalent yields in private market than in public market. These results suggest that investors in public market have a different conception of property risk and complexity of lease options than what is conveyed by private property valuation.","[Patel, Kanak; Pereira, Ricardo A.

It is shown that regional competition yields ail overprovision of public inputs if trade costs are sizable while it leads to underprovision if regions are highly integrated. Moreover, public input competition assures a dispersion of industry as long as trade costs are high but induces agglomeration even for ex ante identical regions if trade costs have fallen below a certain value. Finally, a trade-off between regional convergence and efficiency arises since the efficient distribution of regional infrastructure requires full agglomeration for sufficiently low trade costs.

Specifically, we begin with a fluid dynamics model composed of differential equations describing the dynamics of fluid flow as a function of fluid pressure, formation characteristics, water injection, new wells, and how these parameters change as oil extraction occurs. We then link this physical description of the field to an intertemporal optimizing economic model. The cost and revenue functions are based on data from a number of sources. We use tensor splines to approximate the value function. The optimal solution depends on exogenous variables, such as the discount rate or the timing of breakthroughs in the cost of alternative energy sources, which are uncertain.

The article draws on a framework of medicalization, arguing that the individualization of the social issue of unemployment into a personal trouble of disability is a neglected yet important phenomenon that has interesting implications for theory and policy. By classifying some people as disabled in order to explain their unemployment, medicalization can be seen as an important yet so far neglected mechanism in understanding how this individualizing enterprise comes about. It is concluded that by medicalizing unemployment, the target for society's intervention to fight the spectre of unemployment is primarily individuals' personal troubles rather than any social issues.","Stockholm Univ, Sch Business, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Holmqvist, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Sch Business, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",mih@fek.su.se,,,,,,,48,39,43,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Gradual trade liberalisation causes gradual agglomeration rather than the catastrophic agglomeration that economic geography models have long suggested. Also, trade liberalisation produces divergent welfare effects with the periphery losing and the core gaining; even costless trade fails to equalise welfare in the core and periphery due to non-exported intermediate inputs.

To this end, we estimate a partial equilibrium job search model on panel data from eight European countries. There are five non-wage job characteristics and two sources of job-to-job mobility: on-the-job search and reallocation shocks. We also allow for two types of unobserved heterogeneity. We find strong preferences for amenities, especially job security, yet, these preferences do not translate into significant wage differentials in cross-section. Counterfactual experiments show that one would need extremely low levels of search frictions for compensating differentials to arise. Lastly, a similar exercise on the distribution of job change outcomes reveals the role of constrained job-to-job mobility in the absence of compensating wage differentials.

We show how these two general properties, combined with natural monotonicity considerations, lead to characterization results that single out several versions of Euclidean distance from the wide class of separable distance functions. We then discuss and motivate our results in two different and apparently unrelated application areas-mobility measurement and spatial voting theory-and propose our characterization as a test for deciding whether Euclidean distance (or some suitable variant) should be used in your favourite application context.","[Dardanoni, Valentino] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali & Finanziarie, Palermo, Italy; [D'Agostino, Marcello] Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Sci Umane, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy",University of Palermo; University of Ferrara,"Dardanoni, V (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali & Finanziarie, Palermo, Italy.",dgm@unife.it; vdardano@unipa.it,"D'Agostino, Marcello/T-8565-2019","D'Agostino, Marcello/0000-0002-3832-4487",,,,,27,38,38,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,AUG,2009,33.0,2,,,,,211.0,233,,10.1007/s00355-008-0353-5,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,459NV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267110800002,0

In this paper we focus on imaging rules that can be described by the following procedure: (1) Identify every state with some real valued vector of characteristics, and accordingly identify every probabilistic belief with an expected vector of characteristics; (2) For every initial belief and every piece of information, choose the revised belief which is compatible with this information and for which the expected vector of characteristics has minimal Euclidean distance to the expected vector of characteristics of the initial belief. This class of rules thus satisfies an intuitive notion of minimal belief revision.

In contrast to existing studies, which typically use the least squares estimation technique, quantile regressions were carried out to analyse the data. This method allows one to examine the effects of innovation at any desired point on the distribution function for example, in firms experiencing positive or negative growth - providing a more complete picture of the relationship between innovation and employment growth than the standard method of viewing deviations in the average effect. The key finding of the study is that innovation has a positive effect on employment in both growing and shrinking small and medium enterprises. In addition, innovation has a much stronger impact on employee headcounts in companies that are already experiencing strong growth than in their slower growing or shrinking Counterparts. When differentiating between product and process innovations, the analysis shows that the introduction of new or improved processes has a larger impact oil employment than product innovations. Thus, positive employment effects of innovations are not restricted to narrow segments of the economy. Economic policy aimed at bolstering the innovative strength of firms is thus a strong encouragement to employment oil a broad basis.","KfW Bankengrp, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany",,"Zimmermann, V (通讯作者)，KfW Bankengrp, Palmengartenstr 5-9, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",volker.zimmermann@kfw.de,,,,,,,27,18,19,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Trade rules and dispute settlement mechanisms were altered and a series of specific agreements provided for liberalisation across economic sectors. The Agreement on Agriculture, arguably the most difficult and contentious to negotiate, permitted the continued use of trade-distorting instruments, both domestically and at the border. Rule-enforcement in agriculture therefore relies crucially on the clarity of the rules. This paper provides an in-depth study of a unique and critical case for understanding the new rules: the EC sugar regime. This policy was challenged unsuccessfully under the pre-Uruguay Round rules, but successfully under the new rules. This case is particularly valuable in allowing us to isolate the effect of the Uruguay Round on agricultural trade disputes: the policy under challenge was essentially unchanged and the legal actions addressed the same concern - excessive export subsidisation. Drawing on primary and secondary materials and interviews with key policy actors, sugar is used to illustrate how those involved in the multilateral process learned from particular rule weaknesses revealed in earlier cases, revising those rules in the Uruguay Round in such a way that dispute panels can more readily and objectively determine rule breaches.","[Ackrill, Robert] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham, England; [Kay, Adrian] Griffith Univ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Nottingham Trent University; Griffith University,"Ackrill, R (通讯作者)，Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham, England.",,"Ackrill, Robert/J-3874-2019","Ackrill, Robert/0000-0002-0739-1812; Kay, Adrian/0000-0002-5854-4516",,,,,50,12,12,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2009,32.0,5,,,,,754.0,771,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2008.01148.x,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,440QD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265713900004,0

Macmillan, London Translation of 1898 edition, 1936), is widely used in current central bank research. The idea is that there exists a level at which the real interest rate would be compatible with output at its potential level and stationary inflation. Such a concept is of primary concern for monetary policy because it provides a benchmark for the monetary policy stance. This paper applies the method suggested by Laubach and Williams (Rev Econ Stat 85(4):1063-1070, 2003) to jointly estimate the natural real interest rate and the output gap in the euro area using data from 1960 onwards. Our results suggest that the natural real rate of interest has declined gradually over the past 40 years. They also indicate that monetary policy in the euro area was on average stimulative during the 1960s and the 1970s, while it contributed to dampen the output gap and inflation in the 1980s and 1990s.","[Garnier, Julien] DGTPE, Minist Econ & Finance & Employment, Teledoc 654, F-75572 Paris 12, France; [Wilhelmsen, Bjorn-Roger] First Secur, N-0115 Oslo, Norway",,"Garnier, J (通讯作者)，DGTPE, Minist Econ & Finance & Employment, Teledoc 654, 139 Rue Bercy, F-75572 Paris 12, France.",julien.garnier@dgtpe.fr; bjorn-roger.wilhelmsen@first.no,,,,,,,15,23,24,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We assume that consumers' choice is tempered by a logit function, which characterizes consumers' heterogeneity. As in the one-dimensional case, stores aggregate spatially when consumers' heterogeneity is strong enough. When it decreases, we show that stores differentiate in only one dimension. The analytical solution allows us to give a precise interpretation of this effect through the comparison of consumers' elasticity under differentiation along one or two characteristics.

This paper undertakes a quantitative review of the empirical literature on agglomeration through a meta-analysis of 729 elasticities taken from 34 different studies. The objective is to make sense of the range of values for agglomeration economies found in the literature by identifying some key characteristics that affect the magnitude of the results obtained. Our analysis confirms that study characteristics do matter. In particular, we find that country specific effects, the industrial coverage, the specification of agglomeration economies, and the presence of controls for both unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity and differences in time-variant labor quality can give rise to large differences in the results reported in the literature. in contrast. correcting for reverse causality of agglomeration does not seem to produce noticeable changes in the size of urban agglomeration estimates. We also test for publication bias and find some evidence supporting the presence of positive reporting bias. The findings support the intuition that agglomeration estimates for any particular empirical context may have little relevance elsewhere. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Such value creation likely emanates from liquidity enhancements, regulatory arbitrage, price discrimination and risk diversification by pooling and tranching, gains from specialization in origination, servicing, and holding of mortgages, and the like. Indeed, such value creation would be consistent with past accelerated growth in the mortgage- and asset-based securities markets and the sizable profits earned by secondary market intermediaries. In this paper, we estimate the pricing effects of commercial mortgage securitization. We do so by applying loan level data from 1992 2003 to compare the pricing of conduit and portfolio loans held in CMBS structures. In contrast to portfolio loans, which are held for investment by originating institutions, conduit loans are originated for the sole purpose of sale and securitization in the secondary market. If securitization creates value, it should be evidenced in the relative pricing of conduit loans sold into CMBS pools and in a lower cost of capital to loan originators. We estimate a reduced-form model, in which the interest rate spread between commercial mortgages and comparable-maturity treasury securities varies with loan characteristics, capital market conditions, and conduit loan status. Estimation results indicate that securitization of conduit loans leads to an I I basis points reduction in commercial mortgage interest rates. We assess robustness of results via hazard model tests for omitted variables and originator-specific effects. We further estimate a simultaneous equations model that accounts for tire potential endogencity of mortgage loan terms to the mortgage-treasury rate spread. Results of that analysis suggest a larger 20 basis points reduction in loan pricing among conduit loans sold into CMBS structures.","[An, Xudong] San Diego State Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business Adm, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Deng, Yongheng] Univ So Calif, Lusk Ctr Real Estate, Sch Policy Planning & Dev, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Gabriel, Stuart A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Richard S Ziman Ctr Real Estate, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Southern California; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"An, XD (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business Adm, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",xan@mail.sdsu.edu; ydeng@usc.edu; stuart.gabriel@anderson.ucla.edu,"Deng, Yongheng/A-4272-2010","Deng, Yongheng/0000-0002-4438-5171",,,,,19,13,18,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Our objective is to establish whether alternative regulatory regimes, which may involve road tolls, may lead to a traffic allocation, user welfare, and total welfare that may be closer to the social optimum. An empirical application to interurban Spanish travel is undertaken. We find that the private regime yields the lowest total welfare level: 12.6% below the social optimum level. Optimum pricing requires a toll on car transport of 5.1 cents of per passenger-km, and a price decrease of all other modes, relative to the current regime. Finally, the social optimum without toll regime attains the welfare level closest to the social optimum, though it implies a reallocation of welfare from firms to users and higher environmental costs.

The article conceptualizes migration as a 'vital conjuncture', a critical life period in which both different futures and different identities are at stake, and shows how some women - mostly with skills from the natural sciences - were able to retain former professional identities. Other women, facing the threat of becoming 'just housewives', found work in the higher-skilled sectors of the labour market in different ways: through rei educating themselves; by becoming 'cultural brokers' for other immigrants; or by returning to their home country. Women unable to follow through on one of these four options lost claims to being high-skilled. The analysis contributes to our understanding of both high-skilled female migration and the centrality of identity in constraining or enabling movement within social structures.","SFI Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, DK-1052 Copenhagen K, Denmark",,"Liversage, A (通讯作者)，SFI Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, Herluf Trolles Gade 11, DK-1052 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",ani@sfi.dk,,,,,,,77,112,127,1,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This model distinguishes whether the long-run or short-run components are heteroscedastic. Furthermore, the uncertainty associated with these components may increase with the level of inflation as postulated by Friedman. We propose to use the differences between the autocorrelations of squares and the squared autocorrelations of the auxiliary residuals to identify heteroscedastic components. We show that conditional heteroscedasticity truly present in the data can be rejected when looking at the correlations of standardized residuals while the autocorrelations of auxiliary residuals have more power to detect conditional heteroscedasticity. Furthermore, the proposed statistics can help to decide which component is heteroscedastic. Their finite sample performance is compared with that of a Lagrange Multiplier test by means of Monte Carlo experiments. Finally, we use auxiliary residuals to detect conditional heteroscedasticity in ten monthly inflation series.","[Broto, Carmen] Banco Espana, Direcc Gen Adjunta Asuntos Internacl, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Ruiz, Esther] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Banco de Espana; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Broto, C (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Direcc Gen Adjunta Asuntos Internacl, C Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",carmen.broto@bde.es; ortega@est-econ.uc3m.es,"Ruiz, Esther/L-1737-2014; Pérez, Ana/GQA-6861-2022","RUIZ, ESTHER/0000-0002-5944-9449",,,,,45,6,7,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

It analyzes data on the content of party platforms to develop measures of party support for, or opposition to, political-economic closure, anti-democratic nationalism, and xenophobia in all party platforms of 23 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries for all national elections between 1960 and 2003. These allow broader judgments of trends in autarky and autarchy than focusing on electoral success of particular extreme-right parties. Based on these measures, the paper quantitatively analyzes how international trade and capital openness and flows, and immigration flows, all influence the embrace or rejection of political-economic backlash among parties. The main explanatory finding is that immigration and capital flows and openness tend to increase marginally such backlash when national welfare compensation is very modest, but to reduce it when national compensation is generous, cushioning citizens from globalization's economic risks. This finding provides evidence that the current wave of globalization only marginally resembles the dark politics ending its nineteenth-century predecessor, and that welfare protection may help make the difference between political-economic backlash and liberalism in contemporary globalization.","[Burgoon, Brian] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Burgoon, Brian] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Burgoon, B (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,"Burgoon, Brian/0000-0002-7300-0541",,,,,57,45,49,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

They have higher survival rates and their productivity growth is also higher. The strongest contribution is by productivity growth of existing firms with a multinational status rather than entry into the multinational status.

People widely discussed the question whether the c-commerce should be taxed or not. But, the answer is different. Some people support it, while others don't. They both have put forward corresponding reasons. With the development and the innovation of Internet technology, network technology has been widely applied in e-commerce in China. As a result, the e-commerce is gradually getting matured in recent years. Now, in B2B, B2C and C2C fields, the transaction volume of e-commerce is growing quickly. Naturally, many people have focused on the e-commerce taxation. This paper outlines different types of e-commerce and explains the necessity and possibility of e-commerce taxation by analyzing the captioned case study.

I contend that Olson must be supplemented with Joseph Schumpeter for a theoretical framework that enables us to examine processes of long-term structural economic change. The specific focus is on technological progress and industrial growth, with a view to analyzing why certain nations have been better able to rise to industrial leadership, and staying there, than others. The framework yields one theoretical proposition, which receives broad empirical support: In order to rise to industrial leadership, states must prevent vested interests from blocking structural change. States that are unable to do this will get locked into yesterday's technologies and industries, and will effectively have consigned themselves to long-term stagnation and decline. The empirical support is derived from the second part of the article, where paired comparisons between Britain, France, Germany, the US and Japan for five core industries during five periods of industrial leadership, from the Industrial Revolution until today, provide a qualitative test of the theory.","Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Sanda, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University,"Moe, E (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Sanda, Japan.",,"Moe, Espen/ABI-4647-2020",,,,,,100,13,15,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The authors I selected share the characteristic of being all exponents of utilitarianism and of presenting elements which forerun neoclassical economics in the method and analysis they employ. Besides, they have all worked out models for criminal repression which are quite similar to the contemporary model conceived by Gary Becker.","Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Studi Europei DEMS, I-90133 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Simon, F (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Studi Europei DEMS, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",f.simon@unipa.it,,,,,,,37,3,3,0,7,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

In this paper we analyze long-run scenarios for the European natural gas markets in a model, NATGAS, that explicitly includes both factors, resource constraints and producers' market power. Finite resources lead to interdependencies of current production decisions and future opportunities. These decisions in turn depend on the potential for large producers to set market prices above marginal costs. We analyze the impact of conditions on the global LNG market on market shares of pipeline gas suppliers, as well as on the speed of depletion of indigenous European resources. We focus on how shadow prices of resource constraints affect substitution patterns in the various scenarios.","[Zwart, Gijsbert T.

These business cycle fluctuations in interstate risk sharing are driven mainly by states in which small businesses account for a large share of income or employment. State-level banking deregulation during the 1980s loosened the dependence of interstate risk sharing on the business cycle, mainly through its impact on states with many small firms. Our results establish a major benefit from bank deregulation: small firms' access to credit and, with it, interstate risk sharing have improved mainly when it is most urgently needed: in nationwide economic downturns.","[Hoffmann, Mathias; Shcherbakova-Stewen, Iryna] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Hoffmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",,,"Stewen, Iryna/0000-0002-4329-3865",,,,,25,20,25,0,10,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The article explains voting behaviour in the Council on the basis of selected independent variables - notably, governments' absolute and relative positions on the left-right policy dimension, support for European integration among domestic audiences, Member States' population size, and their positions as either net beneficiaries of or net payers into the EU budget. The empirical analysis reveals that voting behaviour is markedly different for the group of older EU Member States compared to its newer ones, with some of the explanatory variables even displaying opposite signs for these two groups in the statistical analyses.","[Hosli, Madeleine O.] Leiden Univ, Dept Polit Sci, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands; [Mattila, Mikko] Univ Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; University of Helsinki,"Hosli, MO (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Dept Polit Sci, POB 9555, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands.",hosli@fsw.leidenuniv.nl,"Mattila, Mikko/H-5864-2019","Mattila, Mikko/0000-0002-2289-8486",,,,,43,54,54,0,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

However, subsidizing goods on which households spend a high proportion of their budget can create large wealth effects. Consumers may then substitute toward foods with higher nonnutritional attributes (such as taste) but lower nutritional content per unit of currency, weakening or perhaps even reversing the subsidy's intended impact. We analyze data from a randomized program of large price subsidies for poor households in two provinces of China and find no evidence that the subsidies improved nutrition.

The predominant system in the U.S. and a few other countries, the recording system, awards title to claimants over current possessors, whereas the predominant system throughout most of the world, the registration system, awards title to the current possessor. The theory illustrates that the title system effect on asset value depends on property-specific factors like the risk of a claim and title system characteristics like transactions costs. A natural experiment in Cook County, Illinois, where both systems existed side-by-side from 1897 through 1996, allows a test of the theory. The evidence for commercial and industrial properties reveals that parcels tend to self-select into the two systems as expected with registration enhancing value once the self-selection effects are removed.

A statistical theorem referred to as Benford's Law states that in many sets of numerical data, the significant digits are not uniformly distributed, as one might expect, but adhere to a certain logarithmic probability function. In order to detect fraud, we derive several requirements that should, according to this law, be fulfilled in the case of survey data. We show that in several SOEP subsamples, Benford's Law holds for the available continuous data. For this analysis, we developed a measure that reflects the plausibility of the digit distribution in interviewer clusters. We are thus able to demonstrate that several interviews that were known to have been fabricated and therefore deleted in the original user data set can now be detected using this method. Furthermore, in one subsample, we use this method to identify a case of an interviewer falsifying ten interviews not previously detected by the fieldwork organization.","[Schraepler, Joerg-Peter] Univ Bochum, Chair Social Sci Data Anal, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Schraepler, Joerg-Peter] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Schräpler, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Bochum, Chair Social Sci Data Anal, Gebaude GB1-131,Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",joerg-peter.schraepler@rub.de,,,,,,,45,6,6,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We use a local-linear estimator, dimesion-reduction techniques, and bootstrap methods to estimate and make inference about ray scale and expansion-path scale economies. We find substantial evidence of increasing returns to scale among credit unions of all sizes, suggesting that further consolidation and growth among credit unions are likely.","[Wheelock, David C.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Wilson, Paul W.] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Clemson University,"Wheelock, DC (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA.",,"Wheelock, David/I-5757-2016","Wheelock, David/0000-0002-2702-8164; Wilson, Paul W/0000-0002-9865-033X",,,,,57,37,50,0,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

We focus on banking decisions, where a contestant chooses to secure an amount of money for the eventual winner, or to risk it on a general knowledge question. We find that contestants do not use the banking strategy that maximizes total expected prize money. Average earnings could be at least 17% higher. Our results suggest that contestants are not overconfident, but do try to convince other contestants that their ability is higher than it really is, in order to increase chances of winning the prize. We argue that this mechanism may also be applicable to other situations that are of economic interest.","[Haan, Marco A.; Los, Bart] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Riyanto, Yohanes E.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Singapore 637332, Singapore",University of Groningen; Nanyang Technological University,"Haan, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.a.haan@rug.nl; b.los@rug.nl; yeriyanto@ntu.edu.sg,"Los, Bart/ABE-5900-2020; Haan, Marco/B-5328-2009; Riyanto, Yohanes E./C-2939-2009","Haan, Marco/0000-0003-2295-1854; Riyanto, Yohanes E./0000-0001-7343-4043",,,,,12,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2011,71.0,4,,,,,519.0,537,,10.1007/s11238-010-9238-z,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,823ZW,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295169100005,0

However, the further connection to well-being is not as well understood. This paper explores the association between a person's travel patterns, their risk of social exclusion and self-assessed well-being. Key influences on social exclusion are discussed, with trip making emerging as a significant influence. Trip making is not a significant direct influence on well-being but does exercise an indirect influence through the impact on risk of social exclusion. The modelling process enables a value for additional trips to be estimated, the value being about four times the values derived from conventional generated traffic approaches. Similar high values are found in separate metropolitan and regional case studies, confirming the significance of the results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Country and industry effects are generated using company data for 1984-2004 from 13 emerging markets and 11 industries and then regressed on country and firm characteristics to identify their determinants. Macroeconomic variables, financial sector development, and the legal environment all have a significant influence on country effects; industrial and geographical concentration help explain industry effects post-1997. We find that different legal origins matter for the country component of stock returns and suggest that further research on this is needed. The evidence also suggests that globalization alone does not drive stock markets and that country factors will continue to be an important determinant of stock returns.","[Bai, Ye] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Green, Christopher J.] Univ Loughborough, Dept Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England",Nottingham Trent University; University of Nottingham; Loughborough University,"Bai, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Business Sch, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",Ye.Bai@nottingham.ac.uk; C.J.Green@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,56,5,5,1,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The studies are grouped using factor analysis based on the determinants included or not included in each study. Following the structured review, a conceptual model of the determinants of tourist spending is proposed. In the empirical part of the study, which is based on a survey with more than 11,000 respondents, the determinants of spending are analysed using multiple regression analysis. Eighteen determinants are tested in seven different models. All 18 determinants are significant in the 'spending per person per night' model. The additional six models include three subdivisions of this core 'per person per night' model into (ii) transport, (iii) accommodation and (iv) other spending. The other three are: (v) per travel party per night, (vi) per person per stay and (vii) per travel party per stay. The 18 sets of tested determinants are: type of accommodation, length of stay, travel party size, destination, travel distance, origin market, purpose of travel, mode of transport, activities, age group, packaging, income, purchase channel, information sources, gender, first-time versus repeat visit, motives and season.","[Marcussen, Carl H.] Ctr Reg & Tourism Res, DK-3730 Nexo, Bornholm, Denmark",,"Marcussen, CH (通讯作者)，Ctr Reg & Tourism Res, Stenbrudsvej 55, DK-3730 Nexo, Bornholm, Denmark.",marcussen@crt.dk,,,,,,,72,61,63,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Using microdata from the 1900 and 1910 Integrated Public Use Microsamples (IPUMS), published data from the Birth Registration Area in the 1920s, results from a number of surveys, and the Linked Birth & Infant Death Files from the National Center for Health Statistics for 1991, infant and child mortality can be related to such other variables as occupation of father or mother, education of father or mother, family income, race, ethnicity, and residence. The evidence shows that, although there have been large absolute reductions in the level of infant and child mortality rates and also a reduction in the absolute levels of differences across socioeconomic groups, relative inequality has not diminished over the 20th century.

We analyze aggregate data for the two countries as well as city-specific case study data for nine large cities (Chicago, Minneapolis, Montreal, New York, Portland, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, and Washington). Cycling levels have increased in both the USA and Canada, while cyclist fatalities have fallen. There is much spatial variation and socioeconomic inequality in cycling rates. The bike share of work commuters is more than twice as high in Canada as in the USA, and is higher in the western parts of both countries. Cycling is concentrated in central cities, especially near universities and in gentrified neighborhoods near the city center. Almost all the growth in cycling in the USA has been among men between 25-64 years old, while cycling rates have remained steady among women and fallen sharply for children. Cycling rates have risen much faster in the nine case study cities than in their countries as a whole, at least doubling in all the cities since 1990. They have implemented a wide range of infrastructure and programs to promote cycling and increase cycling safety: expanded and improved bike lanes and paths, traffic calming, parking, bike-transit integration, bike sharing, training programs, and promotional events.

Each year Baseball America, a leading industry publication, ranks 100 top prospects that have yet to play substantially in the major leagues. Many of these top prospects continue to develop for a year or more in the minor leagues, which gives fans an opportunity to see potential future Major League Baseball (MLB) stars at their local minor league club. The authors use a data set encompassing all AA and AAA minor league baseball teams from 1992 to 2009 to estimate the impact of having a top 100 Baseball America prospect on a minor league team's attendance. Their results suggest that only those prospects ranked in the top 5 and at the highest level (AAA) have an impact on their team's attendance and their impact on attendance is small.","[Gitter, Seth R.; Rhoads, Thomas A.] Towson Univ, Dept Econ, Towson, MD 21252 USA",University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Gitter, SR (通讯作者)，Towson Univ, Dept Econ, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",sgitter@towson.edu,,,,,,,18,17,17,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

This study documents the development in property values and the trade in second homes during the period 1994-2008 and links property values to socio-economic characteristics, events in the lives of the owners and geography. The study finds that ownership of second homes is still fairly well distributed socially, but that there is a clear trend towards the exclusion of those with lower incomes and of families with children. The average age of owners is rising. Second homes play a subtle role not only as holiday resources, but also in the combined housing economy and investment of Danish families. Indirectly, the developments in the trade and value of second homes have implications for future tourism policies. The continuous availability of privately owned second homes on the rental market is of immense importance for the attractiveness of the Danish tourism product in general, and for specific destinations in particular. Rising property prices in the years up to 2008 and a lack of incentives to upgrade the standard of these houses may compromise mainstream Danish tourism policies.","[Hjalager, Anne-Mette] Univ So Denmark, Ctr Tourism Innovat & Culture, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark; [Staunstrup, Jan Kloster] Aalborg Univ, Inst Dev & Planning, DK-92200 Aalborg, Denmark; [Ibsen, Rikke] iTracks, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; Aalborg University,"Hjalager, AM (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Ctr Tourism Innovat & Culture, Niels Bohrsvej 10, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark.",hjalager@advance1.dk; jks@land.aau.dk; rikke@itracks.dk,"Hjalager, Anne-Mette/J-5454-2017","Hjalager, Anne-Mette/0000-0001-5648-4401",,,,,43,15,15,1,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

An empirical method is used to make the comparison, and hence, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied for 23 OECD countries including Turkey. The study shows that a limited number of OECD countries like Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia succeeded in making agricultural production efficiently from 1990 to 2005. Therefore, it can be proposed that the production structures of these countries are environment friendly thus allowing sustainability in their agricultural sectors with respect to other OECD countries. However, the picture does not seem so optimistic for Japan, Poland and Turkey since their efficiency performance decelerated recently. Therefore, in order to reach agricultural sustainability, Japan, Poland and Turkey should improve the efficiency level of their production process. Moreover, Turkey can be ranked within the worst performers among the 23 OECD countries in the context of sustainable agriculture. What is more alarming is the deterioration in the efficiency performance of the country from 1995 onwards. To reverse the ongoing trend, Turkey should radically change the current structure of its agricultural production. In this context, the heavy use of both labour and machinery should be reduced to minimum. Alternatively, the country may concentrate on the supply side of the economy without ignoring further declines in the greenhouse gas emissions.","[Mihci, Hakan] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Mollaveliglu, Sukru] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Dept Econ, Van, Turkey",Hacettepe University; Yuzuncu Yil University,"Mihci, H (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",,,"Mollavelioglu, Muhammed Sukru/0000-0002-0633-4525; MIHCI, Hakan/0000-0003-3484-5346",,,,,36,7,7,0,18,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2011,10.0,2,,,,,4.0,17,,,,,,14,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,793WJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292854300002,0

The Eastern Cape is a middle-income province (6.6% of national GDP), settles 9.6% of the South African population and has a high unemployment rate. A survey was conducted in July 2009, with 450 visitors completing a structured questionnaire at various sampling locations across the festival area. A social accounting matrix (SAM) for the province was used to estimate the economic value of the arts festival to the region's economy (adopting the classical SAMs multiplier approach) with visitor depending data. This research shows that the festival makes a significant contribution to revenue generation as well as to job creation, thereby confirming that investments made by government in arts and culture can address economic objectives.","[Saayman, Melville] North West Univ, Inst Tourism Wildlife Econ & Leisure Studies, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Rossouw, Riaan] North West Univ, Sch Econ, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Rossouw, Riaan] Eon Consulting, Midrand, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; North West University - South Africa,"Saayman, M (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Inst Tourism Wildlife Econ & Leisure Studies, Potchefstroom Campus,Private Bag X6001, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",melville.saayman@nwu.ac.za; riaan.rossouw@eon.co.za,,"saayman, melville/0000-0001-9991-0140; Rossouw, Riaan/0000-0003-1761-6488",,,,,51,20,24,2,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We explore the trends in the height of recruits by religion and place of birth. Basing on samples drawn from 21-year-old conscripts born between 1845 and 1892 we find that Jewish conscripts were shorter than the Christians by 2.5 cm at the beginning of the period under scrutiny and the difference exceeded 4 cm in the 1890s. The height of Jewish conscripts inhabiting provincial towns declined in the late 1880s and in the early 18905 was about the same as in the 1840s, i.e. 161 cm. The socioeconomic crisis of provincial towns caused a massive migration to Warsaw and abroad as well. In the 1870s the stature of Warsaw and provincial Jews was similar, but in the early 1890s men from Warsaw were by 2 cm taller than provincial Jews. The height gap mirrors the difference in the standard of living between Warsaw and provincial towns. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

We first discuss the relevance of various specifications regarding the choice of variables, the way to measure them and the potential functional forms. Then, relying on long-run projections for GDP, trade and foreign direct investment, we compare the 'old' system of formulas to the new one adopted in 2008 at different time horizons until 2030. Two major results emerge from our analysis. First, a single chair for the Eurozone can free 2-3 percentage points of quota shares, but this amount fades over time because intra-Eurozone trade is relatively less dynamic than world trade. Second, introducing population in quota formulas would be the most transparent and efficient way of significantly raising the quota shares for less developed countries.","[Benassy-Quere, Agnes] Univ Paris Ouest, CEPII, Paris, France; [Benassy-Quere, Agnes] Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Bereau, Sophie] CREST INSEE, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Bénassy-Quéré, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest, CEPII, Paris, France.",,,"Benassy-Quere, Agnes/0000-0003-4898-3694; Bereau-Gnabo, Sophie/0000-0001-5820-9577",,,,,18,6,6,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2011,34.0,2,,,,,223.0,247,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01317.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,723UR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287533300003,0

We discuss some new methodologies in this emerging area and demonstrate their use in measurement and inferences on cross-section and spatial interactions. Specifically, we highlight the important distinction between spatial dependence driven by unobserved common factors and those based on a spatial weights matrix. We argue that purely factor-driven models of spatial dependence may be inadequate because of their connection with the exchangeability assumption. The three methods considered are appropriate for different asymptotic settings; estimation under structural constraints when N is fixed and T -> a, whilst the methods based on GMM and common correlated effects are appropriate when T a parts per thousand << N -> a. Limitations and potential enhancements of the existing methods are discussed, and several directions for new research are highlighted.","[Bhattacharjee, Arnab] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland; [Holly, Sean] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England",University of St Andrews; University of Cambridge,"Bhattacharjee, A (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",ab102@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Bhattacharjee, Arnab/0000-0003-1300-0838",,,,,54,15,16,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

A previous investigation published in 2001 for south Orange County found that moving away from the coast by one mile was associated with a $42,000 lower housing price. Intrigued by this finding, we investigate whether (a) a similar coastal premium exists for all of San Diego County and (b) the premium varies by incremental distance from the coast (e.g., for 500-feet increments). Using data from 9,755 San Diego County home sales in 2006, results presented here suggest that for a median-priced home ($540,000) at the mean distance from the coast (approximately 9 miles-and considerably farther than the Orange County estimate) a one-mile increase in distance from the coast would reduce the sale price by approximately $8,680. Specifying by specific distance increments, we find that the coastal premium is approximately 101.9% for houses within 500 feet of the coast (i.e., their value is 101.9% higher than similar homes located beyond six miles of the coast), falling to 62.8% for homes between 500 and 1,000 feet, declining to approximately 3.3% for homes located between five and six miles of the coast, disappearing entirely beyond around six miles. Since average comparisons of the sort initially considered in this analysis can be very misleading, researchers should consider the nonlinear incremental distance effects in model specifications.","[Conroy, Stephen J.] Univ San Diego, Sch Business Adm, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Milosch, Jennifer L.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of San Diego; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Conroy, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ San Diego, Sch Business Adm, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92110 USA.",sconroy@sandiego.edu; jmilosch@gmail.com,,"Klein, Jennifer/0000-0001-8332-4147",,,,,32,55,58,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In this study, we find that top-tier schools in real estate research are not necessarily the most famous schools in economics and finance; progressive universities specializing in real estate research hold the top ranks. Furthermore, school competitiveness has changed substantially in the United States. The changes are mainly because of a mobility of faculty members.

Instead of the traditional method of identifying neighborhoods a priori and then studying how resident attributes change over time, this approach looks at the neighborhood more intrinsically as a unit that has both a geographic footprint and a socioeconomic composition. Therefore, change is identified when both aspects of a neighborhood transform from one period to the next. The approach is based on a spatial clustering algorithm that identifies neighborhoods at two points in time for one city. The authors also develop indicators of spatial change at both the macro (city) level and the local (neighborhood) scale. The authors illustrate these methods in an application to an extensive database of time-consistent census tracts for 359 of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States for the period 1990-2000.","[Rey, Sergio J.; Anselin, Luc; Folch, David C.; Arribas-Bel, Daniel; Gutierrez, Myrna L.

A forward-looking home price distribution model is developed that explicitly incorporates different sources of volatility in the market value of collateral houses. A consistent and computationally-efficient top-down approach of home price simulation is also introduced. We show that with the proper inclusion of all relevant sources of volatilities, the top-down approach provides close approximation to the results generated by a theoretically sound but computationally demanding bottom-up simulation approach. Using a numerical simulation, we demonstrate that a geographically-diversified mortgage pool entails a substantially lower level of systematic collateral driven mortgage default risk compared to a spatially-concentrated pool. However, the expected default risk is shown to remain unaffected, indicating that the benefit from geographic diversification is only realized through lower risk-based capital requirements, not in lower mortgage insurance premiums. Based on the US state level house price indices, the systematic risk of a state-concentrated mortgage pool is estimated to be about four times higher than that of a nationally-diversified mortgage pool. Our results also show that, among the different volatility components, omitting the cross-sectional dispersion of individual home prices would produce the largest bias in assessing home-price-based mortgage default risk.","[Yang, Tyler T.] IFE Grp, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Lin, Che-Chun] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Cho, Man] KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, Seoul 130868, South Korea",National Tsing Hua University; KDI School of Public Policy & Management,"Yang, TT (通讯作者)，IFE Grp, 51 Monroe St,Suite 801, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.",tyler.yang@ifegroup.com; chclin@mx.nthu.edu.tw; mancho@kdischool.ac.kr,,"Lin, Che-Chun/0000-0002-3905-0959",,,,,21,7,7,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This is achieved by an unobserved components model featuring an irregular component that is represented by a Gaussian mixture with two components. The mixture aims at capturing the kurtosis which characterizes the data. After presenting a Gibbs sampling scheme, we illustrate that the Gaussian mixture model provides a satisfactory representation of the data, allowing for the robust estimation of the cyclical component of per capita hours worked. Another important piece of evidence is that the outlying observations are not scattered randomly throughout the sample, but have a distinctive seasonal pattern. Therefore, seasonal adjustment plays a role. We finally show that if a flexible seasonal model is adopted for the unadjusted series, the level of outlier contamination is drastically reduced.","[Bernardi, Mauro; Proietti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy; [Della Corte, Giuseppe] Bank Italy, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Bernardi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy.",mauro.bernardi@uniroma2.it; giuseppe.dellacorte@bancaditalia.it; tommaso.proietti@uniroma2.it,,"Proietti, Tommaso/0000-0001-5285-7522",,,,,37,1,1,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

While houses built after the implementation of the stronger building codes could be presumed to be safer, no study has measured the extent to which stricter building codes are capitalized into improved property. This study measures the capitalization of stricter building codes into house prices. In addition, the study examines whether homebuyers attach greater value to the stricter building codes after the reality check of the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. A hedonic pricing model is used to capture the differential effect on house prices of the stricter 1994 South Florida Building Code for properties sold from 2000 through 2007 in Miami-Dade County. The model also measures any increase in the marginal value of the stronger building code after the 2004/2005 storm season. Models are estimated for the aggregate data and for three geographical zones based on risk exposure. Results show that the stricter building code has a positive effect on selling price. The greatest effect is seen in the coastal zone, which has the greatest risk exposure. Selling prices for homes built under the new code were about 10.4% higher than prices for comparable homes built under the older, less strict code. The premium for safety is shown to decrease as the hurricane risk exposure decreases. For geographical areas with less risk exposure, there is less capitalization of the stricter building code into house prices. The post-catastrophe (reality check) variables show that, following the minimal impact of the 2004 hurricanes on the Miami area, the premium that consumers are willing to pay for structural integrity disappears. However, after the 2005 hurricanes, which were more devastating to the Miami area, the building code premium returns.","[Dumm, Randy E.; Sirmans, G.

My third case concerns Keynes's misrepresentation of Ricardian macro-economic policy, more specifically, his unwillingness to make use of his demonstrable awareness of Ricardo's actual position to support his argument against the Return to Gold at par in 1925.

The phylogenetic tree, using amino acid sequences of BBTV 6, suggested that BBTV contained two groups. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of six BBTV components were aligned and compared. The highest identities of nucleotide and amino acid sequences within each component were 96.10 and 98.27%, and between the six components 70.78 and 56.24%, respectively. All nucleotides sequences of the six BBTV components contained a major open reading frame (ORF), except BBTV 2. All six components also incorporated characteristic sequences such as CR-SL, CR-M, potential TATA box and potential polyadenylation signal. However, these characteristic sequences were somewhat different in different components. Each CR-M of all six BBTV components contained a 16-nucleotide GC-rich region. Furthermore, an almost complete 16-nucleotide direct repeat (ATACAAc/gACa/gCTATGA) was located from 4 to 19 nt and from 21 to 36 nt in isolates from the South Pacific group, but not in isolations from the Asian group. The phylogenetic trees using full nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences of six BBTV components indicated six groups corresponding to each BBTV component. The CR-M nucleotide sequence indicated two groups according to the place of origin. In addition, the secondary structure and some physicochemical properties of proteins of the six BBTV components were predicted, showing significant differences.","[Huang, Y. H.; Zeng, J. W.; Wu, Y.

It examines two competing literatures about conceptions of the Irish state, one which argues Ireland is a model of successful development or flexible develpomental state, and the other arguing Ireland, as a competition state, prioritises economic competitiveness over social cohesion and welfare. The article empirically examines the structural direction of policy change and shifts in power and policy processes. Both developmental and competition logics are found, these are sometimes complementary and other times opposing logics. The developmental role of the Irish state has been uneven across policy areas, being most evident in policies that enable foreign capital thrive and profit and least evident in supporting indigenous industry and social inclusion. While there have been temporal shifts in developmental and competition logics, examination of recent policy responses to recession and economic crisis suggests the primary logic informing Irish development is the competition logic.","[Kirby, Peadar] Univ Limerick, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Limerick, Ireland; [Kirby, Peadar] Univ Limerick, ISKS, Limerick, Ireland; [Murphy, Mary] NUIM, Dept Sociol, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",University of Limerick; University of Limerick; Maynooth University,"Kirby, P (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Limerick, Ireland.",peader.kirby@ul.ie; mary.p.murphy@nuim.ie,"Murphy, Josephine Mary/HTS-0703-2023",,,,,,68,15,17,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It is designed to capture the relative importance and interaction between procedural justice (defined crudely in terms of the difference between one's expected payoff and average expected payoff in the group) and distributive justice (difference between own and average actual payoffs). The model is applied to experimental games, including randomized variations of simple sequential bargaining games, and delivers qualitatively correct predictions. In view of the model redistribution of income can be seen as a substitute for vertical social mobility. This contributes to the explanation of greater demand for redistribution in European countries vis-a-vis the United States.

These hybrids are very resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot, a trait inherited from the male parent. Current breeding strategies are focused on the improvement of 'Nendran' (AAB), the commercial French plantain cultivar of the state, for higher productivity, dwarf stature and resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, weevil borers and nematodes utilising wild/natural/bred diploids. Though limited by low levels of female fertility, development of plantain hybrids resistant to black leaf streak based on triploid/diploid crosses has been reported. Female-fertile clones of 'Nendran' identified in the genebank were pollinated with the wild Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Calcutta-4', highly resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot. Low seed set and germination reduced the recovery of hybrids for evaluation. One hybrid progeny resulting from the cross ['Nendran' clone 'Chengalikodan' x 'Calcutta 4'] with close resemblance to the female parent recorded a plant height of 360 cm, pseudostem girth of 62 cm and 12 leaves at shooting. It registered a bunch weight of 13 kg with 8 hands and 90 fruits. Unlike its susceptible female parent, the hybrid displayed very high resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, imparted by the male parent. Being male- and female-fertile, the hybrid is being back-crossed with 'Nendran' and crossed with selected diploids. Embryo culture is being standardised to improve the recovery of hybrid progeny.","[Menon, R.; Cherian, A.; Suma, A.; Maicykutty; Mathew, P.; Nair, S.; Aipe, K.

Newer thinking, however, asks questions in line with classical Marxist perspectives veering away from dependencia, relating war in the 'dark continent' to issues of class formation and (oprimitiveo) accumulation. Christopher Cramer's Civil War is not a Stupid Thing in particular raises historically and comparatively grounded questions about the relationship between coercion and 'development' that challenge both dependency and liberal thinking. Yet, as assessments of contemporary writing on similar issues (including 'post-conflict studies') illustrate, the quality of this type of thinking in no way guarantees its intellectual hegemony.","Univ Johannesburg, Dept Anthropol & Dev Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Moore, D (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Anthropol & Dev Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa.",dbmoore@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,66,1,1,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

One is to outline the strategic behavioural patterns of small powers. The lack of scholarly attention to these states - the largest group in the international system - is a major omission from the International Relations canon. The other is to see how EU patterns of behaviour, exemplified in attempts to build up capacities for military intervention, overlap with those of a small power.

The complete discussion of the estimation problem in the presence of additional information involves decisions about filtering methods, the quality of the new information, the correlation between state variables and out-of-sample forecast performance. It is found that the state variable estimation is more sensitive than the parameter estimation to the correlation, information quality and the assumed linearity or non-linearity of the underlying model. As a result of the investigation of these factors, the particle filter is shown to be an attractive method for computing posterior distributions for these models.","[Wang, Ren-Her] Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Tamsui 25137, Taipei County, Taiwan; [Aston, John A.

It employs an improved mode detection algorithm for GPS post-processing to determine trips made by bicycle, which are map matched to an enriched street network. The alternatives are generated as a random sample from an exhaustive, but constrained search. Accounting for the similarity between the alternatives with the path-size factor the MNL estimates show that the elasticity with regards to trip length is nearly four times larger than that with respect to the share of bike paths. The elasticity with respect to the product of length and maximum gradient of the route is small. No other variable describing the routes had an impact. The heterogeneity of the cyclists is captured through interaction terms formulated on their average behaviour. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our hypothesis is that the narrowing of the height gap is related to a larger gain in maternal height among Mexican Americans in relation to Whites.

These policies have been criticized as an implicit subsidy that shifts costs from drivers to the public at large. Others have noted that parking lots and structures can lead to increased water and air pollution. However, there has not been an examination of whether parking, presumably by reducing congestion, generates external benefits. We measure whether nearby parking availability influences commercial property prices after controlling for property characteristics, including on-site parking. We find that publicly accessible parking, such as commercial parking garages, generates significant aggregate externalities. We also find evidence of a significant complementary relationship between building and parking area in property values. This suggests that parking regulation could have a significant impact on property development through its effect on the value of the marginal square foot of building area.","[Cutter, Bowman] Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [DeWoody, Autumn] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92503 USA",Claremont Colleges; Pomona College; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Cutter, B (通讯作者)，Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",bowman.cutter@pomona.edu; aedewoody@sbcglobal.net,,,,,,,15,5,7,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2010,38.0,2,,,,,197.0,223,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00265.x,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,600HL,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277976000002,0

This paper examines the causal implications of this expansion by using variation in the level of boys' athletic participation across states before Title IX to instrument for change in girls' athletic participation. Analysis of differences in outcomes across states in changes between pre- and postcohorts reveals that a 10 percentage point rise in state-level female sports participation generates a 1 percentage point increase in female college attendance and a 1 to 2 percentage point rise in female labor force participation.,"[Stevenson, Betsey] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, CESifo, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Stevenson, Betsey] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Stevenson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, CESifo, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,,,,,19,111,151,0,39,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The traffic flow characteristics at 27 active bottlenecks in the Twin Cities have been studied for seven weeks without ramp metering and seven weeks with ramp metering. A methodology for systematically identifying active freeway bottlenecks in a metropolitan area is proposed, which relies on two occupancy threshold values and is compared to an established diagnostic method - transformed cumulative count curves. A series of hypotheses regarding the relationships between ramp metering and the capacity of active bottlenecks are developed and tested against empirical traffic data. It is found that meters increase the bottleneck capacity by postponing and sometimes eliminating bottleneck activations, accommodating higher flows during the pre-queue transition period, and increasing queue discharge flow rates after breakdown. Results also suggest that flow drops after breakdown and the percentage flow drops at various bottlenecks follow a normal distribution. The implications of these findings on the design of efficient ramp control strategies, as well as future research directions, are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The reason is that the beneficiary of this type of subsidy has to consume a good with some given characteristics which do not necessarily agree with his choice in the market. The welfare loss analysed here tries to overcome the lack of a correct measure of excess burden in the situations indicate above. Therefore, the paper constitutes an empirical novelty in the theory of excess burden. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence of the welfare loss after estimating a hedonic price model and using predicted prices in a quadratic almost ideal demand system for housing characteristics. The new excess burden is computed under standard assumptions from the theory of rationing. We identify the sources of the losses and we also provide a monetary measure suggesting that, under plausible parameter values, it can be quantitatively high.","[Bilbao, Celia] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Bilbao, Amelia] Univ Oviedo, Dept Quantitat Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Labeaga, Jose M.] Inst Fiscal Studies, Madrid 28035, Spain; [Labeaga, Jose M.] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Madrid 28035, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Bilbao, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Av Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",cbilbao@uniovi.es; ameliab@uniovi.es; direccion.general@ief.meh.es,"Bilbao Terol, Amelia/B-6569-2014","Bilbao Terol, Amelia/0000-0002-5634-1010; Bilbao-Terol, Celia/0000-0001-7532-813X",,,,,37,2,2,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The growing supply of labour-intensive manufactured exports from China has been accompanied by a huge expansion in its imports both of raw materials and of skill-intensive manufactured parts and components. This 'offshoring' of intermediates production by a large, labour-abundant economy has economic and environmental implications for other developing economies. More recently, the rapid expansion of the Indian economy and trade indicates that it too will soon exert similar effects on global markets. We sketch a model showing how the growth of these developing-country 'giants' generates adjustment pressures on other developing economies. We discuss in particular how differences in relative factor endowments of resource-rich economies can produce quite different outcomes in the context of product fragmentation and expanding commodity trade. We also explore the effects on production, trade, environment and prospects for future growth in resource-rich economies, particularly in the context of weak institutions and other market failures. We illustrate these different impacts by considering the cases of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and highlight implications for growth, development and policy.","[Coxhead, Ian] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Coxhead, Ian] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Trondheim, Norway; [Jayasuriya, Sisira] La Trobe Univ, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; La Trobe University,"Coxhead, I (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,"Coxhead, Ian/0000-0001-6958-038X",,,,,44,24,27,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2010,33.0,4,,,,,525.0,551,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01232.x,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,577KT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276222600001,0

The results indicate that incorporating meteorological variables can increase predictive power, although the most accurate prediction is obtained using a non-causal model - specifically, an autoregressive neural network.","[Alvarez-Diaz, Marcos] Univ Vigo, Dept Econ, Vigo 36200, Spain; [Rossello-Nadal, Jaume] UIB Sa Nostra, Ctr Recerca Econ, Dept Econ Aplicada, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Alvarez-Díaz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Dept Econ, Lagoas Marcosende S-N, Vigo 36200, Spain.",marcos.alvarez@uvigo.es; jrossello@uib.es,"Alvarez-Diaz, Marcos/AGF-3176-2022; Rosselló, Jaume/GQH-9044-2022; Rosselló, Jaume/A-1181-2012","Rosselló, Jaume/0000-0001-9467-2067; Rosselló, Jaume/0000-0001-9467-2067; ALVAREZ-DIAZ, MARCOS/0000-0003-2372-1102",,,,,44,38,40,1,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In this paper, we present a methodology that duly accounts for underlying spatial effects and estimates the expected cost savings of innovative contracting policies for highway maintenance and rehabilitation relative to in-house execution of these activities. Spatial econometric modeling is used to analyze highway contract data from 49 countries. We also investigate the marginal effects of key explanatory variables on contract cost savings using spatial multipliers. Our findings show that there are significant relationships between cost savings and contract characteristics, and that there is an apparent direct relationship between the average cost savings of contracts in a country and contract average cost savings and contract sizes in neighboring countries.

Recently this literature has expanded to include games in a setting where agents play only with local neighbors in a specified geography. In this paper we explore how the ability of agents to move and choose new locations and new neighbors influences the emergence of cooperation. First, we explore the dynamics of cooperation by investigating agent strategies that yield Markov transition probabilities. We show how different agent strategies yield different Markov chains which generate different asymptotic behaviors in regard to the attainment of cooperation. Second, we investigate how agent movement affects the attainment of cooperation in various networks using agent-based simulations. We show how network structure and density can affect cooperation with and without agent movement.","[Tassier, Troy] Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Barr, Jason] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, Newark, NJ 07102 USA",Fordham University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Newark,"Tassier, T (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",tassier@fordham.edu,,,,,,,29,5,6,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

To decide, she is helped by a committee of N experts. Each expert has an estimation of the unknown demand function and use it to advise the decision-maker on how she should modify the current price. Decisions are taken with a weighted majority rule, where the weight of each expert, which may be interpreted as her decision power, evolves as a function of its accuracy. When a perfect exists, i.e., who always gives the correct advice, we show that she ends up with all the decision power in the long-run so that the decision-maker finds the optimal price. When such a perfect does not exist, the decision-maker is actually unable to consistently select an expert over time so that the sequences of prices and weights describe a limit cycle. Interestingly enough, if the decision-maker takes a large sample of the stationary behavior of prices, the empirical mean turns out to be arbitrarily close to the optimal price, independently of the quality of the experts, as long as there experts are diverse enough. This result gives thus support to the thesis developed in the books of Surowiecki (The wisdom of the crowd. Why the many are smarter than the few and how collective wisdom shapes business, economies, societies and nations, 2005) and Page (The difference: How the power of diversity creates better groups, firms, schools, and societies, 2007).","Ecole Super Ingenieurs Leonard de Vinci, Dept Ingn Financiere, F-92216 Paris, France",,"Braouezec, Y (通讯作者)，Ecole Super Ingenieurs Leonard de Vinci, Dept Ingn Financiere, F-92216 Paris, France.",yann.braouezec@devinci.fr,,,,,,,26,2,3,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Working while mobile is a largely white-collar (and well researched) phenomenon whereas mobility as work and mobility for work involve more diverse occupations and have been omitted from sociological analysis of mobile work. The article explores the range of work involving spatial mobility before focusing on a hitherto unexamined form of mobility for work, mobile hairstyling. Relationships between mobility, employment status and the construction of spatial, social and temporal work-life boundaries are excavated. It is shown that previous arguments linking mobile work with decorporealisation or unboundedness are inadequate, applicable primarily to working while mobile. Other types of mobile work may or may not corrode work-life boundaries; whether they do depends in part on workers' income security. Data are drawn from the Labour Force Survey and interviews with self-employed mobile hairstylists.","Univ Warwick, Dept Sociol, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Cohen, RL (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Sociol, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",R.l.Cohen@warwick.ac.uk,"Cohen, Rachel/AAW-8050-2021","Cohen, Rachel/0000-0003-4560-1590",,,,,39,61,68,1,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Using changes in regional rice prices across the 19 regions in Java, Indonesia, during 1935-40, this paper will assess how rice markets responded to variations in rainfall, which is an important factor in rice production. It finds that rice markets were highly integrated across Java. The El Nino-induced episodes of lower than usual rainfall in 1935 and 1940 did not have a negative effect on levels and variations in regional rice prices, nor did they have adverse consequences for the supply of rice. Adaptive responses of firms specialising in the trade of rice are argued to have mitigated regional deficiencies in food production caused by climate stress.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"van der Eng, P (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"van der Eng, Pierre/F-6968-2011","van der Eng, Pierre/0000-0003-2835-3193",,,,,34,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

The link between market incentives and technology adoption is more nuanced. While stronger consumer pressure is significantly associated with technology adoption, competitor pressure is not, suggesting that in developing economies where many input markets are imperfect, it is primarily firms with rents that are able to adopt new technology. Foreign-owned firms exhibit significantly better technology adoption outcomes, but privatized firms with domestic owners do not.","[Fernandes, Ana M.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Fernandes, AM (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",pcorrea@worldbank.org; afernandes@worldbank.org; curegian@worldbank.org,,,,,,,46,24,25,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

In this paper, we explore the consequences of relaxing the rational expectations assumption usually taken in this type of model; in particular, by considering expectations formed through adaptive learning, it is possible to arrive to results other than the trivial convergence to a fixed point long-term equilibrium. The results involve the possibility of endogenous cyclical motion (periodic and a-periodic), which emerges essentially in scenarios of hyperinflation. In low inflation settings, the introduction of learning implies a less severe impact of monetary shocks that, nevertheless, tend to last for additional time periods relative to the pure perfect foresight setup.","[Gomes, Orlando] Escola Super Comunicacao Social, Inst Super Contabilidade & Adm Lisboa, P-1069035 Lisbon, Portugal; [Gomes, Orlando] Econ Res Ctr UNIDE ISCTE, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Gomes, O (通讯作者)，Escola Super Comunicacao Social, Inst Super Contabilidade & Adm Lisboa, Av Miguel Bombarda 20, P-1069035 Lisbon, Portugal.",ogomes@escs.ipl.pt,"Gomes, Orlando/JAC-2919-2023; Gomes, Orlando/B-6043-2009","Gomes, Orlando/0000-0002-7251-8736;",,,,,23,2,2,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

While some countries enjoy the opportunity to serve on this powerful body, most countries rarely, if ever, get that chance. This gives rise to the question: Does board membership lead to higher funding from the World Bank's two main development financing institutions, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). Empirical analysis shows that developing countries serving on the board can expect more than double the funding from the IBRD as countries not on the board. In absolute terms, countries on the board receive an average $60 million bonus in IBRD loans, an amount that rises in years when IBRD loans are in high demand, particularly for countries in the most influential seats. This effect is more likely driven by informal rules and norms in the boardroom than by the power of the vote itself. No significant effect is found in IDA funding. These results point to challenges of global governance through representative institutions.","[Werker, Eric] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kaja, Ashwin] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Werker, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kaja@post.harvard.edu; ewerker@hbs.edu,,,,,,,24,45,50,0,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

The authors explain how, through their network of audit, the TSR is entangling intermediaries and processes into specific supply chains. Moreover, they argue that the emphasis placed on the role of 'metrology' is overstated in the literature. Rather, the concept of 'standards' better captures the more complex, underlying processes involved in the construction of the TSR. They present evidence gathered through a review of data collected from SDOs' and NABs' websites, official documents, international trade agreements, and the directories published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the International Organization for Standardization. They argue that the TSR acts as a techno-economic network that is global in reach and serves a key coordinating role in facilitating international trade. As such they see the TSR as fundamental to the movement towards 'governing at a distance' that is part and parcel of the neoliberal shift from government to governance.","[Loconto, Allison; Busch, Lawrence] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, Inst Food & Agr Stand, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Busch, Lawrence] Univ Lancaster, Inst Adv Studies, CESAGEN, Lancaster, England",Michigan State University; Lancaster University,"Loconto, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, Inst Food & Agr Stand, 422B Berkey Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,"Loconto, Allison Marie/AAW-4787-2020; Loconto, Allison M/L-5526-2017","Loconto, Allison Marie/0000-0001-8949-186X;",ESRC [ES/F04173X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F04173X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,114,128,144,3,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The common feature among offshore financial products is calculated ambiguity: the ability to give diametrically opposed but legally valid answers to the same question from different quarters. Thus offshore allows individuals and firms to enjoy simultaneous ownership and non-ownership, to be high profit and loss-making, heavily indebted but also debt-free, and for investment to be foreign and domestic. The advantages conferred to individuals and firms, however, tend to undermine the stability of the financial system. Using indirect governance techniques, transnational networks of regulators have sought to coercively simplify offshore finance, with mixed results. Focusing on ambiguity as central to offshore finance complements earlier theoretical treatments of this realm from law, anthropology and international relations. Empirically, the recently enhanced surveillance of offshore centers has produced new data facilitating future quantitative studies, which complement more anthropological approaches to this subject.","[Sharman, Jason] Griffith Univ, Ctr Governance & Publ Policy, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Sharman, Jason] Griffith Univ, Griffith Asia Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Sharman, J (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Ctr Governance & Publ Policy, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",,,,,,,,68,38,41,2,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

While there are the linear curves from the perspective of industrial emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and chemical oxygen demand.

The results reveal that the SAR spatial panel data model incorporating spatial heterogeneity, time period heterogeneity and spatial dependence outperforms traditional panel data model. The improvement of standard highways facilities in each region will have not only greatest positive impacts on its own economic growth but also significantly positive spillover impacts on the economic growth of the other regions. The simulation results show that the improvement of the standard highways facilities in the existing major investment regions not only can not generate large induced impacts on the economic growth of the SCZ but also will enlarge regional disparity. If the goal is to generate largest positive impacts on the economic growth of the SCZ, then we should locate the standard highways investments in the 'core zone'. If the goal is to narrow regional disparity by greatest extent, then we should locate the standard highways investments in the 'middle zone'. To take the two criteria, economic growth and narrowing regional disparity, into account at the same time, the best location of standard highways investments is 'middle zone'. The improvement of the standard highways facilities in the 'periphery' would not only have limited impacts on the economic growth of the SCZ but would also aggravate the unbalanced economic development. The spillover effects must be considered fully in the location choice of standard highways investments, so that all will win and gain from each other.","[Zhang Xuehui] China West Normal Univ, Inst Reg Econ, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China; [Wang Ruyuan] China West Normal Univ, Land & Resources Coll, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China",China West Normal University; China West Normal University,"Zhang, XH (通讯作者)，China West Normal Univ, Inst Reg Econ, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China.",peacefullife800120@gmail.com,,,Key Project of Nature Science in Sichuan Provincial Department of Education [07ZA1],Key Project of Nature Science in Sichuan Provincial Department of Education,"Key Project of Nature Science in Sichuan Provincial Department of Education, NO.07ZA1.",,25,0,0,0,1,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-14-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,826.0,835,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE32,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298225400130,0

First, over many years the connection between migration and development has been of marginal interest for many of those involved in the field of development studies; in many cases, where it has been considered, migration has been seen as a symptom of a development failure and cause of further underdevelopment. What has changed to bring about the dramatic turnaround in views in the last decade? Second, governments and development organisations are increasingly focusing on the role of 'diasporas' in the process of development. The attempts to co-opt diasporas into existing development practice tend to assume that they share a common set of interests and aspirations with the development industry. Here, we ask who is included within these diasporas and why should they be expected to contribute to development? This leads to the third question: what is the nature of development in which we are anticipating that the migration process and diasporas should play a role? This article argues that existing models of development are inherently sedentary and struggle to incorporate migration. In the increasingly mobile world new concepts of development are required. An open and critical dialogue between diaspora members and the development industry may help to achieve this.","Univ Oxford, Int Migrat Inst, Oxford Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 3TB, England",University of Oxford,"Bakewell, O (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Int Migrat Inst, Oxford Dept Int Dev, 3 Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TB, England.",oliver.bakewell@qeh.ox.ac.uk,"Bakewell, Oliver/ABG-3225-2020","Bakewell, Oliver/0000-0002-0904-7134",,,,,50,9,9,0,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Moreover, there is also evidence that children who are not overweight are becoming heavier. We use quantile regression models along with standard ordinary least squares (OLS) models to explore the correlates of childhood weight status and overweight as measured by the Body Mass Index (BMI). This approach allows the effects of covariates to vary depending on where in the BMI distribution a child is located. Our results indicate that OLS masks some of the important correlates of child BMI at the upper and lower tails of the weight distribution. For example, mother's education has no effect on black children, but is associated with improvements in BMI for overweight white boys and underweight white girls. Conversely, mother's cognitive aptitude has no effect on white boys, but is associated with BMI improvements for underweight black children and overweight white girls. Further, we find that underweight white children and black girls experience similar improvements in BMI as they get older, but that for black boys there is little if any association between age and BMI anywhere in the BMI distribution.

In doing so, it has also exposed a weakness in the 'output-oriented legitimation' of Europe's economic and monetary union. The common monetary policy and single currency have to be perceived as working if they are to maintain popular acceptance. Whether they actually work is less important than this perception. This raises the prospect that no matter how successful the ECB is in responding to moments of crisis, public opinion may begin to reflect the perception that it has failed. Indeed, the greater the uncertainty experienced during the crisis, the more likely it is that such negative perceptions will predominate.

This study adds to the understanding of the REIT return generating process by exploring the behavioral impact of investor sentiment on REIT returns. The results show that when investors are optimistic (pessimistic), REIT returns become higher (lower). These findings are robust when conventional control variables are considered. Empirical analysis indicates steady erosion in the importance of the default and term structure interest rate variables previously considered as important determinants of REIT returns. Previous noise trading papers that consider the impact of institutional traders conclude that institutional investors cannot arbitrage away noise trader risk. The results of this paper find an exception in the case of small REITs. Examination of REITs based on size reveals that the return generating process of small REITs differs from that of mid-size and large REITs. Analysis of the return generating process by performance shows high performance REITs are more sensitive to the independent variables in the model as compared to the low and mid performance REITs.","[Lin, Crystal Yan] Eastern Illinois Univ, Sch Business, Charleston, IL 61920 USA; [Rahman, Hamid] Alliant Int Univ, Marshall Goldsmith Sch Business, San Diego, CA 92127 USA; [Yung, Kenneth] Old Dominion Univ, Coll Business & Publ Adm, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Eastern Illinois University; Alliant International University; Old Dominion University,"Lin, CY (通讯作者)，Eastern Illinois Univ, Sch Business, Lumpkin Hall, Charleston, IL 61920 USA.",cylin@eiu.edu; hrahman@alliant.edu; kyung@odu.edu,,,,,,,39,59,65,4,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

They can be seen as a violation of the decision-theoretic version of the principle of extensionality (PE). The PE in logic means that two logically equivalent sentences can be substituted salva veritate. We explore what this notion of extensionality becomes in decision contexts. Violations of extensionality may have rational grounds. Based on some ideas proposed by the psychologist Craig McKenzie and colleagues, we contend that framing effects are justified when the selection of one particular frame conveys choice relevant information. We first discuss this idea from a philosophical point of view, and proceed next to formalize it first in the context of the Bolker-Jeffrey decision theory. Finally, we extend the previous analysis to non-expected utility theories using the Biseparable Preference model introduced by Ghirardato and Marinacci (2001) and therefore show that the analysis is independent of the assumptions of Bayesian decision theory.","[Giraud, Raphael] Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Bourgeois-Gironde, Sacha] Ecole Normale Super, Inst Jean Nicod, F-75005 Paris, France",Universite de Franche-Comte; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Giraud, R (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, 45 D Ave Observ, F-25000 Besancon, France.",Sacha.Bourgeois-Gironde@enslsh.fr; raphael.giraud@univ-fcomte.fr,,"Bourgeois-Gironde, Sacha/0000-0003-1767-0919",,,,,22,13,15,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2009,67.0,4,,,,,385.0,404,,10.1007/s11238-009-9133-7,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,495BG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269863600003,0

We find that office rents in all cities react positively to a rise in office employment and lagged rent changes, while lagged deviations from equilibrium rent levels exhibit a slow and partial adjustment over time. Given the non-negativity constraint of vacancy rates we extend the basic model by examining whether rents react to positive changes in employment conditional on the vacancy rate level. Our results show that office rents react significantly stronger to increases in employment when vacancy rates are below the long-term average. We also repeat the analysis for clusters of cities based on similarities in rent and employment dynamics using multi dimensional scaling.

Elements of the power set are non-resolute outcomes. The final outcome is determined by an (external) chooser which is a resolute choice function. The individual whose preference is under consideration confronts a set of resolute choice functions which reflects the possible behaviors of the chooser. Every such set naturally induces an extension axiom (i.e., a rule that determines how an individual with a given preference over alternatives is required to rank certain sets). Our model allows to revisit various extension axioms of the literature. Interestingly, the Gardenfors (1976) and Kelly (1977) principles are singled-out as the only two extension axioms compatible with the non-resolute outcome interpretation.","[Sanver, M.

After suggesting reasons for not being satisfied with solutions involving state-dependent utilities, an alternative representation shall be proposed involving state-independent utilities and a situation-dependent factor. The latter captures the interdependencies between states and consequences. Two sets of axioms are proposed, each permitting the derivation of subjective probabilities, state-independent utilities, and a situation-dependent factor, and each operating in a different framework. The first framework involves the concept of a decision situation-consisting of a set of states, a set of consequences and a preference relation on acts; the probabilities, utilities and situation-dependent factor are elicited by referring to other, appropriate decision situations. The second framework, which is technically related, operates in a fixed decision situation; particular subsituations are employed in the derivation of the representation. Possible interpretations of the situation-dependent factor and the notion of situation are discussed.","HEC Paris, GREGHEC, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris,"Hill, B (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, GREGHEC, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France.",hill@hec.fr,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2009,67.0,4,,,,,405.0,432,,10.1007/s11238-008-9127-x,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,495BG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269863600004,0

Hence, it is a profitability index that evaluates a firm's capital budgeting decisions at the margin. We estimate the equity marginal q for real estate-managing public corporations, namely, real estate investment trusts (REITs), in an attempt to understand how the various costs and benefits of being a public corporation play a role in managing this important asset class. Using the universe of equity REITs for the period from 1993 to 2005, we find that REITs with greater idiosyncratic volatility, higher stock turnover and smaller bid-ask spread have a higher equity marginal q. In addition, both the holdings of institutional investors and their investment horizons are respectively positively related to equity marginal q. With these firm characteristics taken into account, firm size is found to be negatively related to equity marginal q. Our findings are economically important as well, because the equity marginal q ratio alone accounts for approximately one-third of the total REIT shareholder wealth change during the study period.","[Ambrose, Brent W.] Penn State Univ, Dept Insurance & Real Estate, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lee, Dong Wook] Korea Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Korea University,"Ambrose, BW (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Insurance & Real Estate, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",bwa10@psu.edu; donglee@korea.ac.kr,"Ambrose, Brent/C-8531-2017; Lee, Dong Wook/JPA-4190-2023","Ambrose, Brent/0000-0001-5977-3663;",,,,,44,1,1,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2009,37.0,3,,,,,483.0,514,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00249.x,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,489AO,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269392000005,0

Using a dynamic general equilibrium model, the authors show that an increase in tourism demand leads to an increase in the relative price of domestically produced tourism services and increases tourism production. Because the dynamic transition is characterized by capital accumulation and a current account deficit, the economy ends up with a higher capital stock but a lower stock of net foreign assets. Higher foreign income has a welfare-increasing effect, whereas an increase in marketing expenditures has ambiguous effects on residents' consumption and welfare. The authors also discuss the effects of a temporary demand stimulus, which is nonetheless shown to have permanent effects on the country's net foreign asset position and agents' consumption.","[Schubert, Stefan F.; Brida, Juan Gabriel] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Schubert, SF (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, Piazza Univ 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",stefanfranz.schubert@unibz.it; juangabriel.brida@unibz.it,"Brida, Juan Gabriel/H-3727-2015","Brida, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-2319-5790",,,,,36,17,19,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The results indicate that elements of the labour market are endogenous. The longest wage contract terms are found towards the end of the pre-World War I classical gold standard period - characterised by price-level stability - and during the period since the mid 1990s that has seen a firm fixed exchange-rate policy and low and stable inflation. The shortest contract lengths are observed in the interwar period with high inflation volatility. Inflation indexation of wages was used most extensively in the Bretton Woods period and during the soft peg period of the 1970s when inflation was high and rising. The degree of nominal wage rigidity in the economy is therefore not necessarily approximately constant, as it is otherwise assumed in many New Keynesian models.","Danmarks Nationalbank, Dept Econ, DK-1093 Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Abildgren, K (通讯作者)，Danmarks Nationalbank, Dept Econ, Havnegade 5, DK-1093 Copenhagen, Denmark.",kpa@nationalbanken.dk,"Abildgren, Kim/M-1534-2016","Abildgren, Kim/0000-0003-1548-8347",,,,,23,2,2,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

First, it empirically investigates the effect of international migration on poverty in origin countries, using data from a cross-country analysis. Second, it explores the specific part of the income distribution from which migrants are drawn, by comparing the effect of international migration on different income quintiles of the population. Finally, given that the selection of migrants depends not only on the income level of their households, but also on the skill levels of movers, the paper casts some light on the implications of the emigration of skilled workers on poverty. This article shows that the stock of international migrants have a positive effect on the income of the poor while it does not have a significant impact on the income of the middle and top quintiles of the population. In particular, a 10 per cent increase in the per capita stock of migrants resident in OECD nations augments the income of the poor by 1 per cent, on average and ceteris paribus. Finally, the poverty-reducing effect of migration holds even when the emigration process selects the best and the brightest.",,,,,,"CATTANEO, Cristina/0000-0001-8273-0143",,,,,49,10,10,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2009,32.0,8,,,,,1180.0,1202,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01178.x,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,472BT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268104800003,0

Our analysis is based on a spatial job search framework that shows the importance of dissociating the role of travel time from physical distance in unemployment duration. The contribution of our study also stems from the development of skill-specific accessibility measures that take into account the spatial distribution of labor supply and demand. our results show that physical distance and competition among searchers must be controlled for in order to understand the significant role of job access (measured in terms of travel time) in unemployment duration. Second, improvements in access raise the probability that persons living in urban fringes and rural areas will become employed.

This paper uses an accounting framework founded in economic theory to decompose this reallocation into three components: a demand-side effect due to the low income elasticity of demand for agricultural goods (Engel effect), and two supply-side effects, one due to differential sectoral productivity growth rates (Baumol effect), and the other to differential capital deepening. The results show that the Engel effect accounts for almost all labor reallocation until the 1950s, after which the Baumol effect becomes a key determinant. Our framework provides a unified account of long-run structural change, and demonstrates that historical interpretations and theoretical models that emphasize only one dimension of this process cannot properly account for the dramatic history of labor reallocation in the United States.

Surprisingly, sleep is absent from work-life balance debates and has remained largely under-researched by sociologists. This article examines the relationship of insufficient sleep duration with occupational circumstances and family responsibilities, providing a contribution to the examination of the health consequences of working patterns in the UK. We analyse time use data from 2000, focusing on a sub-sample of workers aged 20-60 years (n = 2882). Nested logistic regression modelling is used to identify the segments of the working population getting a short sleep duration that if sustained may have negative health outcomes. An inverse relationship between working hours and sleep duration is found, which is stronger for men than women. Shift work and social class are also significant predictors of short sleep for men.","[Chatzitheochari, Stella] Univ Surrey, Dept Sociol, CRAG, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,"Chatzitheochari, S (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Dept Sociol, CRAG, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",s.chatzitheochari@surrey.ac.uk; s.arber@surrey.ac.uk,,"chatzitheochari, stella/0000-0001-6773-3995",,,,,37,89,101,1,61,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

When disaggregating by property type at the national level, we find that capital flows predict subsequent returns in the apartment and office sectors, but not in the retail and industrial markets. At the metropolitan level, we find that the flows help explain subsequent returns in a limited number of core business statistical areas (CBSAs), although these CBSAs collectively represent about 30% of institutional capital. We find no evidence that institutional returns are predictive of future capital flows at the national or CBSA level, suggesting that institutional investors are not chasing returns.","[Fisher, Jeffrey] Indiana Univ, Sch Business, Ctr Real Estate Studies, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Ling, David C.] Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business, Ctr Real Estate Studies, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Fisher, J (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Business, Ctr Real Estate Studies, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",fisher@indiana.edu; ling@ufl.edu; andy.naranjo@cba.ufl.edu,,,,,,,41,24,24,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2009,37.0,1,,,,,85.0,116,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00236.x,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,409RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263522400005,0

Using monthly inflation rates, two statistics proposed by Im et al. (J Econom 115:53-74, 2003) reject the unit root; however, the nonlinear IV statistic accepts the unit root.

We isolate the effect of the latter by controlling for the probability that the contract is the player's last. We find that players who are less likely to sign a subsequent contract have a large and statistically significant reduction in performance compared to expectations. The incentive to perform well in anticipation of signing the next contract is equally large and offsetting so that players who expect to sign another contract largely perform to expectations.,"[Krautmann, Anthony C.] Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Solow, John L.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",DePaul University; University of Iowa,"Krautmann, AC (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, 1 E Jackson, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",akrautma@depaul.edu,,,,,,,17,25,29,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Well-designed national greenhouse gas mitigation policies can serve as the foundation for global efforts and as (in example for emerging and developing countries. We present six key policy design issues that will determine the costs, cost-effectiveness, and distributional impacts of domestic climate policy: program scope, cost containment, offsets, revenues and allowance allocation, competitiveness, and R&D policy.

The model developed here brings profits fully into price determination, casts additional light on Cantillon's treatment of distribution, and provides the first extended analysis of the policy recommendations found in part one of his Essai. These anti-urban policies are examined in relation to French urbanization and William Petty's analysis of Irish economic development. Entrepreneurial risk-bearing is central to the Essai and this model, yet for Cantillon landlord tastes determine the economy's equilibrium position. This view is mirrored in his treatment of class mobility: only by becoming landed proprietors can entrepreneurs escape dependence and become independent or autonomous determiners of society. Indeed, social mobility actually accounts for the 'independence' of the landed proprietors as a group. Rent's special role stems not so much from the nature of land or agriculture - as Physiocracy would emphasize - as from the nature of the social forces determining its ownership.","Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",DePaul University,"Berdell, J (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, 1 E Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",jberdell@depaul.edu,,,,,,,49,4,4,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

As early as 1911, he used the Perron-Frobenius theorem to prove the existence of a positive solution and established a duality result between the quantity side and the price side of the model.

It shows larger impacts of the economic crisis on the more vulnerable groups, including those with low education, the rural landless, urban residents, and those in provinces most affected by the crisis.

It finds that the debate between Stalin and Bukharin was indeed consistent with Millar's analysis and it supplies new information on the role of markets, repression and primitive accumulation. I examine these questions against the backdrop of the Central Committee transcripts to determine whether the principals truly aimed to increase the agricultural surplus as defined by Millar, their respective positions on coercion, and the role of Marxist ideology in their decision making. The aim is to discover what the actual decision makers expected from collectivisation and the extent to which they (or their critics) were aware of the possible unanticipated consequences of their actions.","Univ Houston, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77401 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Gregory, P (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77401 USA.",pgregory@uh.edu,,,,,,,36,3,3,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2009,61.0,4,,,,,669.0,683,PII 911201800,10.1080/09668130902826287,0.0,,,15,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,445WY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266083400005,0

The review first provides some background on the substantive differences between the Washington Consensus and more heterodox development paradigms, such as Robert Wade's East Asian revisionism. The paper then outlines Rodrik's own developmental vision, which could be termed a third way inasmuch as it borrows elements from both orthodox and heterodox schools of thought, yet disagrees with some of the central underpinnings of both. The remainder of the paper then critically assesses some key elements of this alternative vision, especially Rodrik's institutionalist revision of the existing growth evidence, his call for greater democratization as a universal institutional reform and his proposed changes to the way in which technocrats should formulate policy advice in a post-Washington era.","Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategies & Governance Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Headey, D (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategies & Governance Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,,,,,91,5,5,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We model the optimal dispatch of supply and demand in natural gas networks, with different objective functions, i.e., maximization of flow, and different economic surpluses. The models take into account the physical structure of the transportation networks, and examine the implications it has for economic analysis. More specifically, pressure constraints create system effects, and thus, changes in one part of the system may require significant changes elsewhere. The proposed network flow model for natural gas takes into account pressure drops and system effects when representing network flows. Pressure drops and pipeline flows are modeled by the Weymouth equation. A linearization of the Weymouth equation makes economic analyses computationally feasible even for large networks. However, in this paper, the importance of combining economics with a model for pressure drops and system effects is illustrated by small numerical examples.","[Midthun, Kjetil T.; Tomasgard, Asgeir] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, SINTEF Technol & Soc, Dept Appl Econ, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Bjorndal, Mette] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance & Management Sci, NO-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); SINTEF; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Tomasgard, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, SINTEF Technol & Soc, Dept Appl Econ, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",asgeir.tomasgard@sintef.no,"Tomasgard, Asgeir/AAX-2832-2020","Tomasgard, Asgeir/0000-0002-0953-1946",,,,,26,29,34,0,26,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,30.0,4,,,,,155.0,180,,,,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,500HU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270290500006,0

In contrast to existing literature, which has taken a snapshot of the post-reform period and identified 'winners and losers' accordingly, this article examines the processes of capital accumulation in the industry and the legacies these have left. It argues that despite defeat in a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute case, concentration and diversification in the EU sugar industry has enabled its leading corporations to prosper after reform, while divestment in the ex-colonies has left producers in the ACP facing difficulties of adjustment far in excess of plain terms of trade losses. Further, it also reveals why EU reform was not solely a response to WTO legislation but rather, because of the relationship of sugar to wider economic fortunes, resulted from an assiduous attempt by the EU Trade Commission to press the sector into a WTO-compatible Common Agricultural Policy.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Richardson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,47,11,14,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We then turn to the likely social and economic impact of this, considering Clark's hypothesis that 'middle-class values' spread through English society prior to the Industrial Revolution. Through the construction of social mobility tables, we demonstrate that the children of the rich were indeed spreading through society, but they were small in number relative to poorer sections of society, and moreover the children of the poor were also entering the middle classes.","[Boberg-Fazlic, Nina; Sharp, Paul; Weisdorf, Jacob] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Sharp, Paul] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",University of Copenhagen; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Boberg-Fazlic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",nina.boberg@econ.ku.dk; paul.sharp@econ.ku.dk; jacob.weisdorf@econ.ku.dk,"Sharp, Paul/C-1027-2019; Boberg-Fazlic, Nina/AAJ-8685-2021","Sharp, Paul/0000-0003-0679-0106; Boberg-Fazlic, Nina/0000-0002-9536-2332",,,,,31,34,34,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

These debates demonstrate how diverse social influences and experiences, and the memory of previous experiences and collective endeavours, are essential features that must be acknowledged in terms of their implications. There are series of interventions on occupational identity, the everyday lives of workers, gender and ethnic relations and the experience of work that nourish our understanding of collectivism as a more complex and broader concept. Furthermore, how features and relations are mobilized, linked and developed is becoming a vital feature of how collectivism should be understood. It is argued that the nature of these relations needs to be a greater focus of the debate if we are to develop a more dynamic view of collectivism, and a more relevant one.","[McBride, Jo] Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Bradford BD9 4JL, W Yorkshire, England; [Lucio, Miguel Martinez] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Employment Relat & Employment Law Grp, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Bradford; University of Manchester,"McBride, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Emm Lane, Bradford BD9 4JL, W Yorkshire, England.",j.mcbride@bradford.ac.uk,,"Martinez Lucio, Miguel/0000-0001-7090-9007",,,,,28,23,23,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The parking capacity allocations, parking fees and access times are considered in a parking market. First we solve the parking market equilibrium without regulatory intervention, revealing four types of competitive equilibrium. Only one of the four types of equilibrium, however, is found to be stable and realistic, and under it each parking area is preferred by the commuters during certain time periods. Compared to the case without parking choice, provision of parking through a competitive market is able to reduce commuters' travel cost and queuing delay, but it does not necessarily lead to the most desirable market outcome that minimizes social cost or commuter cost. This issue can be addressed through market regulations, such as price-ceiling, capacity-floor or capacity-ceiling, and a quantity tax/subsidy regulation. It is found that both price-ceiling and quantity tax/subsidy regulations can efficiently reduce both the system cost and commuter cost under certain conditions, and help ensure the stability of the parking market. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate these findings and furthermore, how a price ceiling or a quantity tax/subsidy should be set in a parking market under realistic model parameters.

A martingale investment is a stochastic sequence of wealth levels, whose expected value at any future stage is equal to the investor's current wealth. In decision theory, a risk neutral investor would therefore be indifferent between holding on to a martingale investment, and receiving its payoff at any future stage, or giving it up and maintaining his current wealth. But a risk-averse decision maker would not be indifferent between a martingale investment and his current wealth level, since he values uncertain deals less than their mean. A risk seeking decision maker, on the other hand, would readily accept a martingale investment in exchange for his current wealth, and would repeat this investment any number of times. These ideas lead us to introduce the notion of a risk-adjusted martingale; a stochastic sequence of wealth levels that a rational decision maker with any attitude toward risk would value constantly with time, and would be indifferent between receiving its pay-off at any future stage, or giving it up and maintaining his current wealth level. We show how to construct such risk-adjusted investments for any decision maker with a continuous monotonic utility function. The fundamental result we derive is that a pay-off structure of an investment (i) is a risk-adjusted martingale and (ii) can be represented by a lattice if and only if the pay-off functions are invariant transformations of the given utility function.","Univ Illinois, Dept Ind & Enterprise Syst Engn, Coll Engn, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Abbas, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Ind & Enterprise Syst Engn, Coll Engn, 104 S Mathews Ave, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",aliabbas@uiuc.edu,"Abbas, Ali E/J-6450-2014",,,,,,11,0,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2011,71.0,4,,,,,643.0,668,,10.1007/s11238-010-9213-8,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,823ZW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295169100011,0

Using a sample of almost 26,000 students enrolled at an Italian University, we document how grades vary significantly across degrees. After controlling for student characteristics, class-size, classmate quality and degree fixed effects, it emerges that students obtain better grades and are less likely to drop-out when their degree course experiences an excess of supply. We adopt an instrumental variable strategy to account for endogeneity problems and instrument the excess of supply using the total number of universities offering each degree course. Our two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimates confirm that the teaching staff on degree courses facing low demand tend to set lower academic standards with the result that their students obtain better grades and have a lower probability of dropping out than they might otherwise. Similar results are obtained using a control function approach.","Univ Calabria, Dipartimento Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Calabria,"De Paola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dipartimento Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",m.depaola@unical.it,,"DE PAOLA, Maria/0000-0002-1704-4136",,,,,22,10,11,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper emphasizes the revenue-generation opportunities and welfare impacts of flat-tolling schemes, standard congestion pricing, and credit-based congestion pricing policies. While most roadway investment decisions focus on travel time savings for existing trips, this work turns to logsum differences (which quantify changes in consumer surplus) for nested logit specifications across two traveler types, two destinations, three modes and three times of day, in order to arrive at welfare- and revenue-maximizing solutions. This behavioral specification is quite flexible, and facilitates benefit-cost calculations (as well as equity analysis), as demonstrated in this paper. The various cases examined suggest significant opportunities for financing new roadway investment while addressing congestion and equity issues, with net gains for both traveler types. Application results illustrate how, even after roadway construction and maintenance costs are covered, receipts may remain to distribute to eligible travelers so that typical travelers can be made better off than if a new, non-tolled road had been constructed. Moreover, tolling both routes (new and old) results in substantially shorter payback periods (5 versus 20 years) and higher welfare outcomes (in the case of welfare-maximizing tolls with credit distributions to all travelers). The tools and techniques highlighted here illustrate practical methods for identifying welfare-enhancing and cost-recovering investment opportunities, while recognizing multiple user classes and appropriate demand elasticity across times of day, destinations, modes and routes.

While the theory itself is sound from most perspectives, its empirical version is connected with several shortcomings. One extremely delicate problem arises because the set of observable asset returns rarely has a history of complete observations. Traditionally, this problem has been solved by simply excluding assets without a complete set of observations from the analysis. Unfortunately, such a methodology may be shown to (i) lead for any fixed time period to selection bias in that only the largest companies will remain and (ii) lead to an asymptotically empty set containing no observations at all.

Using China's inbound tourism market as the object and based on the B-N data decomposition theory, this paper adopts the statistics of variance ratio to measure the long-lasting effects of stochastic fluctuations on China's inbound tourism industry. It also discusses the influences of stochastic fluctuations and the decreasing growth rate on the welfare of China's inbound tourism. The conclusion is that undoubtedly China's inbound tourism industry will continue to grow, but the impact of stochastic shocks will endure for a relatively long time. Twenty-four per cent of the long-term fluctuation of China's inbound tourism industry is the result of stochastic shocks, whose effect, in the short term, will continue to be reinforced. Though the elimination of fluctuations will increase welfare by 0.40%, lowering the growth rate will decrease welfare by a larger percentage. If the monthly growth rate decreases by 0.1%, welfare will fall by about 19.37%, 48 times the amount of welfare loss without fluctuation. Therefore, China's inbound tourism business should stick to the long-term policy of facilitating growth, while some administrative and legislative measures should be taken to address the negative impact of stochastic fluctuation appropriately.","China Univ Geosci, Sch Humanities & Econ Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Beijing,"Ping, L (通讯作者)，China Univ Geosci, Sch Humanities & Econ Management, Xueyuan Rd 29, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",leiping@ruc.edu.cn,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Specifically, we build impulse response functions from a panel of US states to examine how states cope with changes in economic conditions. We examine current expenditures, as well as Unemployment Insurance, welfare, and capital spending. Further, we examine how both short and long term debt and state government taxes vary with GSP. Our examination of average state government behavior indicates that states respond slowly to changes in the economy, and that they do not utilize some of the institutional features that are purportedly designed to cushion budgetary impacts. Finally, we find that welfare and UI spending follow separate distinct time paths, but not ones seemingly constrained by institutional barriers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Yet the self-employed poor rarely have any formal training in business skills. A growing number of microfinance organizations are attempting to build the human capital of microentrepreneurs in order to improve the livelihood of their clients and help further their mission of poverty alleviation. Using a randomized control trial, we measure the marginal impact of adding business training to a Peruvian group lending program for female microentrepreneurs. Treatment groups received thirty- to sixty-minute entrepreneurship training sessions during their normal weekly or monthly banking meeting over a period of one to two years. Control groups remained as they were before, meeting at the same frequency but solely for making loan and savings payments. We find little or no evidence of changes in key outcomes such as business revenue, profits, or employment. We nevertheless observed business knowledge improvements and increased client retention rates for the microfinance institution.","[Karlan, Dean] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Karlan, D (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,"de Groot, M/A-2025-2012","Valdivia, Martin/0000-0003-3604-4307; karlan, dean/0000-0003-0164-1398",,,,,21,296,335,6,128,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Standard isotropic models assume that spatial correlation is a homogeneous function of distance. This assumption, however, is oversimplified if spatial dependence changes with direction. We thus propose a local anisotropic approach based on non-linear scale-space image processing. We illustrate the methodology by using data on single-family house transactions in Lucas County, Ohio. The empirical results suggest that the anisotropic modeling technique can reduce both in-sample and out-of-sample forecast errors. Moreover, it can easily be applied to other spatial econometric functional and kernel forms.","[Fuess, Roland] Int Univ Schloss Reichartshausen, Union Investment Chair Asset Management, D-65375 Oestrich Winkel, Germany; [Fuess, Roland] Int Univ Schloss Reichartshausen, Real Estate Management Inst REMI, European Business Sch EBS, D-65375 Oestrich Winkel, Germany; [Zhu, Bing; Rottke, Nico B.] Int Univ Schloss Reichartshausen, Real Estate Management Inst REMI, European Business Sch EBS, D-65201 Wiesbaden, Germany",European Business School (EBS) University; European Business School (EBS) University; European Business School (EBS) University,"Füss, R (通讯作者)，Int Univ Schloss Reichartshausen, Union Investment Chair Asset Management, D-65375 Oestrich Winkel, Germany.",zhu.ebs@rem-institute.org; rottke.ebs@rem-institute.org; roland.fuess@ebs.edu,,"Zhu, Bing/0000-0001-6003-3646",,,,,19,14,15,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This market is a duopoly where players compete in dollar-denominated prices while one of them, Airbus, incurs a large fraction of its costs in euro. We estimate price elasticities for big aircraft, and construct a simulation model to investigate how companies adjust their prices to deal with the effects of a temporary misalignment and how this affects profit margins and volumes. We conclude that, due to the duopolistic nature of the aircraft market, Airbus will pass only a small part of the exchange-rate fluctuations on to customers. Moreover, due to features specific to the aircraft industry, such as customer switching costs and learning-by-doing, even a temporary departure of the exchange rate from its long-run equilibrium level may have permanent effects on the industry.","[Benassy-Quere, Agnes] Univ Paris Ouest, CEPH, Paris, France; [Benassy-Quere, Agnes] Ecole Polytech, F-75230 Paris, France; [Fontagne, Lionel] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Raff, Horst] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Raff, Horst] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany",Universite Paris Saclay; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel,"Bénassy-Quéré, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest, CEPH, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,15,5,5,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2011,34.0,4,,,,,623.0,641,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01338.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,745KA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289163100006,0

Though the effects are interrelated, the direct impact for each of these stakeholders is unique. For the government, direct taxation, tourism and investment are discussed, with a focus on the immediate effect on infrastructure. For industry, revenue generation, the multiplier effect, leakage, cannibalization and the trend of strategic cross-industry alliance are examined. For the community, average household disposable income, employment rate, direct competition, land speculation and the impact on standard of living are analysed.","Univ Queensland, Sch Tourism, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Lee, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Tourism, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",timothy.lee@uq.edu.au,"Lee, Timothy/AEN-1896-2022","Lee, Timothy/0000-0002-2435-073X",,,,,26,5,5,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Contrary to the predominant view in workplace bullying literature and despite cost implications for employers, this article proposes an agenda for future empirical research focused on whether employers may also benefit significantly from bullying. It outlines a definition of workplace bullying, key debates and prescriptions suggested in previously published literature for management to contest and prevent it. When bullying is perceived in terms of managerial control of labour and the core concepts of the labour process - an approach not previously embraced in the established psychological and social psychological analyses of the issue - bullying is better understood as an endemic feature of the capitalist employment relationship. Existing secondary material and future research possibilities are then explored and discussed, with some conclusions that are aimed to take the research in this field in new directions.","[Beale, David; Hoel, Helge] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Beale, D (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Booth St W, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",david.beale@mbs.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,70,88,2,51,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

But more and more evidences show that agents may have other-regarding preference. The present article extents the model of prisoner's dilemma on Barabasi and Albert networks to include heterogeneous social welfare preference agents and studies its effects on the cooperation emergence on networks. The simulation results show that social welfare preference may promote cooperation in many cases, especially in the situation where the defection attraction is high. However, there are some situations where social welfare preference does not favor cooperation on complex networks. Simulations also display that it is not always true that the higher weight on social welfare preference corresponds with the higher cooperation frequency. Neighborhood size and initial cooperation also have important effects on the cooperation frequency as well, the features which are not observed in the situations without social welfare preference agents. These results are all related to the locality of social welfare preference. This article reveals the complex relationship between social preference and cooperation frequency in complex networks, which may help researchers reconsider the role of pro-social preference in the evolution of cooperation on complex networks.","[Bo Xianyu] S China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Bo Xianyu] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Log & Cognit, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ping Chen] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Univ Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Bo, XY (通讯作者)，S China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xianyubo@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [70673118, 71071061]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 70673118, 71071061).",,34,5,6,3,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Using the internal Census version of the American Housing Survey, we find no evidence of heightened displacement, even among the most vulnerable, original residents. While the entrance of higher income homeowners was an important source of income gains, so too was the selective exit of lower income homeowners. Original residents also experienced differential gains in income and reported greater increases in their satisfaction with their neighborhood than found in other low-income neighborhoods. Finally, gaining neighborhoods were able to avoid the losses of white households that non-gaining low income tracts experienced, and were thereby more racially stable rather than less.

This section goes into detail about measures and data. Part II statistically analyzes the data for all U.

The researchers also investigate whether the relative importance of the drivers of innovation differ depending on county scale and other characteristics that are often used to differentiate rural from urban.

I argue that social status seeking could be welfare improving rather than the usual conclusion that social status seeking is welfare-reducing, under some assumptions that are not particularly strong. Market distortions of the quantity-variety and consumption-leisure trade-off may be corrected by social status seeking. Since modern societies are arguably closer to monopolistic competition than perfect competition, we may also need to rethink the long-held belief that the welfare effects caused by social status seeking are usually negative.","Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Woo, WC (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",wcwoo@cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,16,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2011,36.0,2,,,,,227.0,239,,10.1007/s00355-010-0472-7,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,695JC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285365400003,0

To provide a broad foundation for further thinking on this organization, we analyse its evolution over half a century from two perspectives: phases in the international political economy and the literature on IPE. By so doing, we uncover two paradoxes. Firstly, we find that the organization's evolution closely mirrored major phases in the postwar international political economy until recently. However, the OECD's long-term dependence on the West has now become an obstacle to its efforts to adapt to the latest phase, characterised by the rise of non-Western powers. Secondly, we show that, during the OECD's golden age, scholars paid relatively little attention to the organization but, from the 2000s, as the organization faced an unprecedented challenge of its potential economic decline, IPE literature on the organization blossomed.","[Clifton, Judith; Diaz-Fuentes, Daniel] Univ Cantabria, Fac Econ & Business Sci, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Clifton, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Fac Econ & Business Sci, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",,"Díaz-Fuentes, Daniel/K-8324-2014; Clifton, Judith/E-4462-2013","Díaz-Fuentes, Daniel/0000-0002-6290-2363; Clifton, Judith/0000-0001-6081-6800",,,,,45,23,25,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The result is a de facto preferential trade area in East Asia in which applied tariff rates significantly undercut the legally bound rates. This gap, termed binding overhang, is an under-studied aspect of international political economy, but provides information about the nature of East Asian regionalism. To wit, the regional bias in applied tariffs is driven by transnational production networks that must move components across borders, not geopolitics or state preferences for increased regional integration. This finding supports a 'bottom up' interpretation of East Asian regionalism.","Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Hale, T (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Corwin Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,38,7,7,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The proximity matrix, both by squared Euclidean and cophenetic correlation, between types indicated high closeness/similarity among 'Attiakala', 'Bichkela-1', 'Bichkela-2' and 'Hill Banana'. The highest proximity value of 20.62 with 'Kalyani Local-3' showed maximum dissimilarity with 'Maricha' and 'Jhama Diara'. A dendrogram using the single linkage clustering technique on squared Euclidean distance matrix and cophenetic correlation matrix showed 13 and 14 clusters, respectively. PCA was used by considering 13 factors on the basis of variance explained, i.e. more than 3%, and total explained variation was confined to 68%. Thus considering the dominant characters with positive loading under Factor 1, such as bract scar on rachis, pollen sacs colour, leaf corrugation, general fruit shape, fruits and compound tepal, the positively loaded types were 'Bichkela-1', 'Hill Banana', 'Attiakala', 'Bichkela-2', 'Kalyani Local-1' and 'Jhama Daira'. Factor 1 thus explained 14.21% of the total variance. In general, PCA results agreed with the results obtained by cluster analysis. PCA gave a better picture of the relationship between seeded banana types than cluster analysis and was useful in confirming group(s) obtained through cluster analysis. MDS group plots also clearly indicated the clustering of homogeneous types. Among the 34 seeded banana types, 32 were assessed as parthenocarpic. The two non-parthenocarpic types identified were 'Baruipur' and 'Seed Banana-15'.","[Hasan, M. A.; Chowdhury, R. Ray; Manna, M.; Mandal, K.

Key researchers have commented that there is no stereotypical 'wine tourist'; however, some distinctive features regarding profiling and segmentation can be drawn from literature. The objective of this paper is to address these issues as well as to provide an insight into the winery visitor in Greece. A quantitative approach was employed and 133 visitors to 13 wineries of the 'Wine Roads of Northern Greece' were surveyed through the use of a structured questionnaire. Accordingly, in order to identify their profile, descriptive analysis was carried out and specific demographic, socio-economic, and other behaviour characteristics were assessed. Analysis suggests that the winery visitor in Northern Greece is predominately a young male, well educated, with a high income and comes from urban centres in close proximity to the wine region. Furthermore, Two-step Cluster Analysis was performed on the basis of the wine tourists' motivations for visiting the wine region.

Specifically, this research paper investigates the stock performance of US hospitality firms under different Fed monetary policy regimes. Hospitality companies include gambling firms, lodging companies and restaurants. Changes in the discount rate and federal funds rate are used to measure shifts in the Fed monetary policy and to classify the full monetary policy period as either a restrictive or an expansive monetary policy environment. An expansive monetary condition is a period with a decrease in the discount or federal funds rate; a restrictive monetary environment experiences an increase in the discount or federal funds rate. Empirical test results reveal that the influence of the two monetary policy indicators on hospitality stock returns varies to a great extent. The stock returns of US restaurants are related significantly to changes in the federal funds rate. However, changes in the discount rate generally have no strong impact on US hospitality stock returns.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University,"Chen, MH (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan.",finmhc@ccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,41,11,11,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We consider two measures of inflation-the mean and median-and three different measures of inflation variability-the standard deviation, relative variation, and median deviation. All results from the mean and standard deviation, the mean and relative variation, or the median and the median deviation support both the hypothesis that higher inflation creates more inflation variability and that inflation variability raises inflation across quantiles. Moreover, higher quantiles in both cases lead to larger marginal effects of inflation (inflation variability) on inflation variability (inflation). We particularly consider whether thresholds for inflation rate or inflation variability exist before finding such positive correlations. We find evidence of thresholds for the effect of inflation (inflation variability) on inflation variability (inflation). That is, for low inflation (inflation variability) countries, inflation (inflation variability) does not affect inflation variability (inflation).","[Miller, Stephen M.] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Fang, WenShwo] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Yeh, Chih-Chuan] Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas; Feng Chia University,"Miller, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",stephen.miller@unlv.edu,"Miller, Stephen M/H-8251-2019","Miller, Stephen M/0000-0002-6754-0605",,,,,63,3,4,3,66,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Ultimately, then, the determination of whether more balance is preferred to less in any particular sports league requires careful and thorough empirical investigation.","[Fort, Rodney] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Quirk, James] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; California Institute of Technology,"Fort, R (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, 1402 Washington Hts,Rm 3150, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",rodfort@umich.edu,,,,,,,17,20,23,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Different researchers and organizations tend to monitor the progress of economic and institutional reforms through inventing different indexes (indicators), apparently trying to understand how to detect the end of the transition process. The European Union, opening its door to accession candidates and starting negotiations with a number of eastern European and Baltic states, was the first to rely on those assessments of progress in reforms for making decisions on the readiness of the countries in terms of economic and institutional development to become a member of the European family. This study tries to link the actual assessments of reforms (start of negotiations) and the available set of indicators to construct an empirical model. We apply statistical techniques of limited dependent variable models to reveal the most important criteria followed by the 'EU admission committee' and capture them in limited dependent variable models, which are applied to evaluate the readiness of a number of other post-socialist countries to start hypothetical negotiations with the EU. Based on available empirical results the factors captured in the model include the share of public expenditure in GDP, GDP per capita, private sector share of GDP, share of trade with EU in external turnover, democratization and inflation (macroeconomic stability). Our empirical assessments show that there are several transition economies (Albania, Armenia and Georgia), which despite not having candidate status, offer better general standing in terms of 'accession criteria' than the current candidates. This fact may suggest to policy-makers (other geopolitical conditions being equal) to consider these countries for future EU enlargement waves.","[Tamazian, Artur] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Finance, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Melikyan, Davit N.] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; The World Bank,"Tamazian, A (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Finance, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.",artur.tamazian@gmail.com,,"Tamazian, Artur/0000-0002-1087-9296",,,,,12,1,1,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The use of hybrid discrete choice models constitutes a good alternative to incorporate the effect of subjective factors. We estimated hybrid models in a short-survey panel context for data among many alternatives. The paper analyses the results of applying these models to a real urban case study, and also proposes an approach to forecasting using these models. Our results show that hybrid models are clearly superior to even highly flexible traditional models that ignore the effect of subjective attitudes and perceptions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

First of all, we show that the model specifications by Alesina et al. (J Econ Growth 8:155-194, 2003), which connects high ethnic fractionalisation to lower growth via bad policy variables, cannot fully explain the negative ethnic fractionalisation effect of the 1990s Sub-Saharan African growth experience. Moreover, we show that the remaining negative effect of ethnic fractionalisation on growth in Sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s is due to an increased importance of adverse governance. Second, and on a very different note, we empirically investigate if ethnic fractionalisation might have a positive effect in a nation which is ethnically diverse due to immigration. There is evidence that it is important to distinguish between these two different kinds of ethnic fractionalisation.","[Schueler, Dana; Weisbrod, Julian] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Schüler, D (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",Dana.Schueler@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de; JulianWeisbrod@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,44,3,4,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This structure offers decision makers a more flexible mechanism for preference expression, which can include strong or mild preference of one state or scenario over another, as well as equal preference. In addition, preference between two states can be uncertain. The result is a preference framework that is more general than existing models which consider preference strength and preference uncertainty separately. Within the hybrid preference structure, four kinds of stability are defined as solution concepts and a post-stability analysis, called status quo analysis, which can be used to track the evolution of a given conflict. Algorithms are provided for implementing the key inputs of stability analysis and status quo analysis within the extended preference structure. The new stability concepts under the hybrid preference structure can be used to model complex strategic conflicts arising in practical applications, and can provide new insights for the conflicts. The method is illustrated using the conflict over proposed bulk water exports from Lake Gisborne in Newfoundland, Canada.","[Xu, Haiyan; Hipel, Keith W.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Syst Design Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Kilgour, D.

It was considered that the higher the degree of integration of on-farm tourism activity, the greater was the realization of the demand-shift effect. Second, statistical evaluation using GIS data revealed that a distance of 1,000 m from rural roads was a referential benchmark by which to Judge the effects of distance from roads on farmers' tourism activity. Third, it was clarified empirically that chose farmers with broader perspectives - in terms both of a longer time horizon and consciousness of service marketing management such as diversification of the sales channel and targeted customer services - were more successful in integrating tourism activity.","Chiba Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Chiba 2718510, Japan",Chiba University,"Ohe, Y (通讯作者)，Chiba Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, 648 Matsudo, Chiba 2718510, Japan.",yohe@faculty.chiba-u.jp,"Ohe, Yasuo/K-1096-2019",,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20248024] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,36,5,5,1,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Small firms have been important in technology development in other East Asian countries but the situation in Chinese small firms has been far less explored. We examine how much S&T has been accounted for by small firms and how their S&T intensity differs across industries and ownership groups. We also analyse how various firm characteristics differ over size categories and S&T status. This study is based on newly processed micro-level data provided by the National Bureau of Statistics with information on a large number of S&T indicators for manufacturing firms in China in 2000 and 2004. Our results suggest that the role of small firms in Chinese S&T is similar to that in many other countries. They account for a comparably small share of total S&T and most small firms are not engaged in any S&T. However, those small firms that do engage in S&T tend to be more S&T intensive and have a higher output in terms of patents than larger Chinese S&T firms.","[Sjoholm, Fredrik] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Sjoholm, Fredrik] Univ Orebro, Orebro, Sweden; [Lundin, Nannan] E3G & Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Orebro University; Stockholm Environment Institute,"Sjöholm, F (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,,,47,10,10,0,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2010,33.0,9,,,,,1117.0,1139,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01282.x,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,648BR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281665900004,0

A multi-country computable general equilibrium model has been used. The main results have been that the European Union benefits from these investments, but at international level, USA and Japan would lose in terms of welfare. Furthermore, the welfare change has been decomposed in its components and the results show that the trade effects are higher than the allocative effects.

This is important because illiquidity may be more severe for REITs due to the nature of their underlying assets. We find that momentum returns display asymmetric volatility, i.e., momentum returns are higher when volatility is higher. Additionally, we find evidence that REITs with lowest past returns (losers) have higher idiosyncratic risks than those with highest past returns (winners) and that investors require a lower risk premium for holding losers' idiosyncratic risks. Therefore, although losers have higher levels of idiosyncratic risks, their low risk premia cause low returns, which contribute to momentum.

The petroleum geology models of post-peak oil production indicate supply declines from 1.5% to 6% per year. Travel requires fuel energy, but current transportation planning models do not include the impacts of constrained fuel supply on private travel demand. This research presents a method to assess the risk to activities due to a constrained fuel supply relative to projected unconstrained travel demand. The method assesses the probability of different levels of fuel supply over a given planning horizon, then calculates impact due to the energy supply not meeting the planning expectations. A new travel demand metric which characterizes trips as essential, necessary, and optional to wellbeing is used in the calculation. A case study explores four different urban forms developed from different future growth options for the urban development strategy of Christchurch, New Zealand to 2041. Probable fuel supply availability was calculated, and the risk to transport activities in the 2041 transport model was assessed. The results showed all the urban forms had significantly reduced trip numbers and lower energy mode distributions from the current planning projections, but the risk to activities differed among the planning options. Density is clearly one of the mitigating factors, but density alone does not provide a solution to reduced energy demand. The method clearly shows how risk to participation in activities is lower for an urban form which has a high degree of human powered and public transport access to multiple options between residential and commercial/industrial/service destinations. This analysis has led to new thinking about adaptation and reorganization of urban forms as a strategy for energy demand reduction rather than just densification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We put particular focus on its implication regarding the choice of advisor type used by REITs. This question has long been a puzzling one in real estate literature. Our model provides a theoretical justification regarding the potential appeal of external managerial structure, which is usually regarded as being inferior to internal managerial structure. A crucial driving force regarding advisor choice is the heterogeneity on monitoring power between internal and external advisors and across REIT firms. Provided that the gap of monitoring power is large enough between internal and external advisors, shareholders could make use of the heterogeneity, and induce higher effort levels from external advisors. We motivate the rationale for expecting a monitoring advantage over external management from two aspects: the dual-role of external advisory firm and a bigger reputational cost associated with external advisor. Furthermore, we are able to specify the range within which an improved monitoring power is Pareto-optimal for both REIT shareholders and advisors. One implication is that, as agents, it may also be to the benefit of advisors to be better monitored. Finally, we compare the difference between fixed and stochastic forcing contracts. Our findings show that with their imperfect performance measures, the stochastic forcing contracts always dominate the fixed one.","Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Accounting & Finance, Coll Business & Publ Adm, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA",California State University System; California State University San Bernardino,"Sun, H (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Accounting & Finance, Coll Business & Publ Adm, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA.",hsun@csusb.edu,,"Sun, Hua/0000-0002-9232-7777",,,,,11,7,7,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The emergent xenophobic activism among ethnic minorities, or inter-minority xenophobia, has received much less attention. Mass survey data from the Russian Federation is used in a systematic comparison of attitudes toward migration among ethnic Russians vs. ethnic non-Russians. Attitudes are also compared across select ethnic non-Russian groups to address this growing, if counter-intuitive, problem in Russia's ethnic relations arising from migrations.","San Diego State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Alexseev, MA (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",alexseev@mail.sdsu.edu,,,,,,,25,25,29,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

This paper assesses the first year of the Decision's implementation in Article IV reports. We develop a questionnaire based on the key aspects of the Decision, which is used to evaluate Article IV reports published before and after the adoption of the new Decision for twenty-four countries. We find that the Decision has significantly increased the overall quality of Article IV reports, with improvements noted in emerging-market, advanced, and developing countries. Bilateral surveillance is more focused on external stability and core macroeconomic policies. Exchange rate analysis, in particular, has improved significantly. We note, however, that the integration with multilateral surveillance remains relatively weak and that cross-country spillovers still do not receive sufficient attention. Moreover, while most reports examine domestic stability in some detail, the link between domestic stability and external stability is not adequately analyzed. On the issue of the even-handed application of the Decision, we conclude that implementation has been broadly similar across country income groups, although differences remain for specific aspects of the Decision.","[Vasishtha, Garima; Lavigne, Robert] Bank Canada, Int Dept, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Vasishtha, G (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Int Dept, 5 East,234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",gvasishtha@bankofcanada.ca; rlavigne@bankofcanada.ca,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We employ Tobit (and Probit) models and make use of an exceptionally detailed database that allows an assessment of the allocation of Swedish aid channelled through NGOs in comparison to the allocation of Swedish official aid. Our analysis provides mixed results. On the one hand, NGOs appear to be altruistic as far as available indicators on political and commercial motivations of aid can tell. On the other hand, needs-based targeting of aid by NGOs turns out to be surprisingly weak. GDP per capita of recipient countries shapes the allocation of official aid, but not that of aid channelled through NGOs. The headcount of absolute poverty has a significantly positive effect on aid allocation, but its impact is not particularly strong when NGOs are involved. Overall, the Swedish case supports the sceptical view that NGOs are not necessarily superior donors compared to state aid agencies.","[Dreher, Axel] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Moelders, Florian] DIW German Inst Econ Res, Berlin, Germany; [Nunnenkamp, Peter] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of Gottingen; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Dreher, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.",,"Dreher, Axel/AAN-1839-2020","Dreher, Axel/0000-0002-7227-3599",,,,,38,29,33,2,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2010,33.0,2,,,,,147.0,176,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01233.x,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,551WG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274242700001,0

Unlike the standard monocentric city model, we assume that bid rents for houses are not monotonically decreasing with the distance from the central business district (CBD) because there exist subcenters that are subsidiary to the CBD. As a result, land is initially developed outward from the CBD. Leapfrog development may happen, i.e., distant land from the CBD may be developed prior to nearby land; however, land that is developed later will be more densely developed because it is developed at a better state of nature. We further find that the development patterns of at least four large cities are consistent with that predicted by our model.","[Jou, Jyh-Bang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Lee, Tan] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Auckland, New Zealand; [Lee, Tan] Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Int Business, Tao Yuan 320, Taiwan; [Jou, Jyh-Bang] Massey Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Auckland, New Zealand",National Taiwan University; Auckland University of Technology; Yuan Ze University; Massey University,"Jou, JB (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, 1 Roosevelt Rd,Sec 4, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",tanlee@saturn.yzu.edu.tw; jbjou@ntu.edu.tw,"JOU, JYH-BANG/L-9428-2018","JOU, JYH-BANG/0000-0002-9507-3370",,,,,44,14,15,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This article presents an analytical model of international institutions that shows how underlying norms and principles - the meta-regime - govern the rules and procedures of specific international regimes. It then applies this model to ASEAN's trade and anti-haze regimes, demonstrating how ASEAN's underlying meta-regime has frustrated attempts to liberalize trade and reduce air pollution. While ASEAN's purview has extended well beyond its original security mandate and it has developed new rules and procedures to handle the new issues, its underlying norms and principles consistently limit its ability to handle regional problems. In the conclusion, we discuss how the ASEAN states might be able to foment cooperation in these issue areas without completely abandoning its foundational norms and principles.","[Aggarwal, Vinod K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley APEC Study Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Aggarwal, Vinod K.; Chow, Jonathan T.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chow, Jonathan T.] Amherst Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Aggarwal, Vinod K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Amherst College; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Aggarwal, VK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley APEC Study Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Chow, Jonathan T./AAD-7148-2020","Chow, Jonathan T./0000-0003-1015-8744; Aggarwal, Vinod.

This special issue, therefore, provides a detailed examination of international market regulation - the processes through which the domestic regulatory activities of states and other actors set the effective rules of internationally-exposed markets. To this end, we borrow and extend on arguments developed by historical institutionalists in comparative politics and American political development. In particular, the contributions adapt two mechanisms - policy feedbacks and relative sequencing - to explain state and bureaucratic preferences over international market regulation as well as bargaining strength in relevant negotiations. In addition to contributing to central IPE debates about international economic governance, the individual contributions shed light on a number of important empirical domains such as corporate accounting, intellectual property, pharmaceuticals, hedge funds, and financial market standardization.","[Farrell, Henry] George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Newman, Abraham L.] Georgetown Univ, Edmund Walsh Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC USA",George Washington University; Georgetown University,"Farrell, H (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",henry.farrell@gmail.com,,,,,,,118,101,118,4,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This is followed by a basic analysis of farmer's decision on the selection of agricultural products under risk, including some comparative static results from stylized models. Selected empirical topics are surveyed, with emphasis on risk analyses as they pertain to production decisions at the farm level. We draw conclusion as follows: farmer's decision under risk can cause the increase of intercropping of the farm products and reduce the quantity of agricultural product the price of which fluctuates greatly, and farmer's decision under risk can also hinder the adoption of new agricultural technology. Finally, risk management is then discussed; we put forward some countermeasure of risk management and government interference which can help farmers to reduce the negative effects of farmer's decision under risk.

Fluctuations in the importance granted to externalities reflect fluctuations in the place granted to the market. In the first half of the twentieth century, externalities were judged unimportant. Later, they became pervasive. This radically changed in the 1960s through a redefinition of the market largely based on Ronald Coase's views on transaction costs.

This paper is motivated by an ongoing need to review the effectiveness of empirical fuel demand forecasting models, with a focus on theoretical as well as practical considerations in the model-building processes of different model forms. We consider a linear trend model, a quadratic trend model, an exponential trend model, a single exponential smoothing model, Holt's linear model, Holt-Winters' model, a partial adjustment model (PAM), and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. More importantly, the study identifies the difference between forecasts and actual observations of petrol demand in order to identify forecasting accuracy.

This article draws on two cases studies, parental leave policy and liberalization of the airline industry, to investigate why the myth of gender equality has not resonated with European women. The first case demonstrates that, if the European gender narrative runs up against contending national myths, the EU narrative may be undermined. The second case shows that if EU gender initiatives are forced to compete with dominant narratives in the economic sphere, they are quickly undermined. In other words, the EU gender myth, though well grounded in legislative reality, is too weak to create the gender equal polity that it envisions.","York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Macrae, H (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, S672 Ross Bldg,4700 Keele St, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",hmacrae@yorku.ca,,,,,,,31,50,52,0,18,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

These nonlinear models have a significant influence on unit root tests. It is possible that the persistence of a variable becomes higher and the power of the unit root tests develops distortions if the form of the regime shifts is misspecified. This paper investigates the ability of unit root tests to detect stationarity in misspecified SB and three-regime TAR models. We show that the misspecified SB model has high persistence, similar to an autoregressive (AR) model, when the true process is a three-regime TAR process. On the other hand, unlike the AR model, the misspecified three-regime TAR model does not have persistence, when the true process is one with SB. The results of the Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that a unit root test performed in the misspecified three-regime TAR model has more power even under processes with SB, whereas a unit root test undertaken in the misspecified SB model does not perform well under three-regime TAR processes. We also provide some instances of applications in economic variables that would have regime shifts.","Ryukoku Univ, Fac Econ, Fushimi Ku, Kyoto 6128577, Japan",Ryukoku University,"Maki, D (通讯作者)，Ryukoku Univ, Fac Econ, Fushimi Ku, 67 Tsukamoto Cho, Kyoto 6128577, Japan.",maki@econ.ryukoku.ac.jp,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,8,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

We show that for given technologies, labor market integration necessarily lowers GDP per capita in a poor source country of emigration, because it distorts the education decision of individuals. As pointed out by our analysis, a negative source country effect also materializes if all agents face identical emigration probabilities, irrespective of their education levels. This is in sharp contrast to the case of exogenous skill supply. Allowing for human capital spillovers, we further show that with social returns to schooling there may be a counteracting positive source country effect if the prospect of emigration stimulates the incentives to acquire education. Since, in general, the source country effects are not clear, we calibrate our model for four major source countries - Mexico, Turkey, Morocco, and the Philippines - and show that an increase in emigration rates beyond those observed in the year 2000 is very likely to lower GDP per capita in poor economies.","[Egger, Hartmut] Univ Bayreuth, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Felbermayr, Gabriel] Univ Hohenheim, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University of Bayreuth; University Hohenheim,"Egger, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.",hartmut.egger@uni-bayreuth.de; g.felbermayr@unihohenheim.de,,"Felbermayr, Gabriel/0000-0003-4984-9745",,,,,30,4,4,0,12,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

As an easy to observe and Measure trait, it has been a classic paradigm in the emergence of fundamental concepts regarding inheritance and genetics. Resemblances in height between relatives suggest that 80% of height variation is under genetic control with the rest controlled by environmental factors Such as diet and disease exposure. Nearly a century ago it was recognised that many genes were likely to be involved but it is only with recent advances in technology that it has become possible to comprehensively search the human genome for DNA variants that control height. About 50 genes and regions of the genome have been associated with height to date. These begin to explain the biological basis of height, its links to disease and aid our understanding of the evolution of human height. The genes discovered so far have a very small individual effect and hundreds, maybe thousands, more of even smaller effects are still lost in the genome.

The basic structure of these conflicts is that of the so-called claims problem, in which an amount of money has to be divided among individuals with differing claims and the total amount available falls short of the sum of the claims. We describe the results of a questionnaire in which Belgian and German students were confronted with nine claims problems. In the Firm version, respondents had to divide revenue among the owners of a firm who contribute to the activities of the firm in different degrees. In the Pensions version, they had to divide tax money among pensioners who have paid different contributions during their active career. Responses in the Pensions version are more egalitarian than in the Firm version. For both versions, the proportional rule performs very well in describing the choices of the respondents. Other prominent rules-in particular the constrained equal awards and constrained equal losses rules-fail to capture some basic intuitions. A substantial part of the respondents tend to become more progressive as the amount to be distributed decreases other things equal, and tend to become more progressive as the inequality in the distribution of claims becomes more unequal other things equal. All of these conclusions are robust with respect to the difference in home-country of the respondents.","[Bosmans, Kristof] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, NL-6211 LM Maastricht, Netherlands; [Bosmans, Kristof; Schokkaert, Erik] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Schokkaert, Erik] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Maastricht University; KU Leuven; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Bosmans, K (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, Tongersestr 53, NL-6211 LM Maastricht, Netherlands.",k.bosmans@algec.unimaas.nl; erik.schokkaert@econ.kuleuven.be,,"Bosmans, Kristof/0000-0003-3056-1610; Schokkaert, Erik/0000-0003-0981-3449",,,,,30,20,22,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,NOV,2009,33.0,4,,,,,533.0,557,,10.1007/s00355-009-0378-4,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,509BH,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270985500002,0

But what specific factors related to school outcomes influence house prices: the parents, the peers, or the school inputs? We study the extent that house Values are affected by each of the components of an education production function. Based on 123 school districts and 26,000 house transactions, we find that parental inputs are the primary component of school outcomes that are capitalized into house prices. In the explanation of variations in house prices, variations in parental characteristics are at least seven times more important than similar variations in the influence of peer groups. We find no influence on house prices from variations in school inputs. This result suggests that land values in a particular community will be increased more by attention to zoning laws that influence the mix of renters to homeowners and the type of households entering a community compared to investing in additional public school inputs.

Specifically, we use sign restrictions to identify a government revenue shock as well as a government spending shock, while controlling for a generic business cycle shock and a monetary policy shock. We explicitly allow for the possibility of announcement effects, i.e., that a current fiscal policy shock changes fiscal policy variables in the future, but not at present. We construct the impulse responses to three linear combinations of these fiscal shocks, corresponding to the three scenarios of deficit-spending, deficit-financed tax cuts and a balanced budget spending expansion. We apply the method to US quarterly data from 1955 to 2000. We find that deficit-financed tax cuts work best among these three scenarios to improve GDP, with a maximal present value multiplier of five dollars of total additional GDP per each dollar of the total cut in government revenue 5 years after the shock.

We suggest this paradigmatic shift was influenced by a growing discourse coalition of 'euro-strategists', which mobilized to prevent another European foreign policy failure like the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. While this project remains in its infancy, it has already led to the articulation and institutionalization of a new vision of security within the enlarged European community. Indeed, we contend that the continued expansion of this 'global power' approach is likely to have profound implications for the future of European integration, potentially leading to a deeper and more tightly unified European geopolitical space.","Univ Cambridge, Pembroke Coll, Ctr Int Studies, Cambridge CB2 1RS, England",University of Cambridge,"Rogers, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Pembroke Coll, Ctr Int Studies, Cambridge CB2 1RS, England.",jmr69@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,122,73,79,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

If the theorems hold for all income distributions, previously given conditions are both necessary and sufficient. Different versions of the conditions are compared and their equivalence are stated. It is proved that the continuity of the transformations can be implicitly included in the necessary and sufficient conditions. In general, continuity is a realistic restriction when the theory is applied to transfer problems. The effect of dropping the explicit continuity restriction on the transformations is analysed, since situations in which discontinuity can be assumed are also considered. The analyses have yielded the fundamental result that continuity is a necessary condition if income inequality persists or is reduced.","[Fellman, Johan] Swedish Sch Econ & Business Adm, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Fellman, Johan] Folkhalsan Inst Genet, Helsinki, Finland",,"Fellman, J (通讯作者)，Swedish Sch Econ & Business Adm, POB 479, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",fellman@hanken.fi,,"Fellman, Johan/0000-0002-7162-7121",,,,,9,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,AUG,2009,33.0,2,,,,,335.0,342,,10.1007/s00355-008-0362-4,0.0,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,459NV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267110800008,0

Our results have economic motivations regarding the potential integration of international real estate securities markets and the possibility of including information on changing correlations and volatilities to design more optimal portfolios for international real estate securities.","[Liow, Kim Hiang; Ho, Kim Hin David; Ibrahim, Muhammad Faishal; Chen, Ziwei] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Liow, KH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",rstlkh@nus.edu.sg,"Liow, KimHiang/K-7295-2013",,,,,,29,68,75,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

However, while the existing literature covers all of these motives, most contributions select only one of them as a focus and relegate the others to the background by making simplifying assumptions about them. While the focus on only one saving motive is vital for many insights on aggregate saving behavior, this paper argues that further insights relevant to policy can be gained by relaxing this assumption. Using data from a random sample of German households and from federal official statistics, I explain how much people save under the explicit assumption that various different saving motives co-exist. The findings show that heterogeneity in saving behavior is systematically related to the importance that households attach to different co-existing saving motives. This suggests that policy reforms that change the importance of certain saving motives in the eyes of private households might influence their saving decisions.","Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Schunk, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",dschunk@iew.uzh.ch,,,,,,,71,12,15,4,21,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Our analysis builds on the task-based approach introduced by Autor et al. (2003), as implemented by Spitz-Oener (2006) for Germany, and also accounts for job complexity. We perform a Blinder-Oaxaca type decomposition of the changes in the entire wage distribution between 1999 and 2006 into the separate effects of personal characteristics and task assignments. In line with the literature, we find a noticeable increase of wage inequality between 1999 and 2006. The decomposition results show that the changes in personal characteristics explain some of the increase in wage inequality whereas the changes in task assignments strongly work towards reducing wage inequality. The coefficient effect for personal characteristics works towards an increase in wage inequality at the top of the wage distribution. The coefficient effect for the task assignments on the contrary shows an inverted U-shaped pattern. We conclude that altogether the task-based approach can not explain the recent increase of wage inequality in Germany.","[Antonczyk, Dirk; Fitzenberger, Bernd] Univ Freiburg, Dept Econ, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Fitzenberger, Bernd] ZEW, IZA, IFS, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Antonczyk, D (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Dept Econ, Pl Alten Synagoge, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",dirk.antonczyk@vwl.uni-freiburg.de; bernd.fitzenberger@vwl.uni-freiburg.de; ute.leuschner@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,34,41,44,0,8,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

R&D investments are made often in a phased manner, with the commencement of subsequent phase being dependent on the successful completion of the preceding phase. This is known as sequential investment. Moreover, each stage creates an opportunity (option) for subsequent investment. Therefore, R&D projects can be considered as 'Compound Options' in which investments present uncertainty both in the gross project value and in their costs. It is possible to use exchange options to value the R&D investment opportunities.

Jointness is based on the joint posterior distribution of variables over the model space, thereby taking model uncertainty into account. By looking beyond marginal measures of variable importance, jointness reveals generally unknown forms of dependence. Positive jointness implies that regressors are complements, representing distinct but mutually reinforcing effects. Negative jointness implies that explanatory variables are substitutes and capture similar underlying effects. In a cross-country dataset we show that jointness among 67 determinants of growth is important, affecting inference and informing economic policy.

Yet such interventions are costly to implement, and clear evidence on the optimal time to intervene to yield a high economic and social return in the future is meagre. The majority of successful early childhood interventions start in the preschool years. However socioeconomic gradients in cognitive skills, socio-emotional functioning and health can be observed by age three, suggesting that preventative programmes starting earlier in childhood may be even more effective. We discuss the optimal timing of early childhood intervention with reference to recent research in developmental neuroscience. We motivate the need for early intervention by providing an overview of the impact of adverse risk factors during the antenatal and early childhood periods on outcomes later in life. We provide a brief review of the economic rationale for investing early in life and propose the antenatal investment hypothesis. We conclude by discussing a suite of new European interventions that will inform this optimal timing debate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Urban planners, policy makers and politicians are forced to consider how they can legitimately introduce a policy that the public may not want. Implementation in London, and failure in Edinburgh, raise questions about whether they should seek full citizen support, or work strategically towards implementation in the face of public opposition. This paper reports on an investigation of the Stockholm congestion charging trial (SCCT). It analyses the strategy developed by the city authorities to create legitimacy for the implementation of the SCCT. The SCCT is examined in two steps, firstly how the 'trial + referendum' approach was successful in securing public acceptance, and secondly how key aspects of the design of the trial and the subsequent referendum were adjusted in response to emerging risks, demonstrating the pragmatic approach of the city leaders managing the policy process. The study suggests that the city leaders chose a clearly pragmatic approach, grounded in compromise, yet subtly designed to avoid openly confronting the status quo. The strategy was continuously adapted and adjusted, in the face of emerging risks, and clearly served to create consensus while avoiding difficult questions of urban mobility. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Where the boundaries are drawn can dramatically alter the number of districts a given political party can win. As a result, a political party which has control over the legislature, can (and does) manipulate the boundaries to win a larger number of districts, thus affecting the balance of power in the US House of Representatives. This work introduces a novel solution to the problem of fairly redistricting a state that is motivated by the ideas of fair division. Instead of trying to ensure fairness by restricting the shape of the possible maps or by assigning the power to draw the map to nonbiased entities, this solution ensures fairness by balancing competing interests against each other. Essentially, it is a simple interactive protocol that presents two parties with the opportunity to achieve their fair representation in a state (where the notion of fairness is rigorously defined) and as a result a balanced electoral map is created.","[Landau, Z.; Reid, O.; Yershov, I.] CUNY City Coll, Dept Math R8133, New York, NY 10031 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY),"Landau, Z (通讯作者)，CUNY City Coll, Dept Math R8133, Convent Ave & 138th, New York, NY 10031 USA.",zeph.landau@gmail.com,,,,,,,5,9,10,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2009,32.0,3,,,,,479.0,492,,10.1007/s00355-008-0336-6,0.0,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,399FV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262786700009,0

The estimation results show the existence of three switching regimes, two characterized by low volatility and the third by high volatility. Moreover, the scale of the responses of the Federal funds rate to movements in the rate of inflation and the economic activity index depends on the regime. The estimation results also show robust empirical evidence that the importance of the term spread in the FRF has increased over the sample period and the FRF was more stable during the term of office of Chairman Greenspan than in the pre-Greenspan period.","Univ Basque Country, Dpto Fundamentos Analisis EconA, Mico II, Bilbao 48015, Spain; Univ Basque Country, Dpto Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,"Vázquez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Dpto Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Av Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",jesus.vazquez@ehu.es,"Vazquez, Jesus/D-3067-2019","Vazquez, Jesus/0000-0003-4788-4838",,,,,32,3,3,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In order to achieve this, we investigate an optimising model of labour demand under uncertainty through the application of real option theory. We also consider other forms of employment which increase the flexibility of the labour market. In particular, we are modelling the contribution of temporary employment agencies (Zeitarbeit) allowing for quick personnel adjustments in client firms.

There are thus strong economic arguments for rethinking the set-up for fiscal stabilization policies in the EMU. We suggest three remedies for the underperformance of the automatic stabilizers: making EU expenditure sensitive to the cyclical situation of the recipient country, introducing an EU corporate tax upon the upcoming revision of the EU budget before 2013 and/or setting up a European unemployment scheme.","[Dullien, Sebastian] Stiftung Wissensch & Polit, D-10719 Berlin, Germany; [Dullien, Sebastian] FHTW Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Schwarzer, D (通讯作者)，Stiftung Wissensch & Polit, Ludwigkirchplatz 3-4, D-10719 Berlin, Germany.",daniela.schwarzer@swp-berlin.org,,"Dullien, Sebastian/0000-0002-6401-8651",,,,,34,24,23,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

From this analysis, we find three likely scenarios for Russian oil exports.

I react first to the assumed convergence towards an open economy politics (OEP) framework. While OEP clearly has merits, I find that its narrow conception of actors and interests neglects other approaches' insights into preference formation and institutions that would enable it to offer better explanations of political economy. Second, I respond to the perceived monoculture in American IPE, which many (wrongly) attribute to professional power over journals and (rightly) tie to graduate training in the United States. More to the point of deconstructing the perceived intellectual hegemony driving IPE's monoculture, I challenge Randall Germain's indictment of the Harvard school of IPE. I show that the early Harvard Mafia indeed played a critical role in shaping the field, but it did not determine the myopic paradigmatic and methodological trends we currently see in the discipline. Finally, I reflect on why we have, and indeed need, this transatlantic debate and make a plea for more pragmatism, pluralism and problem-driven research in IPE today.","Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Katzenstein, PJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",,,,,,,,17,27,31,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The 'new IPE', as embodied in the open economy politics approach, is more rigorous and has the virtue of integrating comparative and international political economy into a common framework. But it pays too little attention both to how interests are constructed and how policies are subject to processes of international diffusion, and it is remarkably reluctant to focus on major changes taking place in world politics.

Based on the pair innovation-routine, which is itself a variation of the Darwinian pair variation-selection, the model acts as a guide to Marshall's investigation of firm boundaries and size, industrial organization and economic policy, providing a coherent, yet flexible, explanatory scheme. Since the model is never openly presented, it is too easy for readers to miss its purport. The paper begins with a brief survey of the reception of the book and the disappointment consequent upon the high expectations that its long haul had generated. Section 2 highlights the key role of Marshall's model in his interpretation of industrial development. It also emphasizes that the model has no pretension to predetermine the outcome of the process. Section 3 is devoted to the related but separate issue of the contingent reasons for Marshall's choice of nation-States as the main units of analysis. His policy proposals, less heterogeneous and fragmentary than appears at first sight, are the subject of section 4, which is followed by a few summarizing conclusions.","Univ Pisa, Dept Philosophy, I-56100 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Raffaelli, T (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Philosophy, I-56100 Pisa, Italy.",t.raffaelli@fls.unipi.it,,,,,,,38,4,4,0,1,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

This paper explores three main topics. It first looks at some of the most important theories that seek to explain the Real Business Cycle (RBC), and examines the main features of business cycles over the past three decades of the last century. Real business cycle theories focus instead on the factors that cause output to fluctuate around the long-term trends. Secondly, the article identifies and examines the two important Juglar cycles of Romanian market economy and some useful correlations for risk management during a period of crisis. Thus different types of regularities can be observed in Romanian business cycle that relates more to the correlation among economic variables and GDP. Business cycles also appear to have been relatively closely synchronized across the major industrial countries in the past, suggesting similar phases of expansions and contractions in aggregate economic activity. Cyclical convergence in the Euro area countries is also discussed. Thirdly, the paper attempts to examine a new statistical instrument called Business Cycle Clock (BCC) and its Eurostat's new graphical interface for displaying developments of some key national and European Indicators within Europe, such as GDP, consumption, investment, exports and imports, (un-)employment, Economic Sentiment, industrial production, etc. BCC helps managers in their understanding of economic cyclical evolutions, from up-to downswings, from economic booms to crises or recessions in time and across countries. Finally, variations in the characteristics of economic fluctuations have implications for a better management understanding of the forces underlying them.

Based on the existing ISP analysis frame and ways, this article analyzes the enterprise fundamental principle of enterprise value acting on ISP and defines the formation of enterprise value.

A science team, cooperating with the United Nations Development Programme project Demonstrating Sustainable Conservation of Biological Diversity in Four Protected Territories in the Kamchatka Region, Russian Federation, is working to provide vital information to help guide regional Sustainable development planning in a time of rapid change in globalization and visitation pressures. An emerging part of Russian society has been the managers in Russian industry that receive high wages and demonstrate increased interest in travel and tourism within Russia and across Europe. Consumers have been reporting very low debt and new growth in the economy has been anticipated. Russians have very unique but evolving leisure patterns, with a long tradition of nature-based activities near home, including hiking, cross-country skiing, viewing nature, and relaxing at spas or dachas. The Kamchatka Peninsula is emerging as a nature-based vacation destination with federal and regional protected areas in the region attracting and hosting a growing number of Russian and international tourists. A cooperative study was initiated in 2007 to better understand the visitation and economics aspects of sustainable tourism development in Kamchatka over a one-year period. A survey of 1, 961 tourist visitors to Kamchatka revealed nearly two-thirds of Kamchatka visitors were from Russia, followed by Germany, the U. S., and France. In economic contribution terms, however, while in the minority among visitors, Non-Russian visitors reported over $ 4, 000 per trip in expenditures, excluding air or cruise ship fare to get to Kamchatka. Russian visitors, by far the majority, reported a much lower average of about $ 1, 500 per trip. Similar to recent changes in China and elsewhere in Asia, Russia is expecting continued economic gains with a potential significant rise in consumption and personal income. Current and anticipated spending patterns of discretionary income among Russians could greatly influence transition of this relatively low density frontier in Asian Russia.","[Watson, Alan] US Forest Serv, Aldo Leopold Wilderness Res Inst, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Missoula, MT 59801 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,,,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,6,SICHUAN UNIV PRESS,CHENGDU,"29 WANGJIANGLU, JIUYANQIAO, CHENGDU, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5614-4376-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,185.0,201,,,,,,17,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BKP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268879300025,0

First, European social models are being asked to extend social support to meet new needs associated with the ageing society, changes in citizens' aspirations and behaviour and the reduced reliability of support from employers and the family. How nations respond to these new needs varies according to current gaps in provision and to political will, but most states up to the crisis were expanding their range of social interventions, sometimes leading to hybridization of their traditional social models. Second, deconstruction of social models to implement neoliberalism and reconstruction to meet new needs are often two sides of the same process. Reforms to meet new needs may take a neoliberal form, and neoliberal reforms may generate new needs. European social models may have to respond to these pressures for, unlike those of the USA, European citizens still look to the state to ensure their social citizenship rights.","Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Rubery, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Booth St W, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",Jill.Rubery@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,41,41,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Building on the now fixed system design we employ a simulation model to estimate the impacts of the scheme. Our results indicate that financial impacts are highly dependant on external settings, such as allowance prices and demand growth. We show that the financial burden on the aviation industry will be rather modest in the first years after the introduction of the system and therefore induce only low competition distortions. Likewise, emission reductions within air transportation will be comparably low. While aviation will induce a decline of emissions in other sectors, significant absolute reductions within air transportation can only be reached by a more restrictive system design.

Recent observations from empirical data in arterial networks showed that in some cases by aggregating the highly scattered plots of flow vs. density from individual loop detectors, the scatter almost disappears and well-defined macroscopic relations exist between space-mean network flow and network density. Despite these findings for the existence of well-defined relations with low scatter, these curves should not be universal. In this paper we investigate if well-defined macroscopic relations exist for freeway network systems, by analyzing real data from Minnesota's freeways. We show that freeway network systems not only have curves with high scatter, but they also exhibit hysteresis phenomena, where higher network flows are observed for the same average network density in the onset and lower in the offset of congestion. The mechanisms of traffic hysteresis phenomena at the network level are analyzed in this paper and they have dissimilarities to the causes of the hysteresis phenomena at the micro/meso level. The explanation of the phenomenon is dual. The first reason is that there are different spatial and temporal distributions of congestion for the same level of average density. Another reason is the synchronized occurrence of transitions from individual detectors during the offset of the peak period, with points remain beneath the equilibrium curve. Both the hysteresis phenomenon and its causes are consistently observed for different spatial aggregations of the network. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the first-, second-, and third-order stochastic dominance (FSD, SSD, TSD) are respectively linked to insatiability, risk-aversion and ruin-aversion within the framework of utility maximization. The paths that may be selected by travelers of different risk-taking preferences can be obtained from the corresponding SD-admissible paths, which can be generated using general dynamic programming. This paper also analyzes the relationship between the SD-based approach and other route choice models that consider risk-taking behavior. These route choice models employ a variety of reliability indexes, which often make the problem of finding optimal paths intractable. We show that the optimal paths with respect to these reliability indexes often belong to one of the three SD-admissible path sets. This finding offers not only an interpretation of risk-taking behavior consistent with the SD theory for these route choice models, but also a unified and computationally viable solution approach through SD-admissible path sets, which are usually small and can be generated without having to enumerate all paths. A generic label-correcting algorithm is proposed to generate FSD-, SSD-, and TSD-admissible paths, and numerical experiments are conducted to test the algorithm and to verify the analytical results.

In application, the model predicted migration with 60% accuracy in the first preference recovery measure.

Impact of mobile real-time information on the perceived and actual wait time of transit riders,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public transportation; Traveler information; Real-time information; Wait time,,"In order to attract more choice riders, transit service must not only have a high level of service in terms of frequency and travel time but also must be reliable. Although transit agencies continuously work to improve on-time performance, such efforts often come at a substantial cost. One inexpensive way to combat the perception of unreliability from the user perspective is real-time transit information. The OneBusAway transit traveler information system provides real-time next bus countdown information for riders of King County Metro via website, telephone, text-messaging, and smart phone applications. Although previous studies have looked at traveler response to real-time information, few have addressed real-time information via devices other than public display signs. For this study, researchers observed riders arriving at Seattle-area bus stops to measure their wait time while asking a series of questions, including how long they perceived that they had waited. The study found that for riders without real-time information, perceived wait time is greater than measured wait time. However, riders using real-time information do not perceive their wait time to be longer than their measured wait time. This is substantiated by the typical wait times that riders report. Real-time information users say that their average wait time is 7.5 min versus 9.9 min for those using traditional arrival information, a difference of about 30%. A model to predict the perceived wait time of bus riders was developed, with significant variables that include the measured wait time, an indicator variable for real-time information, an indicator variable for PM peak period, the bus frequency in buses per hour, and a self-reported typical aggravation level. The addition of real-time information decreases the perceived wait time by 0.7 min (about 13%). A critical finding of the study is that mobile real-time information reduces not only the perceived wait time, but also the actual wait time experienced by customers.

Criticality forms the basis of the traditional voting power measures frequently employed to analyse voting games; therefore understanding criticality is a pre-requisite to understanding any such analysis. The concept of criticality is extended to encompass games in which players are allowed to express multiple levels of approval. This seemingly innocuous extension raises some important questions, forcing us to re-evaluate exactly what it means to be critical. These issues have been largely side-stepped by the main body of research as they focus almost exclusively on 'yes/no' voting games, the so called single level approval voting games. The generalisation to multilevel approval voting games is much more than just a theoretical extension, as any single level approval game in which a player can abstain is in effect a multilevel approval voting game.",,,,sreejith.das@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2011,37.0,3,,,,,373.0,395,,10.1007/s00355-010-0488-z,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,811OJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294220700001,0

Researchers and trade unionists claimed that the Commission's embracing of the concept was a rhetorical manoeuvre rather than a genuine attempt to substantially revise the strategy. This article challenges these claims. Drawing on policy learning theory and discourse analysis, the Commission's policy recommendations prior to and past the introduction of Flexicurity are analysed. The main finding is that one of the policy components subsumed by the EES - modern social security systems - has undergone considerable revision. Moreover, the article argues that this revision possibly stems from a learning process. In relation to the literature on the open method of co-ordination (OMC), the study therefore adds that the OMC's learning effects should be assessed not only on the national level. The European institutions - in this case, the Commission - can also be subject to learning.","[Klindt, Mads Peter] Aalborg Univ, Ctr Labour Market Res CARMA, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Klindt, MP (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Ctr Labour Market Res CARMA, Fibigerstr 1, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark.",mpk@epa.aau.dk,"Klindt, Mads Peter Peter/AAX-2025-2021","Klindt, Mads Peter/0000-0003-1989-9477",,,,,46,10,12,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs suggests that an individual's preferences are not fixed but, rather, depend on purchasing power. A decrease in purchasing power with respect to low-hierarchy goods (e.g., bread) is likely to augment an individual's preferences for such goods and to weaken preferences for high-hierarchy goods (e.g., books). By introducing a simple purchasing-power-dependent utility function that satisfies the standard assumptions, it is shown that the preference-shifting effect can provoke Giffen behaviour.","UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Okon, Helmholtz Zentrum Umweltforsch, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Heuson, C (通讯作者)，UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Okon, Helmholtz Zentrum Umweltforsch, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",clemens.heuson@ufz.de,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,12,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Pro-competitive forces, resulting from lower tariffs on final goods, as well as access to better inputs, due to lower input tariffs, both appear to have increased firm-level productivity, with input tariffs having a larger impact. The effect was strongest in import-competing industries and industries not subject to excessive domestic regulation. While we find no evidence of a differential impact according to state-level characteristics, we observe complementarities between trade liberalization and additional industrial policy reforms.","[Khandelwal, Amit] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Khandelwal, Amit] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,,,,,,,,,56,508,581,5,104,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This study examines tourist arrivals in Vietnam compared with Thailand and China from 1995 to 2007. Shift-share analysis is used to test whether the emerging Vietnam marker is impacting on the growth of the Thai or China markets. The findings indicate that shift-share analysis is a useful management tool when applied to measuring the competitive effect between rival markets. This analysis shows that Vietnam is increasingly specialized in attracting tourists from the Americas, Australasia and Europe, and that it has a competitive advantage over Thailand. It is also interesting to note that, since 1995, Vietnam increasingly has been losing ground in attracting more tourists from neighbouring Asian countries.","[Vu, Jo; Turner, Lindsay] Victoria Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia",Victoria University,"Turner, L (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, POB 14428 MC, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",jo.vu@vu.edu.au; lindsay.turner@vu.edu.au,,,,,,,8,6,7,0,16,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In order to best capture the competitive environment, which is critical to the potential role that analysts play, we limit our sample of firms to 161 real estate investment trusts (REITs) issuing debt or equity between 1996 and 2004. Using the estimation technique of Ljungqvist et al. (Journal of Finance 61:301-340 2006), which accounts for the endogeneity of analyst behavior and the coverage self-selection decision, we find that target prices that are optimistic relative to competitors' target prices, significantly increase an underwriter's probability of attracting underwriting business. This result holds for both equity and debt issues with fees greater than one million dollars. We also find evidence consistent with the notion that increased regulatory scrutiny of conflicts of interest between analysts and investment banks has decreased the impact of analyst behavior on underwriter choice.","[Boudry, Walter I.] NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10013 USA; [Kallberg, Jarl G.] Thunderbird Sch Global Management, Glendale, AZ 85306 USA; [Liu, Crocker H.] Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",New York University; Cornell University,"Boudry, WI (通讯作者)，NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, 44 W 4TH St,Suite 9-190, New York, NY 10013 USA.",wboudry@stern.nyu.edu; jarl.kallberg@thunderbird.edu; chl62@cornell.edu,,,,,,,42,8,10,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Cuts in state government fiscal assistance to their local governments, plus shrinking property tax bases are challenging the ability of local governments to continue their current levels of public services. In this paper, we use data on the financing of the nation's largest central cities from 1997 to 2008 to forecast the impact of the recession and the housing crisis on central city expenditures between 2009 and 2013. Because expenditure responsibilities vary among city governments and because overlying governments play different roles, we develop the concept of constructed governments in order to allow us to compare the revenue-raising and spending policies of large central cities. We predict that real per capita spending in the average central city will be reduced by about seven percent during the forecast period, and that spending cuts will be substantially greater in cities hit hardest by the economic recession and the housing market collapse.

Working with the complementary frameworks of Edwards et al. (2006) and Kloosterman et al. (1999), we assess the effects on the internal dynamics of EMB firms of a move into the LPO supply chain. Drawing on case study evidence from three sectors - business services, information and communication technology (ICT) and food manufacture - we focus on the experiences of workers, who have been neglected in extant debates. We find that move to supply LPOs is extremely challenging for EMBs. Although workers express satisfaction with working relationships, the power of LPOs contributes to a tightening of control over practices like recruitment, work organization and work hours.","[Ram, Monder; Woldesenbet, Kassa; Jones, Trevor] De Montfort Univ, Leicester Business Sch, CREME, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England",De Montfort University,"Jones, T (通讯作者)，De Montfort Univ, Leicester Business Sch, CREME, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England.",mram@dmu.ac.uk,,"Woldesenbet Beta, Kassa/0000-0001-8144-2254; Ram, Monder/0000-0003-1901-6654",,,,,35,21,24,2,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

One of the few surveys which has elicited such expectations is the Survey of Economic Expectations in 1999-2001. Using the data from this survey, Dominitz and Manski find considerable heterogeneity across respondents that cannot be explained by simple models of expectations formation. Adapting a principle of dual reasoning borrowed from Kahneman, this paper classifies respondents according to their sensitivity to some pathologies. We find a substantial amount of unobserved heterogeneity between the least and the most sensitive respondents. We then sketch a model of expectations formation.

This paper takes the first step in applying computable general equilibrium (CGE) modelling to forecasting the economic contribution of tourism generated by the Beijing Olympics. CGE modelling has been widely applied to different tourism issues in many countries. In China, it has been used in fields such as taxation and international trade. However, economic impact studies on China's tourism using CGE modelling have not been found. The paper includes two types of estimations: ex ante and ex post. The ex ante estimation was conducted before the Beijing Olympics and thus predicted the impact of international tourism based on historical data, such as previous literature and historical statistics. The ex post estimation was conducted several months after the Beijing Olympics and the estimation was based on up-to-date statistics published by the China National Tourism Administration. The economic impact generated from the two types of estimations is compared. It was found that, while the economic impact of international tourism was predicted to be positive in the ex ante estimation, this impact was analysed as negative in the ex post estimation.","[Li, ShiNa] Leeds Metropolitan Univ, UK Ctr Events Management, Leeds LS1 3HE, W Yorkshire, England; [Blake, Adam] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Serv Management, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Cooper, Chris] Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Business, Oxford OX3 0BP, England",Leeds Beckett University; Bournemouth University; Oxford Brookes University,"Li, SN (通讯作者)，Leeds Metropolitan Univ, UK Ctr Events Management, Leeds LS1 3HE, W Yorkshire, England.",S.Li@leedsmet.ac.uk,,"Blake, Adam/0000-0002-9300-5913",,,,,35,62,65,2,48,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We divide Japanese national exports into 41 prefectural subregions with over 7,000 product categories and construct subregional export margins for the years between 1988 and 2005. First, we find strong evidence of regional heterogeneity in terms of export product coverage, and the export variety of most regions expands in our sample period. Second, we find that the extensive margin accounts for over 60 per cent of the increase in exports of larger subregions, similar to the findings in the international cross-country study.

These policies have positive impacts leading to mobility patterns which are socially and environmentally more desirable, but they also have negative impacts. One negative impact is to be found in regional accessibility, due to the increase in generalized transport costs. This study presents a methodology based on accessibility indicators and GIS to assess the accessibility impacts of a road pricing policy. The methodology was tested for the Spain's road network considering two road pricing scenarios. It enables not only the more penalized regions to be identified but also negative road pricing spillover effects between regions. These effects are measured in terms of accessibility changes occurring in one region produced by charges implemented in another region. Finally, the study of accessibility disparities (by calculating inequality indexes for each of the scenarios considered), provides policymakers with useful information regarding the impact of road pricing policies from the point of view of territorial cohesion.

The other is mutation: any behavior has at any point in time a strictly positive, very small probability of shifting to an arbitrary behavior. We show that behavior observed frequently is in accordance with evolutionary equilibrium, a static equilibrium concept suggested in the literature.

Individual utilities must be additive. The social welfare function must be a linear combination of these utilities. Social preferences are stationary only if, in addition, all individuals have the same constant discount rate. The results are implemented in two frameworks: deterministic dynamic choice and dynamic choice under uncertainty. The applications highlight that the conditions are unlikely to be met by individual preferences, and that they severely restrict social preferences.","[Zuber, Stephane] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Zuber, Stephane] Catholic Univ Louvain, Chair Lhoist Berghmans Environm Econ, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Zuber, S (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",Stephane.Zuber@uclouvain.be,"Zuber, Stephane/D-3424-2014","Zuber, Stephane/0000-0002-4111-2397",,,,,29,26,28,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2011,70.0,3,,,,,367.0,384,,10.1007/s11238-010-9225-4,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,719IX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287199500004,0

We argue that the crisis itself and its escalating nature are very likely to be the result of: (i) steady deterioration of Greek macroeconomic fundamentals over 2001-09 to levels inconsistent with long-term EMU participation; and (ii) a double shift in markets' expectations, from a regime of credible commitment to future EMU participation under an implicit EMU/German guarantee of Greek fiscal liabilities, to a regime of non-credible EMU commitment without fiscal guarantees, respectively occurring in November 2009 and February/March 2010.

Using data from Athens, Greece, we explicitly correct for higher-order serial correlation in the error terms and investigate two, largely overlooked, questions in the transit literature: first, whether a varying fare structure in a multimodal transit system affects demand and, second, what the determinants of ticket versus travelcard sales may be. Model estimation results suggest that the effect of fare type on ridership levels in a multimodal system varies by mode and by relative ticket to travelcard prices. Further, regardless of competition or cooperation between modes, fare increases will have limited effects on ridership, but the magnitude of these effects does depend on the relative ticket to travelcard prices. Finally, incorrectly assuming serial independence for the error terms during model estimation could yield upward or downward biased parameters and hence result in incorrect inferences and policy recommendations.

Our results remain robust to a variety of specifications, including ones that address endogeneity. The estimated magnitudes imply that venture capital stimulates the creation of more firms than it funds, which appears consistent with two mechanisms: First, would-be entrepreneurs anticipating financing needs more likely start firms when the supply of capital expands. Second, funded companies may transfer know-how to their employees, thereby enabling spin-offs, and may encourage others to become entrepreneurs through demonstration effects.","[Samila, Sampsa] Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Sorenson, Olav] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Brock University; Yale University,"Samila, S (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",,"Sorenson, Olav/ABE-5373-2020; Samila, Sampsa/P-3201-2015","Sorenson, Olav/0000-0002-0599-6738; Samila, Sampsa/0000-0001-7769-3747",,,,,29,254,304,7,113,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

A new series of consumption-based poverty measures spanning 50 years, including a 15-year period after economic reforms began in earnest in the early 1990s, is used to examine that issue. Growth has tended to reduce poverty, including in the postreform period. There is no robust evidence of more or less poverty responsiveness to growth since the reforms began, although there are signs of rising inequality. The impact of growth is higher when using poverty measures that reflect distribution below the poverty line and when using growth rates calculated from household surveys rather than national accounts. The urban-rural pattern of growth matters for the pace of poverty reduction. However, in marked contrast to the period before the reforms, urban economic growth in the period after the reforms has brought significant gains to the rural poor as well as the urban poor.","[Ravallion, Martin] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Datt, Gaurav] World Bank, Econ Policy & Poverty Sector, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank; The World Bank,"Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gdatt@worldbank.org; mravallion@worldbank.org,,"Datt, Gaurav/0000-0002-7672-7527",,,,,60,33,39,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

This paper studies the role of new exporting entrepreneurs - defined as firms that became exporters - in determining export growth in a fast growing and export oriented middle-income country i.e., Costa Rica during 1997-2007. It provides a detailed description of the contribution of export entrepreneurs in the short and long run, and comparing the observed patterns with an emerging literature on the role of the extensive margin in international trade. On a year-by-year basis, the rate of firm turnover into and out of exporting is high, but exit rates decline rapidly with age (i.e., the number of years the firm has been exporting). On average, about 30 percent of firms in each year tend to exit export activities, and a similar percentage of firms enter. The exiting and entering firms tend to be significantly smaller than incumbent firms in terms of export value (e. g., entrants export about 30 percent less on average than incumbent firms). These findings are consistent with existing evidence for other middle income Latin American countries. However, in the long run new product-firm combinations (i.e., product-firm combinations not present in 1997) account for almost 60 percent of the value of exports in 2007. Surviving new exporters actively adopted new products (for the firm, but not necessarily new for the country) and abandoned weaker existing products they start with, and their export growth rates were very high during a period (1999-2005) when those of incumbent exporting firms were actually negative.

Originating in Asia, banana and plantain spread across Africa many centuries ago. Increased global movement of plants in the past 150 years introduced pests and diseases from other regions that became new constraints to banana production in Africa. These biotic challenges to banana production include fungi, bacteria, viruses, nematodes and insects. Most banana and plantain in Africa are grown under low levels of crop management in which water is a primary limitation in most rain-fed cropping systems. There is wide scope for improving banana through introgression of host-plant resistance to both biotic and abiotic challenges. Given the slow and land-intensive nature of Musa breeding, there is tremendous potential to accelerate the process through marker-assisted breeding (MAB). Since banana has been relatively neglected in terms of development of molecular tools, we have been adding some basic tools for mapping and germplasm characterisation. In the past 2 years, we have characterised over 400 new EST-based SSR markers, half of which should be mapped this year. An EST sequencing project was complemented by bioinformatics processing for SNP detection and a new tool for visualisation. Characterisation of SNPs in candidate genes is in progress. The imminent advent of a reference genome sequence for Musa should accelerate the progress of MAB, expanding the number of available loci for marker development and increasing focus on mapping traits and characterising diversity. Future maps will benefit from higher marker density, high speed assays and lower costs per data point, especially if we are able to realise greater cost efficiencies through international collaborative efforts.","[Lorenzen, J.; Hearne, S.; Mbanjo, G.; Nyine, M.] Int Inst Trop Agr, Ibadan, Nigeria",CGIAR; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA),"Lorenzen, J (通讯作者)，Int Inst Trop Agr, Oyo Rd PMB 5320, Ibadan, Nigeria.",,,"Hearne, Sarah/0000-0003-2015-2450",,,,,34,5,6,0,11,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,231.0,236,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200025,0

Although governance approaches carry the promise of a sophisticated, empirically grounded picture of CSDP, they have been criticized for their lack of attention to power. This is because governance approaches focus on institutional rules and ideas rather than the social structure that underpins them. To refine the notion of security governance, this article analyses co-operation patterns through social network analysis. Confirming the governance image, it maps out a complex constellation of CSDP actors that features cross-border and cross-level ties between different national and EU policy actors. It is also found, however, that CSDP is dominated by a handful of traditional state actors - in particular, Brussels-based national ambassadors - who retain strategic positions vis-a-vis weaker supranational and non-state actors. These actors are not giving up on state power, but reconstituting it at the supranational level.","[Merand, Frederic] Univ Montreal, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Irondelle, Bastien] Univ Oxford CERI Sci Po, St Anthonys Coll, Paris, France",Universite de Montreal,"Mérand, F (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Polit Sci, CP 6128 Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",frederic.merand@umontreal.ca,,,,,,,54,67,76,0,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

During the 1930s Viner was an outspoken supporter of international monetary cooperation, set up to secure exchange rates stability, which he regarded as a paramount factor in restoring business confidence and fostering recovery. As a close assistant to Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr, Viner was able to exert a positive influence on the administration's foreign economic policy, from the Gold Stabilization Act of 1934 to the Tripartite Agreement of 1936. Although not directly involved in the Bretton Woods Conference, he played a role in preparing the ground for the establishment of multilateral agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

The first part of the paper presents the sources and the dataset that was created to estimate income inequality using grain tithes. The second section shows that through the period grain represented the lion share of total income and therefore that it can be used as a reliable proxy. The following part of the paper introduces an analysis of income inequality in the province during the period 1690-1800 and concludes that inequality decreased during the last third of the eighteenth century. Finally the paper addresses this unexpected result and concludes that it was consequence of the success of the land reform carried out by the central government in the late 1760s. The reform was a success in Guadalajara, thanks to the characteristics of its population and the lack of bargaining power of pressure groups. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

It leads to significant decline in yield and fruit quality due to reduction of photosynthetic sites in the functional leaves. Several fungicides, such as benomyl, tridemorph, mancozeb and propiconazole, were evaluated for their potential to control the disease in 'Pisang Berangan'. Propiconazole was effective in reducing the disease, with treated plants having an average of 15.6 functional leaves as compared to 8.0 functional leaves in untreated plants at 4 months after treatment. Spraying propiconazole alone, or alternating with benomyl or mancozeb at monthly intervals, resulted in an increase in bunch weight from 15.7 kg per bunch for untreated plants to 21.3 kg following treatment with one or more fungicides. Spraying benomyl alone also improved the bunch weight to 18.4 kg. Generally, effective black leaf streak control with the above fungicides resulted in yield improvements of about 17.2-36.0% and increases in incomes of 23.6-46.6%.","[Then, K.

The results obtained suggest that a common currency strengthens economic growth by promoting not only international trade but also tourism.","[Santana-Gallego, Maria; Ledesma-Rodriguez, Francisco J.] Univ La Laguna, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain; [Perez-Rodriguez, Jorge V.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Cortes-Jimenez, Isabel] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Universidad de la Laguna; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of Nottingham,"Santana-Gallego, M (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain.",,"Santana, Maria/H-9163-2015; Perez-Rodriguez, Jorge V./Q-4827-2019","Santana, Maria/0000-0001-5977-7875; Perez-Rodriguez, Jorge V./0000-0002-6738-9191; Ledesma-Rodriguez, Francisco Jose/0000-0002-9080-2335",,,,,34,39,43,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2010,33.0,12,,,,,1811.0,1835,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01305.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,700SN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285764700007,0

We use unique data for a sample of active-duty Army personnel that allow us to first, link personnel to the local communities in which they are located and second, to avoid any selectivity bias associated with endogenous community selection. We find at best mixed evidence that racial hostility is related to economic vulnerability within a community and no evidence that racial conflict can be linked to the level of public expenditure. Crime rates, however, are closely related to the incidence of threatening racial encounters and while a community's demographic profile is also clearly linked to racial tension, these relationships cannot be easily generalized across minority groups or type of threatening racial encounter.

A simple theoretical framework shows the impact of networks on migration incentives at different education levels and how this affects the composition of migrant skills. Empirically, we find positive or education-neutral selection in communities with weak migrant networks but negative self-selection in communities with stronger networks. This is consistent with high migration costs driving positive or intermediate self-selection, as advocated by Chiquiar and Hanson (2005), and with negative self-selection being driven by lower returns to education in the United States than in Mexico, as advocated by Borjas (1987).","[McKenzie, David] World Bank, Washington, DC USA; [McKenzie, David; Rapoport, Hillel] CReAM, London, England; [McKenzie, David] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Rapoport, Hillel] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Rapoport, Hillel] Univ Lille, EQUIPPE, Lille, France; [Rapoport, Hillel] CEPREMAP, Paris, France",The World Bank; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Bar Ilan University; Universite de Lille,"McKenzie, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC USA.",,,,,,,,35,293,350,1,40,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This paper provides an empirical study on the long-term dynamic interrelation between stock and housing markets in a small open economy with special attention to the effect of foreign investors on the dynamics. The empirical findings, based on a quarterly dataset from Finland over 1970-2006, do not support the hypothesis of diminished co-movement between Finnish stock and housing markets after the abolishment of the foreign ownership restrictions of stocks in 1993. The markets still appear to be tightly interdependent in the long run. Nevertheless, the results suggest that the substantial growth in the foreign ownership of Finnish stocks induced a large and long-lasting deviation from the cointegrating long-run relation between stock and housing prices. The results also imply that diversification between stock and housing markets works the worse the longer the investment horizon is.","Turku Sch Econ & Business Adm, FI-20500 Turku, Finland",University of Turku,"Oikarinen, E (通讯作者)，Turku Sch Econ & Business Adm, Rehtorinpellonkatu 3, FI-20500 Turku, Finland.",elias.oikarinen@tse.fi,,"Oikarinen, Elias/0000-0003-4988-9130",,,,,34,13,13,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The paper studies first the main developments in Turkey's trade regime and trade performance. Next it discusses Turkish trade policy under the headings of measures affecting imports, exports and foreign direct investment. The paper notes that the formation of the 1995 EU-Turkey customs union has contributed to a significant increase in the contestability of domestic markets through infusing predictability, transparency and stability to trade policy as well as by liberalising market access. But free trade in industrial goods between Turkey and the EU could still not be established mainly because of non-tariff barriers and in particular because of the various problems faced in the elimination of technical barriers to trade (TBT). The final section of the paper discusses first the role of standards and conformity assessment in general terms and thereafter evaluates critically the Turkish approach to elimination of TBTs.","Bilkent Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Togan, S (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Ankara, Turkey.",,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,20,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2010,33.0,11,,,,,1339.0,1389,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.1254.x,0.0,,,51,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,685GB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284616100001,0

Using real monthly per capita household consumption expenditure as our measure of welfare, we estimate quantile regressions to analyze the urban-rural welfare gap across the entire welfare distribution. While the urban-rural welfare gap was fairly convex across the welfare distribution in 1993-1994, it became more concave in 2004, with the gap narrowing for the lowest and highest quintiles and widening for the middle three quintiles. The urban-rural gap in returns to all levels of education widened substantially for the bottom four quintiles but became increasingly negative for the top quintile. Applying the Machado and Mata (J Appl Econom 20:445-465, 2005) decomposition technique to decompose the urban-rural welfare gap at each percentile, we find that for the bottom 40% of the distribution, differences in the distribution of covariates became less important while differences in the distribution of returns to covariates became more important in explaining the gap. The opposite was true for the top 40% of the distribution. Our analysis suggests that while the rural poor appear to be catching up with their urban counterparts in terms of labor market characteristics, ten years of economic reforms have intensified the urban-rural gap in returns to these characteristics. On the other hand, the rural rich lag even further behind the urban rich with respect to their labor market characteristics even though the urban-rural gap in the returns to these characteristics has diminished during the reform period. Future efforts to generate urban-rural equality may require policies that seek to equalize returns to labor market characteristics between the two sectors at the lower half of the distribution and improve rural labor market characteristics at the top half of the distribution.","Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Chamarbagwala, R (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Wylie Hall,Room 105,100 S Woodlawn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",rchamarb@indiana.edu,,,,,,,23,13,17,2,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The latter result together with transitivity of blocking leads to an elementary proof of the so-called stable median matching theorem, showing how the often incompatible concepts of stability (represented by the political economist Adam Smith) and fairness (represented by the political philosopher John Rawls) can be reconciled for roommate problems.

This framework offers policy makers an assessment platform that focuses on the short- and long-term system behaviors arising from an area-wide congestion pricing policy along with other congestion mitigation policies. Since only a few cities in the world have implemented congestion pricing and several are about to do so, a framework that helps policy makers to understand the impacts of congestion pricing is currently quite relevant. Within this framework, improved bus and metro capacities contribute to the supply dynamics which in turn affect the travel demand of individuals and their choice of different transportation modes. Work travel and social networking activities are assumed to generate additional travel demand dynamics that are affected by travelers perception of the level of service of the different transportation modes, their perception of the congestion level, and the associated traveling costs. It is assumed that the, population, tourism and employment growth are exogenous factors that affect demand. Furthermore, this paper builds on a previously formulated approach where fuzzy logic concepts are used to represent linguistic variables assumed to describe consumer perceptions about transportation conditions.

Monocyclic games, such as Rock-Paper-Scissors, have only mixed equilibria, some of which are stable in the sense that sequential best replies lead to them; yet, even these games are prone to stable cycles under discrete-time simultaneous best replies, giving an unusual equilibrium-selection problem. This article analyzes such games in a random-utility setting where changing strategies is costly, and the speed of the dynamic is, thus, endogenous. The stochastically stable outcome is determined by the cost of switching strategies; when switching costs are high, mixed equilibria are selected, whereas when switching costs are low, cycles are selected.","Univ Oxford, Magdalen Coll, Oxford OX1 4AU, England",University of Oxford,"Norman, TWL (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Magdalen Coll, Oxford OX1 4AU, England.",thomas.norman@magd.ox.ac.uk,"Norman, Thomas/K-6634-2019","Norman, Thomas/0000-0002-4773-4285",,,,,36,2,4,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2010,69.0,2,,,,,167.0,182,,10.1007/s11238-009-9190-y,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,628BY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280090600001,0

An economic model is provided that considers lease rates and occupancy in simultaneous equilibrium. The behavior of both is predicted to be influenced by efficient design attributes. Selling price is determined by both rents and occupancy; therefore the impact of efficient design on commercial sales activity should be distributed through the leasing market. The model is tested empirically using a national sample of sales and leasing data for class A office buildings. The evidence indicates that green buildings achieve superior rents and sustain significantly higher occupancy. The improved performance in the rental market is reflected in a significant premium for the selling price of Energy Star-labeled and LEED-certified properties.,"[Wiley, Jonathan A.; Benefield, Justin D.] Coll Charleston, Charleston, SC 29401 USA; [Johnson, Ken H.] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA",College of Charleston; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Wiley, JA (通讯作者)，Coll Charleston, 5 Liberty St,4th Floor, Charleston, SC 29401 USA.",wileyj@cofc.edu,,,,,,,23,189,215,3,65,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Using disaggregated data on sales by US MNEs' foreign affiliates in 43 developed and developing countries over the 1982-94 period, results show that the provision of fiscal incentives or the deregulation of the labour market would exert a positive impact on total FDI. Given the drawbacks frequently associated with the use of incentive packages, economy-wide policies which ease firing procedures and reduce severance payments would certainly be the best policy option. This paper also highlights the different aggregation and omitted variable biases that have affected results of previous studies and provides some support to recent theoretical models of FDI by showing that third-country effects and spatial interdependence influence respectively the location of export-platform FDI and vertical FDI.","[Azemar, Celine] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Desbordes, Rodolphe] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow; University of Strathclyde,"Azémar, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,"Desbordes, Rodolphe/0000-0002-9190-7331; Azemar, Celine/0000-0002-0560-8934",,,,,87,21,21,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2010,33.0,7,,,,,928.0,957,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01226.x,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,624SY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279842500005,0

Consumers now have a new source of information about hotel quality: information providers on the Internet. The key issue is the degree of reliability of this information. Two types of Internet information providers can be distinguished: those that also sell the assessed services ('sale Websites') and those that do not sell services ('advice Websites'). The former obtain their income via fees, while the latter obtain theirs via advertising (number of hits). It is argued that the information on advice Websites is more reliable than that on sale Websites because the latter suffer from a misalignment of incentives arising from the inverse relationship between income/reward and the quality of the report. Our results show that sale Websites (fee financed) provide an assessment of the quality of their hotels which is on average 7% higher than the equivalent assessment of advice Websites (advertising financed). This difference increases significantly with the hotel category, with up to a 9% increase for five-star hotels. It is also shown that there are systematic differences in the quality appraisal between these two types of information providers. The main implications for tourists and hotel managers are outlined.","[Fernandez-Barcala, Marta; Gonzalez-Diaz, Manuel; Prieto-Rodriguez, Juan] Univ Oviedo, Fac Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Fernández-Barcala, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Fac Econ, Campus Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain.",mbarcala@uniovi.es; mgdiaz@uniovi.es; juanprieto@uniovi.es,"Prieto-Rodriguez, Juan/C-7766-2013; Fernández-Barcala, Marta/ABG-6989-2020; Gonzalez-Diaz, Manuel/K-5986-2017","Prieto-Rodriguez, Juan/0000-0001-9163-3011; Fernández-Barcala, Marta/0000-0001-9238-7633; Gonzalez-Diaz, Manuel/0000-0001-9926-1574",,,,,41,26,27,0,27,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Using matching on detailed information on labour market history and personal characteristics we find positive average effects of having a replacement contract. Our second focus is on whether the duration of the contract matters. We use data on replacement contracts with information on the ex ante duration of the contract which is determined by the individual on leave and find no significant effect on the subsequent unemployment risk of the replacement worker. However, the longer the replacement contract the higher is the probability of having an open ended contract at the same site 2-2.5 years after the start of the contract. Overall, the results suggest that replacement contracts may reduce the risk of future unemployment, but that longer contracts only improve the position within the workplace and not necessarily on the labour market in general.","[Liljeberg, Linus; Skans, Oskar Nordstrom] Inst Labour Market Policy Evaluat, Uppsala, Sweden; [Hartman, Laura] Swedish Agcy Publ Management, Stockholm, Sweden; [Skans, Oskar Nordstrom] IZA, Bonn, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Skans, ON (通讯作者)，Inst Labour Market Policy Evaluat, Uppsala, Sweden.",laura.hartman@statskontoret.se; linus.liljeberg@ifau.uu.se; oskar.nordstrom_skans@ifau.uu.se,,,,,,,27,12,12,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Our proposed recursive-weight density combination strategy, based on the recursive logarithmic score of the forecast densities, produces well-calibrated predictive densities for US real-time data by giving substantial weight to models that allow for structural breaks.

Both specifications are estimated by weighted maximum likelihood on a cross-section of US households drawn from the 2004 SCF.

An economic model predicts that higher wage rates (price of time) will lead to substitution of grazing for primary eating/drinking, especially by raising the number of,grazing intervals relative to meals. This prediction is confirmed in these data. Eating meals more frequently is associated with lower BMI and better self-reported health, as is grazing more frequently. Food purchases are positively related to time spent eating-substitution of goods for time is difficult-but are lower when eating time is spread over more meals. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, individuals' privacy and liberty often conflict with efforts towards safety and security, making it difficult to assess the implications of security measures balanced against the costs (e.g., citizens may be stopped, searched and asked to provide personal identification data to authorities without any particular reason). Henceforth, our research question asks, to what extent would people sacrifice their right to privacy and liberty in exchange for potentially safer and more secure travel? This paper uses a stated choice experiment to quantify individuals' trade-offs between privacy and security within a real-life context, namely rail travel in the UK. Using a nationwide sample, the empirical analysis yields the importance of improvements in the security infrastructure and identifies areas of concern with regard to privacy and liberty controlling for travel related factors. Further, trade-offs across different security measures for rail travel are quantified in terms of individuals' willingness-to-pay extra on top of the average ticket price. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this book was to understand the two great transitions that have occurred in human society. The first, the agricultural revolution, resulted in a transition from hunter-gather society to what NWW call limited access society. This first transition occurred at various times and places, but generally about 10,000 years before the present. The second revolution, the social/industrial/technological revolution, from limited access to what NWW call open access, occurred initially in a few societies, particularly Britain and the United States, within a fairly brief period between 1600 and 1860. Currently, all the West European economies, as well the Western offshoots (the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) and Japan have crossed the economic threshold of $20,000/capita. However, inequality across the set of all political economies is extreme, and likely to increase. The paper attempts to complement the institutional analysis of NWW, deploying some theoretical ideas from social choice theory, game theory, and economics (particularly the role of factors of production, land, capital and labor). Emphasis is placed on the variation of risk preference between autocrats and other factor groups. The discussion also alludes to the notion of structural stability of dynamical social systems, and the possibility of chaos. It is argued that all the limited access societies face a Malthusian constraint, generated by the pressure of population on land. In such societies, particularly in Africa in the present day, this quandary over land is likely to lead to the exercise of power by risk preferring autocrats who will restrain any move to open access democracy.","Washington Univ, Ctr Polit Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Washington University (WUSTL),"Schofield, N (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Ctr Polit Econ, Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",schofield.norman@gmail.com,,,,,,,100,4,4,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2010,34.0,3,,,,,503.0,536,,10.1007/s00355-009-0407-3,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,553SQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274387500012,0

These models are direct models of daily asset return volatility based on realised measures constructed from high-frequency data. Our analysis identifies that the models have momentum and mean reversion effects, and that they adjust quickly to structural breaks in the level of the volatility process. We study how to estimate the models and how they perform through the credit crunch, comparing their fit to more traditional GARCH models. We analyse a model-based bootstrap which allows us to estimate the entire predictive distribution of returns. We also provide an analysis of missing data in the context of these models.

Access to international capital markets is crucial for a country's ability to meet its financial needs and to keep up with the challenges of a changing global landscape. In this paper, financial competitiveness is interpreted as the attractiveness of a country as perceived by foreign investors, which is reflected in refinancing costs in international capital markets. The study, concentrates on foreign direct investment (FDI), which is an essential feature of the globalisation process and has immediate implications for the real economy. An index of international financial competitiveness is calculated which is given by the ratio of the market value to the book value of inward FDI stocks. For a panel of five advanced economies from 1980 to 2006 it is shown that price competitiveness, stable inflation rates and registered patents have a positive impact on the index. Institutional factors like EMU membership or Anglo-American legislation also play a role. Financial competitiveness in turn encourages FDI inflows whereas it benefits fixed investment relative to M&A. There is also some evidence that an innovative environment accelerates investment decisions by promoting competition among investors.","Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Jochem, A (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",axel.jochem@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,41,1,1,0,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

To ensure product safety and consumer protection, regulators in leading markets have applied domestic rules extraterritorially and have joined forces to harmonize rules through transgovernmental cooperation. Yet whereas the United States has long been the dominant player in international market regulation of pharmaceuticals, the European Union has decisively shaped global rules for cosmetics. What explains differences in agenda setting power across the two closely-related industries? We compare and contrast the expectations of a realist account focused on market size and a liberal functionalist argument centered on the role of market friction with a historical institutionalist explanation stressing the relative sequential development over time of domestic regulatory capacity in leading markets. The empirical evidence shows that domestic regulatory institutions systematically shape international market regulation. Historical institutionalism provides an important complement to existing transgovernmental research, offering clear expectations for the origins of and terms of influence within such cooperation. More generally, it opens up a rich toolbox for the analysis of industry-level global market governance, which affects the daily lives of many millions of consumers.","[Bach, David] IE Business Sch, Sch Ctr Nonmarket Strategy, Madrid, Spain; [Newman, Abraham L.] Georgetown Univ, Edmund Walsh Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC USA",IE University; Georgetown University,"Bach, D (通讯作者)，IE Business Sch, Sch Ctr Nonmarket Strategy, Madrid, Spain.",,,,,,,,63,37,39,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The selective effectiveness of United States trade capacity building assistance,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Trade; aid; development; capacity; growth,PROPER ECONOMETRIC SPECIFICATION; GRAVITY EQUATION; AID; GROWTH; POLICIES,"Pundits and scholars have long debated the effectiveness of foreign aid: does it lead to economic growth or is it simply throwing money 'down the rat hole'? This paper re-invigorates the debate by examining the question through a new lens. Rather than examining the effectiveness of general foreign aid on economic growth, this paper tests the impact of targeted foreign aid on a narrower economic activity. Specifically, this paper investigates the impact of United States trade capacity building aid. This targeted aid aims to increase recipient countries' exporting capacity, which may lead to growth, rather than directly increasing growth. If trade capacity building assistance is universally effective, one would expect to see increases in recipient-country exports to both the US and the rest of the world. If trade capacity building is selectively effective, recipient-country exports should increase only to the US. If trade capacity building is ineffective, one would expect no impact on recipient-country exports. This paper finds substantial support that US trade capacity building is selectively effective. US trade capacity building tends to increase recipient-country exports to the United States, but not to the rest of the world. Although the US results may not be generalizable to other donors, this approach suggests an easily expandable research program.","Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Brazys, S (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,"Brazys, Samuel/0000-0002-4482-4234",,,,,65,8,10,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

A randomized experiment in Ghana tested whether the identity of the respondent and the inclusion of product-specific cues in questions affect reported rates of use of financial services. Rates of household use are almost identical whether the head reports on behalf of the household or whether the rate is tabulated from a full enumeration of household members. A less complete summary of household use of financial services results when randomly selected informants (nonheads of household) provide the information.

This study takes advantage of a unique data set from Senegal that combines test score data for children from the second grade with information on their subsequent school progression from a follow-up survey conducted seven years later. Measures of skills from early primary school, corrected for measurement error using multiple test observations per child, are strongly positively associated with later school progression. A plausible interpretation is that parents invest more in a child's education when the returns to doing so are higher. The results point to the need for remedial policies to target lagging students early on to reduce early dropout. Grade repetition policies target poorly performing students and are pervasive in Francophone Africa. Using variation across schools in test score thresholds for promotion to identify the effects of second-grade repetition, the analysis shows that repeating students are more likely to leave school before completing primary school than students with similar ability who are not held back, pointing to the need for alternative measures to improve the skills of lagging children.","[Glick, Peter] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA; [Sahn, David E.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",RAND Corporation; Cornell University,"Glick, P (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA.",pglick@rand.org; david.sahn@cornell.edu,,,,,,,34,48,61,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

For some, Hollywood is an example of flexible production with win-win outcomes for all. For others, the major studios have entrenched their global power at the expense of others. This paper presents a different take on Hollywood which builds on the observations of stock market analysts about the absence of adequate corporate profits, set in the context of financialisation and its discontents. In Hollywood, the 'search for synergy' motivates a strategy of perpetual restructuring, where results will usually disappoint. The lack of profit is explained as due to the uncontrollable pay demands of key 'creatives', the mature market for film, and the mismatch between price and cost in the industry. The implication of this different take is that the absence of corporate profit is chronic and inherent in the business model, so that Hollywood is both a graveyard for corporate business which searches for but does not find profits, and a field of opportunity for a small number of strategically positioned individuals - stars and directors - who become seriously rich.","[Leaver, Adam] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Innovat Management & Policy Div, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Leaver, A (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Innovat Management & Policy Div, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,,"Leaver, Adam/0000-0001-6199-6057",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H010769/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H010769/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,74,7,7,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The minimum wage policy has a twofold influence on the relative attractiveness of the home country, simultaneously affecting its relative cost competitiveness and its aggregate income. The end effect depends on interactions between the skilled and unskilled segments of the labor market. If workers are strongly substitutable, the effect of raising low-skilled workers income is more than compensated by a drop in their employment level. Under such circumstances, a high minimum wage policy reduces the country's attractiveness by increasing production costs and reducing aggregate demand. Aggregate demand is further reduced once adjustments in skilled wages linked to international competitive pressures are taken into account. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In all but of handful of (primarily Western European) countries, obesity is much more prevalent among women than men. We examine several potential explanations for this phenomenon. We analyze differences between men and women in reports and effects of potential underlying causes of obesity-childhood and adult poverty, depression, and attitudes about obesity. We evaluate the evidence for each explanation using data collected in an urban African township in the Cape Town metropolitan area. Three factors explain the greater obesity rates we find among women. Women who were nutritionally deprived as children are significantly more likely to be obese as adults, while men who were deprived as children face no greater risk. In addition, women of higher adult socioeconomic status are significantly more likely to be obese, which is not true for men. These two factors childhood circumstances and adult SES - can fully explain the difference in obesity rates between men and women that we find in our sample. More speculatively, in South Africa, women's perceptions of an 'ideal' female body are larger than men's perceptions of the 'ideal' male body, and individuals with larger 'ideal' body images are significantly more likely to be obese.

While the debate has relied heavily on the theory of optimum currency areas, this theory has weaknesses in explaining the actual formation of monetary unions. At this point, political economy analysis appears to demonstrate stronger explanatory power. This paper provides a systematic review of the main developments in the literature on optimum currency area theory and in the political economy literature on monetary union. In addition, it addresses the feasibility of an East Asian monetary union, by applying the findings in these two academic strands to the region. It finds that even though formation of an East Asian monetary union may be to some extent feasible from an economic perspective, the region's political situation does not appear favourable for the creation of one.","Bank Korea, Inst Monetary & Econ Res, Seoul, South Korea",Bank of Korea,"Chey, HK (通讯作者)，Bank Korea, Inst Monetary & Econ Res, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,75,4,5,0,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2009,32.0,12,,,,,1685.0,1705,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01200.x,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,530KP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272590300002,0

Utilising a modification of the standard Bayesian Probit framework, a Gibbs with Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to estimate the posterior densities for the parameters of interest. Several model specifications are applied to two contingent valuation datasets: one on wolf management plans, and one on the US Fee Demonstration Program. We find that DKs are more likely to be from people who would be predicted to have positive utility for the bid. Therefore, a DK is more likely to be a YES than a NO. We also find evidence of misreporting, primarily in favour of the NO option. The inclusion of DK responses has an unpredictable impact on willingness-to-pay estimates, since it impacts differently on the results for the two datasets we examine.

This article discusses how the growth of cross-border financial intermediation can best be regulated to limit the ensuing risks of financial contagion. It argues that a supranational supervisory system is now needed for some intermediaries, but that proximity to market actors at national level remains important. This points to a quasi-federal system as the way forward, but in constructing such a system account has to be taken of the diversity of Member State structures and preferences. The article concludes that even if a much more extensive EU-level competence is theoretically the optimal way forward, political considerations make it unlikely, suggesting that the crisis has broader implications for European integration.","London Sch Econ, European Inst, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Begg, I (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, European Inst, London, England.",iain.begg@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,30,44,47,0,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

J,"Menon, J",,,,"Menon, Jayant",,,Dealing with the Proliferation of Bilateral Free Trade Agreements,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,REGIONALISM,"Bilateral free trade agreements (BTAs) have been proliferating. The outcome of this proliferation of often overlapping BTAs and plurilateral free trade agreements (PTAs) is described as the spaghetti bowl effect or, in the Asian region, the noodle bowl effect. This is costly, and welfare reducing. How do we remedy the situation? In this paper, we consider the various options proposed in dealing with the spaghetti bowl, and assess their ability to do so. A general limitation of these proposals is their tendency to group all kinds of BTAs together, treating them as a homogeneous group. Thus, the proposals ignore underlying differences in motivation in forming BTAs.

Then, we study the similarity of short-run inflation dynamics across European Union (EU)-25 Member States during the Euro period. Consistent with studies on inflation differentials and inflation persistence, our findings suggest that after seven years from the launch of the Euro the degree of similarity of short-run inflation dynamics across Euro area countries is still weak. By contrast, we find that EU countries not adopting the common currency, whether old EU or new accession Members, display a higher degree of inflation dynamics similarity both among each other and with Euro area countries.","[Zazzaro, Alberto] Univ Politecn Marche, MoFiR, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Sarno, Emma; Zazzaro, Alberto] CFESPR, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Sarno, Emma] Univ Napoli LOrientale, I-80134 Naples, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; University of Naples L'Orientale,"Zazzaro, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, MoFiR, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",g.palomba@univpm.it; esarno@iuo.it; a.zazzaro@univpm.it,"Palomba, Giulio/C-5649-2012","Palomba, Giulio/0000-0003-0093-237X",,,,,77,6,6,1,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Political consensus is an implicit agreement not to vote for extreme policy proposals. We show that such an agreement may play an efficiency-enhancing role. Voters anticipate that voting for extremist parties increases policy uncertainty in the future. A political consensus among voters reduces policy uncertainty because self-interested politicians propose non-discriminatory policies. We study how much inequality can be sustained in a democracy and how the limits to redistribution vary with initial inequality. The bounds of the set of political equilibria may react in a fundamentally different manner to changes in exogenous variables than do the policy variables in the one-dimensional, one-shot game. More initial inequality need not lead to more redistribution from the rich to the poor. The maximum amount of redistribution decreases with inequality if (and only if) agents are sufficiently patient. In this case inequality is politically self-sustaining.","[Gruener, Hans Peter] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Gruener, Hans Peter] CEPR, London, England",University of Mannheim; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Grüner, HP (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",hgruener@rumms.uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,33,1,4,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2009,67.0,3,,,,,239.0,265,,10.1007/s11238-008-9096-0,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,495BF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269863500001,0

The main results are threefold. First, sectors more open to international trade are more volatile. Second, trade is accompanied by increased specialization. These two forces imply increased aggregate volatility. Third, sectors that are more open to trade are less correlated with the rest of the economy, an effect that acts to reduce overall volatility. The point estimates indicate that each of the three effects has an appreciable impact on aggregate volatility.

Initially, the entire sample period (October 1987-June 2006) is investigated. Then the samples, divided into three segments depending on each period's monetary policy regimes, are investigated. Thus, the asymmetric impacts of inflation expectation on Japanese long-term interest rates can be investigated. The first period examined is from October 1987-June 1991. The second period is from July 1991-July 2000. The third period is from March 2001-June 2006. In the first period monetary policy is tightening, but in the second and third periods it is easing. Thus it is concluded that the Fisher hypothesis is valid only in all maturities of long-term interest rates in the first period.

This study examines the unique informational role of room rates by suggesting an analytical model of room rates as a signal of quality and sell-out risk and by testing the theory empirically. The findings indicate that, even in advanced booking situations in which consumers might associate price deviations with the hotel's revenue management policies, prices can still signal quality to the consumers. Moreover, the study demonstrates that in a deal seeking/advanced booking context, there are two additional opposing impacts of the informational role of prices. Customers' propensity to book increases with higher rates because the perception of the sellout risk is higher. However, at the same time, customers' propensity to book decreases because the higher room rate induces a higher expectation of the offer of a better deal.","[Chen, Chih-Chien; Schwartz, Zvi] Univ Illinois, Dept Recreat Sport & Tourism, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Ruseski, Jane E.] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Alberta,"Chen, CC (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Recreat Sport & Tourism, 104 Huff Hall,MC 584,1206 S 4th St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",cchen22@uiuc.edu; jane.ruseski@ualberta.ca; zschwart@uiuc.edu,"Ruseski, Jane/A-8811-2014","Ruseski, Jane/0000-0002-7034-2597",,,,,44,9,11,0,15,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

First, we examine the awareness of research design issues in the literature on Europeanization through a review of the debate on causality, concept formation and methods. Second, we analyse how much of the discussion of the trade-offs in causal analysis in mainstream political science has percolated into Europeanization studies. We therefore construct a sample of the Europeanization literature, comparing it to a control group of highly cited articles on European integration. This enables us to control if some patterns are specific to the Europeanization literature or reflect a more general trend in European integration. We then look at trade-offs in the Europeanization sample and in the control group. Our findings indicate that awareness of research design is still low. Europeanization articles differ from the control group in the focus on mechanisms (rather than variables) and the qualitative aspects of time in politics. Complex notions of causality prevail in Europeanization but not in the control group and the cause-of-effects approach is preferred to effects-of-causes in the control group but not in Europeanization - in both cases, however, the difference is slight. We conclude by explaining differences and similarities and make proposals for future research.","[Exadaktylos, Theofanis] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Exadaktylos, T (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Amory Bldg,Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",te214@exeter.ac.uk; c.radaelli@exeter.ac.uk,"Exadaktylos, Theofanis/H-9998-2016","Radaelli, Claudio M./0000-0001-5056-5585; Exadaktylos, Theofanis/0000-0003-3045-2107",,,,,44,79,82,3,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

It demonstrates that the value judgments concerning the redistribution of income which have been revealed in these studies can be represented by the principle of concentration. A concentration is a redistribution of income which reduces the distance between each income and the average income in the same proportion. Imposing this principle and some other basic properties the paper characterizes several families of social welfare orderings which imply generalized Atkinson inequality measures. They do not necessarily satisfy the principle of progressive transfers.","Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Ebert, U (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",ebert@uni-oldenburg.de,,,,,,,22,7,7,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAY,2009,32.0,4,,,,,555.0,574,,10.1007/s00355-008-0339-3,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,418GG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264136100002,0

Whereas a team in Major League Baseball (MLB) could play as many as I I additional home games by the time it concludes the World Series, the number of home-field playoff games is a random variable with a mean of about 4 extra home games. Using reasonable assumptions, this implies that the expected increase in a MLB team's revenues associated with making the playoffs is about $11 million. The analysis shows that contending teams pay elite players (on average) an extra $2.8 million-a 40% bonus-to lure superstars to their rosters.","[Krautmann, Anthony C.; Ciecka, James] Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",DePaul University,"Krautmann, AC (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",,,,,,,,10,7,9,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Declining food prices over time have been singled out as a main contributor, for example, to the rising trend in obesity. In this paper we use data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association, the Consumer Expenditure Survey, and the United States Department of Agriculture to analyze trends in various types of food prices, to create a food price index, and to estimate the price of a calorie. Results may be used by future researchers in estimating the health implications of these trends. We find that while the general trend in food prices has been declining, that of restaurant meal prices and prices of fruits and vegetables has risen over time. It is doubtful that the decline in food prices has been sufficiently large to account for the large increase in caloric intake that is said to have contributed to the obesity epidemic in the U.S. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Habitual practise has popularised a technique based on the well-known Lagrange Multipliers, characterized as a Specific-to-General approach, and which seems to give good results. In our work, we contemplate other alternatives, some of which may be seen as slight variations of this proposal, including the selection tests of Vuong (Vuong, Q, 1989. Likelihood ratio-tests for model selection and non-nested hypotheses. Econometrica, 57,307-333.) and of Clarke (Clarke, K., 2003. Nonparametric model discrimination in international relations. Journal of Conflict Resolutions. 47, 72-93.). We also examine an approach of the General-to-Specific type, as clearly opposite to the others. The comparison of the two strategies is carried out through a Monte Carlo experiment, the results of which are quite diffuse, in the sense that we do not find conclusive evidence in favour of either of these two approaches. However, it should be recognized that the General-to-Specific strategy seems to be more robust to the existence of anomalies in the Data Generating Process. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

After reviewing the current positions of the older unemployed in the UK, noting the substantial overlap between age and disability, we turn our attention to conceptualizing the lived experiences of individuals through exploring 'identity work' as a means of understanding a non-working work identity. Based upon focus group interviews, our empirical analysis focuses on key dimensions of participants' identity practice and how they sought to manage the following social processes: imposed identities; crafting working identities; and contesting unfavourable working identities. The conclusion contextualizes the findings against a backdrop of increasing individualistic discourses underpinning approaches to employability, closes with the policy implications arising from this study, and makes suggestions for future research agendas.","[Riach, Kathleen] Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Loretto, Wendy] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Edinburgh EH8 9JY, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Essex; University of Edinburgh,"Riach, K (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",k.riach@essex.ac.uk; w.loretto@ed.ac.uk,,"RIACH, KATHLEEN/0000-0002-2135-0398",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E00976X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/E00976X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,104,117,2,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This paper argues that these results can be attributed in part to the low power of univariate tests, and that a violation of the noncointegration assumption is likely to result in a nonrejection of the neutrality proposition. To alleviate this problem, two new and more powerful panel cointegration tests are proposed that can be used under quite general conditions. The empirical results obtained from applying these tests to a panel covering ten countries between 1870 and 1986 suggest money and real output are cointegrated, and hence that the neutrality proposition must be rejected.","[Westerlund, Joakim] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Costantini, Mauro] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Lund University; Sapienza University Rome,"Westerlund, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",joakim.westerlund@nek.lu.se; mcostan@dep.eco.uniroma1.it,,,,,,,26,13,15,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Some 10.4 percent of these additional men will fall to marry, based on simulations presented here that assess how different scenarios for the sex ratio at birth affect the probability of failure to marry in 21st century China. Three consequences of the high sex ratio and large numbers of unmarried men are discussed: the prevalence of prostitution and sexually transmitted infections, the economic and physical well-being of men who fail to marry, and China's ability to care for its elderly, with a particular focus on elderly males who fail to marry.

As an important component of public finances, the development of financial ecology will directly relate to social harmony and stability, and affect the efficiency and effectiveness of public services supply. Financial ecological environment has increasingly become a major factor to constrain public services development. Without strong support from financial ecological environment, in many cases, the equalization of basic public services is meaningless.

The empirical analysis indicates that Czech firms supplying multinationals are less credit constrained than are nonsuppliers. Closer inspection of the timing of the effect, however, suggests that the result is due to self-selection of less constrained firms into supplying multinationals rather than to the benefits derived from the supplying relationship. As the recent literature finds that productivity spillovers from foreign direct investment (FDI) are most likely to take place through contacts between MNCs and their local suppliers, this finding suggests that well-developed financial markets may be needed to take full advantage of the benefits associated with FDI inflows.","[Javorcik, Beata S.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Javorcik, Beata S.] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Spatareanu, Mariana] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",University of Oxford; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Javorcik, BS (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",beata.javorcik@economics.ox.ac.uk; marianas@andromeda.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,30,24,27,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

A comparison of emissions factors (pounds of emissions per megawatt hour of power generation) based on year 2004 data reveals that the average coal fired power plant emits six times as much nitrogen oxide and more than twelve times as much sulfur dioxide as the average non-coal fired power plant. This paper uses data on the population of all electric utilities in the United States and evidence on population growth across regions to document that: Pollution levels are higher in counties with coal fired plants, and that the population is moving away from regions such as the Midwest where the dirtiest coal fired power plants are located.

An augmentation of the usual convergence regressions by quadratic and cubic terms is used with emphasis on curve fitting rather than parameter estimation. The results show that the generic mechanism leading to poverty traps predominantly applies to countries with relatively low levels of income per capita or per worker that simultaneously have low growth rates in the vicinity and below the lowest quintile of the growth rate distribution.

Some authors conclude that FDI inflows exert a positive impact on economic growth only in the presence of a highly skilled labor force and trade openness and the more negative one the higher degree of corruption occurs. Others give results showing that FDI imply increase of GDP in developing countries but not in advanced economies. Bringing together, an ambiguity of relations is apparent. In this article, a FDI and GDP relation in Central European new EU members is studied. Evidently, the difficulties arise how to evaluate relevant characteristics of Czech Rep., Hungary, Poland, Slovakia as for their degree of development.

These types of risk are generally classified under the term 'operational risk'. The identification and measurement of operational risk is a real and live issue for modern day banks, particularly since the decision undertaken by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to introduce a capital charge for this risk as part of the new capital adequacy framework (Basel II). Starting from these premises, the objective of this work is to present in the first part, the components that collectively form a sound operational risk management framework in support of the requirements prescribed by the Basel II Accord and, to explain the concept of operational risk (Ops Risk), including its scope, describe Operational Risk necessary policy and processes. In the second part of our work, we will explain the concept of risk identification in the context of Basel II and operational risk management and we will define and explain what is risk self-assessment. It is relatively difficult to identify or assess levels of operational risk and its many sources. Historically organizations have accepted operational risk as an unavoidable cost of doing business. Now, banking system must have an efficient management of all risks and especially of operational risk, if want to limit the cost of business.","[Petria, Nicolae] Lucian Blaga Univ, Sibiu, Romania; [Petria, Licuta] Constantin Brancoveanu, Pitesti, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu; Constantin Brancoveanu University,"Petria, N (通讯作者)，Lucian Blaga Univ, Sibiu, Romania.",,"petria, nicolae/S-5804-2019",,,,,,6,0,0,1,9,NICOLAE BALCESCU-LAND FORCES ACADEMY,SIBIU,"3-5 REVOLUTIEI STREET, SIBIU, 550170, ROMANIA",1843-6722,,,KNOWL BAS ORGAN INT,,,2009,3.0,,,,,,118.0,122,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BOQ14,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277294300018,0

Using data from the US electricity market from 1990-2000, we analyze how competition, institutional changes, and political constraints have contributed to the precipitous decline in R&D expenditure by regulated utilities. We find that firms reduce,their R&D significantly at the very early stages of restructuring or even when they expect restructuring to occur. Once the emerging institutional structure becomes clear, R&D spending recovers but is later offset by another decline when restructuring legislation is enacted. In addition, greater competition and the nearing of such competition adversely affects research spending. In aggregate, R&D declines by 78.6 percent after electricity markets are restructured. Firm and state characteristics matter, and a majority of the research is conducted by large generation companies located in pro-research states, especially if they are part. of a larger holding company. Such characteristics have a different impact on research spending in the pre- and post-restructured periods.","[Sanyal, Paroma] Brandeis Univ, Sachar Int Ctr, Dept Econ & IBS, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Cohen, Linda R.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",Brandeis University; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Sanyal, P (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Sachar Int Ctr, Dept Econ & IBS, MS 021,415 South St, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",psanyal@brandeis.edu,,,,,,,89,30,38,0,19,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,30.0,2,,,,,41.0,80,,,,,,40,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,426UV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264734400003,0

The parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood based on the extended Kalman filter and uses numerical integration over the latent volatility process. The stochastic volatility model with only correlation does a better job of capturing asymmetry than a threshold stochastic volatility model even though it has fewer parameters. We develop a stochastic volatility model that includes both threshold effects and correlated innovations. We find that the general model with both threshold effects and correlated innovations dominates purely threshold and correlated models. In this augmented model volatility and returns are negatively correlated, and volatility is more persistent, less volatile and higher following negative returns even after counting for the negative correlation.","Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Smith, DR (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",drsmith@sfu.ca,,"Smith, Daniel/0000-0003-2649-6529",,,,,45,10,11,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The price maker reacts more strictly, when the oil price increases and, on the other hand, he is more benevolent when the oil price falls. His preferences are asymmetric. The source of the asymmetric price making is a conflict between the society that requires respectable fuel prices and the price-maker that requires making use of his dominant position by setting optimal prices. As we show, the theory explains the structure of the driving fuel price-making. To verify our statements we form an asymmetric cost function of the driving fuel price maker and derive his reaction function.

First, what has been the impact of the global recession on patterns of international migration? Second, to what extent do recession-induced changes in migration offer evidence in the debate among competing explanations of migration? Third, has the recession heightened the marginalization of migrants? Fourth, to what extent have nations responded to the recession by regulating migration in new ways? Findings include reduced migration flows in the recession, evidence for both economic and social explanations, little evidence in unemployment rates for further marginalization of migrants and limited movement toward added migration restrictions.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Res Labour & Employment, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Tilly, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Res Labour & Employment, 10945 Le Conte Ave,Suite 2107, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",tilly@ucla.edu,"Vyacheslav, Gromyko/I-5054-2012",,,,,,81,70,77,2,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The first, which we are calling supply or demand, asks whether a state experiencing brain drain is below average in high-tech labor demand or above average in high-tech labor supply (the latter concept measured by university enrollments). It is argued that the answer to this question matters a great deal to the policy response. The article then proposes a second, related framework for crafting brain drain policies, which is used widely in the world of business. This is whether a state should make or buy its own high-tech workers. Benchmarking data and a new review of state policy programs are then used to compare what states are doing with what they ought to be doing in light of their particular situations.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Gottlieb, PD (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 55 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",gottlieb@aesop.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,62,5,8,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

In this case, the stability of the model cannot be taken for granted. The objective of the present paper is to study the dynamics generated by both forces within a Harrodian framework. Two main results are obtained. On one hand, the instability property of the model is illustrated. On the other, the introduction of some nonlinearities can constrain instability.

One of the most significant indicators of these changes is market restructuring, in terms of rapid concentration among retailers, the dominance of chain stores and their imposition of cost and quality constraints. To analyze this new aspect in the food sector, we carried out a survey on organic strawberry consumption. Interestingly, although the conventional strawberry may be considered unsafe, due to the widespread use of chemical inputs in the production process, the demand for organic strawberries remains fairly low. We attempted to investigate such concerns through a questionnaire-based survey. The data were analyzed using a Logit model to derive a demand estimate for organic strawberries.

In particular, we propose three alternative reduced rank forecasting models and compare their predictive performance for US time series with the most promising existing alternatives, namely, factor models, large-scale Bayesian VARs, and multivariate boosting. Specifically, we focus on classical reduced rank regression, a two-step procedure that applies, in turn, shrinkage and reduced rank restrictions, and the reduced rank Bayesian VAR of Geweke (1996). We find that using shrinkage and rank reduction in combination rather than separately improves substantially the accuracy of forecasts, both when the whole set of variables is to be forecast and for key variables such as industrial production growth, inflation, and the federal funds rate. The robustness of this finding is confirmed by a Monte Carlo experiment based on bootstrapped data. We also provide a consistency result for the reduced rank regression valid when the dimension of the system tends to infinity, which opens the way to using large-scale reduced rank models for empirical analysis.

Theory suggests that REIT stock prices should be largely independent of market changes; and, at the very least, REITs should have a low covariance with other assets, including other REIT stocks. The evidence presented below does not support this view. Instead, synchronicity appears to be quite high in the equity REIT market, especially among REITs that larger and more liquid. We also find that REIT stock price synchronicity is negatively related to hedge fund ownership, but positively related to pension fund and insurance company ownership. The evidence further suggests that synchronicity is the highest among industrial and regional mall REITs, and lower among apartment, health care, and mixed property REITs.","[Fung, Scott; Simmons-Mosley, Tammie X.] Calif State Univ Hayward, Hayward, CA 94542 USA; [Chung, Richard] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Shilling, James D.] Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",California State University System; California State University East Bay; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; DePaul University,"Simmons-Mosley, TX (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Hayward, Hayward, CA 94542 USA.",tammie.mosley@csueastbay.edu,,,,,,,51,11,11,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Our analyses indicate that the excess real estate returns (i.e., required risk premiums) are, in part, determined by the quality of a country's legal system and the corporate governance environment, controlling for various country-specific macro-economic variables and firm-level characteristics. We further find that the impact of institutional factors on international real estate returns is more prominent in the Asia-Pacific Region, and recent development of the REIT structure across the world does not alter the importance of corporate governance and legal system quality for determining real estate returns.","[Edelstein, Robert] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business F602, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Qian, Wenlan] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Qian, Wenlan] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Qian, Wenlan] Natl Univ Singapore, Risk Management Inst, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Tsang, Desmond] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; McGill University,"Edelstein, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business F602, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",edelstei@haas.berkeley.edu,"Qian, Wenlan/D-8110-2015; Tsang, Desmond/O-6079-2017",,,,,,33,20,20,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

It is the first study to exploit exceptionally rich energy data that were recently matched to official micro datasets. We document that both energy use and intensity are highly dispersed across plants. When isolating the between-sector variation in energy intensity, there is a strong positive correlation with energy use, CO2 emissions and emission intensity. Yet there is no evidence that the scale of an industry determines its energy intensity. The dispersion of energy use across plants of a given sector, normalized by the median, is positively correlated with that of gross output, but not with the median energy use. Similarly, there is no evidence that the median energy intensity is correlated with the within-sector dispersion of energy intensity or with that of CO2 emissions. Looking at the fuel mix across sectors, we find that more energy intensive industries rely more on fuels other than electricity, although the variability among plants in those industries is extremely high. We also demonstrate that average fuel shares are sensitive to the skewness of the underlying distribution and recommend the use of median fuel shares for better representativeness.","[Petrick, Sebastian; Rehdanz, Katrin] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Rehdanz, Katrin] Univ Kiel, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Wagner, Ulrich J.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Madrid, Spain",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Petrick, S (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Hindenburgufer 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",sebastian.petrick@ifw-kiel.de; katrin.rehdanz@ifw-kiel.de; uwagner@eco.uc3m.es,,"Wagner, Ulrich/0000-0002-4046-2803",,,,,56,5,5,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Using an optimization growth model, a condition allowing the assessment of whether public capital would be under- or overprovided was theoretically derived. By deriving a growth equation from a simple production function, we empirically tested this condition for the case of Mauritius during the period 1950-2005. Transport capital is observed to have played an important role in explaining growth of the country. Same is reported for nontransport capital. Interestingly, the null hypothesis that the coefficients of all the types of capital are equal could be rejected, and the estimated coefficient on transport investment proved to be higher than that on private investment (and the nontransport capital). This suggests that transport capital would still be underprovided for the Mauritian case, despite government investment.","Univ Mauritius, Reduit, Mauritius",University of Mauritius,"Seetanah, B (通讯作者)，Univ Mauritius, Reduit, Mauritius.",b.seetanah@uom.ac.mu,"Seetanah, Boopen/AAR-2103-2021; Seetanah, Boopen/K-6128-2019",,,,,,33,1,1,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In this paper we focus on operational models that do not require explicit knowledge of the individual networks of decision makers. We employ a field effect variable to capture social influences, which is calculated as the percent of population in the peer group that has chosen the specific alternative. We define the peer group based on socio-economic status and spatial proximity of residential location. As in behavioral economics and psychology, the concept is that one is influenced by the choices made by one's peers. However, using such a social influence variable in a behavioral model causes complications because it is likely endogenous; unobserved factors that impact the peer group also influence the decision maker, yielding correlation between the field effect variable and the error. The contribution of this paper is the use of the Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (BLP) method to correct the endogeneity in a choice model. The two-stage BLP introduces constants for each peer group to remove the endogeneity from the choice model (where it is difficult to deal with) and insert it into a linear regression model (where endogeneity is relatively easier to deal with). We test the method using a mode choice data set from the Netherlands and readily available software and find there is an upward bias of the field effect parameter when endogeneity is not corrected. The procedure outlined presents a practical and tractable method for incorporating social influences in choice models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

While in New Zealand the active role of the Crown in regulating the land market facilitated access to land, in Uruguay land was seized by a small group of large landowners. Our model shows that land concentration may have negatively influenced industrialization and growth by impeding the formation of a large group of middle-income landowners and, as a consequence, the development of a domestic demand for basic manufactures.

Our results imply that the permanent (random walk) component of stock prices overwhelms any temporary (mean reverting) component, producing a fractional d-value for returns indistinguishable from zero. We highlight the limitations of standard ACF models of overlapping returns, and suggest that the previously observed pattern of increasingly negative autocorrelations is largely an artifact of short-term ARMA dynamics. We confirm the result of Souza (J Time Ser Anal 28:701-722, 2007) that, holding the bandwidth constant, overlapping (and nonoverlapping) temporal aggregation should not affect semiparametric, frequency domain d-estimates such as the GPH and feasible exact local Whittle.","[Coggin, T.

This article presents quantitative metrics derived from patent data covering Japan. the United States, Britain and Germany and it also exploits non-patent based sources. The evidence shows that Japanese domestic inventive activity exhibited a pattern of rapid modernization to the technology frontier in terms of its level, sectoral distribution and quality. Domestic capabilities were much stronger than is often supposed in accounts that stress the prevalence of Western technology diffusion.

Parties compete on an inifinite-dimensional space of possible income-tax policies. A policy is a function that maps pre-fisc income into post-fisc income. Only a fraction of each voter type will vote for each party, perhaps because of issues not modeled here or voter misperceptions of policies. Each party's policy makers comprise two factions, one concerned with maximizing the welfare of its constituency, or its core, and the other with winning over swing voters. An equilibrium is a pair of parties (endogenously determined), and a pair of policies, one for each party, in which no deviation to another policy will be assented to both its core and swing factions. We characterize the equilibria: they have the property that both parties propose identical treatment of a possibly large interval of middle-income voters, while the left party gives more to the poor and the right party more to the rich. An empirical section uses the data of Piketty and Saez on taxation in the US to assess the model's predictions.

The model shows the various vacancy effects in the form of greater seller holding cost, lower seller bargaining power and unobserved negative attributes or stigma. We use a 20-year data series on house transactions to test for these effects in a simultaneous model of price and liquidity, using the long data series to allow for variation across market phases. The robust vacancy effects on price and liquidity across all market phases primarily reflect greater seller holding cost and diminished bargaining power. Repeatedly, vacant houses also exhibit significant stigma effects in the rising market but not in stable or declining market phases. At the same time, vacant houses enjoy stronger shopping externality effects from surrounding houses for sale than do their occupied counterparts.","[Turnbull, Geoffrey K.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Zahirovic-Herbert, Velma] Univ Georgia, Dept Housing & Consumer Econ, Griffin, GA 30223 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Turnbull, GK (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",g.k.turnbull@gmail.com; vherbert@uga.edu,,"zahirovic-herbert, velma/0000-0003-3552-3912",,,,,34,24,28,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2011,39.0,1,,,,,19.0,43,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00285.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,713LQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286739900002,0

However, evidence drawn from a survey of graduate careers suggests that for a cohort of recent business and management graduates, the relationship between employability and employment is far from straightforward.

To this end, we use various tests that are designed to compare competing forecast models. In addition to the standard Diebold-Mariano test, we employ tests that account for specific problems typically encountered in forecast exercises. Specifically, we pay attention to nested model structures, we alleviate the problem of data snooping arising from multiple pairwise testing, and we analyze the structural stability in the relative forecast performance of one indicator compared to a benchmark model. Moreover, we consider loss functions that overweight forecast errors in booms and recessions to check whether a specific indicator that appears to be a good choice on average is also preferable in times of economic stress. We find that none of this indicators uniformly dominates all its competitors. The optimal choice rather depends on the specific forecast situation and the loss function of the user. For 1-month forecasts the business climate indicator of the European Commission and the OECD composite leading indicator generally work well, for 6-month forecasts the OECD composite leading indicator performs very good by all criteria, and for 12-month forecasts the PAZ-Euro indicator published by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung is the only one that can beat the benchmark AR(1) model.","[Carstensen, Kai; Wohlrabe, Klaus] Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Carstensen, Kai] Univ Munich, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Ziegler, Christina] Univ Leipzig, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich; Leipzig University,"Carstensen, K (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",carstensen@ifo.de; wohlrabe@ifo.de; ziegler@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,"Carstensen, Kai/AAF-7834-2020; Wohlrabe, Klaus/R-9102-2016","Wohlrabe, Klaus/0000-0002-5651-2641",,,,,25,9,9,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The authors find that the type of innovation and its role varies widely by sector. The most environmentally challenged firms are among the most likely to innovate new processes, whereas new green innovative companies are more likely to respond to local and regional markets.

In this study, the authors examine historical data of Israeli hotels in order to demonstrate empirically the need for these models and to determine which model best fits the empirical data. Three preference-based pricing models are tested, built with indifference curves to analyse the two-attribute case of room rate versus occupancy. These models differ from standard ones in that the decision maker's actual choices for specific budget scenarios are built directly into them. These constrained choice points are built into a table and are used to create an entire pricing schedule based on the preference ratio thus determined. The first model uses an unconstrained desired point and assumes that managers find rate and occupancy to be perfectly substitutable at all budget constraints. The second model assumes linear fractional substitutability and alters the ratio for specific constrained choice points (Israeli and Brown, 2004). The third model assumes perfect complementarity at each constrained choice point and assumes a consistent ratio for each constrained choice segment (Brown, 2004).

It adopts three objectives. First, the study focuses on national states in developing countries, explaining their lack of enforcement of labour law and the suppression of labour rights. Second, the article examines the effectiveness of transnational regulatory networks (TRNs) in raising labour standards/rights in producer countries. We conclude that, in a fragmented and highly competitive global industry, existing TRNs cannot ensure labour decent standards/rights. Third, we investigate the reasons for their limited effectiveness. We empirically investigate the conditions and rights of labour in the clothing industries of China and Turkey. In the case of Turkey, we are able to explain the lack of effectiveness of TRNs by drawing on interviews with a variety of actors in firms and networks.","[Bulut, Tugce; Lane, Christel] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3RQ, England",University of Cambridge,"Bulut, T (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Free Sch Lane, Cambridge CB2 3RQ, England.",,,,,,,,88,13,13,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Recent randomized experiments have shown the return to capital to be very high for the average microenterprise in Sri Lanka. An intervention was designed to improve access to credit among these high-return microenterprises without subsidizing interest rates or requiring group lending. The intervention consisted of information sessions providing details of the microfinance loan product offered by a regional development bank and a reduction from two to one in the number of personal guarantors required for these loans. Ten percent of the microenterprises invited to the information meetings received a new loan, doubling the proportion of firms receiving loans over this period. However, the loans do not appear to be going to particularly high-return firms but rather to firms with more household assets. Many more firms would like loans but are constrained by an inability to find personal guarantors and by other bureaucratic procedures. The results suggest that information alone is unlikely to be enough for most firms and point to the need for credit bureaus that cover microfinance loans and for continuing innovation in loan products that can reach the urban microenterprise sector.

We depart from recent contributions of New Economic Geography in that our model does not exhibit the strong scale effect in R&D which is inconsistent with time-series evidence from advanced OECD economies. In contrast with previous research, we find that, when R&D spillovers are localized, trade integration affects economic growth only in the short-run; the sign of this (temporary) effect depends on whether intertemporal knowledge spillovers in R&D are positive or negative.

So far, however, there has been no attempt to determine the timing of this rejection and with it to obtain some guidance regarding the cause of failure in reporting an appropriate VaR. This paper corrects this by proposing U-statistic type processes that extend standard CUSUM statistics widely employed for change-point detection. In contrast to CUSUM statistics these new tests are indexed by certain weight functions that enhance their statistical power to detect the timing of the market risk model failure.

The key (but not the only) novelty of the paper is the idea that the alternative which tempts when an item x is consumed may not be the same as the alternative which tempts when another item y is consumed. For any single item to be ultimately consumed, the other items can be ranked by how much they tempt. An individual contemplates, as an alternative consumption, only the item that tempts most. The utility of a menu is then equal to the utility of the item that is consumed less a (psychological) cost of resisting temptation; this cost depends on both: the item to be consumed and the item that tempts. Unlike most of the existing literature, the axioms are imposed on deterministic menus, not on menus of lotteries.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Olszewski, W (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",wo@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,12,6,6,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2011,70.0,1,,,,,83.0,93,,10.1007/s11238-009-9172-0,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,700NV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285751600006,0

One opportunity for empirical analysis is provided by the past energy efficiency subsidies, called demand-side management programs, offered by electric utilities in North America over several decades. Between 1990 and 2005, most electric utilities in Canada administered such programs, with total spending of $2.9 billion (CDN$2005). This paper uses the significant inter-annual variation in demand side management spending during this period to econometrically estimate the effectiveness of these subsidies. The resulting estimates indicate that these programs have not had a substantial impact on overall electricity consumption in Canada. doi: 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-No4-5","[Rivers, Nic] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Rivers, Nic] Univ Ottawa, Inst Environm, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Jaccard, Mark] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; Simon Fraser University,"Rivers, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",nrivers@uottawa.ca; jaccard@sfu.ca,,,Trudeau Foundation,Trudeau Foundation,Nic Rivers acknowledges funding from the Trudeau Foundation.

India is one of the main centres of origin and domestication of Musa balbisiana. The ability of the species to introgress naturally with Musa acuminata has contributed to the wide diversity of B and B-rich genomes (like ABB) in India. The NRCB field genebank has a vast collection of 125 cooking banana accessions, dominated by the Monthan and Bluggoe subgroups. Phylogenetic studies offer the potential for unveiling the diversity available in the cooking bananas for exploitation in genetic improvement programmes. In the present study, the ABB germplasm was characterised through morphotaxonomic traits and molecular markers, with AA and BB genomes included as reference groups. The data were subjected to Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using NTSYS (Rohlf, 1998). Out of 125 accessions characterised morphotaxonomically, 71 accessions were distinct, whilst the rest (54) were synonyms. Forty-eight accessions, suspected to be synonyms based on morphotaxonomic characterisation, were characterised using 36 pairs of microsatellite markers. In both systems, cluster analysis resulted in two major clusters. Cluster 1 comprised AA accessions and cluster 2 included BB and ABB accessions. Though Monthan and Bluggoe are the major subgroups, the current study also resulted in another subgroup called Bontha, which clustered along with Monthan at 40% similarity. The estimated Cophenetic correlation coefficients were significant (0.98) in both molecular and morphotaxonomic characterisation, indicating a good fit of the dendrogram with the similarity matrices produced. The two-dimensional scatter plot obtained as a result of PCA also confirmed the clustering patterns elucidated by HCA. The phylogenetic relationships derived in the present study complemented with fertility studies facilitate identification of diverse parents, useful for the development of superior hybrids. These data also facilitated the elimination of synonyms during the establishment of a comprehensive core collection at NRCB.","[Saraswathi, M. S.; Uma, S.; Vadivel, E.; Durai, P.; Siva, S.

This study examines this question by analysing the performance of Japanese multinationals' manufacturing affiliates in China using an affiliate-level dataset for the period from 1989 to 2002 collected by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. We find that even though foreign multinationals often seem to enter China for the local market potential, affiliates with a higher local sales ratio tend to be less profitable - a pattern that is conspicuously different from that observed for Japanese affiliates in other regions such as the USA or the ASEAN4, where local sales orientation has a positive impact on profitability. On the other hand, we find that Japanese affiliates' profitability was positively associated with their local procurement ratio. Using the coefficients of the profit function estimated from data on all Japanese manufacturing affiliates around the world, we calculate the effect of local sales and procurements on profitability by country, controlling for the level of GDP and per capita GDP. In the case of China, the localisation effects are positive following the country's accession to the WTO, suggesting that both local procurement and sales expansion contribute to higher profitability in China.","[Ito, Keiko] Senshu Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Fukao, Kyoji] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Ito, K (通讯作者)，Senshu Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Ito, Keiko/AAA-6255-2019","Ito, Keiko/0000-0002-2162-2517; Fukao, Kyoji/0000-0002-9471-6653",,,,,24,14,15,1,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2010,33.0,12,,,,,1639.0,1671,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01236.x,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,700SN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285764700001,0

The two theories make contradictory predictions about the sign of the relation between insider ownership and risk. We test for the possibility of diminishing entrenchment returns to insider ownership. Empirical results for equity and asset betas soundly reject linear models in favor of nonmonotonic relations with reversals at insider ownership of 36%. Up to that point, increasingly entrenched insiders mitigate their own risk aversion. Above 36%, incentive alignment emerges as managers become more substantial owners. Leverage declines at an accelerating rate above 20% insider ownership. Together these results suggest a shift in the composition of risk, from leverage risk to asset risk, reflecting comparative advantage and a crossover in the relative monitoring costs of debt and equity. Problematically for linear models, the coefficient of insider ownership is not significant for most risk measures, producing the misleading appearance of no relation between insider ownership and risk. Institutional ownership is significantly negatively related to leverage. Thus incentives are aligned between insiders and institutional owners at insider ownership above 20%.","[Dolde, Walter; Knopf, John D.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Finance, Stamford, CT 06901 USA",University of Connecticut,"Dolde, W (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Finance, Stamford, CT 06901 USA.",walter.dolde@uconn.edu; john.knopf@uconn.edu,,,,,,,23,13,13,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The Potential for Franco-German Leadership in the Enlarged EU,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article examines the potential for Franco-German leadership in the EU-27. Leadership in the sense of shared leadership to achieve collective European goals can be exercised in different ways: by promoting the deepening and/or widening of European integration, by the active search for European compromises on disputed issues or by means of crisis management in European affairs. The Franco-German potential for performing such a leading role inside the European Union can be seen as being a function of French and German formal and informal power resources, of the shape of the institutional environments in different EU policy fields, of the prevailing preference configurations and issue coalitions in the Council and of the deliberate political strategies of French and German political leaders. The article analyses how far the enlargement of the European Union to 27 Member States has eroded the combined leadership capacities of France and Germany. Under specific conditions and circumstances - which should be less frequent in the EU-27 than before - the two European core countries might still be able to provide the kind of leadership which an enlarged Union needs perhaps more than ever.","Univ Trier, D-54286 Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier,"Schild, J (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",schild@uni-trier.de,"Schild, Joachim/I-2058-2019","Schild, Joachim/0000-0001-6149-8007",,,,,46,26,27,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Earlier studies have generally not been able to reject the null hypothesis of a unit-root in real exchange rates, especially for the post-Bretton Woods floating period. The results imply that long-run purchasing power parity does not hold. More recent studies, especially those using panel unit-root tests or nonlinear time series models, have found more favorable results, however. But the results from these recent studies are far from conclusive. Consistent individual country time series evidence that supports long-run purchasing power parity continues to be scarce. In this paper, we test for long memory using (Lo's in Econometrica 59:1279-1313, 1991) the modified rescaled range test, and the rescaled variance test of Giraitis et al. (J Econ 112:265-294, 2003a). Our testing procedure provides a non-parametric alternative to the parametric tests commonly used in this literature. Our data set consists of monthly observations from April 1973 to April 2001 of the G-6 countries (excluding the US) in the OECD. Using the modified rescaled range test, we find only 2 cases out of 15 where the null hypothesis of a unit-root with short-term dependence could be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis of long-term dependence and none using the rescaled variance test. Our results therefore do not provide strong empirical support for the stationarity of real exchange rates.","Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Ahking, FW (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, U-1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",francis.ahking@uconn.edu,"Ahking, Francis/ADR-0525-2022","Ahking, Francis/0000-0002-8869-2966",,,,,74,2,2,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We use twelve different models, from simple ARIMA to dynamic factor models exploiting the timely information of up to 110 short-term indicators, both qualitative and quantitative. This allows to assess the relevance for the forecasting practice of alternative combinations of types of data (real-time and latest available), estimation methods and periods. Out-of-sample predictive ability tests stress the relevance of more indicators in disaggregate models over sample periods covering a complete business cycle (about 7 years in Italy). Our findings downgrade the emphasis on both the estimation method and data revision issues. In line with the classical average puzzle, the use of simple averages of alternative forecasts often improves the predictive ability of their single components, mainly over short horizons. Finally, selected indicators and factor-based models always perform significantly better than ARIMA models, suggesting that the short-run indicator signal always dominates the noise component. On this regard, selected indicators models can further increase the amount of signal extracted to improve up to 30-40% the short-run predictive ability of factor-based models and to forecast-encompass them.","[Golinelli, Roberto] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Bulligan, Guido; Parigi, Giuseppe] Bank Italy, Res Dept, I-00184 Rome, Italy",University of Bologna; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Golinelli, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.",roberto.golinelli@unibo.it,"Golinelli, Roberto/F-1605-2013","Golinelli, Roberto/0000-0003-1107-6417",,,,,71,17,17,1,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

A representative vehicle technology that runs on electricity in addition to conventional fuels was introduced into the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model as a perfect substitute for internal combustion engine (ICE-only) vehicles in two likely early-adopting markets, the United States and Japan. We investigate the effect of relative vehicle cost and all-electric range on the timing of PHEV market entry in the presence and absence of an advanced cellulosic biofuels technology and a strong (450 ppm) economy-wide carbon constraint. Vehicle cost could be a significant barrier to PHEV entry unless fairly aggressive goals for reducing battery costs are met. If a low-cost PHEV is available we find that its adoption has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions, refined oil demand, and under a carbon policy the required CO2 price in both the United States and Japan. The emissions reduction potential of PHEV adoption depends on the carbon intensity of electric power generation. Thus, the technology is much more effective in reducing CO2 emissions if adoption occurs under an economy-wide cap and trade system that also encourages low-carbon electricity generation.

Attempts to reduce VMT typically rely on very blunt policy instruments, such as increasing urban densities, and run the risk of reducing mobility, reducing access to jobs, and narrowing the range of housing choice. VMT reduction, in fact, is an inherently blunt policy instrument because it relies almost exclusively on changing human behavior and settlement patterns to increase transit use and reduce automobile travel rather than directly target GHGs. It also uses long-term strategies with highly uncertain effects on GHGs based on current research. Not surprisingly, VMT reduction strategies often rank among the most costly and least efficient options. In contrast, less intrusive policy approaches such as improved fuel efficiency and traffic signal optimization are more likely to directly reduce GHGs than behavioral approaches such as increasing urban densities to promote higher public transit usage. As a general principle, policymakers should begin addressing policy concerns using the least intrusive and costly approaches first. Climate change policy should focus on directly targeting greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., through a carbon tax) rather than using the blunt instrument of VMT reduction to preserve the economic and social benefits of mobility in modern, service-based economies. Targeted responses are also more cost effective, implying that the social welfare costs of climate change policy will be smaller than using broad-brushed approaches that directly attempt to influence living patterns and travel behavior.

The unique feature of the model is that housing is a consumption good as well as a risky asset. Under general conditions, that is, when the utility function is not Cobb-Douglas and the covariance matrix is not block-diagonal, the model shows that the market portfolio is not mean-variance efficient, and the traditional capital asset pricing model fails. Nonetheless, a conditional linear factor pricing model holds with housing return and market portfolio return as two risk factors. The model also predicts that the nondurable consumption-to-housing ratio (ch) can forecast financial asset returns. The two factor pricing model conditioning on ch yields a good cross-sectional fit for Fama-French 25 portfolios.","Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Chu, YQ (通讯作者)，Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",yongqiang.chu@moore.sc.edu,"Chu, Yongqiang/H-8637-2015","Chu, Yongqiang/0000-0003-1739-7422",,,,,23,4,4,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2010,38.0,3,,,,,427.0,465,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00272.x,0.0,,,39,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,639UL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281000000002,0

Existing frameworks for co-operation offer the possibility of expanding temporary rather than longer-term or permanent movement of workers since extant trade agreements provide scope for negotiating specific market access commitments for services, including those delivered through the cross-border movement of natural persons. Even though the potential for such 'embodied' trade in services will not be anywhere near what would be associated with substantial liberalization of migration regimes, furthering the services trade dimension in the European Union's trade agreements offers significant potential Pareto gains. For the partner countries these gains from temporary movement of service providers are both direct - through greater employment and revenue from providing services in the European Union - and indirect - by helping to increase and sustain higher growth at home.","[Hoekman, Bernard; Ozden, Caglar] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Hoekman, B (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",bhoekman@worldbank.org,,,,,,,25,12,12,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Building on two comprehensive surveys of Danish and Swedish courts and judges, this study challenges the theory of judicial empowerment when explaining judicial integration in the EU. The article argues that in order to explain when and why Member State courts make use of the preliminary ruling procedure, a much deeper understanding of the prevalent legal/political culture and concept of democracy in each Member State is required.

The existence of a common long-term dynamics among electricity prices and between electricity prices and gas prices can be explained by the similarity of the market design across Europe and by the same marginal generation technology.

A path scheme is called population monotonic if a player's payoff does not decrease as the path coalition grows. In this study, we focus on Shapley path schemes of simple games in which for every path coalition the Shapley value of the associated subgame provides the allocation at hand. Obviously, each Shapley path scheme of a game is population monotonic if and only if the Shapley allocation scheme of the game is population monotonic in the sense of Sprumont (Games Econ Behav 2:378-394, 1990). We prove that a simple game allows for population monotonic Shapley path schemes if and only if the game is balanced. Moreover, the Shapley path scheme of a specific path is population monotonic if and only if the first winning coalition that is formed along the path contains every minimal winning coalition. We also show that each Shapley path scheme of a simple game is population monotonic if and only if the set of veto players of the game is a winning coalition.

Whereas there are many studies analysing this relationship for general innovations, studies for the environmental sector are still rare. On the background of high political attention connected with hopeful employment perspectives, a separate analysis of this sector in comparison to other, non-environmental fields seems to be very important. The empirical analysis is based on the establishment panel of the Institute for Employment Research (Nuremberg). The econometric results show that the influence of environmental innovation activities on the employment development is significantly positive and the quantitative impact seems to be larger than in other, non-environmental fields. Within a bivariate probit model, the determinants of environmental innovation activities are also explored. They may be interpreted as indirect influences on the employment development of the firm. The results show that the improvement of the innovative capacities by R&D and further education measures and the existence of highly qualified human capital are significantly important for the development of new products in the environmental sector.","Univ Appl Sci Augsburg, Fac Business, D-86169 Augsburg, Germany",,"Horbach, J (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Augsburg, Fac Business, Schillstr 100, D-86169 Augsburg, Germany.",jens.horbach@hs-augsburg.de,,,,,,,36,34,35,1,13,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Researchers have argued that the empirically observed high exchange-rate volatility may result from herd behavior of foreign-exchange traders and forecasters. We sketch a standard model that illustrates that herd behavior of foreign-exchange-rate forecasters may be rational. We then use survey data to test for herd behavior of forecasters. Our results suggest that exchange-rate-forecasters anti-herd and lean against the wind when forecasting exchange rates.,"[Pierdzioch, Christian] Univ Saarland, Rechts & Wirtschaftswissensch Fak, Saarland Inst Soziookon Forsch & Beratung, D-66041 Saarbrucken, Germany; [Stadtmann, Georg] Univ So Denmark, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Stadtmann, Georg] European Univ Viadrina, D-15207 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany",Saarland University; University of Southern Denmark; European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder,"Pierdzioch, C (通讯作者)，Univ Saarland, Rechts & Wirtschaftswissensch Fak, Saarland Inst Soziookon Forsch & Beratung, Postfach 15 11 50, D-66041 Saarbrucken, Germany.",c.pierdzioch@mx.uni-saarland.de; stadtman@whu.edu,,,,,,,36,3,3,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

In 1996, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) enacted Proposition 16, which increased admission standards for freshmen student-athletes at Division I schools, in an effort to improve graduation rates. Results indicate that Proposition 16 increased graduation rates significantly for Black student-athletes, and had no significant impact on graduation rates for White student-athletes. Results also indicate that graduation rates declined for Black student-athletes at Division II schools, which may have been driven by students transferring to Division I. As a result of the higher admission standards, Division I schools changed recruiting patterns and relied less on freshmen student-athletes, particularly Black student-athletes, to fill scholarships. Even though fewer Black freshmen student-athletes enrolled in Division I schools, the overall number of Black student-athletes did not change, suggesting that a greater proportion of transfer students into Division I schools were Black.","Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Price, JA (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 385 Ives Hall E, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",josh.price@cornell.edu,,,,,,,19,0,14,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Methods: Heights and weights of a cross-sectional sample of 11,454 children, 6-14 years, from schools for indigenous rural children (escuelas albergue) in 158 municipios in Oaxaca were measured in 2007. Tertiles of an index of marginalization were used to classify the 158 municipios into three categories of community well-being: lowest (highest marginalization), low, and moderate (lowest marginalization). Multivariate analysis of covariance, controlling for age, relative isolation and population size, was used to compare body size of children by category of community well-being. Contributions of marginalization, isolation and population size to variation in body size were estimated with sex-specific linear regression. Results: Children from municipios lowest in well-being were shorter and lighter than children from municipios low and moderate in well-being. Marginalization and relative isolation accounted for 23% (boys) and 21% (girls) of the variance in height and for 21% of the variance in weight of girls. Marginalization was the predictor of weight in boys (23%). Conclusion: Community well-being was reflected in the growth status of rural indigenous school children. Compromised growth status was consistent with poor health and nutritional conditions that were and are characteristic of rural areas in the state of Oaxaca. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The estimated PPP for total manufacturing suggests that the relative level of the producer price in China, Japan and Korea was about half to two thirds of the prevailing market exchange rates, respectively. The estimated PPPs are used to calculate comparative output and labor productivity for individual industries of these countries for ca. 1935. It shows that the size of factory manufacturing in Japan was 12 percent of the US level and in China only about one percent of the US level. In terms of comparative labor productivity, measured as PPP$ per hour worked, Japanese and Korean manufacturing was 24 and 23 percent of the US level, whereas Chinese manufacturing was only 7 percent of the US level.

Our testing strategy addresses two key concerns with regard to unit root panel data testing, namely (1) the presence of cross-sectional dependence among the countries in the panel and (2) the identification of potential structural breaks that might have occurred at different points in time. To address these concerns, we employ an AR-based bootstrap approach that allows us to test the null hypothesis of joint stationarity with endogenously determined structural breaks. In contrast to the existing literature, we find that the EU countries considered are characterised by fiscal stationarity over the full sample period irrespective of us allowing for structural breaks.

This unusual result was the result of the confluence of three factors familiar to students of transnational social movement politics: a) presence within UN offices and bodies of supporters opening forums and agendas to indigenous concerns, b) deference to the growing network of indigenous activists by anthropologists-the professional community best placed to serve as advocates speaking on behalf of indigenous communities, and c) indigenous activists' success in developing and projecting a globally-valid indigenous identity as peoples simultaneously uniting the various indigenous communities and providing a rationale for establishing voting rights that enough other actors could be persuaded to accept.

Despite being relatively minor when compared to catastrophes, these events still have profound impacts on traffic flow. To date there has been very little distinction drawn between different types of network-disruption studies and how the methodological approaches used in those studies differ depending on the specific research objectives and on the disruption scenarios being modeled. In this paper, we advance a methodological approach that employs different link-based capacity-disruption values for identifying and ranking the most critical links and quantifying network robustness in a transportation network. We demonstrate how an ideal capacity-disruption range can be objectively determined for a particular network and introduce a scalable system-wide performance measure, called the Network Trip Robustness (NTR) that can be used to directly compare networks of different sizes, topologies, and connectivity levels. Our approach yields results that are independent of the degree of connectivity and can be used to evaluate robustness on networks with isolating links. We show that system-wide travel-times and the rank-ordering of the most critical links in a network can vary dramatically based on both the capacity-disruption level and on the overall connectivity of the network. We further show that the relationships between network robustness, the capacity-disruption level used for modeling, and network connectivity are non-linear and not necessarily intuitive. We discuss our findings with respect to Braess' Paradox. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Novak, D. C.] Univ Vermont, Sch Business Adm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Sullivan, J.

Cross-subsidies are defined as the difference between a fair actuarial premium and the community uniform rate. The estimation result shows that the uniform community rating may unintentionally cross-subsidize inhabitants in high risk areas at the expense of inhabitants in low risk areas. Our simulation results indicate that replacing the current community rating with the fair actuarial premium would increase the overall subscription rate for earthquake insurance by about 3.7 percentage point, and that the increase is particularly prominent in relatively less risky areas. We propose modifying the Japanese earthquake insurance system by adopting a more refined risk rating system that more closely reflects regional differences in earthquake risk.","[Seko, Miki] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan; [Sumita, Kazuto] Kanazawa Seiryo Univ, Dept Econ, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9208620, Japan; [Naoi, Michio] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1080073, Japan",Keio University; Keio University,"Seko, M (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",naoi@2001.jukuin.keio.ac.jp; seko@econ.keio.ac.jp; sumita@seiryo-u.ac.jp,"Naoi, Michio/Y-3640-2019","Naoi, Michio/0000-0002-5088-2828; Sumita, Kazuto/0000-0001-7791-356X",,,,,14,18,19,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This paper studies the impact of FDI on industry productivity and wages over the first 10 years of NAFTA, paying particular attention to the source country and destination industry of investments. It also offers a detailed description of the evolution of FDI, its components, sectoral composition and sources from 1994-2005. There is evidence of a positive effect of FDI on productivity, particularly total factor productivity (TFP). The effect on wages is negative or zero at best, suggesting a divergence from productivity over this time period. The positive productivity effect stems largely from US FDI into non-maquiladora industries, which receive over two-thirds of manufacturing FDI. There is no evidence that more distant source countries have a differential effect. Consistent with theoretical expectations, FDI into maquiladoras benefits unskilled workers at the expense of skilled workers.","Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Colby College,"Waldkirch, A (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",,,,,,,,43,22,34,0,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2010,33.0,5,,,,,710.0,745,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01244.x,0.0,,,36,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,594IG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277529500003,0

We concentrate on two welfarist standards, viz. that the expected average utility for a person in the federation be maximized or that the expected utilities for the different people be equal. We discuss an analytical result that characterizes the decision rule with maximum expected average utility, set up a class of models that display interstate dependencies and run simulations for different dependency scenarios in the European Union. We find that the results that Beisbart and Bovens (Soc Choice Welf 29:581-608, 2007) established for two types of models without interstate dependencies are fairly stable if interstate dependencies are switched on. There are exceptions, though: sometimes the way in which alternative decision rules shape the welfare distribution is significantly affected by such dependencies. These exceptions particularly include cases in which the interests of people from different states are partly anti-correlated.","[Beisbart, Claus] TU Dortmund, Inst Philosophy & Polit Sci, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany; [Hartmann, Stephan] Tilburg Univ, Ctr Log & Philosophy Sci, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Dortmund University of Technology; Tilburg University,"Beisbart, C (通讯作者)，TU Dortmund, Inst Philosophy & Polit Sci, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany.",Claus.Beisbart@udo.edu,"Beisbart, Claus/AAE-4814-2020; Hartmann, Stephan/AAE-4799-2020","Hartmann, Stephan/0000-0001-8676-2177",,,,,19,9,9,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2010,34.0,2,,,,,315.0,344,,10.1007/s00355-009-0399-z,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,551QT,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274224800007,0

The authors incorporate asymmetric information into an endogenous growth model and reexamine how the presence of asymmetric information in financial markets affects the consequences of the government's expenditure and financing policies. With this asymmetric information, the authors find an optimal tax rate for capital income and an optimal share of government spending that maximize economic growth. These two optimal levels are more reasonable in comparison with recent empirical works. The authors find that financial development, measured by a decrease in the information cost, is positively correlated with the optimal share of government spending and the optimal tax rate for capital income. Some preliminary evidence in support of these implications is also found.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Hung, Fu-Sheng] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, Taiwa, Miyagi, Japan",National Sun Yat Sen University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347; HUNG, FU-SHENG/0000-0003-3265-3885",,,,,32,7,7,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Whereas the former aspect has been analysed in many studies, the impact of employment protection on work effort has been analysed in few recent studies. Theory predicts that employment protection reduces work effort because employee shirking cannot be that easily punished by the firm, which decreases the separation probability and increases the expected utility for a shirker in efficiency wage models. Personnel records of a German company are used to assess the impact of lower employment protection during probation on worker absenteeism as a proxy for work effort. The main finding is that new white-collar workers are on average more than 50 percent less likely to be absent and have on average more than 60 percent fewer absent working days during the three months probation period compared to the nine months period afterwards. These relative effects differ only slightly between the genders and between different age and educational groups.","[Pfeifer, Christian] Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Pfeifer, Christian] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Pfeifer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",pfeifer@leuphana.de,,,,,,,17,3,3,1,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The way how the spatial distribution of human capital evolves over time sheds light on the strength of concentration forces for high-skilled workers, such as localised increasing returns to human capital. In this paper I analyse the impact of human capital on local employment growth for Western German regions (1977-2006). Two main empirical Facts are established: Skilled cities in Western Germany grow faster. At the same time there is convergence of human capital shares across cities, i.e., high-skilled workers do not increasingly concentrate in space. Whereas the first fact (the smart city hypothesis) similarly holds in Germany and in the US, there is a striking difference when it comes to the second fact. Some researchers have found an opposite trend of human capital divergence across US metropolitan areas. My findings suggest that human capital exhibits a different spatial trend in different countries. I present a theoretical model which shows that the spatial convergence trend does not imply that concentration forces for high-skilled workers are absent in Western Germany, but only that they are relatively weak compared to countervailing dispersion forces. I further discuss some reasons that may explain the differences between Western Germany and the US. I emphasise the role of the tax system and the impact of pro-dispersive regional policy in Europe.","Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Südekum, J (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Lotharstr 65, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.",jens.suedekum@uni-due.de,,,,,,,37,7,8,1,30,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Since the fair trade concept is based on consumer behavior that incorporates moral and ethical choices, it cannot easily be explained by mainstream IPE theories which are predominantly based on the rational actor model. This paper examines the fair trade movement, discusses its history, its impressive growth and the ethical and social agenda it promotes. Fair trade is an anomaly that cannot be explained by mainstream rationalist ontologies. Instead, the authors argue, IPE theories need to consider classical political economy works which reveal many valuable insights regarding moral and/or ethical concerns. By reintroducing normative considerations fair trade can reconnect consumer and producer, move our theories beyond merely rationalist ontologies and humanize globalization.","[Archer, Candace; Fritsch, Stefan] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA",University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University,"Archer, C (通讯作者)，Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",,,,,,,,103,19,19,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

A stochastic simulation model of the world wheat market is used to investigate the effects of the special safeguard mechanism. As expected, the quantity-based safeguard is found to reduce imports, raise domestic prices, and boost mean domestic production in the countries that implement it. However, rather than insulating developing countries in those regions from price volatility, the quantity-based safeguard increases domestic price volatility, largely by restricting imports when domestic output is low and prices are high. The quantity-based safeguard shrinks average wheat imports nearly 50 percent in some regions, and global wheat trade falls by 4.7 percent. The price-based safeguard discriminates against lower price exporters and contributes to producer price instability.","[Hertel, Thomas W.; Leister, Amanda M.] Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Hertel, TW (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",hertel@purdue.edu; wmartin1@worldbank.org; aleister@purdue.edu,"Martin, William/E-6226-2011","Martin, William/0000-0002-2824-1303",,,,,32,26,27,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

It will be argued that in the classical authors we encounter a sophisticated typology of different forms of technical change and an analysis of the different effects these have. These forms can be analysed in terms of shifts of the inverse relationship between the general rate of profits and wages, or wage frontier. The emphasis will be on Adam Smith's concept of the division of labour, Ricardo's analysis of the substitution of machine power for labour power, and Marx's adaptation of Ricardo's argument to his own analytical framework in terms of a rising organic composition of capital.","Graz Univ, Dept Econ, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Kurz, HD (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Dept Econ, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",heinz.kurz@uni-graz.at,,,,,,,52,37,44,8,60,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

The paper presents a set of scenarios based on a detailed, service-based model of the U.S. buildings sector that is embedded within a long-term, global, integrated assessment model, MiniCAM. Eight scenarios are created in total, combining two sets of assumptions regarding U.S. building service demand growth, two sets of assumptions regarding the improvements in building energy technologies, and two assumptions regarding long-term U.S. climate action - a no-climate-action assumption and an assumption of market-based policies to reduce US.

KEYNES, THINKER OF ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY",HISTORY OF ECONOMIC IDEAS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,The paper reconstructs Keynes's conception of the nature and method of economics focusing on The Theory of Probability and The General Theory and shows that Keynes's theoretical work as an economist was an attempt to cope with the complexity of the economic world and the organic interdependence of the economic variables. Keynes offers a theoretical framework where the macroscopic outcome of the model is the result of the interaction of heterogeneous and not fully rational agents that revise their behaviour as they accumulate information. In the presence of true uncertainty the interactions of agents generate macro-instability and out-of-equilibrium paths. This approach has much in common with the approaches to complexity that have recently emerged.,"Univ Turin, Dept Econ, I-10124 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Marchionatti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ, Via Po 53, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",roberto.marchionatti@unito.it,,,,,,,47,8,8,0,7,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

To this end, policies aimed at influencing load consolidation have been suggested and implemented, resulting in higher gross vehicle weights. The purpose of such policies has generally been to mitigate congestion and environmental impacts. However. trucks cause most of the damage incurred by pavements. The supply chain associated with pavement maintenance and construction releases significant air emissions, raising the question of whether increased vehicle weights may cause unintended environmental consequences. This paper presents scenarios with estimated emissions resulting from load consolidation and changes in load factors. These scenarios reveal several points having to do with the tradeoff between tailpipe versus pavement supply-chain emissions. In some cases, unintended emissions from the pavement supply chain are found to be significant. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

I argue that existing theories are limited in that they conceive of political institutions' impact on corporate governance largely in terms of a deterministic influence on the political coalitions that emerge and on the policy outcomes. Based on the analysis of the paradigmatic case of a consensual democracy - Switzerland - I show that the consensual polity does not directly determine the outcome of a reform process, but rather the direction of causality between legal changes and changes in practices as well as the nature of the changes. Consensual polities require large parliamentary majorities for legal change to happen. Therefore, corporate practices are likely to change before legal rules and less demanding forms of institutional change, such as 'layering', are favoured.","Kings Coll London, Dept Management, London SE1 9NH, England",University of London; King's College London,"Schnyder, G (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Management, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",gerhard.schnyder@kcl.ac.uk,,"Schnyder, Gerhard/0000-0002-6681-6227",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-156-25-0037] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,66,4,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We build a model of electricity prices that takes into account several key features of the French electricity market in order to assess the capacity of the price signal to guide investments. Wholesale prices should reflect the imbalances in the generation mix but the signal can be distorted if monopoly rents and/or missing money are present. We simulate over the 2003-2005 period theoretical perfectly competitive prices with the installed capacity and with the optimal mix to estimate the capacity imbalances and scarcity rents. We then compare the investment signal sent by observed electricity prices and the theoretical prices with the installed capacity. Although there are signs of market contestability for the mid-merit load, through market integration with the other continental markets, observed prices are too high for the baseload and too low for the peakload, as a result distorting the signal.","Univ Paris 09, CGEMP, F-75775 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Vassilopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, CGEMP, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris, France.",philvass@hotmail.com,,,French energy regulatory commission CRE; CGEMP team,French energy regulatory commission CRE; CGEMP team,I am grateful for funding from the French energy regulatory commission CRE and the market department team for their help in terms of new ideas and reality checks.

The objective of implementing market risk management is to measure and assess accurately the sizes and degrees of risk involving agricultural products. In this paper, measurement and analysis of fruit market price risk were conducted on fruit species such as Fuji apple, orange, banana, pear, grape, watermelon and strawberry, using the VaR method. Empirical results show that normal distribution is not the optimal distribution model that can be applied in assessing fruit market risk. This is because different fruits have different degrees of market risk (i.e., strawberries and watermelons are fruits with high risk levels; apples, bananas and pears have relatively low risk levels; and grapes and oranges have middle risk levels). According to the results, fruits that belong to the same market risk level have similar features. It is thus necessary to conduct fruit market risk management with risk monitoring by classifying different types of produce as a single unit. This ensures efficiency and accuracy and reduces substantially the cost of market risk management.

Once estimated, the predicted probabilities of these transitions are used to calculate the probability of homeownership at various times for households in the sample. These estimates are done separately for African Americans and whites for two different 11-year time intervals, 1987-1997 and 1993-2003.

In addition, the evidence is mixed oil whether rising obesity rates are all unintended consequence of successful anti-smoking policies. This study re-examines these relationships using data from China, the largest consumer and manufacturer of tobacco in the world that is also experiencing a steady rise in obesity rates. We focus on the impact of the total number of cigarettes smoked per day on individuals' body mass index (BMI) and oil the likelihood of being overweight and obese. Instrumental variables estimation is used to correct for the endogeneity of cigarette smoking. We find a moderate negative and significant relationship between cigarette smoking and BMI. Smoking is also negatively related to being overweight and obese, but the marginal effects are small and statistically insignificant for being obese. Quantile regression analyses reveal that the association between smoking and BMI is quite weak among Subjects whose BMIs are at the high end of the distribution but are considerably stronger among subjects in the healthy weight range. Ordered probit regression analyses also confirm these findings. Our results thus reconcile an inverse average effect of smoking on body weight with the absence of any significant effect oil obesity. From a policy perspective these findings suggest that, while smoking cessation may lead to moderate weight gain among Subjects of healthy weight, the effects on obese subjects are modest and should not be expected to lead to a large increase in obesity prevalence rates.

The purpose of this work is to analyze from a psychosocial perspective the influence of symbolic, affective, and instrumental motivations on the frequency of car use, taking into account diverse reasons for traveling. From a sample of the Spanish population, participants were 284 people (50.3% female), with a driver's license, car owners and residents in cities of various sizes, who completed an anonymous questionnaire. The effect of each type of variable was estimated by a structural equation model. Results indicate that people's affective link with their private vehicle explains 12% of frequency of car use, as a latent variable of different kinds of trips: visiting friends or relatives, going to work or to a study center, going shopping, or to leisure areas. The instrumental advantages associated with cars and thinking that it expresses one's status predict the affective link with the car. These findings corroborate the relevance of the non-instrumental aspects involved in the selection of the means of transportation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The European Union (EU) is urged by its trading partners to open its agricultural markets. Economic evaluations of trade liberalisation scenarios unanimously conclude that a substantial opening of agricultural markets is required for a successful (welfare-improving) Doha Round. In this paper, we perform new evaluations to identify precisely the contributions of the European farm policy and to examine the robustness of these evaluations in the representation of this complex policy. Using the same specifications as in major previous studies, our first simulations show that the EU has a major responsibility in delivering significant gains to the developing countries. On the other hand, when we conduct the same experiments with a more relevant calibration and modelling of the European farm policy instruments, the gains that these developing countries may reap from the EU liberalisation are considerably reduced.
