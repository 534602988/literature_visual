Thus, the objective of this study is to demonstrate the use of conjoint analysis to obtain time trade-off estimates of healthy-year equivalents (HYEs) for clinically relevant durations and severities of acute, self-limiting, or nonfatal conditions such as vasomotor symptoms. A self-administered, web-enabled, graded-pairs conjoint-analysis survey was developed to elicit women's preferences for reducing the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms (daytime hot flushes and night sweats). Observed trade-offs between symptom duration and symptom relief were used to calculate HYEs for different severities and durations of vasomotor symptoms. A total of 523 women with a mean age of 52 years completed the survey. For these women, an improvement from severe to moderate vasomotor symptoms yields a gain of 4.44 HYEs, and an improvement from moderate to mild vasomotor symptoms over 1 year yields a gain of 4.62 HYEs over a period of 7 years. HYE gains for symptom relief are larger for younger women than for older women. Conjoint analysis is a feasible method for estimating HYEs for acute, self-limiting, or nonfatal conditions. This approach may provide an alternative utility-elicitation method when conventional standard gamble and time trade-off methods are inappropriate to the decision context.","[Johnson, F.

They are determined by geofiltration modeling. The mathematical nets in the knots of which the calculated data is imported, is formed in the modeling territory. If an incorrect mathematical net step is chosen, a model does not match the real situation and the piezometric and hydraulic pitches are distorted. In this way, the accuracy of calculation and modeling is worse. The aim of this work is to determine the influence of mathematical net to the calculations of ground water depth in modeling the trench. 30 estimated variants of the analyzed geofiltration model, the characteristics of which are different, were modeled applying sparse and fine mathematical net. According to the results, it is noticed that the modeling error, which can reach even 100%, depends on the period of calculation and the total resultant coil conductivity. The diagram of the conncection between the error of resultant coil conductivity and ground water depth was formed. Having the results and knowing the period of calculation and the total resultant coil conductivity, it is possible to foreseen the influence of the mathematical net to modeling results before starting to model the already researched or similar cases. This research, carried out using the computer program of geofiltration modeling PLAFI, can be applied to all the computer programs of geofiltration modeling, choosing the mathematical net and its step in various areas of hydraulic network of the modeled territory.","[Vycius, Zydrunas] Lithuanian Univ Agr, Bldg Construct Dept, Univ St 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas District, Lithuania; [Dargenis, Eimantas] Lithuanian Univ Agr, Hydraul Engn Dept, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas District, Lithuania; [Young, Diana] Royal Holloway Univ London, London, England",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Vycius, Z (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Univ Agr, Bldg Construct Dept, Univ St 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas District, Lithuania.",zydrunas.vycius@lzuu.lt; eimantas.dargenis@lzuu.lt; SandsDesign@shaw.ca,,,,,,,7,0,0,1,1,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,82,86,,,,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Engineering, Environmental; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Engineering; Public Administration,BNL17,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845700014,0

Typically, respondents may characterize states as being better than or worse than dead. However, worse-than-dead responses can produce strongly negative mean values, so various analytic transformations of these responses have been suggested. The episodic random utility model (eRUM), operationalized using a linear regression estimator, was proposed as an alternative to these transformations, in part because of its theoretical appeal. We analyzed the eRUM estimator's mathematical properties and found that it violates monotonicity under certain patterns of survey responses, such that improvement in some individual valuations would imply a lower overall valuation for a given health state. Consequently, it is possible that orderings of alternative strategies based on eRUM valuations could lead a decision-maker to choose a strictly dominated strategy. Re-analyzing data from a large population-based EQ-5D valuation survey in the United Kingdom, we found 27% of all TTO responses (63% of all worse-than-dead responses) met the conditions for violation of monotonicity, and 74% of all respondents had at least one such response. These results present some challenge to the use of the eRUM estimator in generating health-state valuations for population health measurement and economic evaluation.

This study aimed to review structural frameworks and key model parameters as reported in current economic evaluations for treatments for chronic hepatitis C, and model the impact of variability across parameters on results. Methods: A systematic review of studies published from 2000 to 2011 was performed. Studies were retrieved from five electronic databases using relevant search strategies. Model structures, disease progression rates, utilities, and costs were extracted from included studies, and were qualitatively reviewed and incorporated into a cost-utility model. Results: Thirty-four studies were appropriate for data extraction. A common pathway of six disease states was identified. In some studies the early disease stages and/or the decompensated cirrhosis state were further subdivided. Large variability in values used for disease progression rates, utilities, and costs were identified. When incorporated into a model, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) varied: in the least favorable scenario, peginterferon plus ribavirin was dominated by interferon plus ribavirin; and in the most favorable scenario, peginterferon plus ribavirin dominated interferon plus ribavirin ($8,544 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]; costs are given in 2008 US dollar amounts). Using mean values the ICER was $15,198 per QALY. Conclusions: Current models use a simplistic structure resulting from the lack of available data reflecting patient heterogeneity. Key model parameters are currently based on a small number of studies and the variability across these values can affect the interpretation of results.","[Townsend, Rebecca; McEwan, Phil] Cardiff Res Consortium, Cardiff CF24 0AB, S Glam, Wales; [Kim, Ray] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Rochester, MN USA; [Yuan, Yong] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Plainsboro, NJ USA",Mayo Clinic; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Townsend, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Res Consortium, Eastgate House,35-43 Newport Rd, Cardiff CF24 0AB, S Glam, Wales.",rebecca.townsend@capita.co.uk,,"Kim, W.

We consider panels that may be characterized by various forms of cross-sectional dependence including (but not exclusive to) the popular common factor framework. We consider block bootstrap versions of the group-mean (Im et al., 2003) and the pooled (Levin et al., 2002) unit root coefficient DF tests for panel data. originally proposed for a setting of no cross-sectional dependence beyond a common time effect. The tests, suited for testing for unit roots in the observed data, can be easily implemented as no specification or estimation of the dependence structure is required. Asymptotic properties of the tests are derived for T going to infinity and N finite. Asymptotic validity of the bootstrap tests is established in very general settings, including the presence of common factors and cointegration across units. Properties under the alternative hypothesis are also considered. In a Monte Carlo simulation, the bootstrap tests are found to have rejection frequencies that are much closer to nominal size than the rejection frequencies for the corresponding asymptotic tests. The power properties of the bootstrap tests appear to be similar to those of the asymptotic tests. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: In this retrospective database analysis, patients receiving opioid therapy were identified from a longitudinal insurance claims database. An algorithm was used to identify patients receiving opioid therapy with coincident constipation-related claims according to ICD-10 codes, targeted procedures, and opioid use criteria. Resource use and costs were determined for these individuals and compared with patients receiving opioid therapy without constipation, without opioid therapy with constipation, and without both conditions. Results were compared using analysis of variance with a significance level of 0.05. Results: A total of 23,313 patients were classified as opioid-treated patients (2.2%) and 6678 of them had events related to constipation (29.0%). Compared with opioid-treated patients without constipation, incremental mean total costs per month per patient were 261.18 BRL (P < 0.001). The average cost per month for opioid-related constipation patients was 787.84 BRL, significantly higher than other patients (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Among cancer patients, 24.4% was receiving opioids and 27.0% of those had constipation-related claims. As expected, the opioid therapy prevalence was significantly higher when compared to all patients (2.2% vs. 24.4%, P < 0.001). Cancer patients had, in average, higher costs than did noncancer patients in all four subgroups. Conclusions: Patients with constipation coincident with opioid treatment exhibited a significantly higher economic burden than did patients without the condition. These results indicate that reducing opioid-induced constipation could lead to potential cost savings for the health care system.","[Takemoto, Maira L. S.; Fernandes, R.

J,"Barberà, S; Grodal, B",,,,"Barbera, Salvador; Grodal, Birgit",,,Preference for flexibility and the opportunities of choice,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Flexibility; Preferences; Uncertainity,FREEDOM,"A decision-maker exhibits preference for flexibility if he always prefers any set of alternatives to its subsets, even when two of them contain the same best element. Desire for flexibility can be explained as the consequence of the agent's uncertainty along a two-stage process, where he must first preselect a subset of alternatives from which to make a final choice later on. We investigate conditions on the rankings of subsets that are compatible with the following assumptions: (1) the agent is endowed with a VN-M utility function on alternatives, (2) the agent attaches a subjective probability to the survival of each subset of alternatives, and (3) the agent will make a best choice out of any set which becomes available, and ranks sets ex-ante in terms of the expected utility of the best surviving alternatives within them.

We focus on two cohorts of veterans: those who served in Vietnam (1964-1975) and the Gulf War (1990-1991). Combat exposure differed between these groups in intensity, duration and elapsed time since exposure. We find that combat exposure generally, and exposure to dead, dying, or wounded people, specifically, is a significant predictor of mental health declines as measured by an individual's Mental Component Summary score. Under our general specifications, the negative effects of combat on mental health were larger for Gulf war veterans than for Vietnam veterans as of 2001. These effects persist after controlling for demographic characteristics, insurance coverage, income and assets. Using discrete factor, nonparametric maximum likelihood (DFML) estimation we controlled for unobserved heterogeneity as well as the factors above. In the DFML specifications we find a negative impact of exposure to dead, wounded or dying people for both Gulf and Vietnam veterans, but find no statistically significant effect for combat exposure overall for Vietnam veterans as of 2001. Based on our Gulf war parameters, we estimate that the costs of mental health declines to be between $87 and $318 per year for each soldier with combat service and exposure to dead, dying and wounded people.

Growing life expectancy of future generations should raise social discount rates for health because of diminishing marginal utility of additional health gains and equity reasons reflecting the desire for a more equitable distribution of benefits over generations. This influence has, however, been largely ignored in empirical studies. We provide a first comprehensive analysis of how time preferences for health gains vary with projected growth rates, indicating the importance of subjective expectations about the growth in life expectancy in the elicitation of social time preference. Six hundred and fifty-six respondents, representative of the Dutch population, completed one of four questionnaires, differing in the projected growth in life expectancy. Results showed that individuals discount future health gains at different rates, depending on the latency period and on the projected or expected growth in life expectancy. As hypothesized, discount rates increased with higher growth rates. The association between observed discount rates and expectations regarding future life expectancy was confirmed, suggesting that discount rates for health may depend on future life expectancy. In light of our results, specifying life expectancy of future generations in time preference exercises appears appropriate.

The aim of this study was to derive relation functions so that Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) scores could be used to estimate Health Utilities Index - 3 (HUI-3) and EQ-5D utility values for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: An observational, cross-sectional, naturalistic, multicentre study was conducted. A total of 244 patients aged 18 years or older, with RA according to American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria, were recruited. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were recorded and patients completed three generic HRQoL questionnaires: the HAQ-DI, the HUI-3, and the EQ-5D. Two linear regression models were used to predict HUI-3 and EQ-5D utility values as functions of HAQ-DI scores, age, and gender. Results: Patient mean age was 57.8 years old (standard deviation [SD], 13.3 years); 75.8% of the patients were women and 95.9% were white. Mean disease duration was 10.8 years (SD, 9 years). Patient distribution according to HAQ-DI severity was as follows: HAQ-DI < 0.5, 29%; 0.5 <= HAQ-DI < 1.1, 28%; 1.1 <= HAQ-DI < 1.6, 16%, 1.6 <= HAQ-DI < 2.1, 15%; and HAQ-DI >= 2.1, 12%. HAQ-DI and EQ-5D mean scores were 1.02 (SD, 0.78) and 63.1 (SD, 20.3), respectively. Mean utility values for HUI-3 and time trade-off (TTO) were 0.75 (SD, 0.21) and 0.65 (SD, 0.3), respectively. The equations converting HAQ-DI scores to utilities were HUI-3 = 0.9527 - (0.2018 x HAQ-DI) + epsilon (R-2 = 0.56), and TTO = 0.9567 - (0.309 x HAQ-DI) + epsilon (R-2 = 0.54). Error distribution was non-normal. Age and gender were found to have no bearing on the utility functions. Conclusions: HAQ-DI scores can be used to estimate HUI-3 and EQ-5D utility values for patients with RA in data obtained from studies where utility values have not been collected.

The allele identification of loci Glu-A1, Glu-D1 and presence of locus Sec-1 were realized on the collection of 16 genotypes, the 7 genotypes of wheat with purple pericarp, the 8 genotypes with blue aleuron layer and the one genotype with red pericarp. For the chosen allele detection were used SPLAT (Specific Polymorphic Locus Amplification Test) method and AS-PCR (Allele-Specific PCR). From the partial analysis results loci Glu-A1, Glu-D1 for HMW (High Molecular Weight) glutenin subunits and locus Sec-1 (rye translocation marker) in 16 wheat genotypes with different colored kernel was in one genotype with purple pericarp (Indigo) detected the occurrence of alleles Glu-A1b and Glu-D1d, and in three genotypes with blue aleuron layer (UC 66049, RU 440-6 and RU 440-5) was detected occurrence of alleles combinations for HMW glutenin subunits (Glu-A1a and Glu-D1d). Within the standard wheat with red pericarp, the remaining six genotypes with purple pericarp and the five genotypes with blue aleuron layer was detected allele Glu-D1d. Rye translocation Sec-1 was not detected in any of the analyzed genotypes. From these results we can conclude that genotypes Indigo, UC66049, RU 440-6 and RU 440-5 have a genetic precondition to a good bread-making quality.

Finally, we show that the primal Divisia technical change index satisfies the properties of identity, commensurability, monotonicity, and time reversal.

There are multiple clinical situations where the unique characteristics of observational investigations can inform medical decision-making within the CER paradigm. Accordingly, it is critical for clinicians to appreciate the strengths and limitations of observational research, particularly as they apply to CER. Methods: This review focuses on the role of observational research in CER. We discuss the concept of evidence hierarchies as they relate to observational research and CER, review the scope and nature of observational research, present the rationale for its inclusion in CER investigations, discuss potential sources of bias in observational investigations as well as strategies used to compensate for these biases, and discuss a framework to implement observational research in CER. Conclusions: The CER paradigm recognizes the limitations of hierarchical models of evidence and favors application of a strength-of-evidence model. In this model, observational research fills gaps in randomized clinical trial data and is particularly valuable to investigate effectiveness, harms, prognosis, and infrequent outcomes as well as in circumstances where randomization is not possible and in studies of many surgical populations. Observational investigations must be designed with careful consideration of potential sources of bias and must incorporate strategies to control such bias prospectively, and their results must be reported in a uniform and transparent fashion. When these conditions can be achieved, observational research represents a valuable and critical component of modern CER.","[Marko, Nicholas F.; Weil, Robert J.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Neurosurg, Neurol Inst, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Weil, Robert J.] Cleveland Clin, Brain Tumor & Neurooncol Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA",Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Cleveland Clinic Foundation,"Marko, NF (通讯作者)，Cleveland Clin, Dept Neurosurg, Neurol Inst, S80,9500 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.",markon@ccf.org,,,,,,,109,44,52,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,989,997,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00786.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,21138497.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000285066200018,0

A review of what national guidelines for economic evaluations say about transferability is important to understand the context in which transferability is currently practiced and discussed. Aim of this editorial is to discuss the results of a study reviewing the positions of various national guidelines in relation to the transferability and generalizability of data and the methods suggested for addressing issues of transferability presented in this issue. Conclusion: The recommendations on good research practices for dealing with aspects of transferability are filling an important gap. However, in order for the applied science of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research to make up for its epistemological aim and the aim of providing normative judgments, the methodological foundation of normative judgments has to be given the same importance as the methodological foundation the scientific community is seeking to establish as good research practices.","Novartis Pharma AG, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",Novartis,"Turk, F (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharma AG, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",florian.turk@novartis.com,,,,,,,2,4,5,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,863,864,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00766.x,0.0,,,2,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20659271.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000285066200001,0

We show that the uniform rule is the only allocation rule that satisfies strategy-proofness, envy-freeness, and same-sidedness: the third axiom is a weak efficiency condition that is equivalent to Pareto efficiency in the single-commodity case. Therefore, this result generalizes the characterization of the uniform rule by Sprumont (1991. Econometrica 59(2), 509-519) in the single-commodity case: it is the only rule satisfying strategy-proofness, envy-freeness, and Pareto efficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

First, I replace his continuity axioms P6 and P7 with a simple modification of Arrow's (1970) Monotone Continuity. Second, I relax Savage's primitives: in my framework, the class of events need not be a sigma-algebra, and acts need not have finite or bounded range. By varying the domains of acts and events, I obtain a unique extension of preference that parallels Caratheodory's unique extension of probability measures. Aside from subjective expected utility, I characterize exponential time discounting in a setting with continuous time and an arbitrary consumption set. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Budget constraints are enforced at each trading post separately implying demand for a carrier of value between trading posts, commodity money.

By explicitly incorporating and modelling endogenously the convenience yield, our theoretical model is able to capture the existence of backwardation or contango in the long-run spot-futures equilibrium relationship, s(t) = beta(2)f(t) + beta(3) When the slope of the cointegrating vector beta(2) > 1(beta(2) < 1) the market is under long run backwardation (contango). It is the first time in this literature in which the theoretical possibility of finding a cointegrating vector different from the standard beta(2) = 1 is formally considered. Independent of the value of beta(2), this paper shows that the equilibrium model admits an economically meaningful Error Correction Representation, where the linear combination of (s(t))) and (f(t)) characterizing the price discovery process in the framework of Garbade and Silber (1983), coincides exactly with the permanent component of the Gonzalo and Granger (1995) Permanent-Transitory decomposition. This linear combination depends on the elasticity of arbitrage services and is determined by the relative liquidity traded in the spot and futures markets. Such outcome not only provides a theoretical justification for this Permanent-Transitory decomposition; but it offers a simple way of detecting which of the two prices is dominant in the price discovery process. All the results are testable, as can be seen in the application to spot and futures non-ferrous metals prices (Al, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) traded in the London Metal Exchange (LME). Most markets are in backwardation and futures prices are information dominant in highly liquid futures markets (Al, Cu, Ni, Zn). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Adherence (proportion of days covered (PDC) >= 0.80), discontinuation (90-day continuous gap), and switching (initiation of second biologic within 90 days of discontinuation date of index biologic) were measured during the 12-month postindex biologic initiation. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying the thresholds to define these measures. Logistic regressions examined the factors associated with RA biologic adherence and discontinuation. Results: Anakinra users had the lowest mean PDC (0.36) and percent adherent patients (11%) followed by etanercept users (mean PDC: 0.57; % adherent: 32%) and infliximab users (mean PDC: 0.64; % adherent: 43%). All three groups had high discontinuation rates (41% etanercept, 76% anakinra, and 41% infliximab). Few patients who discontinued the index biologic switched to another biologic. Logistic regressions found that patients in Florida had lower odds of being adherent and higher odds of discontinuing their index biologic than patients in California. Anakinra users had lower odds and infliximab users had higher odds of being adherent than etanercept users. Anakinra users had higher odds of discontinuation than etanercept users. Conclusion: This study highlights the poor adherence to and premature discontinuation without concurrent switching of RA biologics that should raise concern for clinicians as well as payers.","[Li, Pengxiang; Doshi, Jalpa A.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Li, Pengxiang; Doshi, Jalpa A.] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Blum, Marissa A.; Von Feldt, Joan] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Div Rheumatol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hennessy, Sean] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Doshi, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Sch Med, Div Gen Internal Med, 1222 Blockley Hall,423 Guardian Dr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jdoshi@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,Abbott Labs,Abbott Labs(Abbott Laboratories),This study was supported by an investigator-initiated research grant from Abbott Labs.,,29,68,76,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2010,13.0,6,,,,,805,812,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00764.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,648BZ,21054657.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281666700015,0

Methods: Health Alliance Medical Plans piloted VBBD for diabetes medications for a subgroup of 5400 enrollees in January 2007 while keeping drug benefits unchanged for the remaining plan enrollees. A difference in difference method (DID) was used to evaluate the effect of VBBD based on pharmacy claim data. Patients with unchanged benefits in the same plan were used as the control group. Adherence was measured by the proportion of days covered. Propensity score weighting was used to balance characteristics of the case group and the control group. Results: There were 71 patients in the case group and 5037 patients in the control group. The patients in the two groups had comparable characteristics after propensity score weighting. After the implementation of VBBD, the average copayment per 30 days of supply for diabetes medications decreased from $15.3 to $10.1 for the case group and increased from $14.6 to $15.1 for the control group. The probability of being adherent increased from 75.3% to 82.6% for the case group and was roughly unchanged from 79.1% to 78.5% for the control group. Propensity score-weighted DID analysis showed that patients with copayment reduction had greater odds of being adherent: odds ratio = 1.56, P = 0.03, 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.34.

Both dramatically changed during this period: the redistributive effect became much more positive and utilization shifted from pro-poor to pro-rich. This clearly demonstrates that when utilization is contingent on financing, changes can occur rapidly; and that an integrated approach is required when monitoring equity. From a policy perspective, the Argentine health system appears vulnerable to economic downturns mainly due to high reliance on out-of-pocket payments and the strong link between health insurance and employment.

The follower is better off than the leader, whose price is smaller: the location preemption effect is weaker than the price leadership effect.

To augment model credibility, evaluation via comparison to independent, empirical studies is recommended. Methods: We developed a structured reporting format for model evaluation and conducted a structured literature review to characterize current model evaluation recommendations and practices. As an illustration, we applied the reporting format to evaluate a microsimulation of human papillomavirus and cervical cancer. The model's outputs and uncertainty ranges were compared with multiple outcomes from a study of long-term progression from high-grade precancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN]) to cancer. Outcomes included 5 to 30-year cumulative cancer risk among women with and without appropriate CIN treatment. Consistency was measured by model ranges overlapping study confidence intervals. Results: The structured reporting format included: matching baseline characteristics and follow-up, reporting model and study uncertainty, and stating metrics of consistency for model and study results. Structured searches yielded 2963 articles with 67 meeting inclusion criteria and found variation in how current model evaluations are reported. Evaluation of the cervical cancer microsimulation, reported using the proposed format, showed a modeled cumulative risk of invasive cancer for inadequately treated women of 39.6% (30.9-49.7) at 30 years, compared with the study: 37.5% (28.4-48.3). For appropriately treated women, modeled risks were 1.0% (0.7-1.3) at 30 years, study: 1.5% (0.4-3.3). Conclusions: To support external and projective validity, cost-effectiveness models should be iteratively evaluated as new studies become available, with reporting standardized to facilitate assessment. Such evaluations are particularly relevant for models used to conduct comparative effectiveness analyses.","[Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Hlth Policy, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Primary Care & Outcomes Res, Dept Med, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D.; Stout, Natasha K.; Goldie, Sue J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Program Hlth Decis Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Stout, Natasha K.] Harvard Univ, Dept Populat Med, Sch Med, Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care, Boston, MA USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Methods: The Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life instrument was adapted into Swedish by two independent groups using FB and DP methodologies, respectively. Seven out of thirty resulting items were identical. Nonidentical items were evaluated regarding preference of wording by 23 bilingual Swedes, 50 people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 2 lay panels (n = 11). Psychometric performance was assessed from a postal survey of 200 people with RA randomly assigned to complete one version first and the other 2 weeks later. Results: Preference did not differ among the 23 bilinguals (P = 0.196), whereas patients and lay people preferred DP over FB item versions (P < 0.0001). Postal survey response rates were 74% (FB) and 75% (DP). There were more missing item responses in the FB than the DP version (6.9% vs. 5.6%; P < 0.0001). Floor/ceiling effects were small (BB, 6.1/0%; DP, 4.4/0.7%) and reliability was 0.92 for both versions. Construct validity was similar for both versions. Differential item functioning by version was detected for five items but cancelled out and did not affect estimated person measures. Conclusions: The DP approach showed advantages over FB translation in terms of preference by the target population and by lay people, whereas there were no obvious psychometric differences. This suggests advantages of DP over FB translation from the patients' perspective, and does not support the commonly held view that FB translation is the gold standard.","[Hagell, Peter] Lund Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Hedin, Per-Johan] Cent Hosp Falun, Dept Rheumatol, Falun, Sweden; [Meads, David M.; McKenna, Stephen P.] Galen Res Ltd, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Nyberg, Lennart] Lund Univ, Ctr Languages & Literature, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Falun Hospital; Lund University,"Hagell, P (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, POB 157, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",peter.hagell@med.lu.se,"Hagell, Peter/F-5915-2010; Hagell, Peter/G-9559-2014","Hagell, Peter/0000-0003-2174-372X; Hagell, Peter/0000-0003-2174-372X","Swedish Research Council; Skane County Council Research and Development Foundation; Faculty of Medicine, Lund University","Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Skane County Council Research and Development Foundation; Faculty of Medicine, Lund University","The study was supported by the Swedish Research Council, the Skane County Council Research and Development Foundation, and the Faculty of Medicine, Lund University.",,28,76,80,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN-JUL,2010,13.0,4,,,,,424,430,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00677.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,625DD,20070642.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000279872300014,0

The aim of this review was to identify PCOS-specific QoL measures and establish whether their development history and measurement properties support their use in clinical trials. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using terms synonymous with PCOS and QoL. Following identification of measures, further searches were undertaken using the questionnaire name and abbreviation to explore its use, development history, and demonstrated measurement properties. Results: Of 56 abstracts screened, 21 reported using PRO measures. One PCOS-specific QoL measure was identified: the Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome Questionnaire (PCOSQ). Nine papers show that the PCOSQ's development history is somewhat incomplete, and that it does not have good content validity. The PCOSQ subscales demonstrate acceptable levels of reliability (0.70-0.97) and partial known-groups validity as well as convergent/divergent validity with other PRO instruments. Responsiveness to change is variable and minimally important differences have not been established. Conclusions: The PCOSQ is the only condition-specific measure of the impact of PCOS on QoL. Additional research is required to ensure its comprehensiveness, sensitivity, and to guide interpretation prior to including in clinical trials.","[Malik-Aslam, Aysha; Reaney, Matthew D.; Speight, Jane] AHP Res, Uxbridge UB8 3PQ, Middx, England",,"Speight, J (通讯作者)，AHP Res, Brunel Sci Pk,Kingston Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PQ, Middx, England.",jane.speight@ahpresearch.com,"Speight, Jane/AES-0292-2022","Speight, Jane/0000-0002-1204-6896",,,,,44,22,24,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN-JUL,2010,13.0,4,,,,,440,446,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00696.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,625DD,20230548.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000279872300016,0

Methods: Results from four randomized controlled trials comparing the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy regimens: mitoxantrone, chlorambucil, and prednisolone (MCP); cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP); cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP); or cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, prednisolone, and interferon alpha (CHVP + IFN alpha) versus chemotherapy alone were used to develop a Markov model. The rates of disease progression and the duration of treatment effect were obtained from the trial data. Treatments were compared in two ways: 1) an individual comparison of rituximab + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and 2) a multiple treatment comparison using league tables. Economic and clinical outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)) were estimated over patient lifetimes and discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: In the individual comparison, the addition of rituximab increased QALYs by (mean, 95% confidence interval) 1.174 (1.02-1.30), 0.909 (0.79-1.01), 0.823 (0.71-0.91), and 0.453 (0.40-0.50) for MCP, CVP, CHOP, and CHVP, respectively, compared with chemotherapy alone. The incremental costs per QALY gained were 7474, 8621, 10,732, and 8551, respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicated that rituximab plus chemotherapy was a cost-effective treatment option, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below a threshold of 30,000 per QALY gained. When compared across the chemotherapy regimens, rituximab plus MCP appeared to be the single most cost-effective treatment option, but further randomized trials are required to substantiate this. Conclusions: The addition of rituximab to chemotherapy in advanced FL was found to be highly cost-effective in the UK.","[Ray, Joshua A.] F Hoffmann La Roche & Co Ltd, Global Hlth Econ & Pricing, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland; [Lewis, Gavin] Roche Prod Ltd, Welwyn Garden City AL7 3AY, Herts, England; [Marcus, Robert] Kings Coll Hosp London, Dept Haematol, London, England",Roche Holding; Roche Holding; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; King's College Hospital,"Ray, JA (通讯作者)，F Hoffmann La Roche & Co Ltd, Global Hlth Econ & Pricing, Grenzacherstr 124, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland.",joshua.ray@roche.com,,,"F.

We also derive its almost sure uniform convergence rate. We then establish the asymptotic normality of p((theta) over cap). We undertake two sets of Monte Carlo experiments. The first experiment examines the ESE performance using mixtures of multivariate normal densities. The second estimates copula density functions. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the ESE.

We integrate information on these decisions with observations on child outcomes over a 13-year period from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY). We find that the impact of our school quality measures diminishes by factors of 2 to 4 after accounting for the fact that families may choose where to live in part based on school characteristics and labor market opportunities. The positive statistical relationship between child outcomes and maternal employment reverses sign and remains statistically significant after controlling for its possible endogeneity. Our estimates imply that when parental responses are taken into account, policy changes in school quality end up having only minor impacts on child test scores.

Because preventive care is a present-period investment with a future-period expected financial return, enrollee turnover among private insurers lowers the expected return of this investment. In this paper. I present a simple theoretical model to illustrate the suboptimal provision of preventive healthcare that results from insurers 'free riding' off of the provision from others. I also provide an empirical test of this hypothesis using data from the Community Tracking Study's Household Survey. I use lagged market-level measures of employment-induced insurer turnover to identify variation in insurers' expectations and test for the effect of turnover on several different measures of medical utilization. As expected, I find that turnover has a significantly negative effect on the utilization of preventive services and has no effect on the utilization of acute services used as a control.

This paper derives the optimal accumulation policy in such a context. The optimal accumulation rule depends on whether health spending improve consumption enjoyment, and on whether the planner adheres to an instantaneous welfarist view or to a complete life view. First, when the only role of health is to enhance longevity, we show that the capital per worker maximizing steady-state consumption per head is inferior to the standard Golden Rule. Moreover, the capital per worker maximizing steady-state consumption per head, when consumption efficiency depends on the health status, tends to exceed the optimal capital level under purely longevity-enhancing spending. Finally, when the planner adheres to a complete life view, the capital per worker maximizing steady-state expected lifetime consumption per head exceeds the optimal capital per worker under the instantaneous view.

These studies, however, are subject to possible endogeneity if HCE influences the remaining life expectancy. This paper introduces a 10-year observation period on monthly HCE, socioeconomic characteristics and survivor status to first predict TTD and then use the predicted values as an instrument in the regression for HCE. While exogeneity of TTD has to be rejected, core results concerning the role of TTD rather than age as a determinant of HCE (the 'red herring' hypothesis) are confirmed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One of the key assumptions is additive utility independence (AUI). Recently, Bleichrodt and Filko [Bleichrodt and Filko, 2008. journal of Health Economics 27 (5), 1237-1249] presented a new test for AUI, the test for generalized marginality (GM). Based on a student survey showing that violations observed at an individual level cancel out at the group level they concluded that use of the QALY model for economic evaluations in health care is supported.

Objectives: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of scheduled maintenance treatment with infliximab compared with standard care in children suffering from severe active CD over 5 years from the UK National Health Service perspective. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the progression of a hypothetical cohort of CD children through predefined health states on scheduled maintenance treatment with infliximab (5 mg/kg). The data to populate the model came from infliximab trials from Targan et al., ACCENT I, and REACH. The health states included in the model were remission, responding active disease, nonresponding active disease, surgery, postsurgery remission, postsurgery complications, and death. Standard care, comprising immunomodulators, and/or corticosteroids were used as a comparator. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) estimated using the EuroQol (EQ-5D) from a European CD population. To account for the weight-based dosing of infliximab, a baseline patient weight of 40 kg that increased by 5 kg/year up to 60 kg was used. The costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% over a period of 5 years. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed by varying the infliximab efficacy estimates, costs, and utilities. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for infliximab treatment was 14,607 pound compared with standard care. The sensitivity analyses revealed the treatment effect of infliximab to be the most influential parameter with ICERs ranging from 10,480 pound to 37,017 pound. Assuming a willingness to pay of 30,000 pound per QALY, the probability of infliximab being cost-effective is 78.6%. Conclusion: Scheduled maintenance treatment with infliximab (5 mg/kg) is likely to be a cost-effective treatment in children suffering from severe active CD under an 8-week maintenance program.","[Punekar, Yogesh Suresh] Schering Plough Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Herts, England; [Sunderland, Thomas] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Hawkins, Neil] Oxford Outcomes, Oxford, England; [Lindsay, James] Royal London Hosp, Barts & London NHS Trust, London E1 1BB, England",Merck & Company; University of Sheffield; Barts Health NHS Trust; Royal London Hospital,"Punekar, YS (通讯作者)，Schering Plough Ltd, Shire Pk, Welwyn Garden City, Herts, England.",yogesh.punekar@spcorp.com,"Sunderland, Terence/AAS-5080-2021","Sunderland, Terence/0000-0002-1985-9849; Hawkins, Neil/0000-0003-3199-221X; Punekar, Yogesh/0000-0002-7531-1319","Schering-Plough, UK; Global Health Solutions; Abbott Laboratories; UCB Pharma","Schering-Plough, UK(Merck & CompanySchering Plough Corporation); Global Health Solutions; Abbott Laboratories(Abbott Laboratories); UCB Pharma(UCB Pharma SA)","Source of financial support: This study was funded in full by Schering-Plough, UK, and the writing of this article was funded in part by Schering-Plough, UK.

That flexibility search lead to discrete choice hybrid choice models (HCMs) formulations that explicitly incorporate psychological factors affecting decision making in order to enhance the behavioral representation of the choice process. It expands on standard choice models by including attitudes, opinions, and perceptions as psychometric latent variables. In this paper we describe the classical estimation technique for a simulated maximum likelihood (SML) solution of the HCM. To show its feasibility, we apply it to data of stated personal vehicle choices made by Canadian consumers when faced with technological innovations. We then go beyond classical methods, and estimate the HCM using a hierarchical Bayesian approach that exploits HCM Gibbs sampling considering both a probit and a MMNL discrete choice kernel. We then carry out a Monte Carlo experiment to test how the HCM Gibbs sampler works in practice. To our knowledge, this is the first practical application of HCM Bayesian estimation. We show that although HCM joint estimation requires the evaluation of complex multi-dimensional integrals, SML can be successfully implemented. The HCM framework not only proves to be capable of introducing latent variables, but also makes it possible to tackle the problem of measurement errors in variables in a very natural way. We also show that working with Bayesian methods has the potential to break down the complexity of classical estimation.","[Bolduc, Denis; Alvarez-Daziano, Ricardo] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada",Laval University,"Bolduc, D (通讯作者)，CDAT, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,29,47,51,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,259,287,,,,,,29,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366173200012,0

Although numerous pharmacoeconomic practice guidelines are available in the literature and have been promulgated in many countries, these guidelines are either vague or silent about how drug Costs should be established or measured. This is particularly problematic in pharmacocconomic studies performed from the societal perspective, because typically the measured cost of a brand name pharmaceutical is not a true economic cost but also includes transfer payments from some members of society (patients and third part), payers) to other members of society (pharmaceutical manufacturer stockholders) in large part as a reward for biomedical innovation. Moreover, there are numerous and complex institutional factors that influence how drug costs should be measured from other CEA perspectives, both internationally and within the domestic US context. The objective of this report is to provide guidance and recommendations on how drug costs should be measured for CEAs performed from a number of key analytic perspectives. Methods: ISPOR Task Force on Good Research Practices-Use of Drug Costs for Cost Effectiveness Analysis (Drug Cost Task Force [DCTF]) was appointed with the advice and consent of the ISPOR Board of Directors. Members were experienced developers or users of CEA models, worked in academia, industry, and as advisors to governments, and came from several countries. Because how drug costs should be measured for CEAs depend on the perspectives, five Task Force subgroups were created to develop drug cost standards from the societal, managed care, US government, industry, and international perspective. The ISPOR Task Force on Good Research Practices-Use of Drug Costs for Cost Effectiveness Analysis (DCTF) subgroups met to develop core assumptions and an outline before preparing six draft reports. They solicited comments on the outline and drafts from a core group of 174 external reviewers and more broadly from the membership of ISPOR at two ISPOR meetings and via the ISPOR web site. Results: Drug cost measurements should be fully transparent and reflect the net payment most relevant to the user's perspective. The Task Force recommends that for CEAs of brand name drugs performed from a societal perspective, either 1) CEA analysts use a cost that more accurately reflects true societal drug costs (e.g., 20-60% of average sales price), or when that is too unrealistic to be meaningful for decision-makers, 2) refer to their analyses as from a limited societal perspective. CEAs performed from a payer perspective should use drug prices actually paid by the relevant payer net of all rebates, copays, or other adjustments. When such price adjustments are confidential, the analyst should apply a typical or average discount that preserves this confidentiality. Conclusions: Drug transaction prices not only ration current use of medication but also ration future biomedical research and development. CEA researchers should tailor the appropriate measure of drug costs to the analytic perspective, maintain clarity and transparency on drug cost measurement, and report the sensitivity of CEA results to reasonable drug cost measurement alternatives.","[Hay, Joel W.] Univ So Calif, Dept Clin Pharm Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Smeeding, Jim] JestaRx Grp, Dallas, TX USA; [Carroll, Norman V.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Pharm, Richmond, VA USA; [Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Garrison, Louis R.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Mansley, Edward C.] Merck & Co Inc, N Wales, PA USA; [Mullins, C.

Among population of ca. 650,000, the majority is Christian, despite local animism of Aluk to Dolo (Way of the Ancestors) which was recognized as a sect of Hinduism since 1965. Toraja people lived in autonomous villages, unveiled by the outsider until the early 1900s, but following to Dutch missionary activities, the area became an ideal tourism and anthropologists, particularly from 1970. Toraja people are well-known for sophisticated funeral rites, burial sites carved into rocky cliffs, massive peaked-roof traditional houses, and colorful wood carvings. As the Toraja language is oral and no writing system exists, Toraja people carve wood, calling it Pa'ssura (the writing) to express social and religious concepts. Consequently, wood carvings are Toraja's cultural manifestation and way of life. Each carving bears a special name, and common motifs of animals and plants symbolize goodwill and virtue. For example, the wooden wall panels are incised with geometric and spiraling designs, and motifs such as buffalo heads and cockerels painted in red, white, yellow and black represent the indigenous Toraja religion. Nature, full of abstraction with regularity and order, provides the basic ornamentation of Torajan architecture. It is argued that ornament is the means by which aesthetic beauty or symbolic significance is imparted to utility. Symbolic ornaments compose of elements chosen for significance, while aesthetic ones for beauty alone. To Toraja people minds, symbolism is more favored, as they produce cultural expressions of inner dynamics through material heritage. The paper investigates different types of wood carving, in order to legitimize them as Torajan identity in everyday life. It means how Torajan intangible heritage has been expressed through material culture, strengthening the social value of heritage as a mediator for unity and progress in Toraja and the whole Indonesia.",,,,,"LEE-NIINIOJA, HEE SOOK/ACQ-1921-2022","LEE-NIINIOJA, HEE SOOK/0000-0003-3138-5663",,,,,14,0,0,0,6,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,987,995,,,,,,9,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291664400109,0

The objective of this study was to calculate by means of a discrete event simulation model the budget impact of thrombolysis in Spain. Methods: The budget impact analysis was based on stroke incidence rates and the estimation of the prevalence of stroke-related disability in Spain anti its translation to hospital and social costs. A discrete event simulation model was constructed to represent the flow of patients with stroke in Spain. Results: If 10% of patients with stroke from 2000 to 201 S would receive thrombolytic treatment, the prevalence of dependent patients in 2015 would decrease from 149,953 to 145,922. For the first 6 years, the cost of intervention would surpass the savings. Nevertheless, the number of cases in which patient dependency was avoided would steadily increase, and after 2006 the cost savings would be greater, with a widening difference between the cost of intervention and the cost of nonintervention, until 2015. Conclusion: The impact of thrombolysis on society's health and social budget indicates a net benefit after 6 years, and the improvement in health grows continuously. The validation of the model demonstrates the adequacy of the discrete event simulation approach in representing the epidemiology of stroke to calculate the budget impact.","[Mar, Javier] Hosp Alto Deba, Serv Gest Clin, Clin Management Unit, Arrasate Mondragon 20500, Spain; [Mar, Javier; Arrospide, Arantzazu] Hosp Alto Deba, Res Unit, Arrasate Mondragon 20500, Spain; [Comas, Merce] Hosp del Mar IMIM, Evaluat & Clin Epidemiol Dept, Barcelona, Spain; [Comas, Merce] CIBERESP, Barcelona, Spain",Hospital del Mar Research Institute; Hospital del Mar; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP,"Mar, J (通讯作者)，Hosp Alto Deba, Serv Gest Clin, Clin Management Unit, Arrasate Mondragon 20500, Spain.",javier.marmedina@osakidetza.net,"Comas, Merce/O-3825-2014","Comas, Merce/0000-0003-1926-2740; Arrospide, Arantzazu/0000-0003-3537-6588","Department of Health, Basque Government [200411010]; Carlos III Health Institute, Madrid [P105/1703]","Department of Health, Basque Government(Basque Government); Carlos III Health Institute, Madrid","Supported by grant 200411010 from the Department of Health, Basque Government and Grant P105/1703 from the Carlos III Health Institute, Madrid.",,39,36,37,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2010,13.0,1,,,,,69,76,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00655.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,541PI,19818059.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000273429000014,0

Prospect theory is the dominant descriptive alternative for expected utility. This paper tests whether prospect theory leads to better health evaluations than expected utility. The approach is purely descriptive: we explore how simple measurements together with prospect theory and expected utility predict choices and rankings between more complex stimuli. For decisions involving risk prospect theory is significantly More consistent with rankings and choices than expected utility. This conclusion no longer holds when we use prospect theory utilities and expected utilities to predict intertemporal decisions. The latter finding cautions against the common assumption in health economics that health state utilities are transferable across decision contexts. Our results suggest that the standard gamble and algorithms based on, should not be used to value health. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Nonrandomized studies of treatment effects using secondary databases may supplement the evidence based from randomized clinical trials and prospective observational studies. Recognizing the challenges to conducting valid retrospective epidemiologic and health services research studies, a Task Force was formed to develop a guidance document on state of the art approaches to frame research questions and report findings for these studies. Methods: The Task Force was commissioned and a Chair was selected by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Board of Directors in October 2007. This Report, the first of three reported in this issue of the journal, addressed issues of framing the research question and reporting and interpreting findings. Results: The Task Force Report proposes four primary characteristics-relevance, specificity, novelty, and feasibility while defining the research question. Recommendations included: the practice of a priori specification of the research question; transparency of prespecified analytical plans, provision of justifications for any subsequent changes in analytical plan, and reporting the results of prespecified plans as well as results from significant modifications, structured abstracts to report findings with scientific neutrality; and reasoned interpretations of findings to help inform policy decisions. Conclusions: Comparative effectiveness research in the form of nonrandomized studies using secondary databases can be designed with rigorous elements and conducted with sophisticated statistical methods to improve causal inference of treatment effects. Standardized reporting and careful interpretation of results can aid policy and decision-making.","[Johnson, Michael L.] Univ Houston, Coll Pharm, Dept Clin Sci & Adm, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Berger, Marc L.] Eli Lilly & Co, Global Hlth Outcomes, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Mamdani, Muhammad] Univ Toronto, St Michaels Hosp, Appl Hlth Res Ctr, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada; [Atkins, David] Hlth Serv Res & Dev Serv, Dept Vet Affairs, Washington, DC USA; [Johnson, Michael L.] Michael E DeBakey VA Med Ctr, Houston Ctr Qual Care & Utilizat Studies, Dept Vet Affairs, Houston, TX USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; Eli Lilly; University of Toronto; Saint Michaels Hospital Toronto; Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute; Baylor College of Medicine,"Johnson, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Coll Pharm, Dept Clin Sci & Adm, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",mikejohnson@uh.edu,,,Department of Veteran Affairs [HFP020-90],Department of Veteran Affairs(US Department of Veterans Affairs),This work was supported in part by the Department of Veteran Affairs Health Services Research and Development grant HFP020-90.

It is shown that such quantiles satisfy the defining property of fixed quantiles in having the appropriate number of observations above and below. Like quantiles, time-varying expectiles can be estimated by a state space signal extraction algorithm and they satisfy properties that generalize the moment conditions associated with fixed expectiles. Because the state space form can handle irregularly spaced observations, the proposed algorithms can be adapted to provide a viable means of computing spline-based non-parametric quantile and expectile regressions.

Methods: A static equilibrium model was developed to evaluate health benefits and budget impact of vaccinating five successive birth cohorts with PRV at $50 per dose and 85% coverage (three doses). Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the societal perspective in year 5 of the program, with future health benefits discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: By the age of 5 years, one in five children will have sought medical advice for rotavirus gastroenteritis and one in 43 will have been hospitalized. In 2009, we estimate 1506 hospitalizations (476 per 100,000; 95% confidence interval 451, 502), 3086 Emergency Department (ED) presentations not requiring hospitalization, plus 10,120 cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis managed solely in primary care. The annual societal cost is $7.07 million, including 41% from hospitalization and 25% from caregiver income loss. Health benefits will increase and the cost of illness will decline by 78% in year 5 as successive birth cohorts are immunized. In the fifth year, 1191 hospitalizations, 2442 ED treated cases, 9762 primary care consultations, and 0.8 deaths will be averted. It requires six vaccinated children to avoid one primary care consultation, 49 to avert one hospitalization, and 73,357 to prevent one death. The incremental cost is $2.99 million and the break-even price per vaccine dose is $32.39 at 2006 prices. The cost is $2509 to avert one hospitalization and $305 to prevent one case seeking health-care assistance. The cost per life-year gained in year 5 is $143,097 and the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained is $46,092 (US$26,774). The cost per QALY is sensitive to incidence rates, vaccine price and efficacy, loss of quality of life by the child, case fatality, and caregiver income loss. Conclusions: From a societal perspective, addition of PRV to the New Zealand childhood immunization schedule would confer important clinical gains at a modest cost per QALY gained.","[Milne, Richard J.] Univ Auckland, Sch Populat Hlth, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Grimwood, Keith] Univ Queensland, Queensland Paediat Infect Dis Lab, Queensland Childrens Med Res Inst, Royal Childrens Hosp,Discipline Paediat & Child H, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Auckland; University of Queensland; Royal Children's Hospital Brisbane,"Milne, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Sch Populat Hlth, Tamaki Campus,Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",richard.milne@hoa.co.nz,"Grimwood, Keith/F-9334-2011","Grimwood, Keith/0000-0003-3174-9834","Merck Co., Inc.","Merck Co., Inc.(Merck & Company)","Merck & Co., Inc. partially funded this study but had no role in the study design, in the analysis and interpretation of data, in the writing of the report, or in the decision to submit the article for publication.",,63,33,35,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2009,12.0,6,,,,,888,898,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00534.x,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,474SP,19490550.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000268304600005,0

Methods: The UBQ-C includes a scale for global health status (1 item); and subscales for physical function (3 items), social/usual activities (4 items), self-care (1 item), and distresses because of physical and psychological symptoms (21 items). A scoring algorithm was derived to convert the subscales into a subset index, and combine it with the global scale into an overall health-related quality of life (HRQL) index, which was converted to a utility index with a power transformation. The valuation survey consisted of 204 advanced cancer patients who completed the UBQ-C and assigned time trade-off (TTO) utilities about their own health state. Preliminary validation involved comparing these derived utilities with other measures of HRQL. Results: Weights for the subset index were: physical function 0.28, social/usual activities 0.06, self-care 0.01, and distresses 0.64. Weights for the overall HRQL index were health status 0.65 and subset index 0.35. The mean of the utility index scores was similar to the mean of the TTO utilities (0.92 vs. 0.91, P = 0.6). The utility index was substantially correlated with other measures of HRQL. Conclusions: Data from a simple, self-rated, disease-specific questionnaire can be converted into a utility index suitable for comparing the net effect of cancer treatments on quality of life, and to evaluate trade-offs between quality and quantity of life in quality-adjusted survival analyses.","[Grimison, Peter S.; Simes, R.

Based on these updated results, we estimated the cost-utility (CU) of sequential aTZ relative to chemotherapy alone in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Methods: A Markov model estimated incremental costs and outcomes of 12 months of aTZ after adjuvant chemotherapy in women with HER2/neu-positive breast cancer over a 25-year horizon. The model incorporated four broad health states (disease-free, local recurrence [LCR], distant recurrence [DCR], death), stratified with or without symptomatic cardiotoxicity. Baseline event rates and 3-year relative risk (RR = 0.75) were derived from the HERA trial. As the duration of the benefit remains uncertain, the analysis considered 5-year and 3-year duration of benefit in two scenarios. Costs and utility weights were from the literature. The analysis took a direct payer perspective, with costs reported in 2007 Canadian dollars. Costs and QALYs were discounted by 3% annually. Results: The mean CU of sequential aTZ at a 25-year horizon was $72,292 per QALY gained in the 5-year scenario and $127,862 per QALY gained in the 3-year scenario. Results were particularly sensitive to the magnitude and duration of carryover benefit. Conclusions: The CU of sequential aTZ is primarily dependent on the magnitude and duration of benefit. Further clinical research is required to establish the optimum sequence and duration of aTZ therapy and clarify the magnitude and duration of treatment benefit.","[Skedgel, Chris] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Med, Clin Res Ctr, Halifax, NS B3H 1V7, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Skedgel, C (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Med, Clin Res Ctr, Room 207,5790 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS B3H 1V7, Canada.",chris.skedgel@cdha.nshealth.ca,"Skedgel, Chris/U-7173-2019; Rayson, Daniel/W-2800-2019; Younis, Tallal/HPG-8464-2023","Skedgel, Chris/0000-0003-4989-8846; Rayson, Daniel/0000-0002-2438-3128;","Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University","Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University","Source of financial support: Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University.",,44,24,25,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,641,648,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00511.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19490562.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267130200004,0

Consecutive subjects attending six primary care centers in Argentina were selected based on quota sampling and were interviewed using the EuroQol Group protocol for measurement and valuation of health studies. Initially, the respondents were randomly assigned a unique card set; however, to improve efficiency, the subjects were later randomly assigned to one of three fixed sets of EQ-5D states. Using the visual analog scale (VAS) and time-trade off (TTO) responses for these states, we estimated a valuation model using ordinary least squares regression clustered by respondent. Predicted values for EQ-5D health states are compared with published values for the United States. Six hundred eleven subjects were interviewed by 14 trained interviewers, rendering 6887 TTO and 6892 VAS responses. The model had an R-2 of 0.897 and 0.928 for TTO and VAS, respectively. The mean absolute difference between observed and predicted values was 0.039 for TTO and 0.020 for VAS, each showing a Lin's concordance coefficient more than 0.98. Argentine and US TTO-predicted values were highly correlated (Pearson's rho = 0.963), although the average absolute difference was clinically meaningful (0.06), rejecting the US values for nearly two-thirds of the states (62.8%). The Argentine population placed lower values on mild states and higher values on severe states. This study provides an Argentine value set that could be used locally or regionally, with meaningful and significant differences with that of the United States. Health policy in Latin America must incorporate local values for sovereignty and validity.","[Craig, Benjamin M.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, MRC CANCONT, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Ariel Augustovski, Federico; Edit Irazola, Vilma] Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy, Program Clin Effectiveness, Sch Publ Hlth,Sch Med, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ariel Augustovski, Federico; Pascual Velazquez, Alberto] Hosp Italiano Buenos Aires, Family & Community Med Div, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Gibbons, Luz] Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute; University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires; Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires,"Craig, BM (通讯作者)，H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, MRC CANCONT, 12902 Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.",benjamin.craig@moffitt.org,,"Gibbons, Luz/0000-0002-0235-1635; Craig, Benjamin Matthew/0000-0003-1121-1316",Argentine Ministry of Health,Argentine Ministry of Health,"We thank Paul Kind, Susan Macran, and Xavier Badia for useful comments and guidance, and members of Dr. Craig's staff, Kelly Muenzenberger and Kevin Benish, for their assistance.; Source of financial support: The financial support for this study was provided by a Scholarship Carrillo-Onativia from the Argentine Ministry of Health.

Correcting the errors: Volatility forecast evaluation using high frequency data and realized volatilities. Econometrica 73, 279-296], who address the issue of pointwise prediction of volatility via ARMA models, based on the use of realized volatility. Our approach is to use a realized volatility measure to construct a non-parametric (kernel) estimator of the predictive density of daily volatility. We show that, by choosing an appropriate realized measure, one can achieve consistent estimation, even in the presence of jumps and microstructure noise in prices. More precisely, we establish that four well known realized measures, i.e. realized volatility, bipower variation, and two measures robust to microstructure noise, satisfy the conditions required for the uniform consistency of our estimator. Furthermore, we outline an alternative simulation based approach to predictive density construction. Finally, we carry Out a simulation experiment in order to assess the accuracy of our estimators, and provide an empirical illustration that underscores the importance of using microstructure robust measures when using high frequency data.

Using data front the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we find that the incremental healthcare costs associated with obesity are passed on to obese workers with employer-sponsored health insurance in the form of lower cash wages. Obese workers without employer-sponsored insurance do not have a wage offset relative to their non-obese counterparts. A substantial part of the lower wages among obese women attributed to labor market discrimination can be explained by their higher health insurance premiums, (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate a new latent class hurdle model for panel data and compare it with the latent class NegBin model and the standard hurdle model. Latent class specifications outperform the standard hurdle model and the latent class hurdle model reveals income effects that are masked in the NegBin model. For specialist visits, low users are more income elastic than high users and the probability of using care is more income elastic than the conditional number of visits, The effects of income on total use of GPs are mostly negative or insignificant but positive elasticities are found for Austria, Greece and, to a greater extent, Portugal. On the whole, richer individuals tend to use more specialist care, especially in Portugal, Ireland, Finland, Greece and Austria, Features of the health care systems of these countries may contribute to the observed inequities.

The study was based on the 2005 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a nationally representative probability sample conducted annually by the Agency of Health Research and Quality. Nearly 8 million records were sampled from over 1000 community hospitals in the 2005 NIS. Excluding childbirth-related admissions, the estimated US hospitalizations numbered approximately 30.8 million; individuals with diabetes accounted for over 6.4 million (20.9%) of these admissions. For every 1000 individuals without diabetes, with type 1 diabetes, and with type 2 diabetes, the numbers of hospitalizations were 89, 418, and 303, respectively. The rates of hospitalization increased greatly by the presence of diabetes for all age groups and sex. During 2005, the national bill of hospital charges and costs for individuals with diabetes exceeded US$171 billion and US$90 billion, respectively. If the prevalence of diabetes increases to 7.5% from 7.0%, the total number of hospitalizations made by individuals with diabetes will be 7.5 million in 2015. Although approximately 7% of the population had diabetes in the USA, nearly 20.9% of hospitalizations were made by individuals with this condition. Due to the excessive hospitalizations incurred by patients with diabetes, a small increase in the number of people with diabetes will amplify the number of hospitalizations. Health-care communities should anticipate this possible increased demand of hospitalizations and the associated economic burden.","[Kim, Sunny] Florida Int Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Boye, Kristina S.] Eli Lilly & Co, Global Hlth Outcomes, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Eli Lilly,"Kim, S (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, HLS 575,11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",skim@fiu.edu,,,,,,,19,21,30,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,267,272,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00443.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,20667061.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000263467500012,0

The main results based network analysis can affect human decision-making. At present most researchers concerned about structure analysis and behavior analysis of networked system, little attention to building complex network models using intellectualized methods or tools. Complex economic networks like the financial markets networks and international trade networks, which are constructed by multi-entities and multi-ties, are multi-levels, multi-dimension, multi-mode and evolving. For satisfying various network modeling and analysis needs, we need a new methodology to support modeling and analysis of complex economic networks efficiently.

The aim of this study was to determine test characteristics important to patients and to examine trade-offs in attributes that patients are willing to accept in the context of the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Methods: A discrete choice study was used to assess preferences of patients with clinical indications suspicious of colorectal cancer who experienced both CTC and colonoscopy as part of a diagnostic accuracy study in South Australia. Results were analyzed by using a mixed logit model and presented as odds ratios (ORs) for preferring CTC over colonoscopy. Results: Colonoscopy was preferred over CTC as the need for a second procedure after CTC increased (OR of preferring CTC to colonoscopy = 0.013), as the likelihood of missing cancers or polyps increased (OR of preferring CTC to colonoscopy = 0.62), and as CTC test cost increased (OR of preferring CTC to colonoscopy = 0.65-0.80). CTC would be preferred to colonoscopy if a minimal bowel preparation was available (OR = 1.7). Some patients were prepared to trade off the diagnostic and therapeutic advantage of colonoscopy for a CTC study with a less intensive bowel preparation. Preferences also varied significantly with sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusions: Despite CTC's often being perceived as a preferred test, this may not always be the case. Informed decision making for diagnostic tests for colorectal cancer should include discussion of the benefits, downsides, and uncertainties associated with alternative tests, as patients are willing and able to make trade-offs between what they perceive as the advantages and disadvantages of these diagnostic tests.","[Howard, Kirsten; Salkeld, Glenn] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Pignone, Michael] Univ N Carolina, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Hewett, Peter] Univ Adelaide, Dept Surg, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Cheung, Peter; Roberts-Thomson, Ian C.] Queen Elizabeth Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Woodville, SA, Australia; [Olsen, Julie] Royal Adelaide Hosp, Dept Radiol, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Clapton, Wayne] Govt S Australia, SA Hlth, Policy & Intergovt Relat Div, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Sydney; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Adelaide; Royal Adelaide Hospital,"Howard, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Edward Ford Bldg A27, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",kirsten.howard@sydney.edu.au,"Hewett, PJ/AAT-9350-2020","Howard, Kirsten/0000-0002-0918-7540; Hewett, Peter/0000-0002-8135-1317; Pignone, Michael/0000-0002-6657-7342","Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [211205, 402764]; South Australian Department of Health; Packer Policy Fellowship from The Commonwealth Fund",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); South Australian Department of Health; Packer Policy Fellowship from The Commonwealth Fund,"Source of financial support: This study of patient preferences was funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, Program Grants 211205 and 402764 for the Screening and Test Evaluation Program.

We work with the monthly averaged maximum and minimum temperatures observed at the twenty six Meteorological Office stations. The data is an unbalanced panel. We allow the trend to evolve in a nonparametric way so that we obtain a fuller picture of the evolution of common temperature in the medium timescale. Profile likelihood estimators (PLE) are proposed and their statistical properties are studied. The proposed PLE has improved asymptotic property comparing the sequential two-step estimators. Finally, forecasting based on the proposed model is studied. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We distinguish between the two by using semi-parametric nonlinear panel data methods, applied to both the smoking participation and the cigarette consumption decision, which we allow to be correlated. We find that for both smoking decisions true state dependence is generally much smaller, but still important, when unobserved individual heterogeneity is accounted for, regardless of residential location. We uncover large differences in true state dependence across countries and relate them to discrepancies in regulations, social norms on and tolerance towards smoking, and awareness of its health risks.

Although exactly one model has limiting posterior probability, an optimal linear combination typically includes several models with positive weights. We derive several interesting results: for example, a model with positive weight in a pool may have zero weight if some other models are deleted from that pool. The results are illustrated using S&P 500 returns with six prediction models.

They are claimed to be applicable across disease areas and have started to be used within mental health research. This review aims to assess the construct validity and responsiveness of four generic health status measures in schizophrenia, including the preference-based SF-6D and EQ-5D. Method: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken. Ten databases were searched from inception to August 2009 and reference lists scrutinized to identify relevant studies. Studies were appraised and data extracted. A narrative synthesis was performed of the evidence on construct validity including known groups validity (detecting a difference in health-related quality of life (HRQL) scores between two different groups such as samples from the general population and people with schizophrenia), convergent validity (strength of association between generic HRQL and other measures (e. g., symptom or functional), and responsiveness. Responsiveness was considered by: 1) differences in generic HRQL measure scores in responders/non-responders and 2) correlation between changes on generic HRQL measures and changes in specific measures obtained from patients and clinicians. Results: Thirty-three studies were identified that provided data on the validity and/or responsiveness of the instruments. Most of the evidence concerns the SF-36 and EQ-5D, and for these instruments there was evidence for known group validity. The evidence for convergent validity and responsiveness was mixed, with studies presenting contradictory results. Conclusion: Although the evidence base is limited in a number of important respects, including problems with the measures used to develop constructs in the validation studies, it is sufficient to raise doubts about the use of generic measures of health like the EQ-5D and SF-36 in patients with schizophrenia.","[Papaioannou, Diana; Brazier, John; Parry, Glenys] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Papaioannou, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",d.papaioannou@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Parry, Glenys/JKI-4816-2023","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Medical Research Council Methodology Board [G0801394]; Medical Research Council [G0801394] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [06/92/51] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0801394] Funding Source: UKRI,Medical Research Council Methodology Board(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This study was funded by the Medical Research Council Methodology Board (project number G0801394).,,53,91,95,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2011,14.0,6,,,,,907,920,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.04.006,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BJ,21914513.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081600016,0

Yet there is no clear consensus on what the best measure of individual's experience may be for the evaluation process. To shed light on this issue, monetary values for a number of health problems are compared across different well-being measures within the same UK data set. We find that, whilst there is strong internal consistency of health impacts within each wellbeing measure, hugely different monetary valuations are obtained for the same health problem across different well-being measures. Our results, although should only viewed as illustrative, call for economists to rethink about which measure of well-being or experienced utility to be used in the well-being valuation method, should the approach ever be implemented in real policy contexts.

Methods: For a set of 2000-2009 approved new molecular entities and biologics indicated for cancer, we compared patient access between US Medicare and Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) beneficiaries. Here, access is defined in terms of marketing availability, payer coverage, and patient out-of-pocket costs. Results: Although 34 drugs and biologics were approved for cancer in the US, just more than one-third (35%) were ultimately covered by the Australian PBS. The PBS also placed more restrictions on use. On the other hand, prices and patient out-of-pocket costs were greater for the US Medicare population. Conclusion: Our analysis points to a possible trade-off in market access to oncology drugs. Although more oncology drugs are available in the US and a higher percentage of available drugs are covered, the evidence-based approach adopted by Australia has contributed to reduced prices, thereby improving affordability for payers and patients for those medications deemed cost-effective by the reimbursement authority.","[Wilson, Andrew; Cohen, Joshua] Tufts Univ, Tufts Ctr Study Drug Dev, Boston, MA 02111 USA",Tufts University,"Cohen, J (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Tufts Ctr Study Drug Dev, 75 Kneeland St,Suite 1100, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",joshua.cohen@tufts.edu,,,,,,,54,25,28,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2011,14.0,6,,,,,944,952,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.004,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BJ,21914517.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081600020,0

In 2004 the Australian Department of Health agreed to fund bosentan on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) on the condition that a registry was established to monitor mortality: if the observed mortality rate was higher than that claimed in the original funding submission then the price of bosentan would be reduced to maintain the original incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). This article presents the economic implications of the bosentan patient registry (BPR). Methods: An existing economic model was updated using the results of the BPR. Results: Participation rates were high and the BPR collected 821 patient years of follow-up on 528 patients. Based on the observed raw mortality a 23.7% price reduction would have been needed to maintain the original ICER in idiopathic PAH patients. After allowing for the higher risk patients actually treated in Australia, a 13.5% reduction in bosentan price would have been required. In 2008, however, sitaxentan, a new oral ERA PAH treatment was listed on the PBS at a 15% discount to bosentan. On the basis of cost-minimization, bosentan was forced to reduce its price to that of sitaxentan. After this price reduction the ICER for bosentan was similar to that originally proposed and hence, no additional price reduction was sought by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). Conclusions: The bosentan PAH registry provided a useful mechanism for monitoring the cost-effectiveness of bosentan after funding approval.","[Wlodarczyk, John] John Wlodarczyk Consulting Serv, New Lambton, NSW, Australia; [Reid, Christopher M.] Monash Univ, Clin Informat & Data Management Unit, Sch Publ Hlth & Preventat Med, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Pater, Glen] Actel Australia, Belrose, NSW, Australia",Monash University,"Wlodarczyk, J (通讯作者)，10 Mirral Crescent, New Lambton, NSW 2305, Australia.",john@jwcs.com.au,"Reid, Christopher M/AAP-8135-2021","Reid, Christopher/0000-0001-9173-3944",Actelion Pharmaceuticals,Actelion Pharmaceuticals,No funding or support has been received for this manuscript.

It also proves the asymptotic validity of a bootstrap approximation to their sampling distributions. The autoregressive parameters are estimated using the GMM estimators based on the first differencecl equations and the error variance is estimated using an extended analysis-of-variance type estimator. Contrary to the time series setting, we find that the GMM estimator of the autoregressive coefficients is not asymptotically independent of the error variance estimator. The asymptotic dependence calls for variance correction for the orthogonalized impulse response functions. Simulation results show that the variance correction improves the coverage accuracy of both the asymptotic confidence band and the studentized bootstrap confidence band for the orthogonalized impulse response functions.

When bidders have continuous valuations and make strategic reports, we show that any ex post implementation of the Vickrey choice rule via such a mechanism needs infinitely many iterations for almost all realizations of the bidders' valuations. Thus, when valuations are drawn from a continuous probability distribution, the Vickrey choice rule can only be used at the expense of a running time that is infinite with probability one. This infeasibility result even holds in the case of two bidders and the Vickrey choice rule only being required to be established with probability one. Establishing the efficient allocation when the n bidders' report truthfully contrasts starkly to the previous setting: a bisection procedure has a finite running time almost always, and an expected number of reports are equal to 2n. Using a Groves payment scheme rather than Vickrey's second price payment scheme somewhat mitigates the problem. We provide an example mechanism with a Groves payment scheme, in which the running time of the mechanism in equilibrium is finite with probability 1/2. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A random sample 171 of pharmacy students, ranging in age from 18 to 35 years were surveyed using a written questionnaire. Health status was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey Short-Form 36 (SF-36). The sample consisted of 127 women and 44 men. The sample had a mean age of 22.3 +/- 2.71 years. The associations between health status and health behaviors were examined using both bivariate and multivariate models. The bivariate association was examined by t tests. Multiple regression analysis was used to model each SF-36 score separately using as independent variables sex, lack of regular exercise, regular smoking, and alcohol consumption. Results: The regression model explained between 6% and 12% of the variance in perceived health status. Controlling for other variables in the model, male students had significantly higher scores in bodily pain, general health, vitality, and social functioning than female students. Controlling for other variables in the model, lack of regular exercise was associated with significantly lower scores in physical functioning, bodily pain, and vitality; and regular smoking with significantly lower scores in physical functioning and general health. Controlling for other variables in the model, students who reported consuming alcohol had significantly higher scores in role-physical, bodily pain, and social functioning than students who did not report to consuming alcohol. Conclusions: This exploratory study demonstrates sex differences in health behaviors and perceived health status in pharmacy students. Health status is associated with several health behaviors in this sample of pharmacy students.","Cent Univ Venezuela, Fac Farm, Caracas 1040, Venezuela",University of Central Venezuela,"Bastardo, YM (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Venezuela, Fac Farm, Apto Postal 40109 Nueva Granada, Caracas 1040, Venezuela.",yajairabastardo@yahoo.com,,,,,,,20,5,6,1,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,S,,,S122,S125,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.020,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BE,21839883.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081000027,0

Methods: In HF events (63) from type 2 diabetes-related hospitalizations (N = 462) recorded in an Argentine hospital (March 2004-April 2005), we verified 1) the presence of one metabolic HF predictor (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] value) before hospitalization; and 2) in a simulation model, the resources needed for its prevention controlling such predictor during 6 months before and after the event. Sensitivity analysis of HF risk reduction, hospitalization cost, and cost of different treatments to achieve HbA1c 7% or less was performed with a Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 iterations). Results: HF represented 14% of hospitalizations, with a 44% rehospitalization rate for the same cause. Due to the total estimated cost for an HF hospitalization event was $437.31, the prevention attained using our simulated treatment was $2326.51. The number needed to treat to prevent an HF event under any of the proposed alternatives to reduce HbA1c would be 3.57 (95% confidence interval 2.00-16.67). The additional cost of the simulated treatment versus the real one oscillates between $6423.91 and $8455.68.

Since the critical values of the test statistic are difficult to obtain, we propose a blockwise wild bootstrap procedure to approximate its asymptotic null distribution. Using a Hilbert space approach, we establish the weak convergence of the difference between the sample spectral distribution function and the true spectral distribution function, as well as the consistency of bootstrap approximation under mild assumptions. Finite sample results from a simulation study and an empirical data analysis are also reported. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We achieve this goal by constructing a nonparametric simultaneous confidence envelope for transition density function of the observable variables and checking whether the parametric density estimate is contained within such an envelope. Our specification test procedure is motivated by a functional connection between the transition density of the observable variables and the Markov transition kernel of the hidden states. Our approach is applicable for continuous-time diffusion models, stochastic volatility models, nonlinear time series models, and models with market microstructure noise. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we develop a model in which insurers determine the cost efficiency of health care and have incentives for risk selection. We derive the optimal cost reimbursement function, which balances the incentives for cost efficiency and risk selection. For health cost data from a Swiss health insurer, we find that an optimal cost reimbursement scheme should reimburse costs only up to a threshold.

In many settings, however, exogenously imposed cutoffs on several assignment variables define a set of different treatments. In this paper, we show how to generalize the standard regression-discontinuity approach to include multiple assignment variables simultaneously. We demonstrate that fitting this general, flexible regression-discontinuity model enables us to estimate several treatment effects of interest. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The intent of these accountability laws was to improve academic performance and to make school quality more observable. Nonetheless, schools have reacted to these pressures in several different ways, some of which were not intended. We make use of the variation across states and over time in specific provisions of these accountability laws and find that accountability pressures effect medical diagnoses and subsequent treatment options of school aged children. Specifically, children in states with more stringent accountability laws are more likely to be diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and consequently prescribed psychostimulant drugs for controlling the symptoms. However, conditional on diagnosis, accountability laws do not further change the probability of receiving medication therapy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Bokhari, Farasat A.

Realized volatility is separated into its continuous and jump components, and the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model is applied with implied volatility as an additional forecasting variable. A vector HAR (VecHAR) model for the resulting simultaneous system is introduced, controlling for possible endogeneity issues. We find that implied volatility contains incremental information about future volatility in all three markets, relative to past continuous and jump components, and it is an unbiased forecast in the foreign exchange and stock markets. Out-of-sample forecasting experiments confirm that implied volatility is important in forecasting future realized volatility components in all three markets. Perhaps surprisingly, the jump component is, to some extent, predictable, and options appear calibrated to incorporate information about future jumps in all three markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The procedure is based on a method of moments that uses analytical expressions for the moments of the integrated volatility and series expansions of option prices and implied volatilities. This results in an easily implementable and rapid estimation technique. An extensive Monte Carlo study compares various procedures and shows the efficiency of our approach.

Genetic modification of crops has benefited from emerging knowledge of new genes, especially genes that exhibit novel functions. Pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV), a member of the genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae, is currently one of the most frequent viral pathogen causes yield losses of legumes. Beside aphid vectors, PSbMV is transmitted by infected seed batches. These losses can be easily prevented by growing resistant cultivars. In pea (Pisum sativum), recessive resistance genes to several potyviruses have been mapped genetically to linkage groups II and VI. Resistance to the common strains of PSbMV is conferred by a single recessive gene eIF4E, localized on linkage group VI (sbm-1 locus). Homologues eIF4E(iso) gene was found in close relation to sbm-2 locus (on linkage group II). Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and its isoform eIF4E(iso) play a key role during virus infection in plants. The eIF4E(iso) genes from several pea lines were isolated and sequenced. Full genomic fragments of eIF4E(iso) were obtained and protein sequences were deduced. Mutations of eIF4E(iso) between resistant and susceptible genotypes have been identified but are not yet functionally assigned. Selected genotypes are currently tested by L1 (P2) PSbMV pathotype. Using the RACE method, sequences of 3' and 5'UTR regions, were obtained and used for specific primers design to detect any differences between resistant and susceptible genotypes. Quantitative expression analysis is conducted for both genes.","[Konecna, E.; Hanacek, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Plant Biol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Smykal, P.] Agritec, Dept Plant Biotechnol, Sumperk 78701, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; AGRITEC Ltd,"Konecná, E (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Plant Biol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",eva.konecna@mendelu.cz,"Hanacek, Pavel/E-6683-2012; SMÝKAL, Petr/I-3569-2019","Hanacek, Pavel/0000-0002-9807-1370; SMÝKAL, Petr/0000-0002-6117-8510",IGA FA MENDELU [TP 7/ 2011],IGA FA MENDELU,IGA FA MENDELU Nr.

The list of donkeys that were later attended for measurements was created based on contacts given to us by breeders themselves. From a total of 331 donkey individua living in Czech Republic, we have managed to obtain 50 samples. The measured results were further analyzed by the generic linear model and methods of descriptive statistics. We were able to prove a significant diversity between the Czech population of donkeys and the individuals that were imported from abroad. The calculated hippometric indexes were excluded from further statistical analysis. Moreover the differencies in some of the traits were as significant as the differencies in the measurements. From the mentioned facts we can assume that in the past mainly donkeys with lower withers were imported, whereas presently the phenomena is turning its hands. The demand for higher and stronger donkeys has risen recently as they are better for riding. That is why there were significant differences between the donkeys born in Czech Republic and those born abroad.","[Kost'ukova, M.; Jiskrova, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agr, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kost'uková, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agr, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",markostuko@centrum.cz,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,245,252,,,,,,8,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341783400027,0

Finite sample evidence suggests that the jump parameters can be accurately estimated and that the statistical inferences are reliable under the assumption that jumps are rare and large. Applications to equity market, treasury bond, and exchange rate data reveal important differences in jump frequencies and volatilities across asset classes over time. For investment grade bond spread indices, the estimated jump volatility has more forecasting power than interest rate factors and volatility factors including option-implied volatility, with control for systematic risk factors. The jump volatility risk factor seems to capture the low frequency movements in credit spreads and comoves countercyclically with the price-dividend ratio and corporate default rate.

Using a panel of 49 US States over the period 1980-2004, we study the non-stationarity and co-integration between health spending and income, ultimately measuring income elasticity of health care. The tests we adopt allow us to explicitly control for cross-section dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. Specifically, in our regression equations we assume that the error has a multifactor structure, which may capture global shocks and local spill overs in health expenditure. Our results suggest that health care is a necessity rather than a luxury, with an elasticity much smaller than that estimated in other US studies. Further, we detect significant spatial concentration in US health spending. Our broad perspective of cross-section dependence as well as the methods used to capture it give new insights on the debate over the relationship between health spending and income.

Additionally, we prove that this family endowed with the partial order of Lorenz domination is a lattice that has maximal and minimal elements. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We show that results generated by this approach are sensitive to the order of variables in the recursive identification scheme. In a four-factor model, one may obtain 18 different sets of answers out of 24 possible. We propose an alternative measure that is based on levels of macro variables as opposed to shocks. We account for the correlation between the macro and latent factors via projection of the latter onto the former. As a result, the association between macro variables and yields can be computed uniquely via an R-2. Macro variables explain 80% of the variation in the short rate and 50% of the slope, and 54% to 68% of the term premia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Components of the gains known to the agents and acted on by them may not be known by the observing economist. Such models are called correlated random coefficient models. Sorting on unobserved components of gains complicates the interpretation of what IV estimates. This paper examines testable implications of the hypothesis that agents do not sort into treatment based on gains. In it, we develop new tests to gauge the empirical relevance of the correlated random coefficient model to examine whether the additional complications associated with it are required. We examine the power of the proposed tests. We derive a new representation of the variance of the instrumental variable estimator for the correlated random coefficient model. We apply the methods in this paper to the prototypical empirical problem of estimating the return to schooling and find evidence of sorting into schooling based on unobserved components of gains.

Roughly 8.4 percent of children born in the month prior to their state's cutoff date for kindergarten eligibility - who typically become the youngest and most developmentally immature children within a grade - are diagnosed with ADHD, compared to 5.1 percent of children born in the month immediately afterward. A child's birth date relative to the eligibility cutoff also strongly influences teachers' assessments of whether the child exhibits ADHD symptoms but is only weakly associated with similarly measured parental assessments, suggesting that many diagnoses may be driven by teachers' perceptions of poor behavior among the youngest children in a classroom. These perceptions have long-lasting consequences: the youngest children in fifth and eighth grades are nearly twice as likely as their older classmates to regularly use stimulants prescribed to treat ADHD.

We used a multi-marker approach to explore discriminative abilities of several lipid, inflammatory, and oxidative stress/antioxidative defense markers as CAD predictors. We assessed their cost-effectiveness compared with the Framingham risk score (FRS). Methods: Using a decision model, we evaluated the costs, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of each model. The FRS was used as the baseline model. Other models were formed with the consecutive addition of selected markers: apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), apolipoprotein B (apoB), apolipoprotein (a) [apo(a)] isoform, lipoprotein (a), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase (SOD), sulfhydryl, and superoxide anion (O-2-). A best-case model was formed from a combination of diagnostic markers to yield the best patient stratification algorithm. All models were assessed by their predictive probabilities using receiver operating characteristic curves. To accomplish our goals, we recruited 188 CAD patients (verified by coronary angiography) and 197 asymptomatic CAD-free subjects for comparison. The analysis was performed from a third-party payer perspective. Results: Only two strategies had outstanding discriminative abilities: the best-case model (FRS, SOD, and O-2-) and FRS plus SOD with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.924 and 0.906, respectively. The cost-effectiveness ratio varied between 593 per AUC for the baseline model to 2425 per AUC for FRS plus apo(a) isoform. Strategies involving oxidative stress/antioxidative defense markers were more cost-effective than strategies involving lipid or inflammatory markers. All results were robust. Conclusion: Our results support the feasibility of a multimarker approach for CAD screening. The introduction of oxidative stress/antioxidative defense markers in the clinical laboratory would be convenient and cost-effective.","[Lakic, Dragana] Univ Belgrade, Fac Pharm, Inst Social Pharm & Pharm Legislat, Belgrade 11221, Serbia; [Bogavac-Stanojevic, Natasa; Jelic-Ivanovic, Zorana; Kotur-Stevuljevic, Jelena; Spasic, Slavica] Univ Belgrade, Fac Pharm, Inst Med Biochem, Belgrade 11221, Serbia; [Kos, Mitja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Pharm, Chair Social Pharm, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia",University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade; University of Ljubljana,"Lakic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Pharm, Inst Social Pharm & Pharm Legislat, 450 Vojvode Stepe St, Belgrade 11221, Serbia.",dlakic@pharmacy.bg.ac.rs,"Kos, Mitja/KCK-0806-2024; Kos, Mitja/C-7440-2019","Lakic, Dragana/0000-0002-6861-3888; Kos, Mitja/0000-0002-6801-6450","Ministry of Science and Environmental Protection, Republic of Serbia [145036B]","Ministry of Science and Environmental Protection, Republic of Serbia","This work was supported by a grant from the Ministry of Science and Environmental Protection, Republic of Serbia (Project no. 145036B).

The purpose of this study was to estimate patients' willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical new drug. Methods: Patients with lung cancer were recruited through referrals by senior specialists from two medical centers in Taiwan. Double-bounded dichotomous choice questions and follow-up open-ended questions were employed to elicit patients' WTP. The contingent valuation question assumed that a novel medication was available, which provided a cure for lung cancer; however, patients would have to pay for this new cure out of their own pocket. In addition, the question was asked as to how much patients would be willing to pay for supplementary hospitalization insurance? Interval regression and linear regression were used to estimate the maximum WTP. Results: A total of 294 patients were recruited; their mean age was 67 years; 74% were male and 26% were female. The results show that patients were prepared to pay New Taiwan dollar (NTD) 7416 or NTD 7032 per month to purchase this new medication. Sex, religion, income, the Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and having family that takes care of you are significant factors influencing a patient's WTP. Conclusions: Patients would like to pay less than the actual price of the new medication for their lung cancer. Thus government and health policymakers should consider the ability to pay when making their decision regarding the coverage of new drugs.","Natl Yang Ming Univ, Inst Hosp & Hlth Care Adm, Taipei 112, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Lang, HC (通讯作者)，Natl Yang Ming Univ, Inst Hosp & Hlth Care Adm, 155,Sec 2,Li Nong St, Taipei 112, Taiwan.",hclang@ym.edu.tw,"Lang, Hui-Chu/GXG-4373-2022",,Taiwan National Health Research Institute [NHRI-EX90-9007PC],Taiwan National Health Research Institute,This study was funded by grant NHRI-EX90-9007PC from the Taiwan National Health Research Institute.,,33,41,44,2,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2010,13.0,6,,,,,743,749,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00743.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,648BZ,20561327.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281666700008,0

Before the game starts one player receives a private signal that depends on the realized state of nature. The rules that govern the choice of the signal are determined by the information structure of the game. Different information structures induce different values.

In the models we study, covariate (or regression) effects are modeled additively by cubic splines, and the error distribution (that of the latent outcomes in the case of categorical data) is modeled as a Dirichlet process mixture. We employ a relatively unexplored but attractive basis in which the spline coefficients are the unknown function ordinates at the knots. We exploit this feature to develop a proper prior distribution on the coefficients that involves the first and second differences of the ordinates, quantities about which one may have prior knowledge. We also discuss the problem of comparing models with different numbers of knots or different error distributions through marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors which are computed within the framework of Chib (1995) as extended to DPM models by Basu and Chib (2003). The techniques are illustrated with simulated and real data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Khwaja, A",,,,"Khwaja, Ahmed",,,Estimating willingness to pay for medicare using a dynamic life-cycle model of demand for health insurance,JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Medicare; Willingness to pay; Life-cycle human capital; Dynamic discrete choice,SOCIAL-SECURITY; CARE; RETIREMENT; SPECIFICATION; TRANSITION; BEHAVIOR; OUTCOMES; REFORM; WORK,"Medicare is the largest health insurance program in the US. This paper uses a dynamic random utility model of demand for health insurance in a life-cycle human capital framework with endogenous production of health to calculate the individual willingness to pay (WTP) for Medicare. The model accounts for the feature that the demand for health insurance is derived through the demand for health, which is jointly determined with the production of health over the life-cycle. The WTP measure incorporates the effects of Medicare insurance on aggregate consumption through effects on medical expenditures and mortality, and consumption utility of health. The model is estimated using panel data from the Health and Retirement Study. The average WTP or change in lifetime expected utility resulting from delaying the age of eligibility to 67 is found to be $ 24,947 in 1991 dollars ($ 39,435 in 2008 dollars). However, there is considerable variation in the WTP, e.g., in 1991 dollars the WTP of individuals who have less than a high school education and are white is $ 28,347 ($ 44,810 in 2008 dollars), while the WTP of those with at least a college degree and who are neither white nor black is $ 15,584 ($ 24,635 in 2008 dollars). More generally, the less educated have a higher WTP to avoid a policy change that delays availability of Medicare benefits. Additional model simulations imply that the primary benefits of Medicare are insurance against medical expenditures with relatively smaller benefits in terms of improved health status and longevity. Medicare also leads to large increases in medical utilization due to deferring of medical care prior to eligibility. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Cohn, Z",,,,"Cohn, Zachary",,,A note on linked bargaining,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Linked bargaining; Mechanism design; Bayesian equilibrium; Efficiency,,"A recent result by Jackson and Sonnenschein (2007) describes a general framework for overcoming incentive constraints by linking together independent copies of a Bayesian decision problem. A special case of that work shows that if copies of a standard two-player Bayesian bargaining problem are independently linked (players receive valuations and trade simultaneously on a number of identical copies), then the utility cost associated with incentive constraints tends to 0 as the number of linked problems tends to infinity. We improve upon that result, increasing the rate of convergence from polynomial to exponential and eliminating unwanted trades in the limit, by introducing a mechanism that uses a slightly richer and more refined strategy space. Although very much in the same spirit, our declarations are constrained by a distribution which is skewed away from the expected distribution of player types. When a sufficiently large number of bargaining problems are linked, truth is an equilibrium. Moreover, this equilibrium is incentive compatible with the utility cost of incentive constraints almost surely equal to 0. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One key feature of our method, which we call the tailored randomized block Metropolis-Hastings (TaRB-MH) method, is the random clustering of the parameters at every iteration into all arbitrary number of blocks. Then each block is sequentially updated through an M-H step. Another feature is that the proposal density for each block is tailored to the location and curvature of the target density based on the output of simulated annealing, following Chib and Greenberg ( 1994, 1995) and Chib and Ergashev (in press). We also provide all extended version of our method for sampling multi-modal distributions in which at a pre-specified mode jumping iteration, a single-block proposal is generated from one of the modal regions using a Mixture proposal density, and this proposal is then accepted according to all M-H probability of move. At the non-mode jumping iterations, the draws are obtained by applying the TaRB-MH algorithm. We also discuss flow the approaches of Chib (1995) and Chib and Jeliazkov (2001) call be adapted to these sampling schemes for estimating the model marginal likelihood. The methods are illustrated in several problems. In the DSGE model of Smets and Wouters (2007), for example, which involves a 36-dimensional posterior distribution, we show that the autocorrelations of the sampled draws from the TaRB-MH algorithm decay to zero within 30-40 lags for most parameters. In contrast, the sampled draws from the random-walk M-H method, the algorithm that has been used to date in the context of DSGE models, exhibit significant autocorrelations even at lags 2500 and beyond. Additionally, the RW-MH does not explore the same high density regions of the posterior distribution as the TaRB-MH algorithm. Another example concerns the model of An and Schorfheide (2007) where the posterior distribution is Multimodal. While the RW-MH algorithm is Unable to jump from the low modal region to the high modal region, and vice-versa, we show that the extended TaRB-MH method explores the posterior distribution globally in all efficient manner.

We will suggest that the paradigm based on the consistency of assets, cultural product and communication could achieve different competitive advantages, like distinctiveness, comprehension and experience of a place and its culture, also meeting the need of authenticity expressed by new publics.

We aimed to quantify correlations among these factors and characterize their level of inclusion in economic analyses that are part of informed medical decision-making. Methods: A comprehensive, stepwise systematic literature review was performed on published articles dated 1993 to 2008 using medical subject heading and keyword searches in electronic reference libraries. Data were collected using standardized techniques and were analyzed descriptively. Results: A total of 97 articles fulfilling all inclusion criteria were reviewed, including 16 on economic models (17% of articles). Most studies were retrospective (41 of 97; 42%) and from managed care perspectives (66%). Oral antidiabetic drugs were a central focus, appearing in 83% of studies. Patient behaviors, particularly medication adherence and persistence in real-world settings, are well researched (n = 65) and may influence diabetes outcomes, cardiovascular risk, mortality rates, and treatment-specific resource use (e.g., hospitalizations) and costs (<= 3400 annually per patient). Nevertheless, they are absent from current economic models. Conclusions: Strong correlations exist between patient behaviors, perspectives of care, health outcomes, and costs in T2D. Enhancing their inclusion in pharmacoeconomic modeling, notably the influence on clinical effectiveness of variation in self-management between treatments, should ultimately lead to more accurate estimates of comparative cost-effectiveness, and thereby improve value-based resource allocation and patient access to appropriate therapy.","[Cobden, David S.; Niessen, Louis W.; Rutten, Frans F.

Under this misspecification, the model's estimators are inconsistent. When endogeneity occurs at the level of each observation, the principal technique used to treat for it is the control-function method, where a function that accounts for the endogenous part of the error term is constructed and is then included as an additional variable in the choice model. Alternatively, the latent-variable method can also address endogeneity. In this case, the omitted quality attribute is considered as a latent variable and modeled as a function of observed variables and/or measured through indicators. The link between the control-function and the latent-variable methods in the correction for endogeneity has not been established in previous work. This paper analyzes the similarities and differences between a set of variations of both methods, establishes the formal link between them in the correction for endogeneity, and illustrates their properties using a Monte Carlo experiment.

To date, there are not guidelines for estimating the cost of drugs financed by US public programs.

Methods: This report was prepared by the ISPOR Task Force on Good Research Practices-Use of Drug Costs for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Medicare, Medicaid, and other US Government Payers Subgroup. The Subgroup was convened to assess the methodological and practical issues confronted by researchers when estimating the cost of drugs financed by US public programs, and to propose standards for more transparent, accurate and consistent costing methods. Results: The Subgroup proposed these recommendations: 1) researchers must consider regulation requirements that affect the drug cost paid by public programs; 2) drug cost must represent the actual acquisition cost, incorporating any rebates or discounts; 3) transparency with respect to cost inputs must be ensured; 4) inclusion of the public program's perspective is recommended; 5) high cost drugs require special attention, particularly when drugs represent a significant proportion of health-care expenditures for a specific disease; and 6) because of variations across public programs, sensitivity analyses for actual acquisition cost, real-world adherence, and generics availability are warranted. Specific recommendations also were proposed for the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Conclusions: As pharmacoeconomic evaluations for coverage decisions made by US public programs grows, the need for precise and consistent estimation of drug costs is warranted. Application of the proposed recommendations will allow researchers to include accurate and unbiased cost estimates in pharmacoeconomic evaluations.","[Mullins, C.

Emerging treatments may prolong life; however, these result in additional monetary costs. Accurate estimation of their economic impact requires reliable estimates on preferences for health states. The purpose was to estimate preference weights from the general population in four developed countries for standardized health states experienced by persons with CML. Methods: Time trade-off preferences with a 10-year time horizon were elicited for CML-related health states using an interviewer-administered survey from convenience samples in Canada (n = 103), the United States (n = 74), the UK (n = 97), and Australia (n = 79). Standardized descriptions of seven CML-related health states (characterizing chronic, accelerated and blast phases, each with responding and nonresponding state, and adverse events of treatment) were derived in consultation with oncologists. Generalized linear models were used to estimate whether utilities, adjusted for age and sex, differed by country. Results: The mean age of the sample (n = 357) was 45 years and 46% were male. Mean unadjusted preference values of CML-related health states ranged from 0.84 for Chronic phase responding to treatment to 0.21 for Blast phase, not responding to treatment. For each phase, preferences were lower for the nonresponding state. After adjustment for age and sex, considerable variability was observed in mean preference values between countries. Conclusion: These data quantify the deteriorating impact of CML disease progression and the impact of nonresponse to treatment. The study results add to evidence from other disease areas that systematic differences exist in preference values between countries.","[Szabo, Shelagh M.; Levy, Adrian R.] Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Vancouver, BC V6B 1P1, Canada; [Levy, Adrian R.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Davis, Catherine] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA; [Holyoake, Tessa L.] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Cortes, Jorge] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA",University of British Columbia; Bristol-Myers Squibb; University of Glasgow; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center,"Levy, AR (通讯作者)，Oxford Outcomes Ltd, 450-688 W Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 1P1, Canada.",adrian.levy@oxfordoutcomes.com,"Cortes, Jorge/ABA-0627-2022; holyoake, tessa/M-3668-2015","Cortes, Jorge/0000-0002-8636-1071; holyoake, tessa/0000-0002-0608-6066",Bristol-Myers Squibb Company,Bristol-Myers Squibb Company(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This study was presented in part at the Annual Meeting of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research (ISPOR) European Congress 2007.

Concentrtions of selected parameters of energy profile: glucose (GLU), cholesterol (CHOL) and nitrogenous profile: bilirubin, urea, total proteins (TP) in blood plasma were measured. Significant differences among groups of dairy cows were evaluated by statistical programme Sigma Plot 11.0. Differences among the groups at p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 using test ANOVA one way were considered as significant. In conclusion, we detected some significant differences, especially concentration of bilirubin was higher statistically significant at the beginning of lactation (6.50+5.89 mu kat.l(-1); p < 0.05) in comparison to group during dry period (0.92 +/- 0.29 mu kat.l(-1); p < 0.05).

The background is an apparent convergence ill practice of the work conducted under both traditions. In the light of these methodological developments, We contrast it health planner who wants to maximise health and one who wants to minimise disability. To isolate the effect of framing the problem from a health or a disability perspective, we do not use age-weighting in calculating DALY and employ a common discounting methodology and the same set of quality of life weights. We find that interventions will be ranked in a systematically different way. The difference, however, is not determined by the use of a health or a disability perspective but by the use of life expectancy tables to determine the years of life lost. We show that this feature of the DALY method is problematic and we suggest its dismissal in favour of a fixed reference age rendering the use of it health or a disability perspective merely stylistic.

Research Design and Methods: Psychometric validity of the DSC-R was assessed using blinded data from a large-scale trial of approximately 4000 type 2 diabetes patients. Confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA) and multitrait analysis were used to examine the construct validity of the structure of DSC-R. DSC-R internal consistency, discriminative validity, and responsiveness were also assessed. Distribution and anchor-based methods were used to estimate minimal important differences for DSC-R domains. Results: Mean age of the sample was 56 years, 42% were female, 88% were Caucasian. Patients had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 32.2 and mean glucose-fasting level of 151.7 md/dl. CFA and multitrait analysis indicated that the scoring of the DSC-R has acceptable construct validity. Item-scale correlations ranged from 0.44 to 0.78. Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.69 to 0.87. At baseline, DSC-R scores were higher among patients with higher BMI scores (P < 0.0001), supporting the discriminative validity of the DSC-R. Minimal important difference estimates ranged from 0.39 to 0.60 points when using distribution methods and from 0.00 to 0.33 when estimated using anchor-based methods. Conclusions: The DSC-R demonstrated excellent psychometric properties when tested in a large-scale diabetes clinical trial. Responsiveness and test-retest reliability of the DSC-R warrant further evaluation.","[Arbuckle, Robert A.] Mapi Values, Adelphi Mill, Bollington, Macclesfield SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England; [Vardeva, Kawitha] Amgen Ltd, Cambridge, England; [Arondekar, Bhakti] GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Danten-Viala, Muriel] Mapi Values, Lyon, France; [Snoek, Frank J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Adelphi Group Ltd; Amgen; Amgen Limited; GlaxoSmithKline; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Arbuckle, RA (通讯作者)，Mapi Values, Adelphi Mill, Bollington, Macclesfield SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England.",Rob.Arbuckle@mapivalues.com,,"Snoek, Frank/0000-0001-9563-6762",GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals,GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals(GlaxoSmithKline),"The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of the ADOPT steering committee in designing the ADOPT trial and collecting the data as well as commenting on a draft of the article.

Methods: The development and validation of the MCQ took place in four phases. Phase 1 reviewed the literature and examined existing measures. In Phase 2, the selected instrument (CPCI) was reviewed by a panel of experts using a stepwise consensus procedure. In Phase 3, the adapted 21-item MCQ was administered to 200 outpatients attending oncology appointments. The instrument was refined to 15 items and in Phase 4, it was completed by 477 oncology outpatients. The psychometric properties of the new instrument were assessed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis, multitrait scaling analysis, and by comparing MCQ scores between known groups. Results: EFA of the 15-item MCQ suggested three subscales with acceptable to good reliability: Communication alpha = 0.69; Coordination alpha = 0.84; and Preferences alpha = 0.75. Comparing known groups showed that patients who saw fewer doctors during their clinic visits reported stronger Preferences to see their usual doctor and rated Communication with their doctors as better than patients who saw more doctors during their clinic visits. Conclusion: The MCQ demonstrates good psychometric properties in the target population. It is a brief and simple-to-use instrument, which provides a valid perspective on patients' experiences of communicating with doctors and their perceptions of the continuity and coordination of their cancer care.","[Harley, Clare] St James Univ Hosp, St Jamess Inst Oncol, Canc Res UK Clin Ctr Leeds, Canc Med Res Unit, Leeds LS9 7TF, W Yorkshire, England; [Brown, Julia] Univ Leeds, Clin Trials & Res Unit, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Cancer Research UK; Saint James's University Hospital; University of Leeds,"Harley, C (通讯作者)，St James Univ Hosp, St Jamess Inst Oncol, Canc Res UK Clin Ctr Leeds, Canc Med Res Unit, Room 142,Level 3,Beckett St, Leeds LS9 7TF, W Yorkshire, England.",c.harley@leeds.ac.uk,"Brown, Jamie/F-4413-2011; Harley, Clare/C-9829-2010","Brown, Jamie/0000-0002-2797-5428; brown, julia/0000-0002-2719-7064; Harley, Clare/0000-0002-8800-4238",Cancer Research UK [C7775/A294],Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK),"This study was funded by Cancer Research UK C7775/A294.

J,"Lambo, LD; Tchantcho, B; Moulen, J",,,,"Lambo, Lawrence Diffo; Tchantcho, Bertrand; Moulen, Joel",,,A core of voting games with improved foresight,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Voting games; Core; Stability set; Foresighted core; P-core; No-regret property,STABILITY SET; NON-EMPTINESS,"This paper considers voting situations in which the vote takes place iteratively. If a coalition replaces the status quo a with a contestant b, then b becomes the new status quo, and the vote goes on until a candidate is reached that no winning coalition is willing to replace. It is well known that the core, that is, the set of undominated alternatives, may be empty. To alleviate this problem, Rubinstein [Rubinstein, A., 1980. Stability of decision systems under majority rule. journal of Economic Theory 23, 150-159] assumes that voters look forward one vote before deciding to replace an alternative by a new one. They will not do so if the new status quo is going to be replaced by a third that is less interesting than the first. The stability set, that is, the set of undominated alternatives under this behavior, is always non-empty when preferences are strict. However, this is not necessarily the case when voters' indifference is allowed. Le Breton and Salles [Le Breton, M., Salles, M., 1990. The stability set of voting games: Classification and generecity results. International Journal of Game Theory 19, 111-127], Li [Li, S., 1993. Stability of voting games. Social Choice and Welfare 10,51-56] and Martin [Martin, M., 1998. Quota games and stability set of order d. Economic Letters 59, 145-151] extend the sophistication of the voters by having them look d votes forward along the iterative process. For d sufficiently large, the resulting set of undominated alternatives is always non-empty even if indifference is allowed. We show that it may be unduly large. Next, by assuming that other voters along a chain of votes are also rational, that is, they also look forward to make sure that the votes taking place later on will not lead to a worst issue for them, we are able to reduce the size of this set while insuring its non-emptiness. Finally, we show that a vote with sufficient foresight satisfies a no-regret property, contrarily to the classical core and the stability set.

Methods: Using grounded theory methodologies, we identified key concepts through interviews with 25 COPD patients, review of scientific literature, and input from 22 experts. Results: Constant comparative thematic analysis of data suggested five primary components of the dyspnea experience: breathlessness, fatigue, activity modification, activity limitation, and emotional response. Two major influences on dyspnea were described as individual exertion and exposure to environmental factors. Patients described a sense of dyspnea-related fear, and reported distress over the impact of dyspnea on health and activity limitation. They emphasized coping via behavioral strategies and medication, and reported that dyspnea caused the stopping or scaling back of activities, taking more time to do things and using adaptive measures or equipment. No existing model of dyspnea in COPD incorporated all of these concepts. We, therefore, developed a dyspnea-specific conceptual model in which the most proximal of concepts (dyspnea symptoms) can impair function and are mediated by personal and environmental factors. Conclusion: Patient and expert input guided the development of a comprehensive dyspnea-specific conceptual model for COPD which will inform the design of future patient-reported outcome measurement tools used to assess dyspnea and related functional limitations.","[Victorson, David E.; Yount, Susan; Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Dept Med Social Sci, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Anton, Susan] Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceut Inc, Ridgefield, CT 06877 USA; [Hamilton, Alan] Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceut Inc Canada Ltd, Burlington, ON, Canada",Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Boehringer Ingelheim; Boehringer Ingelheim,"Victorson, DE (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Med Social Sci, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",d-victorson@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,34,28,32,2,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2009,12.0,6,,,,,1018,1025,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00547.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,474SP,19402847.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000268304600021,0

With consumption ratcheting, the investor demands the running maximum of the optimal plan a conventional time-additive investor with lower initial wealth would choose.

The analysis is based on exact small sample regret and does not use asymptotic approximations or finite-sample bounds. Core results are: (i) Minimax regret treatment rules are well approximated by empirical success rules in many cases, but differ from them significantly both in terms of how the rules look and in terms of maximal regret incurred - for small sample sizes and certain sample designs. (ii) Absent prior cross-covariate restrictions on treatment outcomes, they prescribe inference that is completely separate across covariates, leading to no-data rules as the support of a covariale grows. I conclude by offering an assessment of these results. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Tests for parameter instability and structural change with unknown change point. Econometrica 61, 821-856.] and Andrews and Ploberger [Andrews, D.W.K., Ploberger, W., 1994. Optimal tests when a nuisance parameter is present only under the alternative. Econometrica 62, 1383-1414.]. We derive the approximate Bahadur slopes of these tests using large deviations techniques. These show that tests based on the Mean functional are inferior to those based on the Sup and Exp when using the same base statistic. Also, for a given functional, which dominates the LM-based one. We show that the Wald-based test dominates the LR-based test, the Sup- and Mean-type tests satisfy Wieand's [Wieand, H.S., 1976. A Condition under which the Pitman and Bahadur approaches to efficiency coincide. Annals of Statistics 4, 1003-1011.] condition so that their slopes yield the limiting (as the size tends to zero) asymptotic relative Pitman efficiency (whether this holds for the Exp-type tests still remains a conjecture). Using this measure of efficiency, the Mean-type tests are also inferior to the Sup. We also compare tests based on the Wald and LM statistics modified with a HAC estimator. In this case, the inferiority of the LM-based tests is especially pronounced. The relevance of our theoretical results in finite samples is assessed via simulations. Our results are in contrast to those obtained by the authors - in the second reference cited above - based on a local asymptotic framework, and our analysis thereby reveals its potential weaknesses in the context of structural change problems.

We obtained data from a Phase III trial of atrasentan in metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients (n = 809). We determined anchor-based differences using Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), hemoglobin, time to disease progression (TTP), adverse events (AE), and survival. One-third and one-half standard deviation and standard error of measurement (SEM) were used as distribution-based criteria for CMCs. Comparison across baseline FACT-P domains and derived scales [FACT-P total score, Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score, prostate cancer subscale (PCS) score, pain-related score, and FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom Index (FAPSI)] were conducted for KPS, BAP, and hemoglobin using Student's t tests. Twelve-week change scores were compared for TTP, AE, and survival using ANCOVA. CMCs were estimated as 6 to 10 for FACT-P total score, 5 to 9 for FACT-P TOI score, 2 to 3 for FACT-P PCS, 1 to 2 for the 4 PCS pain-related questions, and 2 to 3 for FAPSI. CMCs were also estimated using distribution-based criteria. Kappa statistics were computed to determine the degree of correspondence between the recommended guideline of 1.0 SEM and empirically derived standards. Most of the kappas for health-related quality of life domains and SEM standards had substantial to almost perfect concordance. The significant relationship between clinical and quality of life data provides support for the use of CMCs to increase interpretability of FACT-P scores.","[Nichol, Michael B.] Univ So Calif, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Cella, David; Eton, David] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Inst Healthcare Studies, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Cella, David; Eton, David] Evanston NW Healthcare, CORE, Evanston, IL USA; [Mulani, Parvez] Abbott Labs, Abbott Pk, IL 60064 USA; [Nelson, Joel B.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Pittsburgh, PA USA",University of Southern California; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; NorthShore University Health System; Abbott Laboratories; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Nichol, MB (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, 1985 Zonal Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA.",mnichol@usc.edu,"Nichol, Michael/AHE-6000-2022","Nichol, Michael/0000-0003-4989-9806; Eton, David/0000-0001-8715-1511",,,,,28,154,164,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,124,129,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00409.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,18647260.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000262696800019,0

Sea-level rise will increase erosion of beaches, cause saltwater intrusion into water supplies, inundate coastal marshes and other important habitats, and make coastal property more vulnerable to erosion and flooding. Yet most coastal areas are currently managed under the premise that sea-level rise is not significant and the shorelines are static or can be fixed in place by engineering structures. The new reality of sea-level rise and extreme weather due to climate change requires a new style of planning and management to protect resources and reduce risk to humans. Scientists must: (1) assess existing coastal vulnerability to address short term management issues and (2) model future landscape change and develop sustainable plans to address long term planning and management issues. Furthermore, this information must be effectively transferred to planners, managers, and elected officials to ensure their decisions are based upon the best available information. While there is still some uncertainty regarding the details of rising sea level and climate change, development decisions are being made today which commit public and private investment in real estate and associated infrastructure. With a design life of 30 yrs to 75 yrs or more, many of these investments are on a collision course with rising sea level and the resulting impacts will be significant. In the near term, the utilization of engineering structures may be required, but these are not sustainable and must ultimately yield to managed withdrawal programs if higher sea-level elevations or rates of rise are forthcoming. As an initial step towards successful adaptation, coastal management and planning documents (i.e., comprehensive plans) must be revised to include reference to climate change and rising sea-level.","[Parkinson, Randall W.] RW Parkinson Consulting Inc, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",,,,,,,,,,10,7,7,3,31,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-0694-0,AIP CONF PROC,,,2009,1157.0,,,,,,19,25,,,,,,7,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BLH26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000270167600003,0

The simulations account for a range of situations that may be encountered by researchers in actual practice-varying degrees of endogeneity, instrument strength, instrument contamination, and sample size. The intent of this article is to provide researchers with more intuition with respect to how important these factors are from an empirical standpoint. Results: Notably, the simulations indicate a greater potential for inferential error when using IV than OLS in all but the most ideal circumstances. Conclusions: Researchers should be cautious when using IV methods. These methods are valuable in testing for the presence of endogeneity but only under the most ideal circumstances are they likely to produce estimates with less estimation error than OLS.","[Crown, William H.] OptumInsight Life Sci, Waltham, MA USA; [Henk, Henry J.] OptumInsight Life Sci, Eden Prairie, MN USA; [Vanness, David J.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA",Optum; Optum; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Crown, WH (通讯作者)，OptumInsight Life Sci, 950 Winter St,Suite 3800, Waltham, MA USA.",bill.crown@innovus.com,,"Vanness, David/0000-0002-9790-2988",,,,,27,41,43,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2011,14.0,8,,,,,1078,1084,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.06.009,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BM,22152177.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081900014,0

Since the global game solution in symmetric 3 x 3 supermodular games is known to be independent of the noise structure, this result implies that a noise-independent selection in global games may not be a robust equilibrium. Our proof reveals that the assumption in global games that the noise errors are independent of the state imposes a non-trivial restriction on incomplete information perturbations.

Some studies indicated that more competition led to a faster patient turnover rate, higher hospital costs, and lower hospital efficiency. Since the 1980s some studies found market competition could increase the efficiency of inpatient services. However, there were few studies testing the market competition during a hospital's earlier stages on its efficiency during later stages, or the dynamic of efficiency. In this study, we examined the effect of early-stage market competition on later-stage hospital efficiency in Taiwan, and we determine the efficiency change using longitudinal study design. The data for the analysis came from the annual national hospital survey of 1996 and 2001 provided by the Department of Health. There were 102 teaching hospital be analysed. The results show that no evidence supports the proposition that higher market competition would improve the efficiency of hospitals in delivering inpatient services in Taiwan. Importantly, neither was the inefficiency score nor the Malmquist productivity index of inpatient services associated with the level of hospital market competition, regardless of the adjustment for hospital characteristics. However, the results may be related with the hospital increasing beds investment behavior.

The method entails first integrating intra-day data into the Realized Laplace Transform of volatility, which is a model-free estimate of the daily integrated empirical Laplace transform of the unobservable volatility. The estimation is then done by matching moments of the integrated joint Laplace transform with those implied by the parametric volatility model. In the empirical application, the best fitting volatility model is a non-diffusive two-factor model where low activity jumps drive its persistent component and more active jumps drive the transient one.

Affecting youth weight was not a goal of this program. However, health economics research suggests that the provision of schooling, health information sessions and sizable cash transfers to Oportunidades participants could have substantially changed their overweight and obesity rates. Exploiting an exogenous jump in program participation by means of a fuzzy Regression Discontinuity (RD) design, the evidence of this paper suggests that Oportunidades decreased obesity among participant women. The identified local average treatment effect (LATE) at the threshold for program eligibility suggests that female obesity would decrease if the program was expanded to cover slightly better-off households. The design of the program does not allow disentangling the causal pathways that contributed to the lower prevalence of obesity among women, but the effect likely resulted from increased access to information and schooling, improved dietary quality, increased monitoring of health outcomes and (possibly) increased physical activity. Suggestive evidence shows that teen pregnancy rates were higher among non-participants. Therefore, weight gain after childbirth might also explain higher obesity rates among non-participant females.

Conventional econometric count data models produce results that are commonly found in empirical work; the effect of higher socioeconomic status on healthy behavior is positive and generally statistically significant, but the average partial effects are in some cases small and imprecisely estimated. For both behaviors, subsequent latent class models identify two subpopulations - or groups of people - with different sets of preferences; one group has low latent demands, but for these individuals, average partial effects of socioeconomic status are generally stronger than those predicted by the conventional models. The other smaller group consists of individuals who have high latent demands, but whose variability in behavior is poorly explained by socioeconomic status. Posterior analysis shows that individuals with higher socioeconomic status are more likely to belong to the healthier of these two groups. Proxies for time preferences, risk, self-control, and time constraints are also found to be important in characterizing high latent demand groups for PA and FV.

The paper complements the result in two respects. First, it is shown that the coalition structure core, if non-empty, can be reached from any outcome via a sequence of successive blocks in quadratic time. Second, we observe that an analogous result holds for accessible outcomes, namely, the collection of accessible outcomes, if non-empty, is a minimal dominant set. Moreover, we give an existence theorem for accessible outcomes, which implies that the minimal dominant set of a cohesive game is exactly the coalition structure core or the collection of accessible outcomes, either of which can be reached from any outcome in linear time.

It is one of the first applications in the economics literature to incorporate data on web searches from Google Insights for Search, and these unique data allow the opportunity to estimate the association between weekly unemployment insurance (UI) claims, in addition to monthly unemployment rates, and search indexes for depression and anxiety. Results from state fixed effects models yield (1) a positive relationship between the unemployment rate and the depression search index and (2) a negative relationship between initial UI claims on the one hand and the depression and anxiety search indexes on the other. A lag analysis also shows that an extended period of higher levels of continued UI claims is associated with a higher depression search index. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Because of the NP hardness of the problem there is no polynomial method available for its solution. It is observed in practice that the optimal solution cannot be obtained in the reasonable time with use of the branch-and-bound method. One way to solve the problem is the column generation method. In the paper we use this method for solving the case study vehicle routing problem with a set of identical vehicles with the given capacity. There is a set of customers with given demand and the transportation cost matrix. The goal is to find a set of routes to cover all demands with minimal costs. The method stepwise generates columns (routes) of the set covering problem. Two problems and models are solved by turns - the cover problem with a reduced set of routes and the problem which generates a new route to decrease the transportation costs of the cover problem. The computation experiences are shown in the paper.,"[Fabry, Jan; Korenar, Vaclav; Kobzareva, Maria] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,,fabry@vse.cz; korenar@vse.cz; mariakobzareva@gmail.com,,,,,,,4,10,10,0,2,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRUHONICE,"NA SIDLISTI 152, PRUHONICE, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,140,144,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309074600023,0

An existence of a consensus in the OCRP crucially depends on initial decision makers' preferences: rankings of n objects from the 1st to the nth place. When those rankings are markedly different, there is high entropy (uncertainty) associated with DMs' preferences and a unique consensus within a group is unlikely to be achieved. However, when DMs' rankings are similar, the entropy is small and a consensus is much more likely to be obtained. In the article a relationship between the relative entropy of DMs preferences and an agreement among four classic methods' for OCRP solutions is discussed on several examples. Moreover, experimental evaluation of the relationship is performed and our results indicate that there is a negative relation between the relative entropy and the agreement among methods' solutions, e. g. the higher is the relative entropy, the lower is the methods' agreement. The question remains whether a theoretical relation connecting the entropy and a solution existence (or agreement among methods' solutions) to OCRP can be derived in general.","[Fiedor, Jan] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Dept Intelligent Syst, DITS FIT BUT, Brno 61266, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,,ifiedor@fit.vutbr.cz; mazurek@opf.slu.cz,"Mazurek, Jiri/Z-1303-2019",,,,,,11,2,2,0,1,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRUHONICE,"NA SIDLISTI 152, PRUHONICE, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,157,162,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309074600026,0

ADEs are a burden not only to patients and their relatives, but also to society and have the potential to involve high costs. To provide more information on the economic burden of preventable adverse drug events of outpatients, we performed a cost study on the data collected in the Hospital Admissions Related to Medication (HARM) study. In this study we examined the frequency, preventability, and risk factors for hospital admissions related to medication. Methods: The average costs for a preventable medication-related hospital admission were calculated by summing the direct medical costs and the production losses of all the preventable admissions, taking into account the different types of hospitals (academic and general) and the age of the admitted patients. Results: The average medical costs for one preventable medication-related hospital admission were (sic)5461. The average production loss costs for one admission were (sic)1712 for a person younger than 65 years of age. Combining the medical costs and the costs of production losses resulted in average costs of (sic)6009 for one, potentially preventable, medication-related hospital admission for all ages. Conclusions: The costs of potentially preventable hospital admissions related to medication are considerable. Therefore, patient safety interventions to prevent ADEs and hospital admissions may be cost-effective or even cost saving.

We estimate the DSGE model in order to obtain trajectories of exogenous shocks. We test the estimated model for its data-matching properties to show that is sufficiently approximates the real economy. Based on the model, we decompose the deviation of output from trend into contributions of the exogenous shocks. This decomposition allows us to interpret the economic sources of the fluctuations in the output gap. We show that since the year 2000, the foreign demand shock and the exchange rate shock have been increasingly important for the domestic business cycle. Overall, domestic shocks account for more than a half of the variance in the domestic output gap. We contrast the recession of 1997-1998, caused primarily by domestic shocks, to the recession of 2009, which was caused by a drop in the foreign demand. We also find that the Czech economy is sensitive to the exchange rate movements, as documented by year 2002.","[Motl, Tomas; Vasicek, Osvald] Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,175869@mail.muni.cz; Osvald.Vasicek@econ.muni.cz,"Vašíček, Osvald/AAR-5742-2021","Vašíček, Osvald/0000-0003-3805-4939",,,,,3,0,0,0,0,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,492,497,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309074600081,0

The first method allows for the possibility that a superior technology will become available in the future. The second advocates modeling both the prevalent and all future incident patient cohorts. Unfortunately, for value of information analysis, the period of time over which information about the decision problem would be useful is very uncertain, and existing estimates are seemingly arbitrary. Furthermore, there is very little literature on the historical lifetimes of technologies. Here, I quantify and analyze the historical lifetimes of drugs in England. I then apply this information to inform the value of further research and the cost-effectiveness of health technologies. Methods: A Weibull regression model was fitted to the historical drug lifetimes of 455 drugs. These represented all British National Formulary drugs in England which were launched from 1981 to 2007, and which did not have very low sales volumes. Results: The mean drug lifetime was 57 years (95% confidence interval 39-79 years), and the median was 46 years (35-60 years). Drugs with low sales volumes tended to have shorter lifetimes. Under certain assumptions, the ratio of population level to per-year expected value of information is 21. Drug lifetimes are used to parameterize the two models of cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: The distribution function of the historical lifetimes of drugs can inform suitable time horizons for: 1) value of information; and 2) cost-effectiveness analyses related to drugs.","Univ Exeter, PenTAG, Peninsular Coll Med & Dent, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Hoyle, M (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, PenTAG, Peninsular Coll Med & Dent, Veysey Bldg,Salmon Pool Lane, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England.",martin.hoyle@pms.ac.uk,,"Hoyle, Martin/0000-0001-5593-9777",,,,,27,13,14,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,885,892,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00778.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20825623.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000285066200006,0

After controlling for baseline covariates, standard Cox models estimated that adherence was associated with increased risk of complication with hazard ratio (HR) of 1.09 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.18). With adjustment of time-varying confounders as exogenous variables, the HR was 0.96 (0.88, 1.04). Using the MSM technique, the HR was 0.76 (95% bootstrap CI: 0.60, 0.92), indicating a significant benefit of medication adherence with hypoglycemics on the reduction of microvascular complications. This result contrasts with the negative results obtained in the hazard model, and is more consistent with prior clinical trial results Conclusion: Unlike conventional models, MSMs estimated that higher medication adherence may result in reduced risk of microvascular complications among patients with type 2 diabetes.","[Yu, Andrew P.] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Yu, Andrew P.; Nichol, Michael B.] Univ So Calif, Sch Pharm, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Yu, Yanni F.] Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceut Inc, Ridgefield, CT 06877 USA",Analysis Group Inc.; University of Southern California; Boehringer Ingelheim,"Yu, AP (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",andrewyupeng@gmail.com,"Nichol, Michael/AHE-6000-2022","Nichol, Michael/0000-0003-4989-9806",,,,,24,37,52,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,1038,1045,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00787.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20946182.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000285066200023,0

In a variable environment, however, the coexistence of varying preferences no longer requires optimality, but is identified with the mathematical property of viability: a state of the population is viable if there exists at least one solution starting from it and remaining in the set of constraints until a given time horizon (or forever). The coexistence kernel of two competitors with varying preferences is computed for the case of scalar and 2 x 2 Leslie matrices, with either measurable or differentiable preferences. The homologue of indifference curves is the regulation map, the correspondence associating the set of viable preferences to a given state of the population. Among these viable trajectories, some are also optimal in the sense of dominance discounted in time. These viable optimal solutions are obtained as specific trajectories in an auxiliary dynamic system, and the associated maximal values constitute one boundary of the viability kernel of this auxiliary system (theorem). Hence, the perpetuation of varying preferences allows the diversity of economic preferences, as shown here using the example of the comparative history of fertility from mid-nineteenth century to nowadays in France and England.

Our main contribution is to consider a realistic demographic setup that allows characterizing the age at which individuals decide to give birth to their children. In such a framework, we aim at studying the existence of an equilibrium.

To the extent that deciphering the intricacies of alternative plans consumes time and money; the Medicare health plan market is one in which search costs may play an important role. To account for this, we split beneficiaries into two groups - those who are informed and those who are uninformed. If uninformed, beneficiaries only use a subset of covariates to compute their maximum utilities, and if informed, they use the full set of variables considered. In a Bayesian framework with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we estimate search cost coefficients based on the minimum and maximum statistics of the search cost distribution, incorporating both horizontal differentiation and information heterogeneities across eligibles. Our results suggest that, conditional on being uninformed, older, higher income beneficiaries with lower self-reported health status are more likely to utilize easier access to information.

However, there is also reason to believe that such programs can affect other outcomes, such as the sexual behavior of their young beneficiaries. Zomba Cash Transfer Program is a randomized ongoing CCT intervention targeting young women in Malawi that provides incentives (in the form of school fees and cash transfers) to current schoolgirls and recent dropouts to stay in or return to school. An average offer of US$10/month conditional on satisfactory school attendance plus direct payment of secondary school fees led to significant declines in early marriage, teenage pregnancy, and self-reported sexual activity among program beneficiaries after just one year of program implementation. For program beneficiaries who were out of school at baseline, the probability of getting married and becoming pregnant declined by more than 40 and 30%, respectively. In addition, the incidence of the onset of sexual activity was 38% lower among all program beneficiaries than the control group. Overall, these results suggest that CCT programs not only serve as useful tools for improving school attendance but may also reduce sexual activity, teen pregnancy, and early marriage.

One of the conditions considered is that of Correlation Increasing Majorization (CIM) which has been studied in the existing literature. A new condition called Weighting of Attributes under Unidirectional Comonotonicity (WAUC) is introduced. It requires that, in the case where the allocation of all attributes are comonotonic and attribute i is more unequally distributed than attribute j, a reduction of inequality of i is socially more beneficial than that of inequality off. An MGI is constructed by taking each individual's well-being to be a weighted average of the attribute levels and applying the univariate Gini formula to the resulting vector of individual well-beings. The weights, same for all individuals, are determined by the attribute levels of all the individuals. It is shown that the suggested MGI satisfies both CIM and WAUC. The existing literature does not seem to contain any other MGI satisfying these two conditions simultaneously. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, they may buy private insurance instead if their income exceeds the compulsory insurance threshold. Here, premia are based on age and health, individuals may choose to what extent they are covered, and deductibles and co-payments are common. In this paper, we estimate the effect of private insurance coverage on the number of doctor visits, the number of nights spent in a hospital and self-assessed health. Variation in income around the compulsory insurance threshold provides a natural experiment that we exploit to control for selection into private insurance. We document that income is measured with error and suggest an approach to take this into account. We find negative effects of private insurance coverage on the number of doctor visits, no effects on the number of nights spent in a hospital, and positive effects on health.

In surveys, response errors are often caused by the fact that respondents recall past events and quantities imperfectly. We explore the consequences of limited recall for the identification of marginal effects. Our identification approach is entirely nonparametric, using Matzkin-type nonseparable models that nest a large class of potential structural models. We show that measurement error due to limited recall will generally exhibit nonstandard behavior, in particular be nonclassical and differential, even for left-hand side variables in linear models. We establish that information reduction by individuals is the critical issue for the severity of recall measurement error.

The problem falls into the class of infinite horizon optimal control problems of PDE's with age structure that have been studied in various papers (Barucci and Gozzi, 1998, 2001: Feichtinger et al., 2003, 2006) either in cases when explicit solutions can be found or using Maximum Principle techniques. The problem is rephrased into an infinite dimensional setting, it is proven that the value function is the unique regular solution of the associated stationary Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and existence and uniqueness of optimal feedback controls is derived. It is then shown that the optimal path is the solution to the closed loop equation. Similar results were proven in the case of finite horizon by Faggian (2005b, 2008a). The case of infinite horizon is more challenging as a mathematical problem, and indeed more interesting from the point of view of optimal investment models with vintage capital, where what mainly matters is the behavior of optimal trajectories and controls in the long run. Finally it is explained how the results can be applied to improve the analysis of the optimal paths previously performed by Barucci and Gozzi and by Feichtinger et al. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the deterministic game, the firm's rent is completely taxed away and the firm stops investing completely. In the stochastic game, the government does not tax the firm's rent completely. The firm posts a positive rate of investment if the firm's rent exceeds the labor's income. Although the cooperative solution is indeterminate, cooperation is always Pareto optimal compared to the non-cooperative Markovian Nash equilibrium. For individual rationality, we apply a payoff distribution procedure based on Yeung and Petrosyan (2006) to derive a subgame-consistent solution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We measured willingness-to-pay (WTP) for one additional quality-adjusted life-year gained to determine the threshold of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Our study used the Internet to compare WTP for the additional year of survival in a perfect status of health in Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Taiwan, Australia, the UK, and the US. The research utilized a double-bound dichotomous choice, and analysis by the nonparametric Turnbull method. WTP values were JPY 5 million (Japan), KWN 68 million (ROK). NT$ 2.1 million (Taiwan), 23000 (UK), AU$ 64 000 (Australia), and US$ 62 000 (US). The discount rates of outcome were estimated at 6.8% (Japan), 3.7% (ROK), 1.6% (Taiwan), 2.8% (UK), 1.9% (Australia), and 3.2% (US). Based on the current study, we suggest new classification of cost-effectiveness plane and methodology for decision making.

Design: A retrospective cohort of normal versus obese patients. Subjects: Subjects >= 18 years were identified between 1996 and 2005. Measurements: Patients were categorized as either normal weight (18 kg/m2 < BMI < 27 kg/m2) or obese (BMI > 27 kg/m2) based on baseline BMI (measured 395 days or more after first EMR activity). Outcomes included development, at least 180 days after the first BMI reading date, of four cardiometabolic risk factors (elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], hypertension, or type 2 diabetes) determined from ICD-9 code, prescribed drug, or biometric reading. Logistic regression estimated the odds of developing cardiometabolic risk factors, alone and combined for normal versus obese patients forward for at least 5 years. Results: Seventy-one percent were female, mean age was 43.5 years, and 37.6% had a baseline BMI > 27 kg/m2. Comparing obese versus normal weight patients, adjusted odds ratios for the incidence of elevated triglycerides, hypertension, diabetes, and low HDL-C were 2.1 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.9-2.3), 2.2 (95% CI 2.1-2.4), 2.3 (95% CI 2.0-2.7), and 2.2 (95% CI 2.0-2.4), respectively. Adjusted odds ratios of developing one and all four new risk factors were 1.9 (95% CI 1.8-2.1) and 7.9 (95% CI 5.9-10.5), respectively. Conclusion: Obese patients are approximately twice as likely to develop cardiometabolic risk factors compared with those having normal weight over 5 or more years.","[Said, Qayyim] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Div Pharmaceut Evaluat & Policy, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [McAdam, Carrie; Brixner, Diana I.] Univ Utah, Pharmacotherapy Outcomes Res Ctr, Coll Pharm, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Schwartz, J.

This paper uses panel data for 1234 participants front the Women's Interagency HIV Study to estimate the effect of antidepressant use on the likelihood of being employed among women receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the United States from 1996 to 2004. We show that naive regressions of antidepressant use on employment generally result in negative or nonsignificant coefficients, whereas the instrumental variables (IVs) approach shows a positive and significant effect of antidepressant use on the employment probability of women living with HIV. We use IVs to predict antidepressant use independently of outcomes, thus addressing potential biases (e.g. more depressed women are more likely to receive antidepressant treatment, but they are also more likely to be unemployed). The results are consistent for linear (random and fixed effects) as well as non-linear (bivariate probit) specifications. Among women receiving HAART, and controlling for individual and local area labor market characteristics, the use of antidepressants is associated with a 29-percentage-point higher probability of being employed.

A simple and parsimonious multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) econometric approach to handle such multiple discreteness was formulated by Bhat (2005) within the broader Kuhn-Tucker (KT) multiple discrete-continuous economic consumer demand model of Wales and Woodland (1983). In this chapter, the focus is on presenting the basic MDCEV model structure, discussing its estimation and use in prediction, formulating extensions of the basic MDCEV structure, and presenting applications of the model. The paper examines several issues associated with the MDCEV model and other extant KT multiple discrete-continuous models. Specifically, the paper discusses the utility function form that enables clarity in the role of each parameter in the utility specification, presents identification considerations associated with both the utility functional form as well as the stochastic nature of the utility specification, extends the MDCEV model to the case of price variation across goods and to general error covariance structures, discusses the relationship between earlier KT-based multiple discrete-continuous models, and illustrates the many technical nuances and identification considerations of the multiple discrete-continuous model structure. Finally, we discuss the many applications of MDCEV model and its extensions in various fields.","[Bhat, Chandra R.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Bhat, Chandra R.] Univ Texas Austin, Course Transportat Syst Anal, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Bhat, Chandra R.] Univ Texas Austin, Course Transportat Planning Methods, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Eluru, Naveen] Univ Texas Austin, Transportat Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Bhat, CR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,"Eluru, Naveen/B-2965-2012; Bhat, Chandra/AAC-6965-2019","Eluru, Naveen/0000-0003-1221-4113; Bhat, Chandra/0000-0002-0715-8121",,,,,52,6,7,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,71,99,,,,,,29,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366173200005,0

The objective of this Task Force subgroup report (one of six reports from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research [ISPOR] Task Force on Good Research Practices-Use of Drug Costs for Cost Effectiveness Analysis [Drug Cost Task Force (DCTF)]1) was to review the definition of this perspective, assess its specific application in measuring drug costs, identify any limitations in theory or practice, and make recommendations regarding potential improvements. Methods: Key articles, books, and reports in the methodological literature were reviewed, summarized, and integrated into a draft review and report. This draft report was posted for review and comment by ISPOR membership. Numerous comments and suggestions were received, and the report was revised in response to them. Results: The societal perspective can be defined by three conditions: 1) the inclusion of time costs, 2) the use of opportunity costs, and 3) the use of community preferences. In practice, very few, if any, published CEAs have met all of these conditions, though many claim to have taken a societal perspective. Branded drug costs have typically used actual acquisition cost rather than the much lower social opportunity costs that would reflect only short-run manufacturing and distribution costs. This practice is understandable, pragmatic, and useful to current decision-makers. Nevertheless, this use of CEA focuses on static rather than dynamic efficacy and overlooks the related incentives for innovation. Conclusions: Our key recommendation is that current CEA practice acknowledge and embrace this limitation by adopting a new standard for the reference case as one of a limited societal or health systems perspective, using acquisition drug prices while including indirect costs and community preferences. The field of pharmacoeconomics also needs to acknowledge the limitations of this perspective when it comes to important questions of research and development costs, and incentives for innovation.","[Garrison, Louis P., Jr.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Mansley, Edward C.] Merck & Co Inc, West Point, PA USA; [Abbott, Thomas A., III] i3 Pharma Informat, Basking Ridge, NJ USA; [Hay, Joel W.] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Smeeding, James] JestaRx Grp, Dallas, TX USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Merck & Company; University of Southern California; JeSTARx Group,"Garrison, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Hlth Sci Bldg, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lgarrisn@u.washington.edu,,,,,,,19,105,113,1,21,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2010,13.0,1,,,,,8,13,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00660.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,541PI,19883405.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000273429000004,0

Therefore, early diagnosis, differentiation between risky and relative benign forms and understanding of pathogenesis of disease for further therapeutic approaches is highly desirable. Healthy prostate is unique in zinc accumulation. Zinc is (mostly) buffered by cysteine-rich low molecular protein metallothionein (MT). In contrast, PCa has altered zinc metabolism and elevated MT. In PCa patients, MT is elevated even in serum and can therefore be used as potential tumor marker due to high specifity to PCa. This could be very desirable because of inaccuracies of current prostatic specific antigen (PSA) screening. The aims of this study is (1) to analyze MT-zinc relation on cell lines: to determine zinc and MT levels in cell lines PC-3 (cancer) and PNT1A (control), (2) to find relations between MT and PSA, (3) to describe potential effects of MT and/or zinc on prostate cancer pathogenesis, (4) to determine serum MT level,(5) to find relations between MT level and patient's disease grading. We used (1) optimized fully automated immunochemical methods for detection of serum PSA in serum, (2) protein separation with paramagnetic microparticles modified with antibody against PSA and MT, (3) PAGE gel silver and coomassie staining and colorimetric detection. We found (1) statistically significant (p=0.001) MT elevation in PCa lines and in PCa serum, (2) significant PSA elevation in cell lines, (3) strong correlation between intracel. zinc and MT, (4) no correlation between disease grading/patient's history, PSA level and MT level. We found MT/zinc play a role in PCa pathogenesis, further understanding may have therapeutic implications. By our findings, MT is a good candidate for new marker for PCa screening, developing of automated diagnostic methods is highly desirable.","[Gumulec, J.; Masarik, M.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Masaryk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pathol Physiol, Komenskeho Namesti 2, CS-66243 Brno, Czech Republic; [Cernei, N.; Zitka, O.] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Chem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Cernei, N.; Zitka, O.] Mendel Univ Brno, Biochem Fac Agron, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Babula, P.] Univ Vet Pharmaceut Sci, Fac Pharm, Dept Nat Drugs, Brno 61242, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno; University of Veterinary Sciences Brno,"Gumulec, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pathol Physiol, Komenskeho Namesti 2, CS-66243 Brno, Czech Republic.",j.gumulec@mail.muni.cz; kizek@sci.muni.cz,"Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Masarik, Michal/D-9920-2012; Cernei, Natalia/M-7505-2019; Zitka, Ondrej/L-5588-2019; Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Gumulec, Jaromir/D-7638-2012; Babula, Petr/AAL-6510-2020","Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Masarik, Michal/0000-0003-1172-7195; Cernei, Natalia/0000-0002-8259-1566; Zitka, Ondrej/0000-0001-7607-5058; Gumulec, Jaromir/0000-0002-9658-3444;",GACR [301/09/P436]; IGA MZ [10200-3],GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); IGA MZ,"Financial support from the following grants GACR 301/09/P436, IGA MZ 10200-3 is highly acknowledged.",,20,0,0,0,5,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,977,983,,,,,,7,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341786800128,0

The objective of this report is to provide guidance and recommendations on how manufacturers should approach the use of drug costs. Methods: The Task Force was appointed with the advice and consent of the ISPOR Board of Directors. Members were experienced developers or users of drug cost information working in academia and industry, and came from several countries. Following the core assumptions developed and outlined by the Task Force, a draft report was prepared. Comments were solicited on the outline and several draft reports both from a core group of external reviewers and more broadly from the ISPOR membership of ISPOR via the ISPOR Web site. Results: The industry should always strive for: 1) a focus on drug value and not just cost; 2) credibility-that is correct and consistent costs; 3) transparency-by disclosing the prices and costs, and ensuring that they reflect the actual cost of the drug whenever possible; and 4) providing actionable results that help customers comprehend the value offered by a drug therapy and to use products more efficiently and effectively. Conclusions: Understanding and accounting for all costs and consequences of the use of a medical treatment is in the best interests of all parties involved in the prescribing, consuming, reimbursement, selling, and manufacturing of bio/pharmaceuticals. Transparency, consistency, and clear communication of costs and value are essential for appropriate decision-making and should be important goals for all parties.","[Mycka, Jack M.; Kolassa, Eugene Mick] MME LLC, Montclair, NJ 07042 USA; [Dellamano, Renato] ValueVector Srl, Milan, Italy; [Wonder, Michael] Novartis Pharmaceut Australia, N Ryde, NSW, Australia; [Ghosh, Sabyasachi] Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Oklahoma City, OK USA; [Hay, Joel W.] Univ So Calif, Dept Clin Pharm Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Smeeding, Jim] JestaRx Grp, Dallas, TX USA",Novartis; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center; University of Southern California; JeSTARx Group,"Mycka, JM (通讯作者)，MME LLC, 31 Pk St,Suite 200, Montclair, NJ 07042 USA.",jmycka@m2econ.com,"GHOSH, SABYASACHI/HTN-6217-2023","GHOSH, SABYASACHI/0000-0002-7926-3238",,,,,0,8,9,0,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2010,13.0,1,,,,,25,27,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00664.x,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,541PI,19883402.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000273429000007,0

First, we explore the ways in which local residents engage the wine industry as part of the long agricultural heritage of the Region. Second, we examine evolving tensions between local attachment and intensifying market contexts.

We find that when data is mean-nonstationary and the variance of individual effects is significantly larger than that of disturbances, the FD-GMM estimator performs quite well. We demonstrate that this is because the correlation between the lagged dependent variable and instruments gets larger owing to the unremoved individual effects, i.e., instruments become strong. This implies that, under mean-nonstationarity, the FD-GMM estimator does not always suffer from the weak instruments problem even when data is persistent. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

New methods are constantly being developed, and older more established methods are yet appropriate. Careful application of statistical analysis techniques can improve causal inference of comparative treatment effects from nonrandomized studies using secondary databases. A Task Force was formed to offer a review of the more recent developments in statistical control of confounding. Methods: The Task Force was commissioned and a chair was selected by the ISPOR Board of Directors in October 2007. This Report, the third in this issue of the journal, addressed methods to improve causal inference of treatment effects for nonrandomized studies. Results: The Task Force Report recommends general analytic techniques and specific best practices where consensus is reached including: use of stratification analysis before multivariable modeling, multivariable regression including model performance and diagnostic testing, propensity scoring, instrumental variable, and structural modeling techniques including marginal structural models, where appropriate for secondary data. Sensitivity analyses and discussion of extent of residual confounding are discussed. Conclusions: Valid findings of causal therapeutic benefits can be produced from nonrandomized studies using an array of state-of-the-art analytic techniques.

The first step consists of estimating a reduced form equation for the endogenous regressors and extracting the corresponding residuals. In the second step, the latter are added as control variates to the outcome equation, which is in turn estimated by SML. We establish the estimator's root n-consistency and asymptotic normality. In a simulation study, we compare the properties of our estimator with those of existing alternatives, highlighting the advantages of our approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

After an allocation process where each inhabitant was listed with a general practitioner (GP), a considerable share of the GPs got fewer persons listed than they would have preferred. We examine whether GPs who experience a shortage of patients to a larger extent than other GPs seek to hold a second job in the community health service even though the wage rate is low compared with the wage rate in general practice. Assuming utility maximization, we model the effect of patient shortage on a GP's decision to contract for a second job in the community health service. The model predicts a positive relationship between patient shortage and participation in the community health service. This prediction is tested by means of censored regression analyses, taking account of labour supply as a censored variable. We find a significant effect of patient shortage on the number of hours the GPs supply to community health service. The estimated marginal effect is 1.72 hours per week.

Under boundedness of per capita payoffs, which simply ensures that equal treatment payoffs are bounded above, we apply results of Kaneko and Wooders (1986) to obtain nonemptiness of the core of the economy. We then demonstrate, under the stronger condition of strict small group effectiveness, that the equal treatment core coincides with the set of price-taking equilibrium outcomes with anonymous prices-that is, prices for public goods depend only on observable characteristics of agents. Existence of equilibrium follows from nonemptiness of the core and equivalence of the core to the set of equilibrium outcomes. Our approach provides a new technique for showing existence of equilibrium in economies with a continuum of agents. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The WPAI:CG was administered along with the Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) to a caregiving population (N = 308) enrolled with their older, medically complex care-recipient in a cluster-randomized controlled study. Correlation coefficients were calculated between each productivity variable derived from the WPAI:CG and CSI/CESD scores. Nonparametric tests for trend across ordered groups were carried out to examine the relationship between each productivity variable and the intensity of the caregiving. Results: Significant positive correlations were found between work productivity loss and caregiving-related strain (r = 0.45) and depression (r = 0.30). Measures of productivity loss were also highly associated with caregiving intensity (P < 0.05) and care-recipient medical care use (P < 0.05). The average employed caregiver reported 1.5 hours absence from work in the previous week and 18.5% reduced productivity while at work due to caregiving. Employed and nonemployed caregivers reported 27.2% reduced productivity in regular activities in the previous week. Conclusion: The results indicate high convergent validity of the WPAI:CG questionnaire. This measure could facilitate research on the cost-effectiveness of caregiver-workplace interventions and provide employers and policy experts with a more accurate and comprehensive estimate of caregiving-related costs incurred by employers and society.","[Wolff, Jennifer L.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Wolff, Jennifer L.; Frick, Kevin D.; Boult, Chad] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Baltimore, MD USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine,"Wolff, JL (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 624 N Broadway,Room 692, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",jwolff@jhsph.edu,,"Frick, Kevin/0000-0002-0178-5319",Jacob and Valeria Langeloth Foundation; John A Hartford Foundation; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; National Institute on Aging; Kaiser-Permanente Mid-Atlantic; Johns Hopkins HealthCare; Roger C.

Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using a state transition model of disease natural history and the impact of DMTs for the representative Medicare beneficiary with MS. Costs and outcomes were evaluated from the health-care payer perspective using a 50-year time horizon. Natural history data were drawn from a longitudinal cohort study. The effectiveness of the DMTs was evaluated through a systematic review. Utility data were taken from a study of patients with clinically definite MS in Nova Scotia. Resource use and cost data were derived from the Sonya Slifka database and associated literature. Results: When based on placebo-controlled evidence, the marginal cost-effectiveness of interferon beta (IFN beta) and glatiramer acetate compared to best supportive care is expected to be in excess of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. When evidence from head-to-head trials is incorporated into the model, the cost-effectiveness of 6 MIU IFN beta-1a is expected to be considerably less favorable. Treatment discontinuation upon progression to Expanded Disability Status Scale 7.0 is expected to improve the cost-effectiveness of all DMTs. Conclusions: Further research is required to examine the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these therapies. There is no definitive guidance in the United States concerning discontinuation of DMTs; this study suggests that the prudent use of a treatment discontinuation rule may considerably improve the cost-effectiveness of DMTs.","[Tappenden, Paul; Chilcott, Jim; Simpson, Emma; Madan, Jason] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [McCabe, Christopher] Univ Leeds, Inst Hlth Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Nixon, Richard] MRC, Biostat Unit, Cambridge CB2 2BW, England; [Madan, Jason] Capital Dist Hlth Author, Dept Psychiat, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Brown, Murray] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada",University of Sheffield; University of Leeds; MRC Biostatistics Unit; Dalhousie University,"Tappenden, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",p.tappenden@sheffield.ac.uk,"Chilcott, Jim/B-4474-2009; McCabe, Christopher J/E-2051-2016; Fisk, John/N-7796-2015","Madan, Jason/0000-0003-4316-1480; Fisk, John/0000-0003-3512-8015; Chilcott, James/0000-0003-1231-7817; Nixon, Richard/0000-0002-9991-7833","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health and Human Services [RJ108076]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health and Human Services(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality)","This project was funded under Contract No. RJ108076 from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health and Human Services.",,34,46,48,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,657,665,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00485.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19508662.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267130200006,0

Participants: Data came from the US Health and Retirement Study participants who were asked questions on AD risk perception (N = 778). Measurements: Perceived risk of AD was measured by respondents' estimate of their percent chance (0-100) developing AD in the next 10 years. Preference for AD prevention was measured with questions eliciting willingness to pay for a drug to prevent AD. Analysis: Multivariate linear regressions were used to estimate correlates of perceived risk and preference for prevention. Better cognitive functioning and physical activity are associated with decreased perceived risk. Neither age nor cardiovascular disease is associated with perceived risk. African Americans have lower perceived risk than non-Latino whites; the difference is wider among people age 65 and above. Only 4% to 7% of the variation in perceived risk was explained by the model. Preference for prevention is stronger with increased perceived risk, but not with the presence of risk factors. Persons with better cognitive functioning, physical functioning, or wealth status have a stronger preference for prevention. Some known risk factors appear to inform, but only modestly, individuals' perceived risk of AD. Furthermore, decisions about AD prevention may not be determined by objective needs alone, suggesting a potential discrepancy between need and demand for AD preventive care.","[Chung, Sukyung] Univ Calif San Francisco, Phillip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy Studies, Palo Alto, CA 94301 USA",University of California System; University of California San Francisco,"Chung, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Francisco, Phillip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy Studies, Ames Bldg,795 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, CA 94301 USA.",Sukyung.Chung@ucsf.edu,,,"NIA NIH HHS [P30-AG15272, P30 AG015272] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,44,20,27,1,21,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4,,,,,450,458,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00482.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,19900252.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000266467800010,0

Moreover, asymmetry in the financial data is rarely modeled in a systematic way. In this paper, we suggest a general density function based on the maximum entropy (ME) approach that takes account of asymmetry, excess kurtosis and also of high peakedness. The ME principle is based on the efficient use of available information, and as is well known, many of the standard family of distributions can be derived from the ME approach. We demonstrate how we can extract information functional from the data in the form of moment functions. We also propose a test procedure for selecting appropriate moment functions. Our procedure is illustrated with an application to the NYSE stock returns. The empirical results reveal that the ME approach with a fewer moment functions leads to a model that captures the stylized facts quite effectively. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A closed beta-system of sets on E is a collection H of subsets of E such that A is an element of H implies vertical bar A vertical bar >= beta, E is an element of H, and A boolean AND B is an element of H whenever A, B is an element of H with vertical bar A boolean AND B vertical bar >= beta. If w is a class of closed beta-systems of sets and n is a positive integer, then C: w(n) -> W is a consensus method. In this paper we study consensus methods that satisfy a structure preserving condition called removal independence. The basic idea behind removal independence is that if two input profiles P, P* in w(n) agree when restricted to a subset A of E, then their consensus outputs C(P), C(P*) agree when restricted to A. By working with the axiom of removal independence and classes of closed beta-systems of sets we obtain a result for consensus methods that is in the same spirit as Arrow's Impossibility Theorem for social welfare functions.

Each of these jobs is char acterized by wage, sector (primary care or hospital) and shift (daytime work or shift). This paper estimates a multi-sector-job-type random utility model of labor supply on data for Norwegian registered nurses (RNs) in 2000. The empirical model implies that labor Supply is rather inelastic; 10% increase in the wage rates for all nurses is estimated to yield 3.3% increase in overall labor Supply. This modest response shadows for Much stronger inter-job-type responses. Our approach differs from previous studies in two ways: First, to our knowledge, it is the first time that a model of labor supply for nurses is estimated taking explicitly into account the choices that RN's have regarding work place and type of job. Second, it differs from previous studies with respect to the measurement of the compensations for different types of work. So far, it has been focused on wage differentials. But there are more attributes of a job than the wage. Based on the estimated random utility model we therefore calculate the expected value of compensation that makes a utility maximizing agent indifferent between types of jobs, here between shift Work and daytime work. It turns Out that Norwegian nurses working shifts may be willing to work shift relative to daytime work for a lower wage than the Current one. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We study these aspects formally by deriving the second-order expansion of the first and third cumulant of the studentized inequality measure. We state distribution-free expressions for the bias and skewness coefficients. In the second part we improve over first-order theory by deriving Edgeworth expansions and normalizing transforms. These normalizing transforms are designed to eliminate the second-order term in the distributional expansion of the studentized transform and converge to the Gaussian limit at rate O(n(-1)). This leads to improved confidence intervals and applying a subsequent bootstrap leads to a further improvement to order O(n(-3/2)). We illustrate our procedure with an application to regional inequality measurement in Cote d'lvoire. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using individual-level data oil utilities for health states associated with prostate cancer, we report the performance of a new model that encompasses three traditional models-additive, multiplicative, and minimum-previously used for predicting utilities for joint health states. Describing utilities in terms of utility losses l/(.) relative to prefect health, our final estimated linear index for predicting joint health-state utilities is El(JS) = 0.05+0.72 . max l(SS1),l(SS2)+ 0.33.min l(SS1),l(SS2).0.18.l(SS1).l(SS2). Based oil out-of-sample predictions, this model produces up to 50% reduction in mean-square error compared with traditional models and consistent prediction across different ranges of joint-state utilities, which the traditional models do not. Parameter estimates of the new model proposed here provide direct evidence on the inconsistencies of the traditional models, are grounded in psychological theory by emphasizing the more severe component of a joint health state, and provide a simple linear index to generate consistent predictions of utilities for joint health states.

This evidence is often derived from quantitative tests that Occur naturally within, or are added to, stated preference tasks. In this study, we use qualitative methods to explore three axioms Of utility theory: completeness, monotonicity, and continuity. We take a novel approach, adopting a 'think aloud' technique to identify violations of the axioms Of utility theory and to consider how well the quantitative tests incorporated within a discrete choice experiment are able to detect these. Results indicate that quantitative tests classify respondents as being 'irrational' when qualitative statements would indicate they are rational'. In particular, 'non-nionotonic' responses can often be explained by respondents inferring additional information beyond what is presented in the task, and individuals who appear to adopt non-compensatory decision-making strategies do so because they rate particular attributes very highly (they are not attempting to simplify the task). The results also provide evidence of 'cost-based responses': respondents assumed tests with higher costs would be of higher quality. The value of including in-depth qualitative validation techniques in the development of stated preference tasks is shown.

Because it can be transfused into almost anyone, hospitals particularly value such blood. We use this fact, together with the assumption that types are exogeneously assigned by nature, to design an empirical inquiry into altruism. We also investigate the timing of donations, especially focussing on the behaviour of new and established donors. We show that O-negative blood donors donate no more often than other people. Thus individuals apparently do not exhibit pure altruism. We speculate that instead blood donors may be driven by a broad notion of duty rather than by a far-sighted, rational unselfishness.

The expected net gain from locally optimal trial designs of US$0.72M is shown to increase to US$1.14M with a globally optimal trial design. In general, the proposed method of globally optimal trial design improves on optimal trial design within jurisdictions by: (i) reflecting the global value of non-rival information; (ii) allowing optimal allocation of trial sample across jurisdictions; (iii) avoiding market failure associated with free-rider effects. sub-optimal spreading of fixed costs and heterogeneity of trial information with multiple trials.

As well as technological challenges, 'soft' factors and KISA related to the development of organization and human resources also have to be carefully dealt with when developing IS-ICT companies. This paper explores these issues by presenting two cases taken from the IS banking sector. One describes how a deep change in the performance appraisal of employees helped a supplier of outsourced ICT services in the banking industry develop its outsourcing philosophy and market. The other case concerns the design and implementation of the competence centre of the finance division of a large Italian software company. The discussion shows how successful results are, in both cases, a consequence of the adoption of 'participatory design' approaches and of the choice of 'loosely structured' and 'relation intensive' organizational solutions. IS-ICT suppliers sensitive to the 'soft' aspects in their businesses seem to better serve the propensity to innovate enterprises, including small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) engaged in long term, long distance cooperative endeavors.","[Depaoli, Paolo] Univ Urbino, I-61029 Urbino, Italy",University of Urbino,,paolo.depaoli@uniurb.it; datri@luiss.it; marco.demarco@unicatt.it,"De Paoli, Paolo/AAG-2586-2021",,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,ALFRED UNIV,ALFRED,"ONE SAXON DR, ALFRED, NY 14802 USA",,,978-0-9800510-2-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,993,1000,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJZ06,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267479300154,0

This study examined the effect of GERD patients' compliance with PPI therapy on health-care resource utilization and costs. This was a retrospective study of more than 25 million managed care lives in the United States from January 2000 through February 2005. Administrative claims data were obtained from the National Managed Care Benchmarks database, developed by Integrated Health Care Information Solutions. GERD-diagnosed patients who had at least two PPI dispensings were extracted and grouped into two treatment categories based on their PPI medication possession ratio (MPR): compliant (MPR > 0.8) and noncompliant. A regression-based difference-in-differences approach was used to estimate the effect of compliance on the frequency and costs of inpatient and outpatient visits and pharmacy costs. Statistical controls included health plan type, patient age, baseline use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and comorbidities. Of the total 41,837 patients studied, 68% were compliant. On an annual, per-patient basis, PPI compliance resulted in 0.47 fewer outpatient visits (P = 0.040), 0.03 fewer inpatient visits (P = 0.015), and 0.47 fewer hospitalization days (P = 0.001) from the pre-PPI use period, compared to noncompliance. PPI therapy increased pharmacy costs for both groups, but the total annual health-care costs were reduced for both groups. Compliant patients experienced a greater decline in total cost from the pre-PPI period compared to noncompliant patients (declines of $3261 vs. $2406 per patient per year, P = 0.012). Both health-care resource use and costs were reduced after initiation of PPI therapy. Additional reductions from the pre-PPI period were further observed by compliance with PPI therapy.","[Gosselin, Antoine; Lohoues, Herve; Toy, Edmond; Duh, Mei Sheng] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Luo, Roger] Pfizer Inc, Parsippany, NJ USA; [Lewis, Barbara] Eisai Inc, Woodcliff Lake, NJ USA; [Luo, Roger; Crawley, Joseph] AstraZeneca LP, Wilmington, DE USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Pfizer; Eisai Co Ltd; AstraZeneca,"Duh, MS (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",mduh@analysisgroup.com,,,AstraZeneca LP,AstraZeneca LP(AstraZeneca),Source of financial support: This study was funded by AstraZeneca LP.,,17,31,32,1,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,34,39,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00399.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,19895371.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000262696800006,0

In this paper, we study the issue of nonmonotonic power in testing for changing mean. We investigate the asymptotic power properties of the tests, using a new framework where alternatives are characterized as having large changes. The asymptotic analysis provides a theoretical explanation to the power problem. Modified tests that have monotonic power against a wide range of alternatives of structural change are proposed. Instead of estimating the nuisance parameters based on ordinary least squares residuals, the proposed tests use modified estimators, based on nonparametric regression residuals. It is shown that tests based on the modified long-run variance estimator provide an improved rate of divergence of the tests under the alternative of a change in mean. Tests for structural breaks based on such an estimator are able to remain consistent, while still retaining the same asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of constant mean.

It stems from the fact that credit problems in one bank could easily affect the next bank or financial institution like a virus. However much as credit contagion may be deadly, it's not always true that credit problems in one institution will easily spread to the next institution. Financial institutions make money through advancing credit against assets. However the behaviors of these assets that are attached to the credit advance are the main course of contagion effect. Once there are two or more banks whose assets portfolio is the same and the assets behave in a similar manner to the economic currents, then a credit problem with one financial institution will easily extend like a virus to the next setting off a contagion credit effect in the financial system. This paper is dedicated to finding out the extent to which different banks within the financial system are exposed to contagion risk as a result of an initial credit problem within a single bank. Evidently there has been a boom in the credit market in Uganda, with such a boom in the market, credit advancement conditions tend to be relaxed in a way to make more clients access credit. However current global events in the sub prime mortgage crisis in the United States exposes several Ugandan institutions indirectly to the spread of this effect within the Ugandan financial system. Currently there seems to be a slow down in the credit market. Therefore empirical findings indicate that there is contagion risk is banking and that an initial failure could generate further failure within the financial system if there is no intervention. Therefore the vulnerability of the banking system in Uganda is very high and measures have to e devised to reduce this risk of vulnerability.","[Zhang Youtang; Maurice, Olobo] Wuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,,zyt@whut.edu.cn; olobomaurices2005@yahoo.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,ALFRED UNIV,ALFRED,"ONE SAXON DR, ALFRED, NY 14802 USA",,,978-0-9800510-2-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1710,1714,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJZ06,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267479300268,0
