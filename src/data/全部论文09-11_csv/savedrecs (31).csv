The results of the research suggest that the companies still mainly use operative management, principles and fundamentals of strategic management are not the priority and the usage of marketing management elements does not correspond with the conditions of increasing competitive environment. To increase the competitiveness of companies and to ensure the strategic development on relevant markets a strong top management is needed, which manages the company as a unified entity on the basis of clearly formulated and uncompromisingly implemented strategy. Uses efficient and compact system of management that ensures fulfilling of strategic goals. The system is based on activity of employees and their discipline as well. But in most companies the attitude of top management and the level of strategic marketing management do not match the characteristic of a strong management. The thing is for the company to avoid so called strategic surprise. These are situations which company can't face up with common methods and resources.","[Bednarcik, Zdenek] Slezska Univ Opave, Obchodne Podnikatelska Fak Karvine, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,bednarcik@opf.slu.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZENOTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-5513-1,,,,2011,,,,,,,252,258,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDC20,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312552500028,0

The changing face of IT has an important impact on many fields of research, like collective problem solving. The effectiveness of Group Support Systems (GSS) used to be attributed to the systematically organized and facilitated process, but results do not always favour the group. In contrast to the well organized GSS supported learning process, the social media environment is non-structured, rules free and even chaotic. In this paper we research the possibilities of eliciting group knowledge in the group learning process using the social media environment. Three groups of ten students participated in the three weeks long experiment. Their task was to solve the appointed research question by using exclusively the non-familiar social media environment and present the findings. After the completion of the task their attitudes were measured by a questionnaire. The results suggest that non-restricted environment stimulates self management of the group and motivates group members to share knowledge.","[Borstnar, Mirjana Kljajic] Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Borstnar, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Maribor, Slovenia.",mirjana.kliajic@fov.uni-mb.si,"Borštnar, Mirjana Kljajić/AAB-3150-2020; Borstnar, Mirjana Kljajic/R-6630-2019","Borštnar, Mirjana Kljajić/0000-0003-4608-9090;","Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology of the Republic of Slovenia [P5-0018]","Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology of the Republic of Slovenia","This research was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology of the Republic of Slovenia; Program No. P5-0018.",,12,0,0,0,2,UNIV MARIBOR,KRANJ,"FAC ORG SCI, ECENTER, KIDRICEVA CESTA 55A, KRANJ, 4000, SLOVENIA",,,978-961-232-249-6,,,,2011,,,,,,,42,49,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8BC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000403116000006,0

In this article we analyze the perception of European learning professionals regarding several technology skill elements needed in an e-learning environment. Prior work: The advance of technology solutions triggers a need for a continuous improvement of e-learning solutions. Still, ensuring that e-learning facilitates the acquisition of knowledge and skills can be challenging if the e-learning teams cannot assert competency in creative applications of instructional design, learning theories and technology (Waight and Steward, 2005:337). McPherson and Nunes (2006) found that technological issues are amongst the most important critical success factors for e-learning implementation in higher-education. Design/Methodology/Approach: Based on extensive literature review and the results of the first meeting the project members identified six technology skill elements regarding e-learning: technological basics; tools; content; platforms; how to provide e-learning and emerging e-learning trends. A questionnaire was used to collect 52 European learning professional's perception regarding the importance, extent of use and possibilities of improvement of technological competences in an e-learning scenario. Results/Acknowledgements: The responses indicated by the respondents allowed us establish that: the learning professionals admit the importance of technological aspects for e-learning; use such knowledge, but feel there is a gap between the level of knowledge required and possessed. Also, they consider that a greater knowledge would have a beneficial effect on their job role. The results of the questionnaire were used in the content development process of the courses and in the design of the skill card tested on the ECQA learning portal. Implications: The results of the questionnaire were used in the design of the skill card and the subsequent content development process of courses available on the ECQA learning portal. Through this portal the e-learning manager job role is available for practitioners and academics. After taking the course the candidate who passes an exam will be certified as e-learning manager. Originality Value: The originality of the article lies in the fact that it provides a unique examination of the European learning professional's perception regarding the implications of technology in the design, implementation, use and upgrade of e-learning initiatives.","[Cardos, Vasile-Daniel; Tiron-Tudor, Adriana; Cardos, Ildiko Reka] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,,vasile.cardos@econ.ubbcluj.ro; adriana.tiron@econ.ubbcluj.ro; ildiko.volkan@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"tiron-tudor, adriana/G-3079-2012","tiron-tudor, adriana/0000-0001-5530-5635",,,,,8,0,0,0,4,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,337,340,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000085,0

We would then test correlations between observed attitudes in these domains and stipulate as to the nature and causality of relationships observed.

Lucas (Bell J Econ 9(2):508-523, 1978) shows how management quality plays a role in determining output. The baby boom's entry into the workforce resulted in more managers from smaller, pre-baby boom cohorts. These marginal managers were necessarily of lower quality, leading to a drop in total factor productivity. As the boomers aged, this effect was reversed. A calibrated model of managers, workers, and firms suggests that the management effects of the baby boom may explain roughly 20% of the observed productivity slowdown and resurgence.","[Feyrer, James] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Feyrer, James] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Feyrer, J (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, 6106 Rockefeller, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",james.feyrer@dartmouth.edu,,"Feyrer, James/0000-0002-2787-4264",,,,,21,18,23,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

As such entrepreneurship has received and receiving more attention from policymakers and experts all over the world. The birth of new dynamic businesses is known to contribute to economic development through conversion of innovative ideas into economic opportunities, competitiveness and revitalisation of social and productive networks as well as a source of new employment. Yet entrepreneurship spirit and initiatives are not enough, as entrepreneurship needs an enabling environment to thrive. This appears to be the case in many developed economies such as Japan, Germany, United Kingdom and USA as examples dynamic and vibrant entrepreneurship environments. This paper shows that emerging economies and low income countries such as Nigeria have not benefits from entrepreneurship practice and enterprise development remains weak. With the dilemma of slow growth of Nigerian enterprise and economy, a survey research is carried out to learn the mitigating factors against the growth of Nigerian entrepreneurs using a 5 point Likert scale measure with (=1) Strongly Agree and (=5) Strongly Disagree. These were analysed using SPSS to establish the relationship between environmental conditions and the prosperity of the entrepreneurship. Analysis of various government enterprise driving schemes such as Community Banks, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), National Directorate of Employment (NDE) and Microfinance have produced little impact. The study examined the characteristics of Nigerian entrepreneurs and practices by interviewing owners businesses at various stages of growth in different types of businesses, randomly selected. From theoretical perspective a business of any size needs to have formal structures such as marketing, production, finance and human relations even if these are run by an individual alone and must be separated from the individual. The study found that these elements were predominantly absence in most of the businesses we interviewed. Other obstacles that affect entrepreneurs elsewhere in the world were also present, but quality of management, succession planning and erratic utilities provisions (power, telecommunications, roads, water, and education) mount a major barrier against the entrepreneurship and enterprise growth in the Middle Belt of Nigeria.","[Gbande, Cephas] Nasarawa State Univ, Dept Business Adm, Fac Adm, Keffi, Nigeria",,,cephasgbande@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,14,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,337,345,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800042,0

This paper reports on a study of Maori who own screen production companies, and explores their reasons for becoming entrepreneurs. There has been an increase in research on indigenous entrepreneurship (Dana, 2007) and Maori entrepreneurship in particular. This may be attributed to the research conducted as part of the GEM NZ study, which found Maori were amongst the most entrepreneurial populations in the world (Frederick et. al. 2003, 2006). Whilst exploratory and descriptive studies have proliferated, there has been little attempt to elucidate theoretical frameworks, to better understand, predict and enhance Maori entrepreneurship. Nonetheless, researchers in this field acknowledge the importance of entrepreneurship to Maori economic development, and the critical role of Maori development for the New Zealand economy. Early findings have highlighted factors that all respondents hold strong, albeit varying, views about: Mana Tangata: Identity Manawanui: Efficacy, self-belief Mana Motuhake: Control, desire for self-determination Te Wairua Auaha: In combination, these variables enhance the creative spirit and emancipatory nature of their organisations The above mentioned variables are particularly noteworthy, as much of the literature on indigenous peoples focuses on the impacts of colonisation, imperialism and racism, and how these have profoundly and negatively affected their identity, self-efficacy and self-determination (Walker, 1990; Turpel, 1992; Maaka and Anderson, 2006). This tentative theory highlights the capacity for emancipation that entrepreneurship provides to indigenous peoples. It is argued that this research will contribute to indigenous entrepreneurship and emancipatory indigenous entrepreneurship theory.","[Henry, Ella] Auckland Univ Technol, Maori Dev Fac, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,,ella.henry@aut.ac.nz,"Henry, Ella Y/G-2648-2011",,,,,,29,0,0,2,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,930,938,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800111,0

Economic liberalization and the failure of societal corporatist initiatives during the past decade indicate the absence of macro conditions favourable to the development of micro or firm-level partnership. Instead, partnership can be traced to political and economic factors operating at the micro or firm level. From case studies of five leading South Korean firms, this article will explain how partnership was forged out of micro-level interactions between cooperative institutions, power distributions and historical legacies. These firms' cooperative 'pathways' reveal how micro-level institutions associated with coordinated capitalism may thrive within the macro framework of neo-liberalism. Given the economic importance of these leading firms, the institutional distinctiveness of Korean labour relations (and, by extension, the distinctiveness of Korean capitalism) is likely to persist despite the broader shift towards liberal capitalism.","Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Polit & Int Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Kong, TY (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Polit & Int Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England.",yk2@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,2,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Therefore, the lost wallet game is still an open puzzle.","[Li, Jianbiao; Zhao, Yuliang] Nankai Univ, Sch Business, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Nankai University,,zhaoyuliang327@163.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-642-23022-6,COMM COM INF SC,,,2011,208.0,,1.0,,,,222,228,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BXA64,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295545200034,0

A survey of 254 Cuban SOEs found that marketing capabilities (either market orientation or a competitive marketing mix) improve traditional business performance. Additionally, a competitive marketing mix mediates the relationship between the market orientation of SOEs and performance. Moreover, participating in the Cuban Enterprise Optimization Program seems to enhance the marketing capabilities of SOEs. In summary, in the early phase of an economic transition, marketing capabilities make a significant contribution to SOEs' competitiveness, and enterprise optimization programs may be effective in enhancing the SOEs' marketing capabilities.","[Llonch, Joan; Rialp, Alex; Rialp, Josep] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Empresa, Fac Econ & Empresa, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Llonch, J (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Empresa, Fac Econ & Empresa, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain.",joan.llonch@uab.cat; alex.rialp@uab.cat; josep.rialp@uab.cat,"Rialp, Josep/S-5966-2019","Rialp, Josep/0000-0002-0656-1592; Llonch, Joan/0000-0002-1624-3133",,,,,101,3,4,0,17,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

A Binomial Logit Model is applied to a sample of 94 Spanish businesses from various sectors. The results have allowed us to confirm that businesses following the Porter differentiation strategy invest more in training.

Is the rising amount of unemployment related to the rapid technology upgrading occurring during the development process, or is attributed to enterprise restructuring and organizational innovation since its marketization? Using a reformed firm survey in Nanjing coving data from 1994 to 2001, this paper studies the impact of technological change on employment fluctuation during the transitional period in China, controlling for organizational innovation. Although firms having technological expenditure employ more workers, applying more appropriate technology indicators shows that technological change often gives rise to employment reduction. This conclusion does not change even when we control for fixed effect, enclogeneity and dynamic problems. The employment impact differs considerably if selection bias of technology choice is considered. Moreover, we examine the interaction effect of technological change and organizational reform. When technology combines with state-owned or collective enterprises, trade union or employee participation in decision-making, the interaction employment effect is positive, suggesting institutional factors' role in alleviating negative employment shock of technological change.","[Ning Guangjie] Nankai Univ, Dept Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Nankai University,,gjning@nankai.edu.cn,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,7,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-10-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,212,226,,,,,,15,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBA19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306259300023,0

The paper presents the results of nearly two years of hard work, within two projects financed from structural funds, resulting in the creation of new firms in Constanta and Galati areas, but also in building structures that continue to support this process.","[Rosu, M.; Doicin, C.; Ionescu, N.; Tarba, C.] POLITEHNICA Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,,magdalenarosu@yahoo.com; cristian.doicin@cont-edu.pub.ro; Ripa.Minodora@ugal.ro; ionescu_upb@yahoo.com; ticris@gmail.com,"RIPA, Minodora/JCE-5953-2023; RIPA, Minodora/D-4391-2011; Doicin, Cristian/AAN-1420-2020","RIPA, Minodora/0000-0002-2677-3525;",,,,,3,0,0,0,10,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,737,740,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000185,0

Does the current global economic crisis lead to a change in the mode of development of capitalism? To examine this question the global, finance-led regime of accumulation is examined. The changing balance of class forces with the decline of the share of wages in GDP reinforces the tendency towards overproduction and leads to a rising indebtedness of wage-earners. International current account imbalances and the growing indebtedness of states are further triggers of the expansion of financial markets as well as moments of the current crisis. Crisis management so far rather points to the continuity of the finance-led regime of accumulation - with the prospect of further crises in the near future.","Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Polit Wissensch, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Sablowski, T (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Polit Wissensch, Robert Mayer Str 6, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany.",sablowski@soz.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,50,3,3,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

However, for an organization to utilize them to a maximum, these two have to be introduced in a coordinated way. This is a subject of Business Process Oriented Knowledge Management. On the technical level, we can talk about integration of Workflow Management Systems with various Knowledge Management Systems. We have synthesized a number of common concepts described in extant literature dealing with the subject. The challenge lays in their further development and an appropriate application. The paper explains some key terms, reviews related work and identifies common aspects. Next, we define outstanding issues within the problem domain and suggest possible solutions. In particular, we operate with flexibility of workflow models, facilitating collaboration, organizational learning, advanced decision making, and process monitoring. Another topic introduces human aspects of BPM. To further illustrate the outlined theses, two illustrative examples have been attached, namely from national health sector and software engineering industry. For BPM in healthcare, tasks are typically facilitated rather than automated. We propose an employment of retroactive workflows together with process mining. Regarding the second example, software development is a highly knowledge-intensive domain. Hence we focus on a stimulation of knowledge sharing and on capturing knowledge using a semantic web.","Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Slavicek, V (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic.",vaclav.slavicek@uhk.cz,,,,,,,26,8,8,1,41,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

As the research methodology we combined comparative analysis of two consecutive studies on public administrations' added value to the Lisbon Strategy goals performed in 2008 and 2010, with analysis of Lisbon Strategy evaluation conducted by the European Commission, and practical illustration on the case of Slovenia in the context of the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020. Three main components of the hypothesis: (1) need for incorporation of the public administration modernisation and development into developmental goals of the state, (2) monitoring and adjusting the implementation, and (3) identification of interconnections and complementarities for better use of resources were explored and verified in the contexts of Lisbon Strategy adding value to the national competitiveness. Within the research, the hypothesis was proved, as well as the relevance of all three components, especially in the circumstances of the global economic crisis.

Law and economic scholars have suggested that courts should control requests for preliminary measures, but this form of regulation fails to explain existing legislations, both in civil law and common law countries.

Recent revival of heterodox economics can be regarded as a growing criticism of economists within the own profession of economics. Modern economics is designed as a one-world-capitalism without history and without regional specifications, without institutions, and without real human agents. Heterodox approaches have the aim to underline that different institutions matter, including religion, language, family structures and networks, systems of education, and industrial relations. Taking the discussion within a broader framework of the history of science acknowleges divergencies and convergencies between different approaches in economics that are also in permanent recomposition.

Some argue that food deserts-areas with little or no provision of fresh produce and other healthy food-may contribute to disparities in obesity, diabetes, and related health problems. While research on neighborhood food environments has taken advantage of more technically sophisticated ways to assess distance and density, in general, it has not considered how individual or neighborhood conditions might modify physical distance and thereby affect patterns of spatial accessibility. This study carried out a series of sensitivity analyses to illustrate the effects on the measurement of disparities in food environments of adjusting for cross-neighborhood variation in vehicle ownership rates, public transit access, and impediments to pedestrian travel, such as crime and poor traffic safety. The analysis used geographic information systems data for New York City supermarkets, fruit and vegetable markets, and farmers' markets and employed both kernel density and distance measures. We found that adjusting for vehicle ownership and crime tended to increase measured disparities in access to supermarkets by neighborhood race/ethnicity and income, while adjusting for public transit and traffic safety tended to narrow these disparities. Further, considering fruit and vegetable markets and farmers' markets, as well as supermarkets, increased the density of healthy food outlets, especially in neighborhoods with high concentrations of Hispanics, Asians, and foreign-born residents and in high-poverty neighborhoods.","[Bader, Michael D.

Our findings suggest that GETS specifications perform comparatively well in both ex post and ex ante forecasting as long as sufficient care is taken with respect to the functional form and the way in which the conditioning information is used.

J,"Chalupnicek, P",,,,"Chalupnicek, Pavel",,,The CAPITAL in Social Capital: An Austrian Perspective,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,STATE,"P>In recent decades economists started discovering the importance of the social dimension of economic interactions. Contemporary economics has borrowed several sociological concepts for its own use, among the most important being the concept of social capital. However, this transfer within disciplines did not occur without a loss-the nature of social capital in economics remains confused and obscure. The purpose of this article is to clarify it, specify the possibilities for its use, and discuss their limits. It is argued that economics once also possessed a view of human beings that was more socialized than the modern neoclassical Homo oeconomicus, and that this more socialized view still exists in the Austrian school of economics. Because this tradition of economic thought has also developed an elaborate capital theory, it can serve as an ideal source where we can look for inspiration in the current social capital debate. First, social capital is (re)defined along these lines as an individual's asset connected with recognized reciprocity (as opposed to interactions usually classified as altruistic). Then major critical claims about the relation between social and physical capital are answered and the connection between social capital, trust, and social norms is described.","Univ Econ Prague, Dept Inst Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Chalupnicek, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Inst Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",pavel.chalupnicek@vse.cz,,,,,,,49,10,17,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This is explained by the fact that the CA's objective through remedy is to restore pre-merger competition, but markets are often highly concentrated even before merger. If so, the CA must often choose between clearing an 'uncompetitive' merger, or applying an unsatisfactory remedy. Here, the CA appears reluctant to intervene against coordinated effects, if doing so enhances a leader's dominance.","[Davies, Stephen] Univ E Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Olczak, Matthew] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",University of East Anglia; Aston University,"Davies, S (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",s.w.davies@uea.ac.uk; m.olczak@aston.ac.uk,"Davies, Stephen/HPD-3182-2023","Olczak, Matthew/0000-0001-6808-3832",ESRC [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,21,3,6,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

For data collection, a questionnaire with 26 items using a multiple selection scale was applied. Results revealed that members of the cooperatives under study almost never consider strategic thinking as the application of judgment based on experience to determine future directions for the organization, for which the conscious use of managerial tools is required by the cooperativists; this is the most visible aspect of the presence of strategic thinking, inasmuch as it redefines and promulgates the mission, vision, philosophy, strategies, policies, objectives and values systems in a conscious manner.

Moss (former editor of the AJES) by his son, Joshua Louis Moss. Mixing personal anecdote with a general academic analysis, Moss informally examines his father's intellectual beginnings in the 1960s drawn from the lectures of Ludwig Von Mises, and traces this through his father's development of innovative teaching techniques like the incorporation of stage magic. Moss examines his father's intellectual contrarianism and canonical skepticism as key developmental foundations used to build his father's academic and pedagogical approach. Moss examines his father's interest in expanding economics through a cross-disciplinary approach utilizing philosophy, history, sociology, and performance studies through his father's innovative examination of points of contact between the principles of stage magic and the principles of economic theory.","USC, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Moss, JL (通讯作者)，USC, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Estimations indicate that the most important determinants of selecting an out-licensing strategy are the characteristics of the technological field to which a firm belongs. Firms strongly prefer cross-licensing to unilateral out-licensing when they are in a technological environment of high fragmentation, complexity, and overlap, as well as in a patent thicket. Cross-licensing is also preferred by domestic firms. Conversely, unilateral out-licensing is preferred by both small and large firms facing high competition in product markets, and in a strong and low overlapping technological environment with intense R&D.

This paper investigates whether the forecasting performance of Bayesian autoregressive models can be improved by incorporating information about the target. We compare a mean-adjusted specification, which allows an informative prior on the distribution for the steady state of the process, to traditional methodology. We find that the out-of-sample forecasts of the mean-adjusted autoregressive model outperform those of the traditional specification, often by non-trivial amounts, for five early adopters of inflation targeting. It is also noted that as the sample lengthens, the posterior distribution of steady-state inflation narrows more for countries with explicit point targets.

Although its origins coincide with the earliest scientific inquiry, modern optics is an enabling technology that is applied to a variety of intermediate markets-telecommunication equipment, medical devices, scientific instruments, semiconductors, imaging and reproduction, defense and security, and retail logistics. One difficulty in studying emerging technology is the limitation of current industrial categories and patent classes. This article examines the geography of optical science inventions using a new methodology that can be applied to study other emerging industries. We rely on companies that self-identify as working on optics on the basis of their voluntary membership in the Optics Society of America. We investigate the inventive activity of these companies from 2004 to 2007 and identify a set of International Patent Classes that defines the emergent technology space in optical science. Using this definition, we then analyze all the organizations that are inventing in optical science. We find that inventive activity is geographically concentrated: patenting takes place in 240 urban areas, although 84 percent of the patents were invented in 30 metropolitan areas and almost 50 percent were attributed to 11 metropolitan areas. The article considers the organizations that are shaping the emerging technology and the consequences for geographic clusters. Our results reveal that the geographic distribution of inventive activity does not reflect the location of self-designated regional optics clusters in the United States but suggests a more nuanced understanding of the emergence of industries. We conclude by considering lessons about the development of clusters in emerging industries.","[Feldman, Maryann P.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Lendel, Iryna] Cleveland State Univ, Ctr Econ Dev, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University,"Feldman, MP (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, 209 Abernethy Hall,CB 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",maryann.feldman@unc.edu; i.lendel@csuohio.edu,,,,,,,68,36,45,4,38,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

I show that efficient evidentiary thresholds differ between liability rules and are therefore inconsistent with a general invariant standard of proof. In particular, they require a greater weight of evidence than the common law standard of the preponderance of evidence, which tends to induce overcompliance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It examines the latest evidence on the marginal infrastructure and external costs of high speed rail, finding that the best evidence is that these are both not more than 2 (sic)/train-km. However, current legislation states that environmental costs should not be charged for unless they are charged for on competing modes. Mark ups based on Ramsey pricing principles might reasonably raise prices by 100-200%, given that infrastructure charges are only a part of the final price of rail. The paper then examines the actual prices charged in the main European countries operating high speed trains and the impact these are likely to have on traffic levels and mode split. It is found that mark ups often exceed even the optimal Ramsey levels, with a significant impact on rail volumes and market share. It is concluded that, whilst it is not surprising that governments wish to recover some of the construction costs of new high speed rail lines from users, they should consider carefully whether the level of charges is actually significantly reducing traffic on and benefits from these lines.

The correlation between travel behavior and immigrant characteristics such as place of birth and year of immigration in the US was tested while controlling for spatial and socio-demographic variables. The effects of place of birth and year of arriving to the US were found to be significant for some places of birth and for immigrants who entered the US in recent years.

The cohesion of the cycles is examined via cross-correlations and comparisions made with the regional cycles for Japan, the USA and the euro area. The UK emerges as especially cohesive and efforts to explain the overall cross-correlations of regional GDP are not very successful owing to the low variance of the explicand, when attention is turned to the sectoral/regional cycles with their greater variance, it is possible to demonstrate that economic variables such as distance, dissimilarity in structure and level of output play a significant role in explaining the variance in the cross-correlations. A significant feature of the cross-correlations in relation to those of EU countries is that while they continue to provide support for the 'UK idiosyncrasy' they no longer do so as strongly as they did in earlier data samples.

Through investigating the relationships among the factors influencing energy consumption per unit of GDP, we can ascertain the basic factors influencing the formation of industrial spatial structure from the perspective of energy saving and environmental protection, which are agglomeration economies and environmental capacity. Agglomeration economies and environmental capacity are main factors that determine the location of industries: some industries should be located in areas with agglomeration economies (or with larger agglomeration Economies), and some industries should be located in areas with larger environmental capacity. Agglomeration economies and environmental capacity also determine the spatial characteristics of different areas in metropolis: environmental capacity is becoming larger and agglomeration economies or their influence becoming smaller in different areas farther away from the central area. When industries are located in the areas where environmental capacity and agglomeration economies are. appropriate for the development of the industries, the rational industrial spatial structure in metropolis contributing to energy saving and environmental protection has formed.","[Chen Mingsheng; Liu Mimi] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Business, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China",China University of Political Science & Law,,chenming631@126.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 5-11 QUEENS RD,, MELBOURNE, VC 3004, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54649-0,,,,2010,,,,,,,31,38,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZQ34,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000302388300005,0

The integrated competitive strategy of oligopolic enterprise is considered to be the concerted set of partial (detailed) competitive strategies targeting the certain elements of internal and external environment of an enterprise, determining its strategic position and influencing performance. The complex assessment of the estimated impact of partial competitive strategies on performance criteria is implemented (multicriteria evaluation methods are applied) in order to indicate the detailed strategies, having the highest potential influence on enterprise performance (to be selected to form the integrated competitive strategy), and to determine their scales (weights in the structure of the integrated strategy). The results of empirical application of the model are proposed to be employed to set up long-term goals and choose the main directions of business strategy of an enterprise, to distribute financial, human and other resources for strategic actions to be designed and implemented.","[Ginevicius, Romualdas; Krivka, Algirdas; Simkunaite, Jolita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Ginevicius, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",romualdas.ginevicius@vgtu.lt; akrivka@gmail.com; jolita.simkunaite@gmail.com,,"Ginevicius, Romualdas/0000-0003-2067-4398",,,,,53,37,38,2,18,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Millions of places are being represented in cyberspace by a labour force of hundreds of thousands of writers, cartographers and artists. This paper traces the history and geography of virtual places. The virtual Earth is not a simple mirror of its physical counterpart, but is instead characterised by both black holes of information and hubs of rich description and detail. The tens of millions of places represented virtually are part of a worldwide engineering project that is unprecedented in scale or scope and made possible by contemporary Web 2.0 technologies. The virtual Earth that has been constructed is more than just a collection of digital maps, images and articles that have been uploaded into Web 2.0 cyberspaces; it is instead a fluid and malleable alternate dimension that both influences and is influenced by the physical world.","Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Graham, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",mark@geospace.co.uk,,,,,,,74,80,86,0,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Moreover, despite the conceptual articulations of spillovers and related variety few attempts have been made to examine the collaborative linkages between two or more related industries and, more specifically, how changing macro-economic forces are affecting individual producers at the local scale. In this paper we address these gaps and argue that the growing prevalence of independent production is transforming the nature of the long-standing connection between music and fashion. Specifically, that strategic collaborations between indie producers are becoming crucial to competing in the contemporary landscape of cultural production and consumption. We also assert that the motivations and mechanisms of these contemporary collaborations differ from their historical counterparts in important ways. Indeed technological advancements and the demands of indie production are changing the networking practices that facilitate these partnerships and the ways in which indie producers value and exchange goods and services.","[Hracs, Brian J.] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Hauge, Atle] Eastern Norway Res Inst, Hamar, Norway",University of Toronto,"Hracs, BJ (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Sidney Smith Hall,100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",brian.hracs@utoronto.ca,,"Hracs, Brian/0000-0003-1001-6877",,,,,41,45,47,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Prior sawmilling studies using this method have neglected the multi-output nature of sawmills. To accommodate both lumber and chips as outputs, we used a ray production function and adopted it into the stochastic frontier framework. A translog functional form was specified with three inputs (i.e., capital, labour, and roundwood) and applied to five years (2003-2007) of mill specific production data. The ray production function is flexible allowing factor productivity to vary with the output mix. Results indicated the presence of both economies of scale and technical inefficiency. This suggested that a long-run equilibrium had not yet been reached during this time and might explain recent restructuring occurring in this region.

Consequently, it is of great interest to understand which factors facilitate the creation of new technological knowledge. The existing literature has typically addressed this question by employing a knowledge production function based on firm-, regional- or even country-level data. Estimating the effects for the entire national system of innovation, however, assumes poolability of regional data. We apply our reasoning to Germany, which has well-known regional disparities, in particular between the East and the West. Based on analyses at the NUTS 3 regional level, we find different knowledge production functions for the East and the West. Moreover, we investigate how our results are affected by the adoption of alternative aggregation levels. Overall, our findings suggest that a careful evaluation of poolability and aggregation is required before estimating knowledge production functions at the regional level.","[Patuelli, Roberto] Univ Lugano, Inst Econ Res IRE, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland; [Vaona, Andrea] Univ Verona, Dept Econ Sci, I-37100 Verona, Italy; [Vaona, Andrea] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Grimpe, Christoph] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of Verona; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Copenhagen Business School,"Patuelli, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lugano, Inst Econ Res IRE, Via Maderno 24,CP 4361, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland.",roberto.patuelli@usi.ch; andrea.vaona@univr.it; cg.ino@cbs.dk,"Patuelli, Roberto/C-6271-2008","Patuelli, Roberto/0000-0003-1908-4307",,,,,60,9,9,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The starting point is that in the absence of information, choosing a prior is arbitrary. If the prior is to have meaningful implications, it is more rational to admit that one does not have sufficient information to generate a prior than to pretend that one does. This suggests a view of rationality that requires a compromise between internal coherence and justification, similarly to compromises that appear in moral dilemmas. Finally, it is argued that Savage's axioms are more compelling when applied to a naturally given state space than to an analytically constructed one; in the latter case, it may be more rational to violate the axioms than to be Bayesian.","[Gilboa, Itzhak; Schmeidler, David] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Postlewaite, Andrew] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Schmeidler, David] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Tel Aviv University; University of Pennsylvania; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Gilboa, I (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel.",,,,,,,,19,69,71,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

One component of the counterargument holds that relationship-based lending has served as an effective substitute for legal institutions. In this article, we challenge this assertion with empirical findings that show bank credit allocation that relies heavily on connections undermines the impact of finance on investment growth. Our data come from Vietnam, where-like China-the private sector and financial sector are expanding dramatically but rule of law has not kept pace. Although Vietnam's banking sector is in transition toward a healthier system, it still allocates a disproportionate share of credit to connected enterprises in less competitive regions. We find that political connections, in particular, are an ineffective tool for channeling bank credit to the most profitable investors. Using a two-stage empirical approach, we find evidence that banks place greater value on connections than performance and that the firms with greater access to bank loans are no more profitable than firms without them. By some measures, connected firms are even significantly less profitable. We conclude by demonstrating that the most profitable investors in Vietnam have forgone the formal banking system, preferring to finance their activities out of reinvested earnings or informal loans (JEL G21, G28, G30, O12, K11).","[Malesky, Edmund J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Sch Int Relat & Pacific Studies, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Taussig, Markus] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Harvard University,"Malesky, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Sch Int Relat & Pacific Studies, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",emalesky@ucsd.edu; mtaussig@hbs.harvard.edu,"Taussig, Markus/B-2052-2013; Taussig, Markus/AAQ-7039-2021; Taussig, Markus/M-1074-2018","Malesky, Edmund/0000-0001-5737-9195; Taussig, Markus/0000-0001-6598-0861",,,,,90,68,79,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

We consider a particular regulation applicable only in Italy, the export veto for art objects that are particularly relevant for the national cultural patrimony. We proxy such legal provision in order to include it in the statistical analysis and to check whether it affects the OMP price differentials between pre-auction estimated price and post-auction hammer price. Preliminary results show that the price differential is affected by the legal variable, therefore suggesting that the country's institutional framework plays an important role in price dynamics.","[Onofri, Laura] Univ Venice Ca Foscari, Dept Econ, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Onofri, Laura] FEEM Fdn ENI Enrico, Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Onofri, L (通讯作者)，Univ Venice Ca Foscari, Dept Econ, San Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",lonofri@unive.it,,"Onofri, Laura/0000-0001-8962-4626",,,,,23,11,13,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

However, the UN's experience in outsourcing is limited to providing troops for peacekeeping operations. The purpose of the paper is to develop an outsourcing scorecard for the UN and similar organisations. Forty national and international organisations were surveyed through questionnaires, review of relevant literature and records. The research established that by identifying core competencies, goals and objectives, risks, selection of provider as well as measurements and evaluation of providers' performance using an outsourcing scorecard, support functions can be outsourced successfully. Other criteria indicated as important is peace-building, suitable for humanitarian organisations. The scorecard developed by the research could provide the UN with a number of benefits, such as maximisation of efficiency and savings in costs. The paper develops the first outsourcing scorecard to guide the UN and similar organisations in identifying services that can be outsourced successfully.","[Charles, K. A.; Cloete, C.

We further show the equivalence between this multi-market measure of market power and the critical elasticity for the dominant firm.

The proposal would replace separate entity accounting with a profit allocation based on formula apportionment. Since formula apportionment rests on the source principle, the group faces an incentive to invest in low tax member states. Residence-based group taxation based on separate entity accounting could be an alternative. The subsidiaries' profits and losses are attributed to the parent of the group (current inclusion), and the European group's profit is taxed at the corporate income tax rate of the parent. The parent's state of residence grants a foreign tax credit. Current inclusion prevents tax distortions regarding the location of investments, if no limitations on the foreign tax credit exist. A serious drawback of residence-based taxation is the incentive to move the group's headquarter to a low tax member state. At present, this incentive is mitigated by exit taxation. Applicable exit taxation rules, however, most likely infringe upon European law. Rules that conform to European law probably abolish unfavourable liquidity effects upon exit. In net present value terms, however, exit taxes still render it burdensome for the group to move the headquarter to another member state.","[Schreiber, Ulrich] Univ Mannheim, Chair Business Adm & Business Taxat, Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Führich, G (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Chair Business Adm & Business Taxat, Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",Ulrich.Schreiber@bwl.uni-mannheim.de; Gregor.Fuehrich@bwl.uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,31,4,4,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This paper fills an important need in the literature as one of the first empirical attempts to examine the private political strategies of activists and has important implications for the burgeoning literatures on industry self-regulation and the nonmarket strategies of firms.","[Lenox, Michael J.] Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA; [Eesley, Charles E.] MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",University of Virginia; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Lenox, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA.",lenoxm@darden.virginia.edu; eesley@mit.edu,"Eesley, Charles/N-7888-2016","Eesley, Charles/0000-0003-2348-1583",,,,,25,95,121,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Roberts, Jr., the Supreme Court has demonstrated a willingness to cast aside the Court's prior antitrust decisions. The qualified per se rule applicable to tying surely will not survive much longer, but what else might be in store is more speculative. This essay identifies four decisions relating to competitor collaboration in which the Court's prior application of the per se rule does not comport with its modern decisions. In two of the cases, the conduct likely would be found lawful today; while in the other two, the conduct most likely still would be condemned but only after an abbreviated application of the rule of reason. This essay also identifies three legal doctrines ready for retirement. They are the absolute requirement of market delineation as a predicate for merger analysis, the outmoded approach to market delineation of Brown Shoe, and the unhelpful formulation of the monopolization offense in Grinnell.","US Dept Justice, Antitrust Div, Washington, DC 20530 USA",,"Werden, GJ (通讯作者)，US Dept Justice, Antitrust Div, Washington, DC 20530 USA.",gregory.werden@usdoj.gov,,,,,,,57,7,8,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Companies with a higher percentage of non-executive directors in the audit committees and larger audit committee size are found to exhibit greater forecast accuracy.

By incorporating congestion interaction, this paper derives a decision rule oil each bus service. Moreover, by investigating the effect of road pricing, it is shown that the direction of change in bus fares and private welfare depends on type of provision.

Once the technology level of clean production is determined, information barriers are assumed to be not existent due to the overwhelming eco-labelling system in the market and thus consumers are fully informative of the environmental attributes of green products This paper presents a pricing model consisting of two producers: one is the clean producer (the CP) and the other is the non-clean (or conventional) producer (lite NP) and assumes that the two firms are identical with respect to cost and product quality except the environmental attributes of green products. In this paper, we examine the impacts of environmental concerns' cost of clean production, cross price sensitivity (market competition effect) and production costs on the choice of clean technology and the two producers' pricing behaviours. The most important finding of the analysis demonstrates that environmental concerns play a vital important role in growing the market share of green products and encouraging tire CP to upgrade the technology level of clean production. Furthermore, an increase in environmental concerns leads to rise up of price, sales volume and profit of not only green products hut also the non-green counterparts. This result may provide some implications for policy makers that the promotion of environmental programs to aware consumer's environmental concerns is an effective win-win-win strategy since it provides benefits to the two producers and also treats the environment in a sustainable way.","Nan Hua Univ, Grad Inst Environm Management, Coll Management, Chiayi 622, Taiwan",Nanhua University,"Chen, CC (通讯作者)，Nan Hua Univ, Grad Inst Environm Management, Coll Management, 32 Chung Keng Li, Chiayi 622, Taiwan.",ccchen@mail.nhu.edu.tw,,,,,,,36,7,7,1,23,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Owing to the fact that the Mexico City metro mainly serves the low income sectors of the population, this paper attempts to separate the overall income effect into two uncorrelated components: a vehicle stock effect (used as a proxy for medium/high income) and minimum wage effect net of the influence of vehicle stock (used as a proxy for low income). The time series cointegration results show that minimum wage elasticities are positive whilst vehicle stock elasticities are negative. These results suggest that for the majority of metro users, whose salaries are based on low multiples of the minimum wage and are not potential car owners, the Mexico City metro is perceived as a normal good. However, for middle/high income earners, who can afford to buy a private vehicle when their incomes increase, the Mexico City metro is perceived as an inferior good. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue, that in studies of transnationalism, on the one hand the idea of nation-states as spatial containers is overcome, but on the other hand also reproduces the same spatial containers. Instead we suggest the use of the term 'trans-world' to avoid any connotation suggesting spatial containers. In this framework, places and borders are instead seen as multi-dimensional and dynamic concepts which can be applied to almost any kind of relationships transgressing and reconfiguring borders and places at all scales. The papers which follow this introduction show how in particular situations and contexts, these transgressing and reconfiguring activities can be conceptualised in very different ways.","[Ernste, Huib; Van Houtum, Henk] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Human Geog, Nijmegen Ctr Border Res, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Zoomers, Annelies] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Utrecht University,"Ernste, H (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Human Geog, Nijmegen Ctr Border Res, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",h.ernste@fm.ru.nl; h.vanhoutum@fm.ru.nl; a.zoomers@geo.uu.nl,"Zoomers, Annelies/B-9012-2014","Zoomers, Annelies/0000-0002-6216-9907",,,,,63,13,16,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In order to secure deep understanding of learning processes of internationalizing firms the study in this chapter adopted a qualitative approach based on 12 longitudinal case studies of internationalizing firms. Data collection involved multiple, semi-structured interviews with chief executive officers conducted over three consecutive years. Secondary data and expert opinion provided both a means of validation and enrichment of the interview data. Internationalization process theory emphasizes the importance of experiential market knowledge in explaining the gradual internationalization of firms. International new venture research places more emphasis on knowledge intensity and unique product knowledge to explain the early and rapid internationalization of new firms.

Online questionnaires are increasingly used to get detailed opinions of distance learning students on various issues of studies. During the project EURASIA, it was identified that VEBER online questionnaire can be a useful tool for VGTU beyond the scope of the project EURASIA. An online questionnaire has been developed to facilitate the process of surveying related to implementation of the project EURASIA. The assessments helped to recognise that this tool helps VGTU to enhance its institutional system related to e-learning. Having identified the potential of this tool outside the scope of the EURASIA to project, further experiments have been carried out to assess how this tool can be further developed to accommodate the requirements of the project EURASIA other institutional systems. The research showed that distance learning students not only want to express their opinion about the study process, but also to be active participants in shaping strategic alternatives of the study process by electronic means. In order to implement this idea, the authors proposed the Web-based Model of Multiple Criteria Ethical Decision-Making for Ethical Behaviour of Students and used as a basis to develop the Ethical Web-Based Decision Support System (E-DS). Using the features of the VEBER online questionnaire, the developed Model and the E-DS System, the process of distance learning can be additionally humanized and adjusted to ethical norms, which would have a positive effect on the whole distance learning process. Thus, the institutions participating in the project EURASIA or offering distance learning studies could use the features of VEBER online questionnaire, the developed Model and the E-DS System in their activities. It would stimulate more efficient application of moral norms in the distance learning process.","[Kaklauskas, Arturas; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras; Budzeviciene, Rita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Inst Internet & Intelligent Technol, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Kaklauskas, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Inst Internet & Intelligent Technol, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",arturas.kaklauskas@st.vgtu.lt; edmundas.zavadskas@adm.vgtu.lt; ritabudzeviciene@gmail.com,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Kaklauskas, Artūras/AAC-4058-2019","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Kaklauskas, Arturas/0000-0001-9800-9158",,,,,32,16,17,0,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

With the growing importance of the city in global flows, hypotheses concerning the global city and social/spatial polarisation were advanced for Istanbul, arguing that it could best be characterised as a 'divided city'. This paper suggests that despite the city's growing integration with global dynamics, the degree of segregation is not on the rise but even registered a slight fall between 1990 and 2000. The distinct nature of social mobility that provided the poor with the opportunities for upward mobility generated an easily legible pattern of segregation. In the mid-1990s these dynamics changed and the forces acting upon segregation became too diversified to be reduced to a single factor, generating unpredictable results in parts of the city. Our findings indicate that the mobility of the existing population and locational choices of newcomers work in opposite directions as far as their impacts on segregation are concerned, with the former increasing and the latter decreasing the existing levels of segregation.","[Pinarcioglu, M.

In practice, the criteria weights are determined in assessing the economic development of the state and its regions, the commercial activity and strategic potential of enterprises, the effectiveness of particular investment projects, etc. Several theoretical and practical methods of determining the significance (weight) of criteria by experts are known. Pairwise comparison of criteria is widely applied, and the most well-known, widely applied and mathematically grounded technique is the so-called Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). However, the application of this method is limited because of a great number of evaluation criteria, contradicting expert estimates and incompatible matrices obtained.

More and more managers are willing to allocate higher percentages of their turnover to communication, which, once more, demonstrates the higher importance given by companies to promotional activities. The most frequently used promotional techniques are sales force and advertising by catalogues, leaflets, and brochures, followed by price-offs.

Meanwhile some scholars argue that geographic borders and territories are increasingly losing their importance for structuring human life and social spaces, others hold that new politics of belonging, new logics of inclusion and exclusion are leading to new divisions of social segmentation and spatial segregation. After discussing some recent conceptualisations of the ongoing process of internationalisation the paper develops a differentiated typology of internationalisation processes based on an explicit reflection on the tradition of methodological nationalism and on different concepts of space, mainly absolutist and relativist understandings of space. It is argued that the different concepts of space and the various ideal types of internationalisation have to be treated not in an 'either-or' but in an 'as well as' perspective.","Ruhr Univ Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Pries, L (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",ludger.pries@ruhr-uni-bochum.de,,"Pries, Ludger/0000-0002-0972-5177",,,,,35,16,16,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

While markets tended to integrate mainly due to improved infrastructure, ethno-linguistic networks had persistent trade diverting effects. We find that the political borders which separated the empires successor states after the First World War became visible in the economy from the mid-1880s onwards, already 2530 years before the First World War. This effect of a border before a border cannot be explained by factors such as administrative barriers, physical geography, changes in infrastructure or patterns of integration with neighbouring regions outside of the Habsburg customs and monetary union. However, controlling for the changing ethno-linguistic composition of the population across the regional capital cities of the empire does explain most of the estimated border effects.","[Schulze, Max-Stephan] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ Hist, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Wolf, Nikolaus] Univ Warwick, Ctr Study Globalisat & Regionalisat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Wolf, Nikolaus] CEPR, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Warwick; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Schulze, MS (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ Hist, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.s.schulze@lse.ac.uk; nikolaus.wolf@warwick.ac.uk,,"Wolf, Nikolaus/0000-0002-7461-2910",,,,,53,32,34,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Ceiling was introduced by the Delors 1 (1988) to manage the first financial perspective and EU budget stability. Paper is focused on financial ceiling policy of the EU budget expenditures. Financial ceiling is used for the total expenditure size (with relative indicators) and for the individual expenditure headings (with absolute indicators). We designed EU budget models using the methods of financial ceiling, which reflect different total expenditures size (total expenditure ceiling within the range of 2 % EU GNI, 5 % EU GNI, 20 % EU GNI, I % EU GNI, and 1,24 % EU GNI), and new heading structure for total expenditure ceiling of 1,24 % EU GNI. We tried to design the new budgetary structure to reflect the Lisbon Strategy better than actual EU budget. We strengthened following expenditure headings: la Competitiveness for growth and employment, 3 Citizenship, freedom, security and justice, and 4 EU as a global player. The growth of these headings is compensated by an expenditure decrease of the following headings: 2 Preservation and management of natural resources, especially the section of the market-related expenditure and direct payment, and 1b Cohesion for growth and employment. We made comparative analysis, which compare differences between received expenditures into agriculture and structural operations at individual member states in the case of present and new (our) structure of the EU budgetary expenditures. According to the results of this analysis we can say that new budgetary structure will likely be politically unacceptable.","[Simikova, Ivana; Pfaffova, Zdenka] Tech Univ Liberci, Hospodarska Fak, Katedra Financi & Ucetnictvi, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Simíková, I (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberci, Hospodarska Fak, Katedra Financi & Ucetnictvi, Voronezska 13, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic.",ivanasimikova@seznam.cz; z.pfaffova@centrum.cz,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Our qualitative and quantitative study provides evidence that NTTCs are not an effective policy tool in accelerating the commercialization of university inventions.

The results show that the evolution of standards can be identified as an innovation process within the multinational hotel groups because new service offerings and processes are driven by changes in corresponding standards. A process of standard evolution contains four consecutive stages: variation, selection, experimental-replication, and routinisation. Throughout the process, collective and multiple learning underline evolving standards over time. The evolution of standards can be recognized as an 'all for one and one for all' innovation process in service MNCs since all actors, including the corporate headquarters, regional headquarters and affiliated hotels, participate in this long process.","DPU, Fac Business Adm, Bangkok 10210, Thailand",,"Sutthijakra, S (通讯作者)，DPU, Fac Business Adm, 110 1-4 Prachachuen Rd, Bangkok 10210, Thailand.",s_sawitree@yahoo.com,,,,,,,38,2,2,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

If, however, unions attach a higher weight to the wishes of the old, the unemployment rate of the old (young) will increase (decrease).

The starting working assumption (hypothesis) is that the volume of total budget expenditure (including the foreign borrowing) has not been realizing appropriate effect on GDP growth. In the analysis of these relationships we primarily use the method of vector autoregressions (VAR). The main result of the analysis showed that, in accordance with theoretical assumptions, the structure of expenditures is essential for the effects of budgetary spending on economic growth. We determine the positive effects of investment spending and purchases of goods and services and the negative effects of other categories of current spending. The reduction of capital expenditures during the recession presents a particularly adverse trend, which reduces the rate of growth of the economy in the long and short term. A fundamental conclusion of the research is that the budget expenditures have not adequately affected the GDP growth. Therefore, it is possible to affect the economic growth by changing the structure of budgetary spending, as well as directing public borrowing to investment financing.","[Drezgic, Sasa; Blazic, Helena] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Sever, I (通讯作者)，Nova Ves 79, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",sever@efri.hr; sdrezgic@efri.hr; helena@efri.hr,"Blažić, Helena/Q-3836-2018; Drezgic, Sasa/GVR-7966-2022; Drezgic, Sasa/S-4114-2018","Blažić, Helena/0000-0003-4602-3665; Drezgic, Sasa/0000-0002-7712-8112",,,,,42,7,7,0,13,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The traditional framework analyses dyadic preference relations in terms of a hypothetical choice between the two compared alternatives. The swap framework extends this approach by analysing dyadic preference relations in terms of two hypothetical choices: the choice between keeping the first of the compared alternatives or swapping it for the second; and the choice between keeping the second alternative or swapping it for the first.","Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Gustafsson, JE (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,"Gustafsson, Johan E./0000-0002-9618-577X",,,,,10,2,2,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Results indicated that the applied model gives inconclusive evidence as to whether the instruments used to secure the intermediate aims are open market placement operations and legal reserves, since open market rescue operations and the rediscounting instrument have not been used often because, in recent years, BCV monetary policy has been contractive, basically using public national debt placements to drain liquidity.

This paper documents the breadth and scope of the influence of McGee's paper and offers several possible explanations for it.

First, we want to challenge the notion of human capital as education, training and work experience and suggest that it is the quality of the workforce that matters, here defined as the set of characteristics that allow workers to function in a specific institutional and historical context. Our main conclusion is that the quality of the workforce is affected by the institutional environment where the workers live and that therefore it can vary across countries and institutional contexts. Second, we want to show the empirical relevance of this last point by testing the extent to which the quality of institutions (here proxied by the governance indicators of Kaufmann et al. (2007)) can affect the quality of the workforce (proxied by the percentage of the working age population registered in a lifelong learning program). Our empirical analysis is conducted on a data-set of 11 European countries observed over the period 1996-2006. The results indicate that countries with better governance indicators are also endowed with a more qualified workforce.","[Bottone, Germana] Inst Studies & Econ Anal, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Sena, Vania] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Bottone, G (通讯作者)，Inst Studies & Econ Anal, Piazza Indipendenza 4, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",g.bottone@isae.it; v.sena@aston.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,7,7,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to diagnose the culture of a pharmaceutical company, which is located in Turkey, and find out the perceived and preferred cultural profiles both in the headquarters and branches of the company. The perceived culture has been found as hierarchy whereas the preferred one has been found as clan leading to incongruence between the perceived and preferred cultural profiles. In this regard; the reasons lying behind this mismatch are discussed, as it is important for the success of the organization and person-organization fit. Hence, the influential effects of national culture on shaping the organizational culture profiles have been discussed. Furthermore, the effects of educational level and union membership on culture profiles are also explored to understand the dynamics leading to such results thoroughly.","[Demir, Cengiz; Unnu, Nazli A.

This issue has not received adequate theoretical attention in the existing scholarship that has largely focussed on factors like defence, trade, and public goods provision. In this paper, merger negotiations are modelled using a bilateral bargaining model with inside options and contest as an outside option. It is shown that the threat of contest constrains the set of mutually acceptable taxes and, more importantly, it provides stability to the federal constitution by making the punishment strategy in the secession rule credible. The existence of negotiated and contested constitutional merger agreements that are path dependent but time-consistent is shown.

J,"Schwarz, P",,,,"Schwarz, Peter",,,Money launderers and tax havens: Two sides of the same coin?,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Money laundering; Tax havens; Regulation; Economics of crime,OFFSHORE FINANCIAL CENTERS; STATE SOVEREIGNTY; COMMERCIALIZATION; COMPETITION; PUNISHMENT,"This paper investigates whether tax havens have an incentive to maintain low regulatory standards in order to attract black money activities. Using a new dataset on money laundering regulation, the results of this study show that tax haven and money laundering services coincide within the same country. This effect is especially observable for regulative instruments which increase the probability of detecting money laundering; whereas in the case of punitive regulation for money laundering the complementary relationship is weaker, perhaps due to a false friends effect. If we classify tax havens according to their per capita GDP, poorer tax havens in particular tend to supply both services, because the gains from their tax haven status are low compared to those of wealthier and well-established tax havens. From a policy perspective the results add new insights to the debate on the welfare effects of tax havens since the results suggest that poorer tax havens might be reluctant to provide the necessary regulatory environment in order to constrain money laundering. This externality is beyond the familiar tax revenue effects caused by tax havens. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In many situations, DMUs can have a two-stage structure where the first stage uses inputs to produce outputs (called intermediate measures) that then become the inputs to the second stage. In recent studies on two-stage production processes, authors used the radial DEA models to measure the efficiency of the whole process and the efficiencies of individual two stages. In these models, due to the existence of intermediate measures, the usual procedure of adjusting the inputs or outputs by the efficiency scores for an inefficient DMU does not necessarily yield an efficient DMU. In this paper, we introduce a non-radial enhanced Russell measure (ERM) model on two-stage production processes by taking into account a relationship of the two stages. Unlike the radial two-stage DEA models, the new approach enables us to determine the efficient projections for inefficient DMUs within the framework of two-stage-DEA. An example of the non-life insurance industry in Taiwan is applied to compare the new measure to a recent two-stage DEA model.","[Ashrafi, A.; Jaafar, A. B.; Lee, L.

The authors note that whereas a Member State has a wide competence to define a SGEI, this is no longer the case when a USO is found in liberalising legislation. The authors question whether the use of USOs is a temporary device and whether USOs will survive if, and when, there is full market liberalisation of a sector. Their chapter charts the various stages of the evolution of an EU concept of a USO and their analysis concludes that far from the gradual demise of the USO in the liberalisation process, they see the concept changing, evolving and expanding in its role of protecting the consumer citizen interest in the Internal Market. A second focus of this chapter is to place the consumer citizen at the heart of the USO. While academics have argued that USOs have a role to play in protecting the vulnerable consumer contributing to the evolution of a social European private law Davies and Szyszczak argue that USOs have a much wider remit in contributing not only to the inclusiveness of EU society but also the effectiveness of the benefits brought by an Internal Market. They argue that by placing the consumer citizen of EU law at the heart of a complex web of networked relationships several new issues emerge of governance of the processes and outcomes through which consumer, competition and integration issues are mediated.","[Davies, Jim] Univ Northampton, Sch Social Sci, Dept Law, Northampton NN2 7AL, England; [Szyszczak, Erika] Univ Leicester, London LE1 RH, England",University of Northampton; University of Leicester,"Davies, J (通讯作者)，Univ Northampton, Sch Social Sci, Dept Law, Northampton NN2 7AL, England.",jim.davies@northampton.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,7,7,0,0,TMC ASSER PRESS,J N DEN HAAG,"R J SCHIMMELPENNINCKLAAN 20-22, J N DEN HAAG, 2517, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-6704-733-3,LEG ISS SERV GEN INT,,,2011,,,,,,,155,+,,10.1007/978-90-6704-734-0_7,0.0,,,2,Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BVN53,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291967200007,0

Price fixing within certain limits is a concern for all air transport companies, whether traditional or low cost. The research objectives in case aimed at answering this problem, finding the value of this price. Prior work: The paper may be included in the sphere of the scientific research on the methods of study, approach and developing of the price strategy on the market of air transportation. The implemented pricing strategy is a careful calculation of all prices and past developments, an actual research prior to the adoption of a strategy or tactics, as well as an estimation of the future evolution of the market and competition movements. The pricing strategy depending on the main orientations (costs, competition, strategic objectives, etc.) must be completed by other issues such as customer immediate satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Methodology: The research in question was a quantitative one, namely a survey conducted on two plans: traditional and low cost airlines. It was conducted on a sample of 766 respondents who answered several questions. The selected individuals were persons who traveled by air several times during a calendar year, on flights operated by traditional and low cost airlines. The sampling method was the stratified random non-proportional sampling, the strata being composed according to certain demographic variables. Results: In order to identify the range of price acceptability and the optimum price point we used the Price Sensivity Meter method and the Van Westendorp configurator. The results have targeted both traditional and low-cost companies on domestic, international European and outside Europe flights. Among the limits of the research we may include the online method, without a direct contact to the respondents, used for filling the questionnaire. Implications: The article has a double importance, both scientific and practical. Scientifically speaking, there can be distinguished and developed several models of pricing strategy in the air transport services sector, and in practical terms, such service providers may adopt the values obtained, considering, of course, the limits of the research.

The mobile banking market is characterized with a history of numerous tried and failed solutions, and a future of promising but yet uncertain possibilities and innovations. In the past decade, user- centered design has become the essence of creating innovative mobile banking business models. In this domain, designers and business model developers focus on comprehending and meeting people's specific requirements. In this paper, we describe a collaboration business model, which involves collaboration among all stakeholders in the mobile payments value chain, with the focus on the consumer. It is about the convergence of collaboration, communication, community and content. We describe the stakeholder involvement and its implications on the innovation process. An analysis of the mobile banking environment is provided using a multidisciplinary approach involving all the relevant factors. The analysis of frameworks and aspects of external influences is necessary to comprehend all the relevant factors, and analyze the different influences that impact the mobile banking market and lead to economic development. This refers to technological aspects, regulatory and standardization frameworks, social and cultural factors and marketing aspects. Each of them has a remarkable influence on adoption of mobile banking business models, and each of them represent a very extensive research area for itself. We are not going to analyze them in detail, but our focus is on the social and cultural factors and regulatory frameworks. Social and cultural factors are important determinants for the use of different mobile banking business models. These factors include, but are not limited to, economic conditions within the country, payment culture, and culture's disposition to trust. On the other side, regulatory requirements including liquidity, security, fraud detection and management and in particular money laundering prevention is essential. The analysis of frameworks and aspects of external influences is necessary to comprehend all the relevant factors and analyze the different influences that impact the mobile banking market.

In this paper we present a virtual and anonymous, deliberative and analytical participatory group process which we applied in a planning study. The process was a combination of concept mapping and a policy Delphi. The Concept Mapping Policy Delphi offers an iterative process that is meant to foster critical, dissensus-based thinking by a group about an evaluation problem. In particular, it offers a platform on which to structure the group brainstorming of ideas, integrates knowledge and values, and creates a shared conceptual framework for addressing evaluation problems. We discuss the merits and limitations of this process and compare it with other public engagement mechanisms for decision-making. We argue that the use of a Concept Mapping Policy Delphi is relevant in forecasting and decision-making processes that aim to integrate information which is from various disparate points of view in order to clarify arguments and values, democratize and mediate public participation, and/or provide strategic advice about scenarios or planning options, while mitigating the problematic aspects of face-to-face group processes.

Amongst 23 analysed indicators it is possible to find near thirteen indicators with divergent evolution, near nine indicators with neutral evolution (stagnant) and one indicator with desirable convergent evolution (disparity reducing). Such evolution is not sustainable in the long term. Outstanding problem is the growth of disparities the capital of Prague, especially in economic area.

Individual members of large groups can more cheaply bias downwards their beliefs as to the immorality of their free-riding thereby circumventing internal moral constraints. The relative anonymity inherent to large number settings moreover reduces social pressures against free-riding stemming from some common ethical or moral norms. Both selfish individuals facing an internal moral constraint to behave altruistically and those with altruistic preferences have an incentive to bias upward their belief of the decisiveness of their contribution in large number settings. In addition, the impact of symmetry and the illusion of control can introduce biases regarding the expected reactions of others to one's own decisions. The loosening of moral constraints will tend to increase free-rider behavior while biased beliefs about the decisiveness of one's contribution or the reaction of others to one's actions will tend to decrease such behavior.","Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona 17071, Spain",Universitat de Girona,"Kyriacou, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona 17071, Spain.",andreas.kyriacou@udg.edu,"Kyriacou, Andreas/G-8973-2015","Kyriacou, Andreas/0000-0001-9571-2833",,,,,67,3,3,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Croatians form one of the larger ethnic communities in Australia (Kipp, Clyne and Pauwels, 1995; Collins, 1989), but are often left out in Australian migration research in particular when it comes to their involvement in entrepreneurial business activities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with small to medium business operators at the beginning of this year (2011) and case studies were prepared describing entrepreneurial motivations and successes of small business owners of Croatian descent in Australia, the impact of such behaviours on business performance, and reports on applicability of existing social theories of ethnic entrepreneurship to Croatian entrepreneurial involvement. Specific questions have been explored such as, whether Croatian business start-ups stem from observing others in business, and if professional, more skilled migrants, arriving here in the 1990s, have greater or lesser propensity towards self-employment than less skilled migrants, arriving as Displaced Persons in the 1960s.","[Ljubicic, Miro; Breen, John] Victoria Univ, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Bertone, Santina] Swinburne Univ Technol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Victoria University; Swinburne University of Technology,"Ljubicic, M (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",mljubicic@kangan.edu.au; John.Breen@vu.edu.au; sbertone@groupwise.swin.edu.au,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,967,974,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800115,0

The major objective is to determine a conceptual model to improve innovation capabilities from services industry. We argue that this conceptual model allows companies to anticipates and seek the opportunities to develop new services. In services, the role of users is much more significant because service have to create and consumption simultaneously. Today, service sector growth is fuelled by advances in information technology, innovation, and changing demographics that create new demands. The creative use of information can be a source of new services, or it can add value to existing services. Several studies have emphasized the role of knowledge-related processes in innovation development. Relevant literature is synthesized to provide a picture of current knowledge of innovation in service companies. This paper offers a conceptual framework for managing service innovation by exploring the growth service sector. We identify, the critical role played by technology to facility the new service innovation and examine the growth in knowledge-intensive business services by using multiple data collection methods including document analysis. Web research, and observation. The findings show that exploration of new knowledge and advanced capabilities are needed to create competitive advantage through innovation. The results also show how the conceptual model may be usefully integrated with advanced technology and company strategy to improve innovation capability. From a practical perspective, the relationships among technology and innovation capability may provide a solution regarding how service companies can sustain their innovation performance and gain a competitive advantage. The findings of this paper provide a theoretical basis, and simultaneously can be used to analyze relationship between advanced technologies and innovation capabilities of service companies. The main contribution of this paper is that it explores and builds a conceptual model to improve innovation capabilities of service companies. From a manager perspective, this paper identified several factors essential to innovation process. Future research explores how culture and personal can be used to improve innovation capabilities of service companies.","[Militaru, Gheorghe; Ionescu, Sorin] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,,gh.militaru@gmail.com; sc.ionescu@gmail.com,"Militaru, Gheorghe/W-9923-2018",,,,,,9,0,0,0,11,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,305,308,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900077,0

However, what is missing in Global Commodity Chain (GCC) and Global Value Chain (GVC) analyses is an explanation of how governance structures change over time. In this paper I suggest that the production system associated with particular commodities is not the only factor shaping commodity chain governance. Rather, I argue that actors' strategies, regulation, and historical trajectories also influence and, in certain conjunctures, transform chain governance. Since regulations and actor strategies in competitive environments change over time, it follows that chain governance is dynamic. Drawing from the case of the Dutch cut flower agro-industry, the world's leading supplier of cut flowers, I build on the GCC, GVC and Global Production Network (GPN) literatures to illustrate how actor strategies, regulation and the historical trajectory of the Dutch cut flower GCC shape and change chain governance. What the Dutch cut flower case illustrates is how grower strategies and government policy facilitated the formation of grower cooperatives, and transformed the power relations between growers and buyers in a shift from a buyer to a producer-driven chain.","Penn State Univ, Dept Rural Sociol & Agr Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Patel-Campillo, A (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Rural Sociol & Agr Econ, 111B Armsby Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",aup20@psu.edu,,"Patel-Campillo, Anouk/0000-0002-9841-4310",,,,,57,19,23,2,65,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The determination of the processes in the mind of the consumer plays a major role in the way they react on different stimuli of the marketing communication. Researchers have analyzed the inputs consumers receive and the reaction they have, but the greatest challenge is to determine what happens in their minds. Although it is impossible to determine completely the processes which take place in the mind of the consumer, called also the black box, researchers tried to develop models which structure this decision making process. In order to determine the type of reaction the consumers have, a research was conducted. The research consisted in an observation of the buying behavior of 146 persons. Depending on their initial and final indications on their own intentions and motives and their real buying behavior, it could be determined if the consumers act rather emotional or cognitive. The first results of the research have indicated that the buying behavior of the consumers depends on the type of product. Depending on the profile of the consumers, a company should know how to design the communication means of the technological change or innovation. If the buying decision is rather cognitive, then the communication means should be informative. If the buying decision is emotional the communication means should be creative and emotional.

For the observer, corporate buyers which produce goods and services and therefore hold patents to protect them are intuitive players in the market for patents, but a new phenomenon is observable. In recent years, companies which seem to have none of the traditional buying motives have emerged as new significant players in the market for patents. Even though these companies do not produce goods and therefore do not need patents in their historical meaning, they acquire patents and aggregate large patent portfolios. We indicate them as patent aggregating companies. Extant literature on this new phenomenon is limited to anecdotic reports of single cases and often emotionally charged. A profound analysis of buying motives and the business models of patent aggregating companies is lacking. Based on an exploratory case study design, we investigate strategies, business models, and activities of 27 patent aggregating companies. Our findings confirm that patent aggregating companies are a young phenomenon. These companies are highly diverse regarding their motives to aggregate patents, their funding structure, their way of venture creation, and their focus on industry and patents they aggregate. We identify four main drivers that have enhanced the patent aggregating business: (1) corporate recognition of patents as asset; (2) financial pressure and risk diversification needs of producing companies; (3) an increasingly complex patent landscape; (4) the large financial opportunities for bold entrepreneurs. Based on our findings we derive eight types of patent aggregating companies. Four types acquire patents to generate revenues by exploiting the patents. Based on how these companies exploit the patents we distinguish between patent acquisition funds, patent enforcement funds, patent incubating funds, and patent trading funds. The other four types acquire patents to serve their members, their customers or the society (commercially or not). Patents are only a means and the exploitation of them follows more diverse objectives than sole revenue generation. We cluster this companies in defensive patent funds, non commercial patent funds, patent pools, and patent securitization funds.","[Ruether, Frauke] Univ St Gallen, Inst Technol Management, St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,,frauke.ruether@unimelb.edu.au; nicole.ziegler@unisg.ch; martin.bader@unisg.ch,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,770,777,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800092,0

SR is a contemporary version of informal systemic behavior aimed at requisite holism of behavior of influential persons and their organization. It requires their honest behavior, care, and end of abuse of their ownership rights in treatment of employees, business partners, broader society, and natural preconditions of humankind's survival; in ISO 2600 the topics of SR are even 7 and linked by principles of holism and interdependence. SR extends to governors, managers, and governments the managerial principle called 'process owners' that entitles subordinates to run parts of organizations with responsibility including their right of (efficient and effective!) use without their right of abuse. Standardizations cannot solve all the problems the society is facing, especially not if standards such as ISO 2600 are not mandatory but only recommendatory. Let's put it another way: when would the organization take the SR more seriously and even be more holistic? Shall SR be an intangible asset of the organizations, incorporated as goodwill in financial statements? Then the high SR would enable organizations to be more competitive and survive. This solution would mean collecting and interpreting the data in a new, slightly different, but also broader, way, based on opportunity costs that are not visible in the usual accountancy. Well-being (WB) as a SR's component can rarely be attained without ethics of interdependence of professional specialists enabling requisite holism of approach and requisite wholeness of outcomes of work and life processes. WB as a complex construct is more than the absence of illness or pathology. WB has subjective and objective dimensions. It can be measured at the level of individuals, or organizations, or society, and it accounts for elements of life satisfaction that cannot be defined, explained or primarily influenced by economic growth. Many studies indicated significant life benefits for people with high subjective WB. Thus, the interventions to increase subjective WB are important, not only because people feel good about themselves: they have more positive work behavior and exhibit other desirable characteristics. The social and natural environmental conditions directly impact quality of people's life and their actual choices (where to live, work), human health and wealth (through climatic variations, natural disasters). From the strategic point of view, the governments or organizations or managers are responsible to set up the framework conditions in which the potentials of co-workers can be revealed, results obtained and objectives attained Their happiness is then a source of organizational viability and not vice versa. All mentioned concepts shall be treated in the complementary way in order to achieve the requisite holism/wholeness (RH).","[Sarotar-Zizek, Simona] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business Maribor EPF, Maribor, Slovenia; [Mulej, Matjaz] Univ Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia; [Mulej, Matjaz] IRDO Inst Dev Social Responsibil, Maribor, Slovenia; [Mulej, Matjaz] IASCYS Int Acad Syst & Cybernet Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Potocnik, Amna] Maribor Dev Agcy, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Sarotar-Zizek, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business Maribor EPF, Maribor, Slovenia.",simona.sarotar-zizek@uni-mb.si; mulej@uni-mb.si; amna.potocnik@mra.si,"Potocnik, Amna/GQI-2457-2022","Potocnik, Amna/0000-0002-4958-9595","Public Agency for Research, Republic of Slovenia [1000 - 09 212173]","Public Agency for Research, Republic of Slovenia","This contribution is based on the basic research project: 1000 - 09 212173 that is supported by the Public Agency for Research, Republic of Slovenia.",,114,1,1,0,4,TRAUNER VERLAG,LINZ,"KOGLSTR 14, 4020 LINZ, AUSTRIA",,,978-3-85499-873-0,SCHRIFTEN INFORMATIK,,,2011,36.0,,,,,,175,+,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYL01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299185000018,0

However, because cause related marketing is in the early stages of development, there are still limited researches concerning its efficiency as well as the factors that may contribute to its success (Barone et all, 2000). In addition, it is important to examine whether this strategy can be more effective than alternative communication strategies in achieving marketing objectives (Vadarajan, and Menon, 1988). As research methods it were used experiment and survey. We used the classical experimental model based on random assignment of subjects, a pre-test and post-test, an experimental group and a control group.

As a result research for sustainability has become an important driver for innovation. This paper describes developing a model that supports SMEs in integrating sustainability in their business and innovation processes. In general innovation and entrepreneurship are important in the realm of national economies because they hold the key to the continuity and growth of companies and economic growth within a country. National governments are spending vast sums of money to enable and improve innovation management and entrepreneurial behaviour within organizations. This is also the case in The Netherlands. Partnerships involving universities (education), companies (preferably SMEs) and industrial associations (business) and representatives from governmental organizations (community) are stimulated and should be geared towards: the development of sustainable networks, a contribution to regional economic growth within sectors, the development of learning communities in which best practices are shared, knowledge circulates and knowledge is created through applied research and last but not least sustainable relations are developed between universities and the business community. Within the centre for innovation and entrepreneurship at our university we have taken the initiative to develop an innovation programme for entrepreneurs in the construction industry to help them integrate sustainability in their business processes, while simultaneously professionalizing students and teachers. Sustainability and concern for the environment are two of the main reasons for entrepreneurs to look for opportunities to innovate. Policy measures are aimed at reduction of CO2 emission, waste management and alternative use of energy sources and materials. In line with these measures companies are urged to integrate sustainability in their business processes and search for innovative sustainable solutions. This paper describes the experiences with a number of SMEs in the construction industry and the barriers entrepreneurs encounter on the road towards sustainability. We focus on the role of the entrepreneur in the process of sustainable innovation and development. We conducted exploratory research and through an organisational analysis and in-depth interviews with the owners/managers of the companies insight was gained in innovation processes towards sustainable development. Conclusions show that one of the main bottlenecks is the dilemma posed by the need for profit for the continuity of a company, while taking into account people and planet. The dilemmas of innovation are described as issues that need to be addressed and which influence the innovative capacity of companies and organizations.

One important strand of these demands is the need to develop students' international awareness and understanding - a theme government and employers now view as critical to individual, organisational and collective betterment. More generally, the requirement to meet the complexity of these demands is straining universities' finite resources and is requiring alternative, pedagogic delivery and support. Therefore, this educational landscape requires new ways of working across various boundaries such as functions, disciplines and cultures. However, the solutions that will support such new ways of working are only just emerging. The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of Web 2.0 technology, specifically Wikis, to engage in boundary crossing activities between individuals and groups who may be required to collaborate remotely on temporary/transient projects. The concept of remote, collaborative learning is emergent and requires new thinking in terms of teaching and learning. Enterprise education demands interaction and engagement, which is often based around action- and experiential-learning pedagogies. This paper will report on the results of a study which investigated the design requirements of Wikis in enterprise education to meet the requirements of international students. The results of this study demonstrate that universities can use Wikis as a way of connecting students in an educational environment, irrespective of their location. Critically, the study investigated different types of Wiki usage, the process of Wiki usage, different levels of student experience pre and post Wiki activity and reflections on learning. The implications of the results are threefold: Firstly that informed decisions can be made on the application of Wikis in enterprise education for international students. Secondly, the research fosters an understanding of how a Wiki can contribute towards development of business opportunities and market sensitivity. Finally, and in terms of policy implications, the results suggest that Wikis can offer a solution to universities reaching out across cultural, social and geographical boundaries.","[Smith, Anne; Halcro, Keith; Duncan, Peter] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow Caledonian University,,Anne.smith@gcu.ac.uk; Keith.Halcro@gcu.ac.uk; p.b.duncan@gcu.acuk,"Halcro, Keith/ITV-3169-2023",,,,,,44,0,0,0,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,787,794,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800094,0

Attracting and retaining human resources is essential for every company and is a priority for HR managers. The rise of the level of education, the increased access to foreign markets and the technological developments and high mobility of the workforce have caused businesses to start to compete for attracting talents at a global level. A study by Pricewaterhouse Coopers Romania, presented at the National HR Club Conference (Bucioveanu, C., 2008) shows that the main concern of organization managers is administering talent.

The fact that many people still do not adopt Internet to do their bank transactions is due, among other things, to the low level of trust that still exists regarding this system. This distrust may be linked both to familiarity and to the degree of security that people perceive in this banking system. The objective of this study is to analyze the effect that familiarity and perceived security have on trust toward Internet banking. The proposed hypotheses are contrasted through a structural model built using a series of valid and reliable constructs. The main conclusions of this study are that familiarity as much as perceived security have a direct, positive effect on trust.

Two seminal papers [Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) and Meza and Webb (1987)] obtained ambiguous answers to this question based on different assumptions about the character of information asymmetries in credit markets. The present paper approaches the same question but using a labor market model in which income is determined by ability and individuals derive utility from income and occupational group status. Occupational group status for entrepreneurs depends on the average entrepreneurial income (due to ex post screening by banks), whereas status for wage employees depends on their own income and ability (due to ex ante screening by employers). Thus, individuals create externalities through their occupational choice. It is shown that there can be too many or too few entrepreneurs in equilibrium depending on the marginal returns to ability in entrepreneurship relative to paid employment; this enables the researcher to use independent evidence about occupational marginal returns to identify the relevant equilibrium likely to arise in practice, together with the likely appropriate policy responses. Based on this approach, we suggest that there may be too many (low ability) entrepreneurs in the USA.","[Parker, Simon C.] Univ Western Ontario, Richard Ivey Sch Business, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [van Praag, Mirjam] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Amsterdam,"Parker, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Richard Ivey Sch Business, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",sparker@ivey.uwo.ca; c.m.vanpraag@uva.nl,"Parker, Steve C/C-8180-2011","Parker, Steve C/0000-0003-3804-0975; Parker, Simon/0000-0001-7642-2857",,,,,46,30,34,0,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

We test these predictions and find that such prosecutions are associated with a reduction in the number of partners, an increase in safe sex, and an increase in sex with prostitutes.

When making decisions, they frame the decision problem as: 'What should we do?' instead of 'What should I do?'. We study one particular approach to such 'we-reasoning', economist Michael Bacharach's theory of 'team reasoning', and relate it to philosopher Raimo Tuomela's distinction between 'I-mode' reasoning and 'we-mode' reasoning. We argue that these theories complement each other: Tuomela's philosophical theory provides a conceptual framework augmenting Bacharach's theory, and Bacharach's mathematical results support Tuomela's view on the irreducibility of the we-mode to the I-mode. We-mode reasoning can explain some kinds of human cooperative behaviour left unexplained by standard game theory. Standard game theory is not well-equipped to deal with we-mode reasoning but it can be extended by the methods developed by Bacharach. However, we argue that both standard game theory and Bacharach's theory require more attention to the information-sharing stages that precede actual decision making, and we describe a stage-based model of we-reasoning.","[Hakli, Raul; Miller, Kaarlo; Tuomela, Raimo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Hakli, R (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,,"Hakli, Raul/0000-0001-8201-6409",,,,,32,65,68,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

This study aims to apply the Involvement Theory to construct an inventory to measure level of travelers' involvement in public transport services. The results indicate that the number of low involvement travelers is the critical factor that determines whether the new public transport system can effectively operate.

Mathematically, we identify the interport model as an extension of the conventional multimodal and multicommodity transhipment problem. The main purpose of the network model is to highlight and measure the advantages that logistic agents can enjoy in routing maritime containers through the interports. The model minimizes the sum of all container-related generalized logistic costs throughout the entire port-hinterland distribution network, subject to balancing conditions at all nodes and capacity constraints over railway links. We present empirical applications (baseline scenario, ideal scenario, pessimistic scenario) portraying the intermodal and logistic first-tier network in the Campania region, Southern Italy. Naples and Salerno are the container seaports of the region; the relatively recently constructed terminal, customs, warehousing and processing facilities at Nola and Marcianise are recognized as interports. Major Italian regions and cities constitute the other inland destinations for the container traffic handled in the Campanian seaports. The numerical prototypes were programmed and solved using the GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) computer code. The results confirm the importance of the regional off-dock and inland logistic system for the distribution of international maritime containers flowing through the Campanian seaport cluster. The future competitiveness of the regional seaports and their hinterland distribution system will depend on a further unproved supply of interport services.","[Iannone, Fedele] CNR, IRAT, Inst Serv Ind Res, I-80122 Naples, Italy; [Thore, Sten] Univ Texas Austin, Inst IC2, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Iannone, F (通讯作者)，CNR, IRAT, Inst Serv Ind Res, Via M Schipa 91, I-80122 Naples, Italy.",fiannone@irat.cnr.it; thore@mail.telepac.pt,,,,,,,34,17,18,0,26,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

There are important similarities between this view of ongoing transnational-operation-induced organizational transformation of the retail TNCs and processes that strategic and organizational management scholars describe as continuous morphing. In this article, we provide a theoretically informed study of one of the most dynamic of the retail TNCs (Tesco plc) morphing its organizational structures and competencies during a high risk, but potentially transformational, market entry into the western United States. The article positions the study within the rapidly emerging literature on transnational retail and the global economy, interprets the innovative dimensions of Tesco's U.S. market entry-particularly its attempts to achieve territorial and network embeddedness-through the conceptual lens recently provided by economic geographers, and assesses ongoing transformational impacts of the entry on the firm. It adds value to the literature on retail foreign direct investment by documenting the ways in which this leading retail TNC has attempted both to reconfigure its existing capabilities and to develop the new capabilities required to support its U.S. market entry via a combination of processes that we describe as transference, splicing, and enhanced imitation.","[Lowe, Michelle] Univ Surrey, Sch Management, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Wrigley, Neil] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Surrey; University of Southampton,"Lowe, M (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Sch Management, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",m.lowe@surrey.ac.uk; n.wrigley@soton.ac.uk,"Wrigley, Neil/B-3224-2011","Wrigley, Neil/0000-0002-3967-5668",ESRC [ES/E019048/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E019048/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,83,43,47,0,56,CLARK UNIV,WORCESTER,"950 MAIN STREET, WORCESTER, MA 01610 USA",0013-0095,,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Applications of relevance include forecasting volumes of call centre arrivals, transportation, e-mail traffic and electricity loads. The first method that we develop extends an exponential smoothing formulation that has been used for daily sales data, and which involves smoothing the total weekly volume and its split across the periods of the week. Two new methods are proposed that use discount weighted regression (DWR). The first uses DWR to estimate the time-varying parameters of a model with trigonometric terms. The second introduces DWR splines. We also consider a time-varying spline that uses exponential smoothing. The final new method presented here involves the use of singular value decomposition followed by exponential smoothing. Empirical results are provided using a series of intraday call centre arrivals.

In order to evaluate the ability of this proposed algorithm, the traditional statistical models are used as a benchmark vis-a-vis their time series counterparts. As emerging techniques in the area of mathematical programming yield better results, application of suitable models is expected to result in highly performed forecasts. The motivation behind this paper is to develop an algorithm which will succeed in detecting companies that appeal to financial manipulation. The methodology is based on cutting plane formulation using mathematical programming. A sample of 126 Turkish manufacturing firms described over 10 financial ratios and indexes are used for detecting factors associated with false financial statements. The results indicate that the proposed three-phase cutting plane algorithm outperforms the traditional statistical techniques which are widely used for false financial statement detections. Furthermore, the results indicate that the investigation of financial information can be helpful towards the identification of false financial statements and highlight the importance of financial ratios/indexes such as Days' Sales in Receivables Index (DSRI), Gross Margin Index (GMI), Working Capital Accruals to Total Assets (TATA) and Days to Inventory Index (DINV).

This paper attempts to answer these questions, using firm-level data from the cotton-spinning industry in Japan for the period 1956-64. We determine that industrial policy cut two ways during this period. Industrial policy effectively controlled the output of cotton-spinning firms, which contributed to the establishment of a stable market structure during the period. On the flip side, such policy constrained the reallocation of resources from less productive large firms to more productive small firms. Combined with the negative productivity growth in large firms during this period, industrial policy resulted in negative productivity growth in the industry.","[Kiyota, Kozo] Yokohama Natl Univ, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Okazaki, Tetsuji] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",Yokohama National University; University of Tokyo,"Kiyota, K (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",,,"Kiyota, Kozo/0000-0001-7649-9870",,,,,38,5,5,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The starting point was an established statistical model based on a regression analysis of medal totals in earlier Games, with past performance and GDP among the principal covariates. However, we based our own forecasts on a model with additional regressors, including a measure of public spending on recreation. This adaptation is shown to have improved the forecasting performance. We also made subjective, judgemental adjustments before releasing our final public forecasts, and we demonstrate that this led to a further increase in accuracy.

However, existing economic literature generally offers either mixed or qualified results regarding optimal punishment of repeat offenders. This paper analyzes optimal punishment schemes in a two period model, where the social planner announces possibly different sanctions for offenders based on their detection history. When offenders learn how to evade the detection mechanism employed by the government, escalating punishments can be optimal. The contributions of this paper can be listed as follows: First, it identifies and formalizes a source which may produce a marginal effect in the direction of punishing repeat offenders more severely, namely learning. Next, it identifies conditions under which the tendency in legal systems to punish repeat offenders more severely is justified. Overall, the findings suggest that traditional variables identified so far in the literature are not the only relevant ones in deciding how repeat offenders should be punished, and that learning dynamics should also be taken into account.

Our answer is not necessarily; there are circumstances where actually prohibiting settlement generates more social welfare than allowing it. Settlement can lower social welfare because it reduces the accuracy of legal outcomes. Reducing this accuracy reduces the ability of the law to deter harmful activity without chilling legitimate activity that might be mistaken for harmful activity. In some circumstances, the welfare loss from the chilling of legitimate activity can outweigh the gains from litigation cost savings, even if there are no restrictions on the damage rule.

Both product and business innovations involve novel practices. Historically, the economics profession has tended initially to rely upon monopoly explanations for such practices. Courts have reacted with similar hostility. But almost always there has followed a more nuanced economic understanding of the business practice that recognized its procompetitive virtues. Antitrust standards have adjusted occasionally to reflect that new economic learning. This sequence has produced a fundamental link between innovation and antitrust error that transcends the uncontroversial point that the probability of false positives and their social costs are both higher in the case of innovation and innovative business practices. We discuss some principles for applying Easterbrook's error-cost framework to innovation. We then discuss the historical relationship between antitrust error and innovation. We conclude by challenging the conventional wisdom that the error-cost approach implies that the rule of reason, rather than per se rules, should apply to most forms of business conduct. We instead identify simple filters to harness existing economic knowledge to design simple rules that minimize error costs. We make five such proposals.","[Manne, Geoffrey A.] Int Ctr Law & Econ, Lewis & Clark Law Sch, Portland, OR USA; [Wright, Joshua D.] George Mason Univ, Sch Law, Arlington, VA USA; [Wright, Joshua D.] Int Ctr Law & Econ, Dept Econ, Arlington, VA USA",George Mason University,"Manne, GA (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Law & Econ, Lewis & Clark Law Sch, Portland, OR USA.",gmanne@laweconcenter.org; jwrightg@gmu.edu,,"Wright, Joshua/0000-0002-9835-6579; Manne, Geoffrey/0000-0003-4677-1938",,,,,11,38,42,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Through an analysis of selected works in anthropology, economics and sociology, we discussed the importance, meaning and framing of economization, unravelling its trace within a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. This second instalment of the article explores what it would mean to move this research programme forward by taking processes of economization as a topic of empirical investigation. Given the vast terrain of relationships that produce its numerous trajectories, to illustrate what such a project would entail we have limited ourselves to the examination of processes we call 'marketization'.

I find that cohort size has a negative and statistically significant effect on earnings, and that this effect is larger for the older age group-aged between 35 and 54-than for the younger group-aged 20 to 34. I also find that earnings are more sensible to changes in cohort size in Southern Europe, which points to a lower degree of substitutability between individuals with the same education but different age. I argue that the uncovered lower substitutability in the Olive Belt of Europe is in line with the higher employment protection that its workers enjoy, at least compared to the workers located in Northern Europe.","Univ Padua, Dept Econ, I-35100 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Brunello, G (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ, Via Santo 33, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",giorgio.brunello@unipd.it,"Brunello, Giorgio/AAC-2927-2022",,,,,,22,29,31,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Very good traffic location, relatively homogeneous nationality structure and the high educational level of its population enabled a positive development for Trencin. The interest of foreign investors in this town in the prewar period provided a diversified economic basis, what remained unimpaired also by the socialist industrialization characterized by building a heavy industry. These circumstances caused Trencin to enter the transformation period with better prospects than the other towns. As a conclusion, the transformation of the Trencin town after year 1989 proceeds relatively successfully, that is indicated by the low unemployment rate, very low leave for work, a positive rating issued by the Slovak rating agency and continuing interest of foreign investors in this town.","[Danielova, Katarina] Univ Komenskeho Bratislave, Katedra Reg Geog Ochrany Planovania Krajiny, Prirodovedecka Fak, Bratislava 84215, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,,danielova@fns.uniba.sk,"Danielová, Katarína/HDN-4044-2022",,,,,,20,4,4,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZENOTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-5210-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,72,84,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDC19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312551100010,0

On the other hand, relationship marketing as an attitude based on purposeful establishment and maintaining of relationships with customers and other stakeholders represents an instrument which does not demand any high investments and yet it can substantially help small enterprises to gain and secure their stability in the market. Authorities of local government can also be included in the list of the relatively significant stakeholders for small enterprises. The paper presents the results of the research carried out within the framework of the international project Relationship Marketing of Micro and Small Enterprises along with Local Authorities - Comparative Research in which employees of the Karol Adamiecki University of Economics Katowice, Matej Bel University in Banska Bystrica, Faculty of Economics and Administration of Masaryk University Brno and Faculty of Business and Management of Brno University of Technology cooperated. The project aimed to explore the degree to which relationship marketing is implemented in small enterprises and authorities of local government in the examined countries. This paper presents partial results concerning the mutual attitudes of small enterprises and authorities of local government in the Czech Republic. The research results show that the views of small enterprise representatives and local government authority representatives about their relationships quite considerably reflect their differing positions determined by the character and the sources of their interdependence and the different level of their interest in establishing and maintaining the relationship. Due to the different position in the relationship and also the varying level to which the expectations of both entities are met the quality of the relationship is assessed in a different way and also the emotions connected with the relationship are of a different character. To sum up, on the one hand the results reveal potential, but on the other hand also obstacles to establishing relationships between these two entities.","[Lukasova, Ruzena] Masaryk Univ, Ekon Spravni Fak, Katedra Verejne Ekon, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic; [Klapalova, Alena] Masaryk Univ, Ekon Spravni Fak, Katedra Podnikoveho Hospodarstvi, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno,"Lukásová, R (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Ekon Spravni Fak, Katedra Verejne Ekon, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic.",lukasovar@econ.muni.cz; 1126@mail.muni.cz,"Klapalová, Alena/N-3854-2015","Klapalová, Alena/0000-0002-7169-6223",,,,,41,1,1,0,11,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The study identified fair and just human resource management practices, open communication and employees' participation as the strongest predictors of organizational trust. An ethics code and ethics auditing had a weaker effect on organizational trust and only in a small number of cases. This paper aims to further explore the findings, discussing socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents and their organizations that make implications to building organizational trust in a post-socialist context which is characterized by rather low societal trust (Pucetaite and Lamsa, 2010; Sztompka, 1999). The research findings indicate that the respondents' gender, position in the organization and education can be significant in perceptions of organizational trust. Age is important in perception of ethical organizational practices, in particular the ones related to communication and participation. Small organizations are more sensitive to fair and just HRM practices. Private and foreign-capital organizations are favourable contexts for developing organizational trust. These companies could be regarded as light-houses with the strongest potential to advance organizational trust if proper managerial efforts are made. Beside managerial implications the paper makes suggestions for further research.","[Pucetaite, Raminta; Novelskaite, Aurelija] Vilnius State Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Lamsa, Anna-Maija] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland",Vilnius University; University of Jyvaskyla,"Pucetaite, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines G 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",raminta.pucetaite@vukhf.lt; lamsa@jyu.fi; novelskaite@vukhf.lt,"Pucetaite, Raminta/ABG-3910-2020","Pucetaite, Raminta/0000-0001-5050-9591; Novelskaite, Aurelija/0000-0003-0654-8715",,,,,53,8,8,0,10,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

One of the ways leading to this 'measurement' is personnel controlling In our contribution, we put forward a proposal of a concrete methodology, for implementing personnel controlling. Firstly, it is necessary to carefully consider the way of transforming so called 'soft data', which are difficult to quantify, into measurable indices Further, it is necessary to start from the theoretical knowledge available in the field of human resources management In the case of personnel evaluation, it is necessary to conduct an analysis of all known and used methods New techniques The Mirror of Agreement and The Flexibility Matrix - are built upon the basis of such analysis The submitted methodology was implemented in a concrete company and within three years the individual tools and procedures were completed The implementation of personnel controlling in the firm practice is a process that involves long-term, systematic and intensive teamwork and also strong support from the top management Personnel controlling can, in this case, become a fully functional management tool within two or three years after its implementation After that, it becomes a very effective and reliable tool both for the evaluation of the effectiveness of financial means spent and for the consequent management of the work performance and employees' development By means of the Flexibility Matrix it is also possible to manage career advances, identify the needs of training and development, but also, if urgently needed, to suggest possible staff rotation The Flexibility Matrix can be also used as a significant diagnostic tool in the field of interpersonal relations.","Univ Jana Evangelisty Purkyne Usti nad Labem, Fak Socialne Ekon, Katedra Obchodu & Sluzeb, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Reissová, A (通讯作者)，Univ Jana Evangelisty Purkyne Usti nad Labem, Fak Socialne Ekon, Katedra Obchodu & Sluzeb, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",,"Reissová, Alice/P-6050-2019","Reissová, Alice/0000-0002-5095-051X",,,,,10,3,3,2,28,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Professionals, or those actors involved professionally in the development of a region, also recognise this impact on popular perception and they use characteristics of regions to fulfil their goals. They play an important role in employing the identity of a region. The extent to which this occurs varies between regions, which mean that some regions have stronger identities than others. In this paper evidence from two case studies in the Netherlands, Waterland and the Noordoostpolder, is used to explore why these differences occur. By counting the occurrence of names of regions, which are thought to be the most important symbols of a region's identity, insight is gained in the embeddedness of a region in social perception. Representations of regions commodified by professionals show that these actors influence the embeddedness of regions and as such regional differences; so professionals have a great impact on the strength of a region's identity.","[Simon, Carola] Univ So Denmark, Danish Inst Rural Res & Dev IFUL, Esbjerg, Denmark; [Huigen, Paulus; Groote, Peter] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Cultural Geog, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Southern Denmark; University of Groningen,"Simon, C (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Danish Inst Rural Res & Dev IFUL, Esbjerg, Denmark.",carola_simon@hotmail.com; p.p.p.huigen@rug.nl; p.d.groote@rug.nl,/I-2807-2013,/0000-0002-9642-4013,,,,,34,27,29,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

When a forecasting method is used as an input to an inventory system, it should therefore always be evaluated with respect to its consequences for stock control through accuracy implications metrics, in addition to its performance on the standard accuracy measures. In this paper we address the issue of judgementally adjusting statistical forecasts for 'fast' demand items, and the implications of such interventions in terms of both forecast accuracy and stock control, with the latter being measured through inventory volumes and service levels achieved. We do so using an empirical dataset from the pharmaceutical industry. Our study allows insights to be gained into the combined forecasting and inventory performance of judgemental estimates. It also aims to advance the practice of forecasting competitions by arguing for the consideration of additional (stock control) metrics when such exercises take place in an inventory context.

Its scope often depends on company size and subject of its activities. Large companies usually dispose with sufficient amount of qualified staff and their procedures in this area are usually properly sophisticated. Small and medium-sized companies due to their specific features even in this area can provide remarkable characteristics which are necessary to be researched. The article deals with actual aspects of small and medium sized companies ' employees ' remuneration. It contains basic theoretical resources concerning employees' remuneration, introduces basic legislative regulations which are followed by Slovak employers when they set up remuneration for the work done, defines individual forms and types of wages, pays attention to an institute of minimum wage. Minimum wage in Slovak republic is confronted with other EU countries as amount in EUR, type of rate and coverage. Minimum wage is a significant instrument of price and income policy, influences employer's remuneration in all branches. Amount of minimum wage is connected not only with salary policy in enterprises as basic gross wage involved in their wage system, but is also connected on funds paid to social and health insurance and with a lot of various acts and codes. With raise of the minimum wage amount raise costs of employers, but only in case they pay their employees on its level. Significant problem is relation between wage increase and advance in the labour productivity. This paper presents the results of author 's own research which was carried out in the second quarter of 2009. The respondents provided their opinions concerning employees ' remuneration, presented their attitudes towards wages, funds contributions and actual situation in this area in the period of economic crisis.

To the best of our knowledge there has been no systematic investigation of any advantage enjoyed by Irish speakers in Ireland and allegations of the comfortable middle class ambience of the Gaelscoileanna have remained at the level of anecdote. Since linguistic elitism is a feature of many societies and since Irish enjoys the constitutional status of the national and first official language of Ireland, such an investigation was, arguably, overdue. This is then compared to the structural advantage of Irish speaking workers in Northern Ireland and of Welsh speaking workers in Wales. Our conclusion is that after controlling for as many relevant factors as the data permitted, a considerable part of the difference between Irish speakers and non-speakers in Ireland, in their proportionate presence in the upper reaches of occupational class, was due to structural advantage. The major contribution of this paper is to lift the debate about the economic position of Irish speakers in Ireland above the level of hearsay: duirt bean liom go nduirt bean lei.","[Borooah, Vani K.] Univ Ulster, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland; [Dineen, Donal A.; Lynch, Nicola] Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",Ulster University; University of Limerick,"Borooah, VK (通讯作者)，Univ Ulster, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland.",VK.Borooah@ulster.ac.uk; Donal.Dineen@ul.ie; Nicola.Lynch@ul.ie,,,,,,,25,13,14,0,9,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

This paper categorizes manufacturing client sectors by their use of R&D services and investigates the behaviors of R&D services utilization by each sector group. As a result, it classifies client sectors into four groups, namely, new growth engine sectors, high-technology-based key industrial sectors, traditional industrial sectors, and consumer-goods sectors. The detailed characteristics of each group are determined by using a questionnaire survey.

Once chosen as the nation's first experimental field for the market economy, the province continued to participate above average in national economic growth ever since. At present, it still maintains a leading position with regard to general industrial performance and average personal income. However, as China's industry begins to embark on a path to technological upgrading, this pre-eminent position begins to be challenged. In the nation's emerging fields of strength, the province's rivals, Beijing and Shanghai, are in a better starting position because they are better endowed with both R&D capacities and qualified human capital. In this context, our paper illustrates the resulting challenges through a number of specialized indicators and explains why, despite a continuously impressive export performance in the high-tech sectors, Guangdong is far from being well prepared to maintain its current position. Finally, it briefly describes the policy responses that have been developed, concluding that despite a clear evidence of progress some key issues with regard to regional innovation policy appear to remain unaddressed.","[Kroll, Henning; Tagscherer, Ulrike] Chinese Acad Sci, Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Inst Policy & Management, D-736139 Karlsruhe, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Kroll, H (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Inst Policy & Management, Breslauer Stasse 48, D-736139 Karlsruhe, Germany.",henning.kroll@isi.fraunhofer.de; ulrike.tagscherer@casipm.ac.cn,,,,,,,24,13,13,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Results show that invention efficiency and R&D marketability are 0.6 and 0.4, respectively. It is not desirable that firms often ignore marketability in the R&D process. Cluster analysis is used to divide firm population into high- and low-efficiency segments in order to determine the relationships between invention efficiency, marketability, and environment variables.

Recently, some international evidence has emerged which shows that, by augmenting the price-earnings metric with information about consumer price inflation, further enhancements can be achieved in tactical asset allocation. This study reviews these arguments as they apply to South Africa, and finds that an inflation-augmented price-earnings ratio is more successful in forecasting equity returns than is the simple price-earnings ratio. Moreover, the metric is found to be significant in explaining relative asset class returns. On a risk-adjusted basis, however, the tool fails to improve the portfolio results when compared to a buy-and-hold strategy.","Univ Pretoria, Gordon Inst Business Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Saville, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Gordon Inst Business Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,8,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"RM EMS 4-51, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Using the results of this model as a starting point, this paper focuses on how the fare's proportion of travellers' generalised costs and fare elasticity are linked to travel distance. it is shown that how these figures relate to trip length is critically dependent on the weight the transport operator puts on profit and the assumptions made about the demand conditions.

The Court considered several factors, including the availability and competence of other laws to regulate unwanted behavior, and the potential that application of the antitrust laws would result in unusually serious mistakes. This paper examines whether similar considerations suggest restraint when applying the antitrust laws to conduct that is normally regulated by state and other federal laws. In particular, we examine the use of the antitrust laws to regulate the problem of patent holdup of members of standard setting organizations. Although some have suggested that this conduct illustrates a gap in the current enforcement of the antitrust laws, our analysis finds that such conduct would be better evaluated under the federal patent laws and state contract laws.","[Kobayashi, Bruce H.; Wright, Joshua D.] George Mason Univ, Sch Law, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Kobayashi, BH (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Sch Law, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",bkobayas@gmu.edu; jwright@law.utexas.edu,,"Kobayashi, Bruce/0000-0002-8259-0950; Wright, Joshua/0000-0002-9835-6579",,,,,78,19,19,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

However, Hand (2009) postulates that when the large cross-sectional datasets of data mining and the high-frequency time series of forecasting converge, common problems and opportunities are created for the two disciplines. This commentary attempts to establish the relationship between data mining and forecasting via the dataset properties of aggregate and disaggregate modelling, in order to identify areas where research in data mining may contribute to current forecasting challenges, and vice versa. To forecasting, data mining offers insights on how to handle large, sparse datasets with many binary variables, in feature and instance selection. Furthermore data mining and related disciplines may stimulate research into how to overcome selectivity bias using reject inference on observational datasets and, through the use of experimental time series data, how to extend the utility and costs of errors beyond measuring performance, and how to find suitable time series benchmarks to evaluate computer intensive algorithms. Equally, data mining can profit from forecasting's expertise in handling nonstationary data to counter the out-of-date-data problem, and how to develop empirical evidence beyond the fine tuning of algorithms, leading to a number of potential synergies and stimulating research in both data mining and forecasting.

However, there has been minimal examination of the financing methods of these firms and, while the major retail TNCs have supply relationships in sub-Saharan Africa, so far none have opened stores on the continent. Therefore, in this article we analyse expansion into sub-Saharan Africa by a second tier retail TNC (Shoprite) and explore its financing strategy. We find that the food retail sector in sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing strong growth with high financial returns. We identify a pecking order to financing the firmwith a preference for internal funding through retained earnings preceding long-term debt, and limited issuance of equity as a last resort. Given the efficiencies of debt financing, this preference is interpreted as reluctance to dilute returns to shareholders and as a pragmatic approach to financing expansion in particularistic business environments.","[Wood, Steve] Univ Surrey, Sch Management, Surrey GU2 7XH, England; [Okeahalam, C.

Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that SOX induced small firms to exit the public capital market during the year following its enactment.

These estimators rely on a variety of different assumptions and take many different functional forms. Motivated by the empirical success of combination forecasts, this paper presents a novel approach for combining individual realised measures to form new estimators of price variability. In an application to high frequency IBM price data over the period 1996-2008, we consider 32 different realised measures from 8 distinct classes of estimators. We find that a simple equally-weighted average of these estimators cannot generally be out-performed, in terms of accuracy, by any individual estimator. Moreover, we find that none of the individual estimators encompasses the information in all other estimators, providing further support for the use of combination realised measures.

Amenities, it is often said, have an especially potent effect on the migration patterns of individuals endowed with high levels of human capital. However, these approaches raise many unanswered questions. Theories that describe urban growth as a response to movements of people in search of consumer or lifestyle preferences can be questioned on the grounds of their assumptions about human behavior, as well as their silence in regard to the geographical dynamics of production and work. We argue that a more effective line of explanation must relate urban growth directly to the economic geography of production and must explicitly deal with the complex recursive interactions between the location of firms and the movements of labor. In this context, we also offer a reinterpretation of the currently fashionable notions of creativity and the role of skilled labor in cities.","[Storper, Michael] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Storper, Michael] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Publ Affairs, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Scott, Allen J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Storper, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.",,"Scott, Allen John/A-8111-2008","Scott, Allen/0000-0002-8742-5970","ESRC [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0749038] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,67,571,646,11,371,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We live in fear that an even more extreme violence will characterize the twenty-first century. The city of Hiroshima was the victim of the greatest single stroke of violence in the history of humanity. Yet it managed to arise, Phoenix-like, as a city devoted to peace in the aftermath of nuclear horror. How was this extraordinary forgiveness possible? Is it possible that it was born out of a compassion for the victims of nuclear holocaust that extended beyond its immediate borders? In several works, but most notably in Upheavals of Thought, Martha Nussbaum has analyzed the conditions for the occurrence of compassion. She has also subjected her largely Aristotelian analysis of compassion to a Stoic-inspired critique. This paper will reconstruct Nussbaum's analysis, critique, and defense of compassion. I will then extend Nussbaum's analysis to argue how a forgiveness rooted in compassion, rather than mercy, might be possible. The city of Hiroshima's dedication to worldwide peace in the aftermath of nuclear horror is used to illustrate a compassion-based forgiveness.","Assumption Coll, Worcester, MA 01615 USA",Assumption College,"Gallagher, P (通讯作者)，Assumption Coll, Worcester, MA 01615 USA.",,,,,,,,13,9,12,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

However, concerning financial aspects this characteristic is reversed: compared to larger firms SME are financially inflexible. The paper analyses spatial aspects of financial flexibility under a systemic as well as an organizational perspective. In particular, it focuses on the flexibility in financial relationships between banks and SME in a local production system in Alicante/Spain. Theory suggests that financial relationships which are embedded in a local production system support the financial flexibility of firms. However, empirical evidence of Alicante challenges this view. The Spanish financial system in general is dominated by multiple banking relationships. They depend on transaction-based short-term financial contracts and include collateral securities. These are contracts which seriously narrow the financial flexibility of firms. The case of Alicante shows that the rationality behind this kind of transaction-based relationships is more related to routines in banking organization than to risk perception in a local production system. The paper concludes that spatial concentration does not automatically lead to a local dimension of finance.","Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Handke, M (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, Berliner Str 48, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",michael.handke@geog.uni-heidelberg.de,,,,,,,84,2,2,1,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

We set apart the knowledge base in two categories: Information centers and organizational memory, accepting that mentors act differently accordingly. Based on the literature reviewed we were able to stage a three-dimensional theoretical setting (mentoring, knowledge, and change) and produce three research questions. We have addressed these research questions using an exploratory qualitative approach to five different firms from three industries apart. This study contributes to the literature at least in two ways. Firstly, it connects the mentor figure to the knowledge base's access, exposing the importance of the mentor as a knowledge access facilitator during change periods.

Applying the standard closed-economy or open-economy loanable funds model without including the world interest rate and the expected exchange rate, we find similar conclusions except that the positive coefficient of the ratio of the net capital inflow to GDP has a wrong sign and is insignificant at the 10% level.","SE Louisiana Univ, Coll Business, Dept Business Adm & Finance, Hammond, LA 70402 USA",University of Louisiana System; Southeastern Louisiana University,"Hsing, Y (通讯作者)，SE Louisiana Univ, Coll Business, Dept Business Adm & Finance, Hammond, LA 70402 USA.",yhsing@selu.edu,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,4,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Three elements help to explain this permanence: tradition, which is assumed and reproduced by the line of believers - past, present and future; ritual, which reproduces historic memory and local identity; and the appropriation of cultural elements foreign to the local culture in order to survive in global contexts. These celebrations permit restoring harmony in the towns and barrios, which have changed drastically due to their own insertion in a world market. They also generate the perception of having control of the community in the face of the great external processes that threaten it: the urban stain, international commerce, the mass communications media and mass culture, among others.","[Montes, Olga] Univ Autonoma Benito Juarez de Oaxaca, Inst Invest Sociol, Oaxaca 68000, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma Benito Juarez de Oaxaca,,Pirachet@cmq.edu.mx; Olgamontes_2000@yahoo.com,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,2,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Under these circumstances, managers need to re-define firms rather in terms of value creation than in those of value appropriation. The most important way in order to do this - in the context sketched out by the knowledge-based society - could be by identifying the potential of the intellectual capital to create value added and then leveraging the intellectual capital of the firm through business competitive strategies.","[Ogrean, Claudia] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,,claudia.ogrean@ulbsibiu.ro,"OGREAN, CLAUDIA A/C-6678-2008",,,,,,36,0,0,0,2,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,196,204,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS70,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984000032,0

Monopoly is the sole supplier of the product on the market faces competition from other companies supplying the same or similar product and can sell at higher prices than in the markets of perfect competition. Therefore, there is a need for regulation by the State to ensure an adequate level of profit for manufacturers and sufficient quality of service for customers. In the Czech Republic is responsible for the functions of the electricity regulator Energy Regulatory Institute, which uses method price regulation by the form of allowed revenues. The goal of a specific research conducted by Faculty of Economics and Administration at Masaryk University was to identify the theoretical methods that allow the establishment of regulated prices and to analyze factors influencing the amount. The methodology of Energy Regulatory Institute consists in the calculation of allowed costs, depreciations and profit. The base for calculating of depreciation of fixed assets are historical costs, which do not price developments and thus can not create sufficient resources for the reproduction of consumed assets. Similarly, in the calculation of the profit is used regulatory asset base, which represents the residual value of operating assets, taken from the firm's accounting for the year. It is obvious that the value of the assets taken from the balance sheet the company does not take into account possible investment opportunities for the company, which forms part of its market value. The result of the research is to propose a model of fair value revaluation, which eliminates the shortcomings of historical costs (of purchase price) and allows included the existing fixed assets in the calculation of allowed revenues and also the present value of its investment opportunities. The model of fair value is preferred also by International accounting standards because brings the accounting near to actually existing market conditions and eliminates the underestimation of business assets and depreciations.","[Sedlacek, Jaroslav; Valouch, Petr] Masaryk Univ, Ekon Spravni Fak, Katedra Financi, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Sedlácek, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Ekon Spravni Fak, Katedra Financi, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic.",sedl@econ.muni.cz; valouch@econ.muni.cz,"Sedláček, Jaroslav/AAF-8051-2021; Valouch, Petr/O-4251-2014","Sedláček, Jaroslav/0000-0001-6238-8619; Valouch, Petr/0000-0002-8755-4457",,,,,15,8,8,1,77,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

By separating the transaction cost variation into two regimes, this paper utilizes a two-regime TVECM with the error correction term serving as the threshold variable to create a non-linear threshold model. The empirical results show that when the marketing margin is lower than the threshold value, the market system operates freely and there is feedback between the farm and retail prices. However, when the marketing margin is higher than the threshold value, the government intervenes in the market and the causality between the farm and retail prices no longer exists. The conclusions are as follows. Changes in the marketing margin can cause the asymmetric price transmission between the farm and retail prices in Taiwan's rice markets; therefore, ignoring the effect of the marketing margin could lead to errors in the models. When the marketing margin is higher than the threshold value, the government intervenes in the market and the causality between the two prices is broken.","[Wang, Kuan-Min] Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40721, Taiwan; [Lee, Yuan-Ming] So Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Yung Kang, Tainan, Taiwan",Southern Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Wang, KM (通讯作者)，Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, 100 Chiao Kwang Rd, Taichung 40721, Taiwan.",wkminn@ocu.edu.tw; lym0436@mail.stut.edu.tw,"Wang, Kuan Min/H-5247-2019","Wang, Kuan Min/0000-0002-0237-0596; Lee, Yuan-ming/0000-0002-4054-2651",,,,,18,3,3,0,6,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

We adapt the 'implied model approach' of Kaiser and Maravall to achieve both objectives in a nonparametric fashion. The frequency response function of an X-11 linear filter is used, together with the periodogram of the differenced data, to define spectral density estimates for signal and noise. These spectra are then used to defi ne a matrix smoother, which in turn generates an estimate of the signal that is linear in the data. Estimates of the signal are provided at all time points in the sample, and the associated time-varying signal extraction mean squared errors are a by-product of the matrix smoother theory. After explaining our method, it is applied to popular nonparametric filters such as the Hodrick-Prescott (HP), the Henderson trend, and ideal low-pass and band-pass filters, as well as X-11 seasonal adjustment, trend, and irregular filters.

Class action has the potential to recreate, in the judicial domain, the same effects that individual interests and motivations, governed by the perfect competition paradigm, bring to the market. Moreover, through economic analysis it is possible to rediscover not only the productive function of this legal machinery, but also that partial compensation of victims and large profits for the class counsel, far from being a side-effect, are actually a necessary condition for reallocation of the costs and risks associated with the legal action.","[Cassone, Alberto; Ramello, Giovanni B.] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Choice, POLIS, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Ramello, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Choice, POLIS, Via Cavour 84, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy.",giovanni.ramello@sp.unipmn.it,,,,,,,33,10,10,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

It is interesting to note that the client-firms, on the other hand, decide to hire those assets based mostly on the prevailing short-term market forces. Hence, it is important for the companies which provide the assets for hire to also build the prevailing short-term market trends into their long-term forecasting and planning. In this paper, we develop a model for tracking these two simultaneously evolving and interacting patterns, namely the asset-availability (i.e. supply) and utilization (i.e. demand) patterns, in order to better understand the underlying processes, and thereby provide a basis for better forecasting. We test our models using three sets of data collected from the oil drilling industry, and find the proposed model to provide a good fit and forecasting efficiency.

This practice can have both social costs and social benefits. For an example of the social benefits of consolidating separate claims, if the facts giving rise to the claims are substantially similar, then there may be significant savings in litigation and court administrative costs from presenting those facts once rather a multitude of times. There may, however, be significant social costs to creating a class of litigants and consolidating their claims. For example, this practice may empower those with frivolous negative expected-value claims to wring an unwarranted settlement from the defendant or defendants. The article surveys other sources of social cost and benefit from class-action litigation, reviews the empirical literature on these actions, and examines recent U.S. policy debates about reforming class-action litigation. The article concludes that class-action litigation can have substantial net social benefits but only if courts assiduously oversee the class certification process so as to identify and forestall the social-cost-generating aspects of class-action litigation.","Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Ulen, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",tulen@law.illinois.edu,,,,,,,25,11,12,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Using data from US metropolitan areas, we show that not only are average wages greater in metropolitan areas with higher market access, but wage differentials are also more unequally distributed. Specifically, greater market access is linked to relatively weaker (stronger) outcomes for those at the bottom (top) of the wage distribution. Further assessment finds that market potential is favorably associated with greater shares of high-skilled workers. The analysis provides further rationale for the much-observed positive relationship between the metropolitan area's share of high-skilled workers and its skilled-worker wage premium (all else constant).","[Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Olfert, M.

We show that the outcome under affiliation depends on the tradeoff between platform rent extraction (which increases in exclusivity) and content rent extraction (which increases in multihoming), and demonstrate that the propensity for exclusivity can be increasing, decreasing, or even nonmonotonic in content quality. Finally, if a content provider internalizes the effect of its own price on platform demand, we prove that a platform that already has exclusive access to content may prefer to relinquish control over content pricing to the content provider in order to reduce price competition at the platform level.","[Hagiu, Andrei] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Lee, Robin S.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA",Harvard University; New York University,"Hagiu, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Morgan Hall 212, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",ahagiu@hbs.edu; rslee@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,21,47,56,2,56,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Along the way, we develop a model consistent with between-country differences in overall fertility and fertility timing. Our analysis of ART centers around the distinction between biomedical and behavioral effects. While improvements in ART have the biomedical effect of raising fertility, they may cause some women who would otherwise have tried to have children earlier on in life to postpone childbirth to later in life when the conception success probability is lower. This behavioral effect of postponement may reduce the fertility rate.","[Rainer, Helmut] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Selvaretnam, Geethanjali; Ulph, David] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Salvators Coll, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of St Andrews,"Rainer, H (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",RAINER@ifo.de,,"Selvaretnam, Geethanjali/0000-0002-7609-8388; Rainer, Helmut/0000-0003-1181-2568; Ulph, David/0000-0003-3171-1270",,,,,45,5,6,2,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Advocates of net neutralityaEuroincluding President Obama and the current FCC majority-believe that owners of broadband distribution systems (hardware used to distribute Internet and video services) and producers of certain must-have video content should be subject to prophylactic regulation that transcends present-day antitrust law enforcement. In the economic terms that are used in debates on competition policy, the concern is with vertical integration that may give firms both the opportunity (through denial of access or price discrimination) and incentive (increased profit) to restrict competition. This paper's central point is that virtually every production process in the economy is vertically integrated, and economics predicts changes in the extent of vertical integration-that is, changes in the boundaries of the firm-in response to changes in relative prices, technology, or institutions. Both vertical integration and changes in the extent of vertical integration are benign characteristics of efficient, dynamic, competitive markets. While there is no shortage of theoretical models in which vertical integration may be harmful, most such models have restrictive assumptions and ambiguous welfare predictions-even when market power is assumed to be present. Empirical evidence that vertical integration or vertical restraints are harmful is weak, compared to evidence that vertical integration is beneficial-again, even in cases where market power appears to be present. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that prophylactic regulation is not necessary, and may well reduce welfare. Sound policy is to wait for ex post evidence of harm to justify interventions in specific cases. Net neutrality, recently enacted by the FCC but subject to judicial review, is an unfortunate idea.","[Owen, Bruce M.] Stanford Inst Econ Policy Res, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Owen, Bruce M.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Owen, BM (通讯作者)，Stanford Inst Econ Policy Res, 366 Galvez St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",BruceOwen@Stanford.edu,,,,,,,64,7,7,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The themes of the paper are structured according to five of the Dolowitz and Marsh questions: what is transferred?; why do actors engage in policy transfer?; who are the key actors involved in the policy transfer process?; from where are the lessons drawn?: and what restricts or facilitates the policy transfer process? The methodological approach taken for considering each question involves two steps. Firstly, a bottom-up step considers the views of policy transfer from a city perspective, for which use is made of results from interviews recently carried out within the EU project Transport Research Knowledge Centre (TRKC). These interviews were intended to ascertain the information needs of seven representatives of European cities, all of whom were involved in the Cities Reference Group of the EU project Citymobil. These seven cities have widely varying characteristics in terms of size and geographical location (across Europe). By discussing information needs, the interviewees provided many insights into the transport policy transfer process. Secondly, a top-down step considers the policy transfer questions from an EU perspective'; use here is made of various transport policy documents published by the European Commission (EC). For each of the five questions, bottom-up and top-down perspectives are examined and compared. The final section of the paper draws conclusions, providing a number of recommendations to both city authorities and the EU on how urban transport policy transfer might be enhanced in the future.

A dataset of 114 monthly indicators is set up and simple bridge equations are estimated. The individual forecasts are then pooled, using different weighting schemes. To take into consideration the release calendar of each indicator, six forecasts are compiled successively during the quarter. We found that the sequencing of information determines the weight allocated to each block of indicators, especially when the first month of hard data becomes available. This conclusion extends the findings of the recent literature. Moreover, when combining forecasts, two weighting schemes are found to outperform the equal weighting scheme in almost all cases. Compared to an AR forecast, these improve by more than 40% the forecast performance for GDP in the current and next quarter.

The rise of Ecological Economics can be seen as a positive step towards integrating social and natural science understanding by a movement that aims to go beyond the confines of mainstream economics towards a progressive political economy of the environment. However, this vision has not been shared by all those who have associated themselves with Ecological Economics and there has been conflict. An historical analysis is presented that shows the role of mainstream theory in delimiting the field of environmental research. The argument is put forward that rather than employing a purely mechanistic objective empirical methodology there is a need for an integrating interdisciplinarity heterodox economic approach. In order to distinguish this approach-from the more mainstream multidisciplinary linking of unreconstituted ecological and economic models-the name Social Ecological Economics is put forward as expressing the essential socio-economic character of the needed work ahead.","[Spash, Clive L.] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Socioecon, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Spash, Clive L.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragr, As, Norway",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Spash, CL (通讯作者)，WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Socioecon, Nordbergstr 15-4-B UZA 4, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",clive.spash@umb.no,"Spash, Clive/IST-5510-2023",,,,,,127,65,72,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We rationalize conflicting results in the empirical literature, finding a nonmonotonic relationship between a firm's expected environmental performance and its environmental disclosures. Greater activist pressure deters greenwash, but induces some firms to disclose less about their environmental performance.

We found that because of the financial crisis there was an increase in the impact of news about volatility from the previous periods but only a slight drop in the persistency of the conditional variance.","[Angabini, Amir; Wasiuzzaman, Shaista] Multimedia Univ, Fac Mangement, Cyberjaya, Malaysia",Multimedia University,,amir_2005641@yahoo.com; shaista@mmu.edu.my,"Wasiuzzaman, Shaista/H-8403-2019","Wasiuzzaman, Shaista/0000-0002-0244-2174",,,,,46,0,1,0,3,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8719-3,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,3.0,,,,,,79,84,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX67,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303218200017,0

According to the definition of risk supported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a function of hazard and resilience lines of evidence was defined. The results of the hazard and resilience assessment were used to develop an economic framework based on Faustmann studies. The evaluation model, implemented through a spatial analysis procedure, was carried out linking Faustmann formula with hazard and resilience raster maps. The model permitted to estimate in monetary terms two possible costs to be supported: the first one is expressed as the expected damage to the forest crop on the basis of the current obtainable woody assortments and the second one referred to the potential expenses to pay in order to mitigate the risk. Finally, the framework was tested on an area of central Italy (Tuscany region). (C) 2011 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umea, Sweden. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Within their regulatory frameworks, corporations define security standards for the protection of information and procedures that enable them to operate in a highly competitive environment. The article focuses specifically on Slovenian private or public corporations that have control over certain parts of critical infrastructure and impose restrictive measures adopted on the basis of legal requirements or internal safety regulations. These measures, however, can strongly infringe on the privacy of employees, working in such organisations, and thus cause additional stress on individuals.

Our hypothesis is that real output is characterized by a non-linear mean reverting process. It is flexible Fourier stationary unit root test proposed by Enders and Lee (2004, 2009) to assess the nonstationary properties of the real GDP per capita that has been applied for nine Central Eastern-European Countries from 1969 to 2009. The results of our research have proved that Fourier stationary unit root test has higher power than linear method if the true data generating process of per capita real GDP is in fact a stationary non-liner process of an unknown form with structural change using the low frequency components. The investigation of the stationary of per capita real GDP from the non-linear point of view provides strong evidence clearly indicating that real output is well characterized by a non-linear mean reverting process, namely in Bulgaria, Latvia and Romania. The evidence is that these three countries are non-linear stationary, implying that per capita real GDP follows a steady rate of growth, and policy innovations rather then have temporary effects. These results have important policy implications for macroeconomic policy, modeling, testing and forecasting for Central Eastern-European Countries.","[Su, Chi-Wei] Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chang, Hsu-Ling; Su, Chi-Wei; Zhu, Meng-Nan] Xiamen Univ, Dept Finance, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chang, Hsu-Ling] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taichung, Taiwan",Tamkang University; Xiamen University,"Su, CW (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan.",hsulingchang@yahoo.com.tw; cwsu@mail.tku.edu.tw; zmnan@xmu.edu.cn,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021; Zhu, Meng-Nan/JXL-7243-2024","Zhu, Meng-Nan/0000-0002-1313-3692",,,,,26,0,0,0,6,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The latter corresponds to a moving average parameter theta that is equal to or close to 1. The joint limiting distribution of the maximum likelihood estimators (b) over cap and (theta) over cap of the regression parameter vector b and the moving average parameter theta is described. Unlike the case with standard time series models, the limiting distribution of (b) over cap depends on whether or not theta is being estimated. Specifically, the limit distribution of (b) over cap is non-normal if theta is also being estimated and is normal if theta is unestimated and equal to 1. The asymptotic behavior of the generalized likelihood ratio statistic for testing theta = 1 vs. theta < 1 is also studied and shown to perform well compared to the locally best invariant unbiased test of Tanaka (1990).

This qualitative study explored images and perceptions of cycling, their potential influence on cycling and whether these views differed between regular, occasional and non-riders. Seventy participants (24 males and 46 females) were recruited. Of these, 22 were classified as non-riders, 23 were occasional riders and 25 were regular riders. Twelve focus groups were held in inner Sydney during October and November 2005. Data were audio taped, transcribed and thematically analysed. Themes linked to images of cycling included: 'clean and green'; 'healthy and fun': 'dangerous' and 'serious business'. Themes linked to images of cyclists included: 'risk takers and law breakers' and 'status and sub-cultures'. Discussion centred on the low social status of riding over other transport modes, the relative acceptability of different riding sub-cultures, the 'green' image of cycling transport and the status associated with the riders clothing and bicycle choice, especially lycra and its 'serious and sporty' connotation. While 'cycling' was generally viewed as a positive, environmentally friendly activity, the actions of some 'cyclists' were disliked, which influenced views about cycling, particularly among non-riders. A cycling acceptability hierarchy emerged; with recreational riding at the top, followed by cycling for sport and exercise, with transport/commuter cycling towards the bottom. Bicycle couriers were viewed least favourably. A common perception among non-riders was the latter two groups were rule breakers and risk takers, while regular riders felt unfairly judged by this stereotype. While there was greater acceptance of recreational riding, riding for transport was not viewed as a mainstream activity. There is a need to improve the public acceptability of cycling and change public norms so it is seen as an everyday activity that can be undertaken by almost anyone, without the need for special clothing, expensive equipment or limited to purpose built facilities.

The methodology is based on the use of both passenger perceptions and transit agency performance measures involving the main aspects characterizing a transit service. The combination of these two types of service quality measurement fulfils the need to provide a reliable as possible measurement tool of the transit performance. Considering passenger perceptions is fundamental because the customer's point of view is very relevant for evaluating the performance of a transit service. At the same time, the use of a more objective measurement provided by the transit agency can be a useful solution for obtaining a more comprehensive service quality measurement. The proposed procedure is applied to a real case study of a suburban bus line; a series of subjective and objective indicators are calculated on the basis of users' perception about the service and measurements provided by the transit agency.

Countries as well as enterprises all over the world have been threatened by this event significantly. The crisis has influenced almost every area of the human life. One of the areas affected by the crisis in the most significant way was the area of human resources management. Despite the fact that people - employees are considered to be the most important company's asset and the crucial source of its competitiveness, they have become the most frequent object of the costs cuts. Companies have started to downsize, to reduce wages and benefits and also to reduce the duration and extent of employee education. Due to the fact that employee education is the most important way of the human capital development, the restrictive actions in this field might have fatal consequences on the future performance of the company. The paper deals with the most significant changes in the area of employee education under the conditions of the global crisis. It is based on a survey aimed at human capital and potential development that was carried out on a sample of Slovak enterprises at the beginning of 2010. The objective of the survey was to analyze the initiatives of the Slovak enterprises in the area of human capital and potential development as well as to identify the most significant changes in performing these activities as a result of the global economic crisis. The main aim of the paper is to characterize the impact of the global crisis particularly at the labor market and to identify the impact of the global crisis on the investments into human capital development with the focus on employee education as one of the personal activities.","Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Econ & Management, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Elexová, G (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Econ & Management, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",gabriela.elexova@umb.sk,,,,,,,10,5,5,0,21,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The entrepreneurial orientation is crucial to continue existing plans or to promote new entrepreneurial ideas. This nascent willingness of entrepreneurs has to be analysed in order to indicate the influences on entrepreneurial activity. The way the attitude to entrepreneurial orientation is influenced by entrepreneurial activity is fairly nebulous. Therefore, this paper mainly wants to investigate the relationship between these factors. The hypotheses were tested by the regression model to identify the value of interrelation of the entrepreneurial orientation. The data consists of 498 questionnaires, which were completed twice. The asked questions were answered before the entrepreneurial activity and additionally afterwards. During the arranged entrepreneurial activity the students had the task to create value in one week just by using one pen. The limited resource pen symbolized the resource restriction which symbolizes the restriction in real business. The results showed that the activities within the project influenced the self-employment. The ability to start an entrepreneurial career is influenced by the participation in entrepreneurial activity. Moreover, we found that opportunity recognition has a strong significance but does not develop more intensively during the entrepreneurial activity. These insights have important implications for entrepreneurial programmes which are seeking a higher orientation of the participants to be an entrepreneur and for the configuration of entrepreneurial programmes. Future programmes have to improve the capability of opportunity recognition. The results also show that there is no significant effect on the personal attitude. The participants did not change their attitudes. To sum up, this analysis intents to measure the specific effects on the change of entrepreneurial orientation. This paper highlights entrepreneurial activity and their specific influences to the nascent willingness to establish a company.","[Fiegler, Torsten] Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Dresden, Germany; [Schefczyk, Michael] Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Turkey",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Fiegler, T (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Dresden, Germany.",torsten.fiegler@tu-dresden.de; michael@schefczyk.net,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,1069,1072,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800127,0

The main results suggest that, although some sectors can be considered as playing a particularly important role as a source of pecuniary knowledge externalities in the majority of examined countries, there exist significant national differences in the occurrence of these effects. Moreover, such external effects influence the dynamics of total factor productivity in downstream sectors and appear as a relevant source of growth in modern economies. As such, the concept of pecuniary knowledge externalities, as opposed to pure knowledge externalities postulated in the new growth theory, provides a new understanding of the growth process.","[Gehringer, Agnieszka] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Gehringer, Agnieszka] Univ Turin, Dept Econ S Cognetti de Martiis, Turin, Italy",University of Gottingen; University of Turin,"Gehringer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",agnieszka.gehringer@wiwi.uni-goettinge.de,,,,,,,39,11,11,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

But in absolute terms, the CR is going to receive the second largest amount of EU funds within CEE region just after Poland with a EUR 83.1bn bulk. EU funds are expected to affect the economy through both demand-side and supply-side channels. Demand-side effects are associated with short-term expenditure multipliers; supply-side gains materialize through the enhancement of production capacity via improved infrastructure, boosting innovation and developing of human capital. While demand-side effects might dominate in the short-term, boosting potential growth is far more important in a longer term perspective. The impact of EU funds might also be diminished by a number of factors. These include the potential crowding-out of public and private investment, an increase in the savings rate in anticipation of just temporary support, and an excessive appreciation of the real exchange rate (via inflation or the nominal exchange rate) that might deteriorate external competitiveness. This paper focuses on these issues and tries to identify the key economic impacts of EU funds on the Czech economy.","[Horska, Helena] Vysoka Skola Skoda Auto, Raiffeisenbank As VSE, Mlada Boleslav, Czech Republic",,,horska@gmail.com,"Horská, Elena/AAQ-6137-2020",,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-77-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,186,193,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDJ83,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313565200019,0

The firm then may not recall the product as often as socially desired or provide insufficient reimbursement for consumers' return costs. In contrast, the full duty to return rule denies the firm's future liabilities after it makes a recall. More consumers then return the product, which may reduce the firm's incentives to recall the product. We show that the full duty to return rule may or may not generate more product recalls or higher social welfare.

While the geography of sex work has received considerable scholarly attention since the 1970s, such analyses have focused upon the interplay between market pressures and sexual values in the production of sexual spaces. This paper takes a different stance, as it analyses the Schipperskwartier's restructuring in the light of the globalisation of the sex industry. This analysis reveals how more attention should be paid to globalisation's local mediation (glocalisation) in the analysis of the changing urban geographies of sex work. Such an approach not only supports the interpretation of local diversity in the urban geographies of sex work. It also conveys a more politicised understanding as it zooms in on the political struggles in which new urban geographies of sex work unfold.","[Loopmans, Maarten] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, EES, B-3001 Louvain, Heverlee, Belgium; [Van den Broeck, Pieter] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Architecture Urbanism & Spatial Planning, B-3001 Louvain, Heverlee, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Loopmans, M (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, EES, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Louvain, Heverlee, Belgium.",Maarten.loopmans@ees.kuleuven.be; pieter.vandenbroeck@asro.kuleuven.be,"Loopmans, Maarten/ABE-9286-2020","Loopmans, Maarten/0000-0002-7157-5608; Van den Broeck, Pieter/0000-0002-3388-0759",,,,,78,20,21,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The dominant view among heterodox economists is that this point of critical mass was reached because of various failures in the financial system. This paper puts the accompanying view that the toxic assets were created largely in response to external pressures, a principle source of which was global inequality: while income inequality was an important factor behind the supply of those assets, wealth concentration was a major factor behind the demand for them. The policy implications of this analysis are that income distribution and wealth ownership have to be more equitably structured if global financial crises are to be avoided in the future. This is not to exclude other proposals for making the financial system more transparent and accountable. The point, rather, is that these proposals are insufficient on their own. No matter how radical the re-structuring of the financial system, as long as there remain external pressures on it to create products or to indulge in practices that are harmful to it, such products and practices will continue to be introduced and financial crises will continue to occur.","London Metropolitan Univ, London Metropolitan Business Sch, London N7 8HN, England",London Metropolitan University,"Lysandrou, P (通讯作者)，London Metropolitan Univ, London Metropolitan Business Sch, 277-281 Holloway Rd, London N7 8HN, England.",p.lysandrou@londonmet.ac.uk,,,,,,,28,49,53,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Research-based spin-offs in Poland have become the most promoted and desired mechanism of knowledge and technology commercialisation. Their creation has already become a central point of numerous national and regional programmes and projects fostering entrepreneurial behaviour among academic and non-academic researchers. Even though there are still a number of legal, economic and social barriers in the way of this form of scientific entrepreneurship in Poland, such ventures have already grown in popularity. However, due to the specificity of the Polish economy, there needs to be a unique research-based spin-off creation model developed, particularly for the publically funded non-academic R&D institutions - Public Research Organisations (PROs). The authors of this article, on the basis of selected international case studies analyses, have examined two models of research-based spin-off ventures creation: the downstream and the upstream model and following this investigation they have developed the most effective, in their opinion, spin-off creation model for Polish public research institutes. The model they have come up with is based on the downstream spin-off creation model, in which the innovative solution developed at the parent institution is at the core of this commercialisation undertaking. There are two sub-models of the downstream spin-off creation model and the difference between them concerns the means of financing the establishment of the spin-off enterprise. The first of these sub-models assumes direct financing of the business start up by the R&D sector, usually by the parent organisation itself, whereas in the later the means of financing the new venture creation come from external funds, i.e. external investors or structural funds. The model developed by the authors of the paper comprises and further elaborates on both these sub-models of the downstream research-based spin-off creation model.","[Mazurkiewicz, Adam; Poteralska, Beata; Wnuk, Urszula] Natl Res Inst ITeE PIB, Inst Sustainable Technol, Radom, Poland",Institute for Sustainable Technologies,,adam.mazurkiewicz@itee.radom.pl; beata.poteralska@itee.radom.pl; urszula.wnuk@itee.radom.pl,"Poteralska, Beata/D-6882-2018; Poteralska, Beata/AAG-1151-2021","Poteralska, Beata/0000-0002-4670-0024;",,,,,18,4,4,1,12,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,629,636,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800076,0

Rapid prototyping is widely used in the automotive, aerospace, medical, and consumer products industries. Although the possible applications are virtually limitless, nearly all fall into one of the following categories: prototyping, rapid tooling, or rapid manufacturing.","[Novakova-Marcincinova, Ludmila] Tech Univ Kosice, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,,ludmila.marcincinova@tuke.sk,"Novakova-Marcincinova, Ludmila/AAB-4041-2020","Novakova-Marcincinova, Ludmila/0000-0001-9298-8818",,,,,7,2,2,0,7,TECHNICAL UNIV CLUJ-NAPOCA,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"28 MEMORANDUMULUI STREET, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400114, ROMANIA",,,978-973-662-614-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,333,336,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDA57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312344600073,0

Yet, the verification of the proposed research hypotheses is not consistent As regards the first hypothesis which suggests a positive relationship between company size and export intensity, it ought to be noted that in the case of the studied companies, company size has little effect on export intensity. In terms of using revenue as a measure of company size, it may be pointed out that its increase does not significantly affect the growth of export intensity. Also, as far as number of employees as a measure of company size is concerned, one may note that higher number of employees does not indicate higher degree of export intensity.

The results indicate that the PMF motivated its researchers, as well as facilitated the achievement of organisational objectives. The results also indicated the presence of a wide range of interactive management controls that were employed to design and implement the PMF. These interactive controls included leadership enthusiasm, ownership, open communication and other informal activities that acted as a lubricant to reduce the friction of the formal PMF. In effect, these informal controls motivated researchers because they provided a series of rewards, they improved the perception of formal controls and they increased the efficiency of the organisation structure.","[Sartorius, Kurt; Eitzen, Carolyn] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Accountancy, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Uliana, Enrico] Univ Cape Town, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Cape Town,"Sartorius, K (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Accountancy, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,,,,,,61,0,0,0,10,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The time is right for higher education administrators, faculty, and staff to begin applying Lean Management to their business. Lean management is the way to reduce costs, improve quality, simplify processes, gain market share, stabilize or grow employment, and better satisfy costumers. This paper first addresses a framework for studying lean management, as well as some consideration on the task of higher education. I am focused on the five principles of lean production and eight types of waste in a higher educational context, in order to find out the limitations and extensions of the lean management philosophy when using the concept in higher education. Thus, I examined the following lean principles: specify value by, specific product, identify value stream for each product, make the value flow without interruptions, let the costumer pull value from the producer, and pursue perfection. I have approached other concepts like: value in higher education, the line workers, customer in higher education and others. Comparative researches performed on observations and case studies allow the identification and the application of new model to implement the Lean in higher education. The fourth step model is described below: identify the opportunities - complete an organization - wide diagnostic search for issues, problems and opportunities, solution design - create a blueprint for success that involves all employees, implementation/ use kaizen events, core teams, and metrics to implement and illustrate change, - continuous improvement - monitor performance after the projects are completed. Everybody knows that waste exists in higher education, and lean management seems to be a useful tool for reducing the different types of waste and, in this way improving higher education. In order to achieve lean management in higher education, the identification of values has to take place as well as organisational changes. Lean is a better way to begin improvement than the traditional quality approaches are. There are fewer initial tools to learn, the whole process can be done very quickly, and the resultants can be more powerful than any single traditional quality improvement effort. The implementation of lean management is materialized in numerous benefits and reduces waste. The overall impact is the cultural concept that a positive change can and does happen at all universities. The implications are: cost savings, efficiencies, personal performance improvements, student satisfaction and faculty satisfaction. The value originality refers to the new approach of Lean management in Romanian universities. Also, concerning the Lean management, universities can improve their educational processes, provide educational services of quality and form or consolidate their image in the European or international university field.","[Todorut, Amalia Venera] Constantin Brancusi Univ Targu Jiu, Targu Jiu, Romania",Constantin Brancusi University,,amalia_venera@yahoo.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,25,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,453,456,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000114,0

The aim of this paper is to propose a framework to analyse these developments. It does so from a historical institutionalist perspective by employing path dependency arguments. However, after an analysis of past and present of exhibition centres in Europe, it is found that this theory contains some omissions which make them less suitable for the analysis of such large scale urban projects. To correct these omissions, a multidimensional view to path dependency, consisting of four different dimensions is proposed.

It is argued that corresponding developments in all four dimensions lead to path dependent development, while divergence from this correspondence in one of these dimensions leads to a critical juncture.

Against a background of the recent almost global recessionary climate, this lack of employment is a serious problem. While government has responded with many initiatives to deal with employment creation, unemployment rates in South Africa remain high. In this paper the problem of low employment economic growth performance is initially examined for the period 1994-2008 by drawing on the Harrod-Domar model and then over a longer time period by using regression analysis. The paper uses a parsimonious regression model to highlight the probable links between changes in economic growth and changes in employment. The growth elasticity of employment over the 1994-2008 period is low and over a longer time horizon the marginal growth employment effect is weak.","[Mahadea, Darma; Simson, Richard] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mahadea, D (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa.",,,,,,,,55,9,12,0,17,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

But does such an optimal fine exist? We focus on emissions from production, and, even if we assume that the damage function is perfectly known, we still show that the optimal fine typically does not exist. Non-existence occurs as the environmental damage function is non-linear in overall emissions, meaning that there are interactions between emissions, the economy and the environment. We argue that these interactions cannot be accurately reflected in the fine imposed by the regulator. Previous literature on optimal fines does not recognize the non-existence of the applicable optimal fine, basically since this literature uses discrete models where the damage caused by the crime is assumed constant. Our result reduces the attractiveness of fines and might thus help explain enforcement agencies' inclination towards non-monetary enforcement instruments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We argue that density forecasts are more appropriate than point forecasts and that a good forecasting system might choose a different model for each ATM. An analysis of the data finds that seasonal structure, first-order autocorrelation and cash-out days are important aspects of the data. Predictive sequential (prequential) comparisons between linear models, autoregressive models, structural time series models and Markov-switching models are made. The Markov-switching models are preferred because they are found to produce better density forecasts, and might also be more useful for inventory control because they separate the demand for cash from 'out-of-service' effects.

We re-examine this claim by using realized volatility as an estimator of the unobserved volatility, adopting a stationary de-trended trading volume, and applying a more recent data sample with robustness tests over time. Our linear Granger causality test shows that there is no causal linear relation running from volume to volatility, but there exists an ambiguous causality for the reverse direction. In contrast, we find strong bi-directional non-linear Granger causality between these two variables. On the basis of the non-linear forecasting modeling technique, this study provides strong evidence to support the sequential information hypothesis and demonstrates that it is useful to use lagged values of trading volume to predict return volatility.

The main outcome is that fixed specific investment positively impacts contract duration confirming previous theoretical conjectures. Additionally, other variables such us the price-cost margin of the franchise, the brand name or the discount factor also play a relevant role. The empirical analysis using a large sample of franchises operating in Spain confirms the main conclusions of the model. However, the connection found between investment and duration, although statistically robust, is weak from an economic point of view. This result suggests the possibility that, in general, most franchisees are not in equilibrium because of the high standardization of this contract term across franchises. In these cases, the expectation of renewal is likely to be a crucial element of adjustment.","[Llorca-Vivero, Rafael] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Llorca-Vivero, R (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Ave Naranjos S-N,Edificio Dept Oriental, Valencia 46022, Spain.",aliciagherrera@icav.es; Rafael.llorca@uv.es,"Llorca-Vivero, Rafael/G-9902-2015","Llorca-Vivero, Rafael/0000-0003-1729-4204",,,,,19,9,9,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Using New York City as a case study, this paper analyzes how Mayor Michael Bloomberg's 2007 congestion pricing proposal gained widespread public support but was ultimately blocked in the State Legislature. The paper assesses the implications of New York's experience for pursuing congestion pricing and mileage-based taxes in the United States. A central conclusion from this analysis is that gaining approval of pricing will require changing how motorists view the effect of pricing on them personally. Given the power of even small groups of auto users to block pricing through the political process, pricing proposals need to be perceived as benefiting drivers individually and not simply society at large.

Yet a fundamental and unresolved empirical question is whether the lack of political and civil freedoms is a cause of greater insecurity. This paper takes a new approach to an answer by using microdata on 106,170 people in 61 nations for 1981-97. Controlling for country and year fixed effects, we find that freedom has strong and robust negative effects on revolutionary support. A 1-standard-deviation rise in freedom, equivalent to a shift from Argentina to the United States, decreases support by 3 percentage points, or 37 percent of the standard deviation of the proportion of people who want to revolt. Greater growth in the gross domestic product can buy off part of the increase in support when freedoms are constrained.

A simple choice theory model of crime participation and labor supply suggests that low-wage workers may substitute time and effort away from illegal activity to legal and remunerative recycling activity. Between 1973 and 2001, eleven states and one city enacted bottle recycling laws, and this paper exploits the variation in the year of implementation of the bottle laws to measure and test for any reduction in crime rates. The results show that city-level petty crime rates in bottle law states are on average 11% lower than city-level petty crime rates in non-bottle law states. Although the primary positive benefits of recycling income go to low-income individuals, the unexpected secondary benefit of lower crime rates affects both high- and low-income individuals.","[Ashenmiller, Bevin] Occidental Coll, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA",Occidental College,"Ashenmiller, B (通讯作者)，1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.",bevin@oxy.edu,,,,,,,29,8,8,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

Corruption dilutes deterrence, and hence the government needs to adjust law enforcement activities appropriately. We argue that this distortion is not the only one taking place.

We attend more closely to the scale of derivatives utilization, types of derivatives used, risks hedged by these instruments and the main determinants influencing usage of derivatives. Furthermore, we discuss reasons for non-usage of financial derivatives among companies. Past and present state of derivative market in Slovakia is also analyzed. The emphasis of this paper lies on analysis and reasoning of results that have emerged from our primary research in UK and secondary research in Slovakia. Stronger competition among companies has arisen under globalization processes. New companies from emerging economies are also entering global markets. These are only some of number of reasons which make global business environment more risky and difficult to survive in. Hence the need for effective protection against risk or in other words hedging. Derivatives are definitely important area for companies to consider when coping with various risks. Caution should be applied when using derivatives due to the fact that it is very easy to deviate of the main purpose (hedging) and slip into speculation which might deteriorate company's position on the market. Risk management is nowadays inevitable part of every successful company and derivative instruments only contribute to further sharpen teeth of any risk manager. Main obstacles faced when attempting to conduct pertinent and statistically valid academic research in regards to financial derivatives in Slovak Republic is mainly insufficiently developed capital market which directly results from lack of liquidity and functionality, lack of investors, few initial public offerings, lack of trust of retail investors towards mutual investing and last but not least need to harmonize Slovak financial legislation with legislation of European Union.","[Cisar, Radomir] Exchange Data Int Ltd, London EC1N 8DL, England; [Dufala, Vaclav] UMB Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Císar, R (通讯作者)，Exchange Data Int Ltd, 32-33 Hatton Garden, London EC1N 8DL, England.",radocisar@hotmail.com; vdufala@lanco.sk,,,,,,,31,2,2,2,21,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Through the imitation of standardized technology, which is widely used by FDI and so on, and while FDI promoted growth of Zhejiang foreign trade and economy, FDI has also led an employment increase through the technology spill-over effect, connection effect, and competition effect.

The low level of competitiveness is caused by features, factors and conditions of a given local government unit that influence unfavourably in comparison to its main competitors.","[Grzebyk, Mariola] Univ Rzeszow, Rzeszow, Poland",University of Rzeszow,,mgrzebyk@op.pl,,"Grzebyk, Mariola/0000-0003-1107-0250",,,,,5,2,2,0,1,GAUDEAMUS,HRADEC KRALOVE,"UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE, ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-040-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,95,98,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCL97,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310659300020,0

This in mind, the contribution provides more in depth insights what has been achieved so far in East German regions in terms of catching up economically. For this purpose, regional development in Saxony which is often regarded as one of - economically - most successful states in the eastern part of the country is analyzed. The Bavarian regions which stand for a relatively successful catching upprocess in West Germany serve as a benchmark. To avoid an inappropriate comparison, it is done for groups of regions which show similar characteristics in terms of settlement structure. The analysis comprises both the economic results achieved as well as indicators which affect economic results. Though in the early 1990ies a rapid convergence in terms of productivity occurred, until now a productivity gap remains, and since the mid-1990ies catching-up in terms of overall productivity is more or less stagnating. Moreover, considering the different types of regions, the Saxon-Bavarian productivity gap is greater in urban regions than in rural spaces. The analysis shows: Though on average Saxony is in comparison with other East German states at best endowed with factors relevant for economic growth, Saxon regions show a range of structural weak points in comparison with the Bavarian regions reflecting particularities of an economy in the post-transition period: lower R&D in the private enterprise sector, dominance of labour-intensive industries in the manufacturing sector whereas technology-driven industries are, with few exceptions, relatively rare. Further structural change will be needed, which has to be accompanied, against the background of a shrinking and ageing population with strong efforts to maintain human capital.","[Heimpold, Gerhard] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Dept Struct Econ, D-06108 Halle, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),,Gerhard.Heimpold@iwh-halle.de,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-180-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,116,116,,,,,,1,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BGW05,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000324343700007,0

The primary data source is the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79), 1979-1994. We show that binge drinking behavior is quite alcohol-price responsive and is a rational addiction. A new result is that an individual's decision to binge drink has a statistically significant negative effect on his/her earnings. Furthermore, we conducted simulations of the short-run and long-run impacts of increasing the alcohol price. They showed that the tendency for an individual to binge drink heavily is reduced significantly, and the reduction is greater in the long-run than short-run simulation. Also, an individual's annual earnings were increased. However, in the structural model, an individual's earnings have no significant effect on his/her tendency to engage in binge drinking. Our results contradict earlier findings from cross-section evidence that showed increased alcohol consumption raised an individual's earnings or wages.","[Keng, Shao-Hsun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan; [Huffman, Wallace E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",National University Kaohsiung; Iowa State University,"Keng, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",shkeng@nuk.edu.tw; whuffman@iastate.edu,"Keng, Shao-Hsun/W-6172-2019","Keng, Shao-Hsun/0000-0002-7153-5892",,,,,54,11,12,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

I draw on the pioneering work of Spencer Heath whose insights about the viability of proprietary communities were developed further by his grandson, Spencer Heath MacCallum who, in 1970, recognized that private real estate developers sometimes make their capital gains (mostly) by creating useful public spaces that others enjoy. I also draw inspiration from Fred Foldvary's effort in 1994 to synthesize the pubic goods problem in economics with the Henry George Theorem in urban economics. While the real estate owner-developer does emerge on my pages in a somewhat more favourable light than as originally portrayed by Henry George in his Progress and Poverty in 1879, I offer a realistic appraisal of the duplicitous behaviours required of such entrepreneurs. in the context of the modern regulatory state. Real estate development remains a 'hot button' item in local politics, and real estate developers must become genuine 'political entrepreneurs' if they are to complete their projects in a timely way and capture business profits.

Few possibilities of being employed as hired labour do not limit their chances for self-employment, which seems to be one of the most important ways to resolve the problem of unemployment in Poland and other European countries. Entrepreneurship depends on various conditions. Among them we can find those that are connected with the psychosocial qualities of the candidates to be entrepreneurs. The significance of these characteristics is often underestimated because more importance is attached to knowledge, skills and, above all, possessed financial capital. The paper presents the results of research conducted among students of one of the biggest business schools in Poland The choice of the survey's participants is motivated by the fact that this group, due to the chosen education path, is the most predisposed to become self-employed. The purpose of the study was to investigate their psychosocial predispositions to succeed The research findings indicate that a significant majority of the students intend to establish their own firm in the future. Paradoxically, they exhibit a whole range of characteristics which might become barriers to achieve this goal. Moreover, they are often not aware of this fact. Therefore, an education process aimed to promote entrepreneurship among young people should also shape their attitudes, value system and view of economic reality. This would increase the possibility that entrepreneurial activity will be successfully undertaken in the future.","[Pawlowska, Anna; Kacprzak, Agnieszka; Strzelecki, Adam] Warsaw Univ, Dept Org Theory, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Pawlowska, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ, Dept Org Theory, Fac Management, Ul Szturmowa 3, Warsaw, Poland.",annap@mail.wz.uw.edu.pl; agnieszka_kacprzak@op.pl; strzelecki@wz.uw.edu.pl,"Kacprzak, Agnieszka/ABD-1300-2020","Kacprzak, Agnieszka/0000-0003-1949-9131; Pawlowska, Anna/0000-0001-8534-3317",,,,,53,2,2,2,30,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

It neglects the imperatives of capitalism, underestimates of the impact of unequal power relations on business relationships, fails to incorporate time, fetishises proximity, treats entrepreneurship simplistically, promotes the chaotic concept of institutional thickness, and is limited by the chaotic concept of social capital.

In order to prepare the approaches which are necessary to carry out the strategic planning in the institutions, the role of the DSS was revealed, the structure of the system was defined, and the variety of the DSS was systematized. Besides, the factors which predetermine the requirements for the DSS of strategic planning in the institutions were defined. According to these factors and the results of the research on theoretical potential of decision support, it is rational to apply a complex character of intelligent support to prepare alternatives and to make decisions of strategic planning in public institutions.

Consequently, policy-makers are eager to keep their graduates in the region or attract graduates from elsewhere. It is also well known that people with a higher level of education exhibit high rates of spatial mobility. Much less is known about mobility patterns according to discipline and academic grade. Do the best people stay or leave, and does this vary according to discipline and type of region? This paper investigates the relationship between ability, field of study and spatial mobility using a micro-dataset on Dutch university and college graduates. The findings indicate that there are substantial net flows mainly towards the economic centre of the Netherlands, but that there are also flows between peripheral regions and to other countries. The paper finds that university graduates are more spatially mobile than vocational college level graduates and that when one looks at spatial behaviour according to discipline, there are also striking differences between graduates. This, however, does not necessarily mean that peripheral regions also lose their best graduates. For several disciplines, employers in the peripheral areas are able to retain the graduates with the highest grades, contrary to what the standard human capital framework predicts.

After presenting the most popular solutions we introduce also two of our own procedures that can be applied in the pre-negotiation phase for eliciting negotiators' preferences and building the offers' scoring systems for the parties. The first one is based on the Hammond, Keeney and Raiffa's procedure of even swaps, while the second derives from the Roy's ELECTRE-TRI. Both of them can be easily applied as the analytic engines in electronic negotiation systems replacing the classical additive scoring systems.

The founders usually own specific human capital and key technological capability, enabling them to take the operational risk and to appropriate rewards of innovations under the industrial environment of rapid technological change. Whether high-tech RD spinoffs, compared to their other spinoff counterparts, have better RD productivity remains less well explored. According to the conceptual discussion of the advantages of intangible innovation assets embodied in company founders, this study argues that the founders' innovation cognition, knowledge externalities, absorptive capability and routine experience can help RD spinoffs to have higher RD productivity. We thus propose three hypotheses that are then empirically tested. Based on a sample of Taiwanese electronics firms, the empirical findings show that RD spinoffs invest with a higher RD intensity and on average have more patents issued. More importantly, the microeconometric estimates show that the patent and output elasticities of the RD of RD spinoffs are significantly higher than those of other firms, indicating that they actually have higher RD productivity.","[Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Jhongli 320, Taiwan; [Lin, Hui-Lin; Li, Hsiao-Yun] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Central University; National Taiwan University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, 300 Jhongda Rd, Jhongli 320, Taiwan.",chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,"de Lima, Andréia/G-8040-2014",,,,,,40,5,5,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

To address heterogeneity and simultaneity in the relation between police and crime, we model the police funding formula - used to distribute police resources across municipalities - to identify the endogenous variation in police levels. We use the remaining variation in police levels to identify the effect of police. We find significantly negative effects of higher police levels on property and violent crime. public disorder, and victim precaution.

We focus here on the impact of transactions costs associated with patent thickets on new entrants' interactions with the capital markets. Using data on the financing of entrants into 27 narrowly defined software markets, we show that start-up software companies operating in markets characterized by denser patent thickets saw their initial acquisition of VC funding delayed relative to firms in markets less affected by patents after the mid 1990s. The relationship between patent thickets and subsequent financing activity such as IPO or acquisition is more complex, but there is weak evidence that firms without patents became less likely to go public if they operated in a market characterized by patent thickets. Firms with patents are more likely to be funded or experience a liquidity event. However, the application for a patent appears to matter more than its grant.","[Cockburn, Iain M.; MacGarvie, Megan J.] Boston Univ, Sch Management, Dept Finance & Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Cockburn, Iain M.; MacGarvie, Megan J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cockburn, IM (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Sch Management, Dept Finance & Econ, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",cockburn@bu.edu; mmacgarv@bu.edu,"Cockburn, Iain/G-9524-2013","Cockburn, Iain/0000-0003-2034-0187",,,,,57,76,101,3,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

We highlight the large number of choices that must be made when specifying the various panel data models that have been used to address this question. There is little clarity about the knowledge potential murderers have concerning the risk of execution: are they influenced by the passage of a death penalty statute, the number of executions in a state, the proportion of murders in a state that leads to an execution, and details about the limited types of murders that are potentially susceptible to a sentence of death? If an execution rate is a viable proxy, should it be calculated using the ratio of last year's executions to last year's murders, last year's executions to the murders a number of years earlier, or some other values? We illustrate how sensitive various estimates are to these choices. Importantly, the most up-to-date OLS panel data studies generate no evidence of a deterrent effect, while three 2SLS studies purport to find such evidence. The 2SLS studies, none of which shows results that are robust to clustering their standard errors, are unconvincing because they all use a problematic structure based on poorly measured and theoretically inappropriate pseudo-probabilities that are designed to capture the key deterrence elements of a state's death penalty regime, and because their instruments are of dubious validity. We also discuss the appropriateness of the implicit assumption of the 2SLS studies that OLS estimates of the impact of the death penalty would be biased against a finding of deterrence.","[Donohue, John J., III] Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Wolfers, Justin] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Yale University; University of Pennsylvania,"Donohue, JJ (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Law, POB 208215, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",j.donohue@yale.edu,,,,,,,59,33,37,1,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

Focusing on the most prevalent eligibility expansion, we estimate that the adoption of a child murder factor is associated with an approximately 20% reduction in the child murder rate. Eligibility expansions may enhance deterrence by (i) paving the way for more executions and (ii) providing prosecutors with greater leverage to secure enhanced noncapital sentences. While executions themselves are rare, this latter channel may be triggered fairly regularly, providing a reasonable basis for a general deterrent response.","[Frakes, Michael] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Petrie Flom Ctr Hlth Law Policy Biotechnol & Bioe, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Harding, Matthew] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Harvard University; Stanford University,"Frakes, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Petrie Flom Ctr, 23 Everett St,3rd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mfrakes@law.harvard.edu,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

In particular, we investigate the impact of awards implemented under a number of wage setting institutions on the pay differential. These include the pay increases awarded by the Public Service Benchmarking Body in its first report and the increases given to higher-level posts in the public sector by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, Reports No. 40 and 41. The pay increases that were awarded under the Social Partnership process in Sustaining Progress and the Mid-Term Review of Part Two of Sustaining Progress are also captured in the data used. Furthermore, we assess the impact of pensions on the gap. The results indicate that the public sector pay premium increased dramatically from 9.7 to 21.6 per cent between 2003 and 2006. Furthermore, we found that by 2006 senior public service workers earned almost 8 per cent more than their private sector counterparts, while those in lower-level grades earned between 22 and 31 per cent more. The public premium results derived in this paper relating to March 2006 predate the payment of the two most recent Social Partnership wage deals, along with the pay increases awarded in the second Benchmarking exercise and by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in Reports No. 42 and 43. The results presented raise serious questions with respect to the justification for any further boosts to the pay levels of public sector workers. Finally, the study highlights the importance of correcting for differences in pension coverage between public and private sector workers when making any assessment of the public-private sector pay differential.","[Kelly, Elish; McGuinness, Seamus; O'Connell, Philip] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Kelly, E (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland.",Elish.Kelly@esri.ie,,,,,,,34,21,22,0,10,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

This paper compares the IP strategies of small entrepreneurs and large incumbents that disclose patents at 13 voluntary standard setting organizations (SSOs). These patents have a relatively high litigation rate. For small private firms, the probability of filing a lawsuit increases after disclosure to the SSO. For large public firms, the filing rate is unchanged. Although forward citations increase after disclosure for all firms, the size of this effect is the same for entrepreneurs and incumbents. These results suggest that standards increase the difference between large and small firms' incentives to litigate, rather than the relative value of their patents. We conclude that because specialized technology providers cannot seek rents in complementary markets, they defend IP more aggressively once it has been incorporated into an open platform.","[Simcoe, Timothy S.] Univ Toronto, Joseph L Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada; [Graham, Stuart J.

As an effect, residential segregation has generated an increase of social problems such as alcoholism, delinquency, young, pregnant single women and school desertion.

In a perfectly competitive and anonymous market characterized by faceless buyers and sellers, the issue of reputation would be irrelevant and unnecessary. In reality, however, markets are often filled with varying degrees of information asymmetry, which can threaten the very existence of the market system itself. In critical reaction to the standard neoclassical model, some economists, on the one hand, argue that when there is an information problem, reputation serves as a valuable source of market signal of quality. Sociologists of economic life similarly contend that reputation, along with trust, is critical in lowering transaction costs and thereby facilitating various economic activities among individual actors. The purpose of this article is to apply this broad theoretical observation to a specific empirical phenomenon. It does so by highlighting the role of social networks that connect actors on both demand and supply sides of the market. Specifically, this study examines how interpersonal networks in the market for legal services affect the duration of ties between buyers and sellers. Quantitative analysis based on a random sample of Chicago lawyers, a project funded by the American Bar Foundation, reveals that ceteris paribus the lawyer-client relations are significantly driven by social network factors.","Hanyang Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 133791, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Kim, HH (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 133791, South Korea.",harrishkim@hanyang.ac.kr,,,,,,,47,8,15,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In addition to these indicators, the openness of a country, tertiary enrollment, and income equality are found to also have a significant positive effect on Internet diffusion.","[Wunnava, Phanindra V.] Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA; [Leiter, Daniel B.] Morgan Stanley, New York, NY USA",Morgan Stanley,"Wunnava, PV (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",wunnava@middlebury.edu; Daniel.Leiter@morganstanley.com,,,,,,,18,26,28,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The analysis includes effects on prices, sales, shadow economy and employment. It starts with the assumption of no substantial effect. Survey for Croatia is done by small business owners' interviews and encompasses descriptive and inferential statistics based on parametric tests. The EU expected existence of a link between VAT reduction, price reduction, sales increase and positive effects on employment (as well as decline in the shadow economy) is proved even in this research. However the pass-through to prices is very moderate as well as other effects. The reduced VAT rate could have some positive results for the restaurants and bars only. There exists also some possibility for construction of housing and construction services related to housing as well as some other labour intensive services.","[Blazic, Helena; Dimitric, Mira] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Blazic, H (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",helena@efri.hr; dimitric@efri.hr,"Blažić, Helena/Q-3836-2018; Dimitric, Mira/R-9274-2018","Blažić, Helena/0000-0003-4602-3665; Dimitric, Mira/0000-0001-6941-5392",,,,,26,0,0,2,9,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The results identify trade-offs between MFIs outreach and sustainability depending on larger board size, and on higher proportion of unaffiliated directors. Moreover, the study shows that the more women there are on the board the better the performance, and reveals that external governance mechanisms help MFIs to achieve better financial performance. This study also allows us to distinguish other factors leading to better sustainability such as Regulation, and the use of individual lending methodology. However, the MFIs, active as NGOs, seem to be more consistent with their social mission than with their financial performance.","Sfax Univ, Sfax 3018, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax,"Bassem, BS (通讯作者)，Sfax Univ, Rd Airport Km 4,BP 1088, Sfax 3018, Tunisia.",bensoltane.bassem@laposte.net,"BASSEM, BEN SOLTANE/H-4407-2017; Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023",,,,,,44,52,55,0,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The paper reviews existing evidence on the role of entrepreneurship and small firm formation in promoting development in Sub-Saharan Africa, before setting out a model of factors that influence whether migrants contribute to entrepreneurial activity by registering a business after their return. Factors tested for their association with entrepreneurship include a range of individual characteristics, duration of stay and reasons for return, and the acquisition of financial, human and social capital while abroad. The analysis suggests that work experience abroad is the most significant predictor of entrepreneurial activity among the return migrants interviewed, although savings accumulated while abroad, reasons for return and the frequency of visits home while abroad are also significant factors.","[Black, Richard; Castaldo, Adriana] Univ Sussex, Sussex Ctr Migrat Res, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Black, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sussex Ctr Migrat Res, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",r.black@sussex.ac.uk; a.castaldo@sussex.ac.uk,,"Black, Richard/0000-0003-4276-2057",Department for International Development (UK,Department for International Development (UK,"This paper is based on data collected as part of a project funded by the Department for International Development (UK) on 'Transnational migration, return and development in West Africa.'

By reaching this goal we propose two studies: a study regarding the exchange acts, starting from the fact that the exchange acts are unbalanced and an exploratory research regarding the consumer's perception on the size of the price as a results of the exchange between the company and a category of stakeholders with double role (employees and consumers of companies products). The article proposes a new vision on determining the price of the products, by pointing out the societal costs. The research conducted specifically highlights the source of these imbalances, respectively the contradictions between the interests of the two categories of stakeholders (internal and external). The formulation of marketing policies at corporate level should be based on sorting these contradictions through a shared vision of internal stakeholders to the needs and expectations of external stakeholders including of course a positive attitude towards societal costs.","[Boboc, Stefan; Dumitru, Ionel; Stancu, Alin] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Fac Mkt, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Boboc, S (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Fac Mkt, 6 Romana Sq, Bucharest, Romania.",stefanboboc@yahoo.com; ionel.dumitru@gmail.com; alinstancu@mk.ase.ro,"Stancu, Alin/HLX-7418-2023; Stancu, Alin/C-5729-2012; Dumitru, Ionel/AFR-7489-2022","Stancu, Alin/0000-0002-8380-7445; Dumitru, Ionel/0000-0003-0152-3885",,,,,19,2,2,0,9,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

It is focused on knowledge that represents critical factor of organizations' successful development. The original concept of knowledge management can be perceived in two different ways in the Czech environment. Firstly, as knowledge management, i.e. specific managerial discipline that deals with knowledge resources or assets and that ties knowledge management with organizational global strategy. Secondly, as management of knowledge, i.e. set of approaches, methods, procedures, techniques or tools utilizable for realization of knowledge management. Management of knowledge originated in different areas such as artificial intelligence, psychology, sociology, pedagogy and other cognitive sciences. Unfortunately, this distinction of two different phenomena is often not considered by both theoreticians and practitioners. Consequently, this situation has significant implications in practical efforts to implement knowledge management into organizations. Description and explanation of differences of these two concepts belong to the conceptual perspective of knowledge management and is based on analogy and systems approach. The main utilized toot is knowledge hierarchy that consists of four basic levels - supranational level, national level, organizational level, and management of knowledge level. While supranational level and national level are general in nature, work with concepts of knowledge society and knowledge economy, and specific knowledge is not important here, organizational level and management of knowledge level are closely related to particular knowledge domain of an organization and therefore work directly either with knowledge or knowledge resources. This paper also clarifies the interdependence of these levels and emphasizes the systemic nature of knowledge managers' work.","Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informat & Managementu, Katedra Informacnich Technol, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Bures, V (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informat & Managementu, Katedra Informacnich Technol, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",vladimir.bures@uhk.cz,"Wang, Charles/B-5565-2011; Bureš, Vladimír/A-4353-2013","Wang, Charles/0000-0001-9331-8437; Bureš, Vladimír/0000-0001-7788-7445",,,,,26,23,23,0,16,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

To survive in a disorderly environment, characterized by very rapid mutations, under the circumstances of a fierce competition and of clients who continuously change their needs, their desires and requests, the 21st century organizations have to be as flexible as possible, because the reaction speed and flexibility are key factors for success. In the new era, more frequently, people and organizations have to get rid of not only the old but also of the new, in order to introduce something even newer. The speed with which something new becomes old is fantastic. Nowadays, the information technology (IT) allows organizations to become more rapid and flexible, to discover the new and include it in their practices. The purpose of this paper is to present why flexibility is so important for the organizations in a changing and uncertain competitive environment. The authors perform a literature review to identify the essential ideas regarding flexibility and what managers can do to help prepare organizations for a dynamic world.

The evaluation is in principle based on a definition of a set of properly chosen key characteristics affecting the usability of the user interface. Such criteria are then evaluated by a group of typical users of the system. These evaluations are in principle expressed as imprecise, vague linguistic expressions stating commonly known truths representing some value of quality of use. Since the crisp numbers cannot directly express vague terms or ambiguities, theory of fuzzy logic has been chosen as the most appropriate apparatus to deal with the uncertainty. The evaluations expressed in users' natural language are converted to the set of normalized evaluation words. With the help of database of commonly used words, users are not limited to use their common language. Each normalized evaluation is a member of an empirical scale and can be represented by one fuzzy number whose parameters are obtained by assigning linguistic and numeric evaluation to the evaluation. A fuzzy inference system that uses expert knowledge is used to match the best possible approximation of evaluation with the knowledge included in the fuzzy rule base. The output of inference system is obtained by using common defuzzification methods. An overall usability score represents a meaningful and authentic value - a mark of the quality of particular user interface, value that can be compared to the others. Proposed methodology was successfully implemented into software application Fuzzy Usability Evaluator that has been used for evaluating usability of Web portals in Public administration.","[Hub, Miloslav; Zatloukal, Michal] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Syst Engn & Informat, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Hub, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Syst Engn & Informat, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",miloslav.hub@upce.cz; michal.zatloukal@student.upce.cz,,,,,,,13,10,10,0,4,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Contingency theory, proposing the concept of fit between organizational characteristics and contingency factors, is used in this case. A range of potential contingency factors are examined including perceived environmental uncertainty (PEU), competitive strategy, strategic mission, industry, and size. Objective of the paper: This paper aims to investigate the certain types of MAPs that are appropriate to the specific characteristics of Thai companies. Scope and methodology: The questionnaire was delivered to 'accounting managers' of 451 companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) both manufacturing and non-manufacturing firms. There were 135 returned and usable responses, resulting in 30 percent response rate. Factor Analysis and Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA were conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings and Implications: PEU, competitive strategy, and size were found to have impact on MAPs. Firms operating in higher PEU obtain higher benefit from both contemporary and traditional MAPs. In line with expectations, firms pursuing prospector strategies perceive higher benefit from contemporary MAPs than those pursuing defender strategies. No relationship has been found between competitive strategy and traditional MAPs. Larger firms also obtain higher benefit from both contemporary and traditional MAPs than smaller firms.","[Nimtrakoon, Sirinuch; Tayles, Michael] Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Hull,,s.nimtrakoon@2005.hull.ac.uk; m.e.tayles@hull.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,0,0,1,4,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"INST TENAGA, BANGI 43600, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-942-923-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,69,97,,,,,,29,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBC87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306479500003,0

The quite a number of various problems, barriers can emerge trying to compare the distinct enterprises and aiming to adapt the highest standards of the concrete range of activity.

It also seeks to examine the moderating effect that age at international entry and the firm's entrepreneurial orientation have on this international knowledge transfer to the firm's domestic activities. Such questions are essentially unexplored in international business literature, which tends to view the international growth activities of the firm as rather separate from those of the domestic market. Two in-depth case studies of Greek internationalized firms took place. One of those firms was an incremental internationalizer and the other a 'born global' firm. The evidence suggests that firms that grow abroad may transfer knowledge and skills from international to domestic operations in terms of redefining their target markets, introducing new products and redesigning their logos irrespective of their age at international entry or their entrepreneurial orientation. Therefore, growth of the internationalized firm can significantly affect that of the domestic market, and hence a comprehensive examination of the firm's growth is warranted.","[Plakoyiannaki, Emmanuella] Aristotelian Univ Thessalonika, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Deligianni, Ioanna] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Plakoyiannaki, E (通讯作者)，Aristotelian Univ Thessalonika, Thessaloniki, Greece.",,"Deligianni, Ioanna/AGG-1895-2022",,,,,,0,2,2,0,3,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"GLENSANDA HOUSE, MONTPELLIER PARADE, CHELTENHAM GL50 1UA, GLOS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84720-830-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,37,52,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285291900005,0

The aim of the in-class experiment was to provide student with a more active way of oligopoly strategy learning. At the same time the experiment served teachers to earn some experiences from learning-by-doing method of teaching. Based on this experiment teachers suppose to introduce similar activities to the study of different decision-making models of firms. Strictly theoretical approach to the study of the oligopolistic market structure was replaced with a learning-by-doing method. Although only a short theoretical lecture preceded quantity-setting game (essential assumptions of Cournot duopoly model were explained), students were able to develop their own strategies from the very beginning of the experiment. Each group of students has understood that their decision about quantity produced was not independent but determined by the decision of the other group. Hence, they had to make assumptions about its rival's strategy and learn from each additional round of the game. At the end of the experiment students were asked to describe anonymously their opinion about new learning method. They found experiment interesting, stimulating and challenging. They have reported that they have really understood that free rider behavior might harm efficient outcome in market structures where firms can influence the main market variables but not absolutely control them. This experiment shows further possible extension of duopoly in-class game and it also justifies new approach to the study of different market structures.","[Raguseo, DomeNico] Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, Katedra Verejnej Ekon, Banskej Bystrici, Slovakia; [Horehajova, Maria] Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, Katedra Ekon, Banskej Bystrici, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Raguseo, D (通讯作者)，Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, Katedra Verejnej Ekon, Banskej Bystrici, Slovakia.",Domenico.Raguseo@umb.sk; Maria.horehajova@umb.sk,,,,,,,10,0,1,0,7,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

I worry that in their haste to incorporate Latin America into the varieties of capitalism framework, however, Schneider and Soskice: 1) overlook the Iberian roots of the region's principal economic institutions; 2) confuse symptoms like ignorance, informality, and corporate conglomeration with causes like inequality and fiscal underdevelopment; and 3) ignore not only the possibility but the likelihood of left-wing mobilization in the wake of democratization and international integration.

At least one-third of the total rent paid is land rent. Despite increases in real incomes, very-low-income tenants in the Bay Area today have less income remaining after payment of rent than tenants did in 1960. High land rent is a long-term feature of the Bay Area rental market that results mostly from its geography, the density of its urban centers, and a strong economy, rather than from regulatory barriers to new multifamily construction. Deregulation is not a sufficient response to the effects of land rent on low-income tenants. Government should subsidize non-profit housing organizations, particularly land trusts that remove residential land from the market. Taxes on land rent would be a particularly appropriate funding source.","Berkeley Rent Stabilizat Board, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA",,"Barton, SE (通讯作者)，Berkeley Rent Stabilizat Board, 2125 Milvia St, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.",sbarton@ci.berkeley.ca.us,,,,,,,27,6,12,1,36,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Moreover, article 6 of the Spanish Constitution states that the internal structure and operation of parties should be democratic. However, perhaps it should be asked to what point this normative precept is actually fulfilled. This article is dedicated to analyzing the degree of internal democracy that PSOE activists seem to enjoy. Therefore, the ability that members have to intervene and participate in all those areas in which decisions relevant to the organization are made was studied in order to find out if activists can truly participate in determining the direction and action of their party or even vary the decisions taken in the party's executive bodies.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Polit & Sociol, Dpto Ciencia Polit & Adm 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Medero, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Polit & Sociol, Dpto Ciencia Polit & Adm 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",gsmedero@cps.ucm.es,"Medero, Gema Sánchez/Z-2321-2019",,,,,,14,1,1,0,6,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

J,"Boate, C",,,,"Boate, Carol",,,Competition in Primary Healthcare in Ireland: More and Better Services for Less Money,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Understanding precisely the nature of competition in primary healthcare has an important role to play in understanding how to improve the delivery of healthcare services. This is particularly the case in Ireland, where the private sector plays such a large role in primary care. If we do not understand competition, well-intentioned regulations and policies are less likely to be effective and more likely to result in excessive costs and under-utilisation of primary healthcare. This in turn can increase Ireland's overall health expenditure and contribute to a higher cost of living in Ireland and thus lower competitiveness. This paper shows how well-designed regulations and systems for State funding of primary healthcare can ensure that competition works well and contributes to the better availability and quality of services at the lowest possible cost. The most common barriers to entry and expansion in primary healthcare markets are outlined and price-setting mechanisms examined. Examples are used to illustrate the benefits to consumers and the State where these obstacles to competition have been removed, and the difficulties where they remain. Conclusions are drawn on the implications of this analysis for the governance of regulatory bodies, for regulatory Codes of Conduct, and for achieving value for money. It is time for the culture of the healthcare professions to move towards one where it is no longer considered unprofessional to provide a competitive service.","Competit Author, Dublin, Ireland",,"Boate, C (通讯作者)，Competit Author, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,7,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

This article uses micro data to rank 74 major Chinese cities with respect to their household carbon footprint. We find that the 'greenest' cities based on this criterion are Huaian and Suqian while the 'dirtiest' cities are Daqing and Mudanjiang. Even in the dirtiest city (Daqing), a standardized household produces only one-fifth of the emissions produced in America's greenest city (San Diego). We find that the average January temperature is strongly negatively correlated with a city's household carbon footprint, which suggests that current regional economic development policies that bolster the growth of China's northeastern cities are likely to increase residential carbon emissions.

J,"Kopp, P",,,,"Kopp, Pierre",,,The unpredicted rise of motorcycles: A cost benefit analysis,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Two-wheel motor vehicle; Modal shift; Cost benefit analysis,,"This article examines the consequences, for Paris, of the increase in two-wheel motor vehicle (2WMV) traffic (measured in vehicle/km). Our study reveals that, between 2000 and 2007, the subway's (Metro) share in total inner-Paris travel increased by 13.6%, the RER's share by 10.3% and the SNCF's share by 20.5%. These three means of transport account for 58% of daily travel. On the other hand, the bus share has decreased by 16% and that of cars by 23.7%. Private motor vehicles represent 37.3% of total travel. Looking at road traffic, where public transport (buses) and private motor transport compete for the use of limited road space, private motor vehicles account for 91.5% and public transport 8.5% of total travel. The 2WMV share in Paris traffic increased by 36% between 2000 and 2007, with 2WMVs now accounting for a share twice as large as that of buses. A survey has shown that 100 million additional passenger kilometres were made by 2WMV in 2007 compared to 2000. 53% of this increase comes from people shifting to 2WMV from public transport and 26.5% from private cars. The remaining 20% is attributable to the increased use of 2WMVs by those already owning such vehicles in 2000. Is the growth in the share of 2WMV traffic in Paris beneficial to the community? This shift in the means of transport generates time savings of (sic)293 million and increases owners' vehicle usage costs by (sic)49 million. The cost of accidents is increased by (sic)49 million and the negative consequences in terms of pollution are estimated at (sic)22.6 million. The welfare impact of the government revenue change is negative and equal to (sic)4.7 million. In total, the gain for the community is therefore around (sic)168 million. Accident costs are the key issue. The fact that there are on average 21 2WMV fatalities in Paris (average 2006-2007) for a means of transport accounting for 16% of passenger/km made every day in Paris offers a striking contrast to the 6 (average 2006-2007) fatalities concerning cyclists which account for a mere 0.1% of trips. The massive shift to 2WMV has taken place without any public policy support. Public policy could easily further improve the 2WMV cost-benefit balance by taking measures that would decrease the number of accidents. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The models are characterized by their short-term (memory by delay or memory by feedback) and long-term (linear or nonlinear) memory structures. The experiments are conducted as a series of forecast cycles, with a rolling origin of a constant fit size. The models are recalibrated with each cycle, and out-of-sample forecasts are generated for a five-period forecast horizon. The results confirm that the JENN and GMNN neural network models are generally more accurate than competitors for cumulative multi-period basin water quality prediction. For example, the JENN and GMNN models reduce the cumulative five-period forecast errors by as much as 50%, relative to exponential smoothing and ARIMA models. These findings are significant in view of the increasing social and economic consequences of basin water quality management, and have the potential for extention to other scientific, medical, and business applications where multi-period predictions of nonlinear time series are critical.

This may justify a (further) reduction in the level of liability from a social standpoint, thereby arguing against seeking to approach full compensation as close as possible. In our framework, firms are liable under product liability, but also invest in care to prevent consumers' switching to competitors.

Recently, with the smoking-induced health costs and related class-action litigation against the tobacco industry, the courts have become an important forum for regulating tobacco products. The purpose of this article is to investigate theoretically the pricing behavior of a cartel (or price leader) under conditions of decreasing demand and falling costs with a formal proof and numerical simulations. In particular, this article generalizes and examines both the normal case and unusual case under these circumstances. The model thus derived can be used as a more general theoretical basis for antitrust enforcement. It applies directly to the tobacco industry in which promotional activities, rather than prices, are regulated.","[Trumbull, William N.; Cushing, Brian J.; Hwang, Ming J.] W Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,,yang@clarion.edu; William.Trumbull@mail.wvu.edu; Brian.Cushing@mail.wvu.edu; mjhwang@mail.wvu.edu,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

We use a unique data set on antitrust litigation in federal district and administrative courts during 1996-2006 to examine whether economic complexity impacts antitrust decisions and provide a novel test of the hypothesis that antitrust analysis has become too complex for generalist judges. We also examine the impact of basic economic training on judges. We find that decisions involving the evaluation of complex economic evidence are significantly more likely to be appealed, and decisions of judges trained in basic economics are significantly less likely to be appealed than are decisions by their untrained counterparts. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that some antitrust cases are too complicated for generalist judges.","[Baye, Michael R.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Wright, Joshua D.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; George Mason University,"Baye, MR (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,"Wright, Joshua/0000-0002-9835-6579",,,,,26,57,61,0,13,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Moreover, returns to scale are reflected in the cost function at its general form. The solutions obtained show the possibility to map competition without reaching a monopole. This solution has been tested with a theoretical case and several empirical cases in Germany proving its usefulness at a macroscopic scale.

Our hypothesis is that not only are there Argentinean entrepreneurs who start up business motivated by necessity, but there are others who detect opportunities in the market. As there is not a registry of firms according to the nationality of the owner, we used virtual social networks (Facebook's groups) and traditional snowball sampling to contact potential Argentinean entrepreneurs. Eventually, 214 entrepreneurs living in Spain were contacted. We made a conglomerate analysis using the following criteria: previous labour experience, sector of activity (knowledge-based or traditional ones) and motivation to start up a business (opportunity or necessity). Results show that there is heterogeneity among Argentinean entrepreneurs. We identified six groups: 1) entrepreneurs motivated by necessity; 2) intrapreneurs in Argentina who start up businesses in sectors that are not knowledge-based; 3) entrepreneurs in Argentina who start up businesses in not knowledge-based sectors; 4) inactive in Argentina who is potentially innovating; 5) intrapreneurs in Argentina who start up businesses in knowledge-based sectors and 6) entrepreneurs in Argentina, with previous business experience, who start up businesses in knowledge-based sectors. Except the first group, they are all opportunity-driven entrepreneurs. Each group was correlated with the level of education, the performance of the firm and the willingness to return to Argentina. The relationship shows that groups with firms based on knowledge are positively correlated with education and business performance but negatively correlated with the probability to return to the homeland. These conclusions have several policy implications. Providing policy makers with information about the different activities carried out by immigrants is crucial in order to implement policies for the non-EU ones that lead to a greater valuation of this kind of immigrants in society.","[Baltar, Fabiola; Brunet, Ignasi] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Gestio Empreses, Tarragona, Spain; [Gregori, Leix] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Tarragona, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Baltar, F (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Gestio Empreses, Tarragona, Spain.",fabiola.baltar@urv.cat,,"Baltar, Fabiola/0000-0002-2980-0381",,,,,39,0,0,2,11,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,112,120,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800015,0

Prior Work: Financial and internal auditors are required by their professional standards to develop and/or enhance their IT knowledge and skills. In the planning stages of their mission they have to assess how the client's characteristics affect system risk (Bedard et al., 2005) and the subsequent misstatements (Bell et al. 1998). During the mission they have to consider how IT complexity affects the nature of audit testing (Javrin et al. 2009). Methodology: An empirical survey via questionnaires was conducted on Romanian financial and internal auditors. The questionnaire covered several aspects regarding the importance given by auditors to several IT-related activities, the usage of Computer-Assisted Audit Tools & Techniques [CAATs], the perceived difficulties of auditing entities with complex Enterprise Resource Planning [ERP] systems in place, the influence of accounting information system evaluation on the audit opinion. Results: Based on the data gathered we concluded that Romanian internal and financial auditors prefer to audit around the computer rather than with or through it. Auditors indicated difficulties in auditing entities with ERP systems in place suggesting that there is a gap between the competences required for an audit in such a complex IT environment and the competences possessed by auditors. Implications: The identified knowledge gaps can help professional organizations in reshaping their training policies and also academics in further investigating other aspect regarding the impact of information systems' complexity on the audit steps or the whole mission. Originality Value: The paper is among the few works which explore, in Romania, the level of IT competences of internal and financial auditors and their ability to audit complex accounting information systems.","[Cardos, Vasile-Daniel] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,,vasile.cardos@econ.ubbcluj.ro,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,5,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,485,488,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000122,0

In this paper, we applied particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain optimized parameters setting for support vector machine (SVM) with feature selections. In addition, we also used integrated PSO with SVM approach to construct the financial crisis prediction model. We hope our proposed model will become a great analysis tool for the listed companies. In order to evaluate our proposed approach, the dataset collected from Taiwanese listed companies which are used as source data. Besides, the dataset is composed of 68 companies from 1996-2005, and has 544 records (8 seasons); which each records includes 37 financial and non-financial ratio indexes. This research is divided into three steps: (1) selecting features by principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce unnecessary features (2) applying PSO-SVM data mining techniques for training data, cross-validation and test data to obtain the classification accuracy rate (3) comparing with grid search for SVM and original SVM. Besides, comparing that whether do selecting features will influence the classification accuracy rate or not. Finally, the experimental results showed that our proposed approach was effective in finding for the better parameter settings, and improve the hit ratio on predicting company financial crisis significantly. In fact, it can be found that the average classification accuracy rates are increased when the feature selection is applied. Furthermore, the average classification accuracy rate of the approach is 100% in the training subset, and be 88.98% in the test subset. It is evident that the PSO-SVM approach is as good as the grid search for SVM and original SVM.","[Chen, Bo-Tsuen; Chen, Mu-Yen] Natl Taichung Inst Technol, Dept Informat Management, Taichung, Taiwan",,,s1899b109@ntit.edu.tw; mychen@ntit.edu.tw,"Chen, Mu-Yen/AAO-6568-2021",,,,,,14,2,2,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8640-0,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,1.0,,,,,,301,305,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173400065,0

The study draws on a survey of 420 Swedish winners, which is analyzed against the background of previous research from the USA and Europe. The analyses show that winners are cautious about realizing any dreams of becoming someone else somewhere else. This result contradicts theories suggesting that identities are being liquefied by the commercially driven consumer culture in affluent Western societies. In contrast, the article concludes that winners generally try to stay much the same, but on a somewhat higher level of consumption. The critical situation that large winnings produce is generally met by an attempt to hold on to one's identity and social relations. In addition, the article shows that lump sum winners tend to save and invest large parts of their winnings, compared with winners of monthly installments who are more likely to spend on leisure and consumption. These results indicate that wild lump sums make winners tame their winnings more firmly, whereas domesticated monthly instalments can be spent more thoughtlessly without changing identity or becoming an unfortunate winner.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Sociol, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Larsson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Sociol, Box 720, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",bengt.larsson@sociology.gu.se,,"Larsson, Bengt/0000-0001-8454-2891",,,,,44,14,15,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The exercise of entrepreneurship, through business formations and expansions, is regarded as a vehicle for job creation and output expansion. According the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) reports, South Africa's level of early stage total entrepreneurial activity (TEA) is rather low relative to other countries at a similar level of development. This is partly owing to skills and resource limitations. If more individuals could realistically be exposed to practical entrepreneurship education at the secondary school level, South Africa's base for entrepreneurial capacity can be enhanced. This study uses quasi logistic regression to examine the probability of secondary school learners, in Pietermaritzburg, the capital of Kwazulu-Natal province in South Africa, to start their own business in the future. It also probes the association between the socio-economic attributes of these learners and entrepreneurship. On the basis of a survey of 275 senior school learners from 5 schools, the regression results indicate that gender, ethnic background and having a role model as well as acquiring personal skills to run one's own business are significant factors influencing an individual's propensity to venture into small firm self-employment in the future. Black learners are perceived to have a significantly greater disposition to enter into business than other groups, and male scholars are found to have a greater probability of starting their own business than female. As potential entrepreneurs do not necessarily come exclusively from a business family background, the supply of effective entrepreneurship can be augmented, if more young individuals with the relevant skills endowment can start opportunity firms and necessity ventures.","[Mahadea, Darma] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa; [Ramroop, Shaun; Zewotir, Temesgen] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Stat & Actuarial Sci, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mahadea, D (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa.",,"Ramroop, Shaun/N-4956-2013; Zewotir, Temesgen/N-5353-2013","Ramroop, Shaun/0000-0001-9305-6967; Zewotir, Temesgen/0000-0003-1503-8055",,,,,36,7,17,1,32,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Sample one comprises 60 Chairpersons/Heads, working in different departments of private and public sector universities of Pakistan. The second sample consists of 60 teaching faculties of Pakistan which includes senior and regular teachers working for minimum period of two years in the same department from where the first sample of heads is taken. After having consent of the Vice-Chancellor/Registrar/Dean of the particular university, the heads of the departments were requested to complete the sets of questionnaires related to the head of the department. They were asked to complete, Introduction to Participants, Informed Consent Form and Personal Information form. Then they completed Multi factor Leadership Questionnaire Short Form, 6 S (MLQ-6S, Bass & Avolio, 1992), which is related to their style of managing their department. Further they were requested to nominate two regular teachers of their department to be sample two, who completed the Introduction to Participants and Informed Consent Form followed by Personal Information Forms, Costello Achievement Motivation Scale (CAMS, adapted English version by Misra & Srivastava, 1990) which measures their achievement motivation. Correlations were applied for statistical analyses of the scores. Analyses of the results indicate that our both hypotheses are not confirmed as the correlation of transformational and transactional management styles are not positively and significantly related with achievement motivation of their teaching faculties while passive/avoidant management style is positively and significantly related with achievement motivation of their teaching faculties.

Using data on EU-FP projects from the EUPRO database and from a representative survey of participants, we produce statistically significant evidence that collaboration choices in EU-FPs are primarily facilitated by prior acquaintance, thematic proximity and geographical proximity. Also, network effects are significantly related to collaboration choice. Moreover, the study shows that the impact of geographical effects increases for more intensive collaboration.

Reflections on the financial crisis. Among the characteristics of the financial system the most unfavorable is its inherent instability. As Keynes pointed out, this instability emerges from inevitable uncertainty in financial markets. Although a much more pronounced one than the crises before the financial crisis of 2007 was a consequence of this instability. In case of a crisis the government may prevent the financial system from collapsing, as could be seen in the aftermath of 2007. However, there is no chance for an ex ante avoidance of financial crises. Even stricter regulation, which makes sense in order to strengthen. the resilience of financial institutions against shocks, may only reduce but not eliminate the probability of crises. Despite its instability the financial system contributes significantly to the dynamic trend growth of the world economy. The direct costs of the 2007 crisis in terms of output losses could turn out to be relatively small on the global level. The paradigm shift in the EU regarding government debt should cause more concern. The non-bail-out-paradigm is undermined by the new European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The ESM delivers financial assistance to over-indebted member states.

This work studies how production processes and governance structures are organised by firms and how such organisational structures change during the development process. By clustering the firms in similar organisational configurations at three different points in time, the results show that it is possible to observe that firms develop along different, sometimes overlapping paths.

First, the content analysis is employed to assess the effectiveness of the EGM by searching some of the practical issues of the EGM via the newspapers, magazines and other public domain media. Second, we also conduct a document analysis on the annual reports of public listed companies to examine whether these companies complied with the selected international best practices on EGMs set by various globally recognized institutions. The research finds that the EGM can be used as an effective tool to safeguard shareholders rights in their companies. In terms of disclosure, the researchers find that some of the international attributes such as notice of meeting are well complied by a majority of all the companies while a few other practices like disclosure on directors' attendance was just ignored.","[Salin, Ahmad Saiful Azlin Puteh] Univ Teknol MARA Perak, Fac Accountancy, Accounting Res Inst, Perak, Malaysia; [Rahman, Rashidah Abdul; Omar, Normah; Hui, Wee She; Samuel, Erolyn Jane Devanesam J.] Univ Teknol MARA, Accounting Res Inst, Menara SAAS, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Salin, ASAP (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA Perak, Fac Accountancy, Accounting Res Inst, Perak, Malaysia.",ahmad577@perak.uitm.edu.my,"OMar, Normah/GPW-6307-2022; Salin, Ahmad Saiful Azlin Puteh/K-2625-2013","Salin, Ahmad Saiful Azlin Puteh/0000-0001-9652-712X",,,,,7,0,0,0,7,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8640-0,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,1.0,,,,,,246,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173400053,0

This paper fills this gap by examining how debt heterogeneity and derived debt structure are related with corporate cash holdings. We find that corporate cash holdings have a strong relationship with the structure of debt, and the direction of relationship varies depending on the type of debt. In particular, corporate cash holdings are negatively correlated with the proportion of secured debt, short-term debt, commercial paper and bank debt. On the other hand, firms show the opposite direction of cash holding behavior as they have a larger proportion of subordinated debt, longterm debt and convertible bonds.

Valid taxing conditions of traders and self-employed persons for the last three years in the Czech Republic, lead to labour market distortions. This paper gives evidence of extreme differences in tax burden of various income groups of self-employed persons compared to wage and capital yield taxation. Remarkable disparities are apparent both at lower and medium-high incomes and at peak incomes exceeding CZK 10 million per year. Presented calculations and figures confirm that particularly freelance occupations, consulting services as well as other trading professions are groundlessly favoured. Their bearers can transmit real costs on their clients and yet they are eligible to apply lump sum expenses ranging from 40 % to 60 % of income. Thus, they reduce their taxable income as well as basis of assessment for obligatory payments into insurance system in this way. Unlike them, some traders and people in position of employees cannot use such an optimization from practical reasons. This systemic distortion constitutes a groundless differentiation in a share of different citizens on financing of state expenditures. In a broader sense, it might even contradict constitutional order of the Czech Republic. At least, this situation harms significantly a willingness of citizens to take a share in solidarity system of financing state operation and its social system voluntarily. Diverse tax burden imposes a pressure on the labour market or more precisely leads to crowding-out of wage earners out of the labour market into the sphere of so called svarzsystem (evasion of labour law provisions by a conclusion of a commercial-contractual relationship). Secondary, but fundamental result is a distortion of macroeconomic statistics that provide documentary evidence for labour market development.","Tech Univ Liberec, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Ekonomie, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Sojková, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Ekonomie, Liberec, Czech Republic.",lenka.sojkova@tul.cz,"Sojková, Lenka/AAE-3524-2022","Sojková, Lenka/0000-0002-0563-3419",,,,,9,1,1,0,11,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

First, how does combining the estimates of others differ from revising one's own estimate based on the judgment of another? The experiment found that participants often ignored advice when revising an estimate but averaged estimates when combining. This was true despite receiving identical feedback about the accuracy of past judgments. Second, why do people consistently tend to overweight their own opinions at the expense of profitable advice? We compared two prominent explanations for this, differential access to reasons and egocentric beliefs, and found that neither adequately accounts for the overweighting of the self. Finally, echoing past research, we find that averaging opinions is often advantageous, but that choosing a single judge can perform well in certain predictable situations.

Such explanations run the danger of ending up with a rather static definition of culture. This paper presents a dilemma approach of innovation culture that acknowledges the complexity, dynamics and tensions between contradictory elements of culture. Six dilemmas of innovation culture are distinguished. Interaction between the ways in which regions and companies deal with these dilemmas will influence innovative performance at both levels. The approach is applied in an analysis of the region Southeast Netherlands. The findings emphasise the need to establish a dynamic balance in the different dilemmas of culture. Intermediary organisations can play an important role in bringing companies and regions together in this balancing act. Openness to outside influences (disturbing whatever balance has been reached), appears crucial to maintain innovative performance over time.","[Van Reine, Peter Prud'Homme] Innovat Culture & Change Consulting & Educ, NL-3583 CC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Dankbaar, Ben] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Van Reine, PP (通讯作者)，Innovat Culture & Change Consulting & Educ, J van Ruisdaelstraat 99, NL-3583 CC Utrecht, Netherlands.",peter.prudhomme@innovationculture.nl; B.Dankbaar@fm.ru.nl,,"Dankbaar, Ben/0000-0003-0250-3114",,,,,52,8,9,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Economic sociologists have explored the role of such experiments to demonstrate how economics - as a set of practices, ideas and technologies - enacts its worlds. This paper examines one such case of high-powered economic theory and its enactment in an emergent West African oil economy by focusing on economist Jeffrey Sachs's advisory project in Sao Tome and Principe. It pivots on the 'resource curse', an economic device that has recently gained purchase in global policy circles. This paper argues that economic devices are not simply imposed on pre-arranged worlds. Instead, they collide with and adjust to already existing politico-economic and socio-cultural conditions, resulting in complex articulations. Drawing on ethnographic material, I critique the ability of the resource curse to make sense fully of apprehensions of the past, present and future consequences of extractive industry developments. Contrasting economic accounts of an incipient curse with competing and complementary local accounts of the effects of oil wealth, I propose a new model for the sociological analysis of the variety of articulations into which an economic device, such as the curse, may enter.","Univ Exeter, Dept Sociol & Philosophy, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Weszkalnys, G (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Sociol & Philosophy, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",g.s.weszkalnys@exeter.ac.uk,,,,,,,73,64,72,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Before March 1, 2002, livers were allocated to patients based on objective clinical indicators and subjective factors. In particular, a center placing a prospective transplant recipient in the intensive care unit (ICU) leads to a higher position on the liver transplant waiting list. After March 1, 2002, a policy reform mandated that priority on the liver transplant waiting list no longer be influenced by whether the patient was in the ICU. I show that after the reform, ICU usage declined most precipitously in areas with multiple transplant centers. I find no evidence that pervasive manipulation in the most crowded liver transplant markets distorted the allocation of livers away from the intended prioritization of the sickest patients first.

We provide a simple general equilibrium model which endogenously determines these two choices. Our specific focus is on how residences and the locations of production are affected by the secular decline in trade and mobility costs that we witness. The main prediction of our analysis is that economic integration in the sense of a joint reduction of distance-related frictions eventually leads to an increased spatial concentration of production and a decreased concentration of residences. Intuitively, if distance-related costs fall, households' residence choices will be affected more strongly by the motive to avoid rising land rent, whilst the increasing strength of agglomeration economies induces a stronger concentration of production. We focus on and formalize the theory in terms of long-distance commuting.","[Borck, Rainald; Pflueger, Michael] Univ Passau, Dept Econ, D-94032 Passau, Germany; [Borck, Rainald; Pflueger, Michael] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Wrede, Matthias] Univ Marburg, Fac Business Adm & Econ, D-35032 Marburg, Germany",University of Passau; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Philipps University Marburg,"Borck, R (通讯作者)，Univ Passau, Dept Econ, Innstr 27, D-94032 Passau, Germany.",rainald.borck@uni-passau.de; michael.pflueger@uni-passau.de; wrede@wiwi.uni-marburg.de,"Borck, Rainald/M-3077-2019","Wrede, Matthias/0000-0001-8376-517X; Borck, Rainald/0000-0003-0833-020X",,,,,38,8,9,1,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The results of this study indicate that the FAST program has reduced the average border wait time at four of the five busiest crossing ports. However, the benefits associated with the FAST program are unevenly distributed among the ports, determined by the ability to accommodate infrastructure improvements, and firms, with larger trucking companies and exporters reaping the benefits and small and medium-sized trucking firms and exporters burdened by costs and often unable to capitalize on the program's benefits. Recommendations for program improvement include: greater regulatory cooperation between Canada and the US to reduce costly duplication and paperwork, and providing tax incentives or subsidies to small and medium-size firms as a means to increase the participation rate in the program.

In methodology, the study constructs a simple forecasting model that incorporates the indicator/variable using the vector error correction (VECM) model of quasi-tradable inflation index and selected indicators: commodity prices, financial indicators and economic activities. For each indicator, the forecasting horizon used is 24 months and the VECM model is applied for seven sample windows over sample periods starting with the first month of 1980 and ending with the 12th month of every 2 years from 1992 to 2004. The degree of independence of each indicator from inflation is tested by analyzing the variance decomposition of each indicator and Granger causality between each indicator and inflation. We propose that a simple model using an aggregation of indices improves the accuracy of inflation forecasts. The results support our hypothesis.

The integrity of the fishery is, however, under threat due to various land-use practices, which could weaken its appeal as a tourist attraction. The aim of this study is to estimate the amount recreational users are willing to pay for a project to improve the trout habitat of waters managed by the Wild Trout Association (WTA) in this fishery in order to improve its fish population density by 100 per cent. Data were collected from a biased sample of 96 respondents via a questionnaire during September 2006 to September 2007. The median estimated willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the project was R245 per annum per person, and the total WTP was estimated at R171 500 per annum. A valuation function to predict WTP responses was also estimated, and showed that gross annual pre-tax income and the number of visits per annum were positive determinants of WTP. The results of this study show that policy-makers should take heed of the importance trout fly fishers attach to this fishery when declaring trout zones in the upper catchments of South Africa. The aggregate WTP estimation, however, constitutes only a partial analysis of value. A number of other factors and environmental value streams need to be analysed and compared with the value estimates generated by this study if adequate holistic decision-making is to take place with regard to trout stream improvement. More specifically, the aggregate WTP estimated in this study must be viewed as only one input into a comprehensive social cost-benefit analysis to determine the desirability of trout stream improvement for wider society.","[Du Preez, M.; Lee, D.

In the model, the growth rate moves discretely between two regimes; one characterised by a stable positive average growth rate, and a collapse regime characterised by negative and volatile growth rate. The aim is to derive plausible estimates of the transition probabilities for the Markov chain component. These estimates are then included in a vector of time-varying country-specific variables for the Markov-switching estimation. The results show that the probability of an economy remaining in a stable growth regime increases with institutional quality, education, improving terms of trade and increased concentration on manufacturing industries. The analysis takes into account the fact that the dynamics of output following a large collapse differs significantly from the dynamics of output during more stable time periods by taking a non-linear approach.","Natl Univ Ireland, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",Maynooth University,"Byrne, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",,,"Byrne, Julie/0000-0002-5800-6902",,,,,43,3,3,0,4,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

An important benchmark in the anxiety literature is the inverted-U hypothesis, which states that an increase in anxiety improves performance when anxiety is low, but reduces it when anxiety is high. We show that the inverted-U hypothesis is consistent with evidence that high-powered incentives can reduce the agent's optimal effort and expected performance. In equilibrium, however, a profit-maximizing principal never offers such counterproductive incentives. We also show that the inverted-U hypothesis can explain empirical anomalies related to monitoring, the informativeness principle, and the risk-reward tradeoff.","[Rauh, Michael T.] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Dept Business Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Seccia, Giulio] Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Econ Div, Southampton S017 1BJ, Hants, England",Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Southampton,"Rauh, MT (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Dept Business Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",mtrauh@indiana.edu; giulio.seccia@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,,56,2,3,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Using a very rich administrative data set for the minimum income program of the Madrid Government (over 50,000 spells), this paper aims to broach various questions arising from the issue of welfare re-entry. We try to identify what factors determine observed differences in the durations of the first off-welfare spell. We analyze the combined effects of the length and type of exit of the first spell, unemployment, and sociodemographic characteristics. The experience of the first spell and, to a lesser extent, employability can contribute toward lengthening the time spent outside the program. Our results also show that off-welfare spells of households leaving the program in periods of low economic growth will be longer than those that do so during economic expansions. With the exception of unemployment effects, our estimates yield very similar results to those obtained in the U.S. studies, suggesting that U.S. welfare policies and analyses are not entirely irrelevant for European discussions of welfare policies.","[Ayala, Luis] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Madrid 28032, Spain; [Rodriguez, Magdalena] Inst Estudios Fiscales, Madrid 28035, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Ayala, L (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.",luis.ayala@urjc.es; magdalena.rodriguez@ief.meh.es,"Ayala, Luis/ABF-8664-2021; Ayala, Luis/AAA-2231-2019","Ayala, Luis/0000-0002-3141-827X",,,,,34,4,5,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Moreover, we discuss also the determinants of income and housing wealth and their relationship to household consumption. We merge two data sets in our paper. First, we use the household budget survey (FIBS) conducted annually by the Statistical Office of the Slovak republic. Second, we calculate the value of real estates owned by the households using the database of housing prices published by the National Bank of Slovakia. The most recent data set covers ranges from 2004 to 2009, which reflect the change of methodology of HBS in 2004. We find that disposable income of households is determined mainly on the incomes of the adult members (parents). Furthermore, individual income is influenced by individual characteristics including age, gender, family size, and education. We show that acquired human capital is a significant determinant of the income level, which differ during the life cycle. Moreover, we find that human capital acquired before 1990 is evaluated significantly less than education completed after the beginning of economic reforms. As expected, income level is a significant determinant of the housing wealth. We compare several tobit models and Heckman selection models for the estimation of housing wealth. In addition, we can see that older cohorts, who entered the labor market before 1990, are generally equipped with higher stock of real estates. This lowers the negative welfare implications of low human capital endowments on the older cohorts. We estimate the consumption function using income and housing wealth. We correct for the endogeneity of income and consumption by the application of selected instrumental variables. As expected, the housing wealth effect on consumption is found to be insignificant in Slovakia, which corresponds to restrictions on housing and financial market. Finally, we can see that income, housing wealth and consumption show large regional differences in Slovakia.","[Fidrmuc, Jarko] Comenius Univ, Oesterreich Natl Bank, CESifo Munich, OEI Regensburg, Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut,,jarko.fidrmuc@lrz.uni-muenchen.de; matus.senaj@nbs.sk,,,,,,,0,1,1,0,5,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-180-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,367,367,,,,,,1,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BGW05,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000324343700031,0

Real data sets of citizen questioners for the city of Chrudim were analysed, pre-processed, and used in the model. This model is defined as classification model and it uses algorithms used in decision trees. A decision tree is a predictive model which can be used to represent both classifiers and regression models. In operations research, a decision trees refers to a hierarchical model of decisions and their consequences. When decision tree are used as a classification tasks, it is more appropriately referred to as a classification tree. Classification trees are used to classify an object, or an instance, to a predefined set of classes based on their attribute's value. These trees are frequently used in applied fields such as: finance, marketing, engineering, and medicine. They are useful as an exploratory technique. There are various top-down decision trees inducers such as ID3, C4.5, and C&RT. In our case we used C5.0, C&RT, and CHAID algorithm for the modelling of the quality of life in the previously mentioned city. Similar results were achieved through out our research when using the mentioned algorithms. However, the best results were achieved when using the C5.0 algorithm. Finally, we summarized the presented problems, and compared its accuracy in classification on the basis of decision trees, with classification results based on the probabilistic neural network and the radial basis function neural network.","[Krupka, Jiri; Kasparova, Miloslava; Jirava, Pavel] Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Systemovaho Inzenyrstvi & Informatyki, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Krupka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Systemovaho Inzenyrstvi & Informatyki, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",Jiri.Krupka@upce.cz; Miloslava.Kasparova@upce.cz; Pavel.Jirava@upce.cz,"Jirava, Pavel/T-8388-2018","Jirava, Pavel/0000-0002-0369-4613",,,,,40,14,14,0,23,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

However, in some tropical countries, growth models for fast-growing tree species have been developed only recently. Additionally, environmental services of forests gain importance and should be integrated in forest management decisions. We determine the impact of a joint production of timber and carbon sequestration on the optimal rotation of a fast-growing species in north-western Ecuador, comparing different optimization approaches and taking the latest developments of the Kyoto Protocol into account. We find that payments for carbon sequestration have substantial impact on the rotation length: in contrast to an optimum of 15 years when focusing oil timber production only, joint production leads to a doubling of the rotation length, which means that timber harvest should be postponed until the end of the carbon project.

While the availability of market data has benefits it also creates problems, notably those relating to questions of meaning, judgement and intervention: how to make sense of these flows - how to see the 'market', its futures, and thus act pre-emptively. Over more recent years financial organizations have been turning to new technologies of representation, in particular the design and application of visualization software in an effort to enable better visual imagination of and interaction with markets as they unfold in real time. 'What you see is what you risk' in many respects captures the thinking or at least the desire underlying the employment of the latest visualization software. The more powerful one's vision the better able one is to participate in increasingly complex financial markets, at least in theory. Based on recent interviews with those involved in developing and using the latest visualization software within some of the key markets of global finance, and developing the influential work of Daniel Beunza and David Stark, and Karin Knorr Cetina, in particular, this paper adopts a cultural-economy-of-finance perspective to examine the implications of these new techniques of representation. The paper argues that the latest visual turn within finance should be afforded a more central position in the study of contemporary financial market practices.","Open Univ, Dept Geog, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",Open University - UK,"Pryke, M (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Dept Geog, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",m.d.pryke@open.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H010769/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H010769/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,61,33,35,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The technology for evaluation of regional competitiveness is based on application of three methods of multi-criteria decision making. The first one is the classical weighted average where relevance of criteria's significance is determined by the method of lvanovic deviation. The second method - FVK is a multiplicative version of AHP, the third method is the well known DEA. The results of the methods are compared with the simple averaging. On the basis of the multi-criteria techniques, we obtain a more detailed perspective in the study of the competitiveness of the NUTS3 regions in the Czech Republic and also NUTS2 regions (V4 - Visegrad Four countries) in EU within the time period of 7 years (2000 2006).

The competition seems to be intensifying due to institutional prestige, subsistence and extra income. The evaluation of doctoral schools essentially depends on what added value the degree, the Ph.D. qualification, earned at a given institute represents in a candidate's future life. Those who apply to a Ph.D. training program, driven by their definable motivation, consider the qualification to be obtained a competitive edge. When competitive edges are analyzed, regional inequalities will also be described. These are manifested in the inequality and centralized arrangement of the regional locations of doctoral schools and in the inequality of the regional distribution of disciplines. Furthermore, inequalities of areal and regional locations of research and development places - as the potential market of Ph.D. qualification - will also be studied. The studies represent three groups. The first group comprises applicants, the second group includes students taking part in the training program and the third group consists of those who have finished the training. The competition seems to be evolving on two areas. On the one hand, how significant the Ph.D. qualification is as a competitive edge in the applicants' future career from the applicants' point of view. On the other hand, the competition among doctoral schools contributes to a quality progress in the training programs and development of doctoral schools, which - as a natural process - makes the standard of Ph.D. qualification increase and function as a real competitive edge.","[Szontagh, Krisztina] Univ Pecs, Fac Econ, Doctoral Sch Reg Policy & Econ, Pecs, Hungary",University of Pecs,,k.szontagh@gmail.com; dees.szilvia@mutf.hu,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,2,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-180-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,141,148,,,,,,8,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BGW05,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000324343700010,0

Apart from generally used variables measuring (i) the total connectivity of a node and (ii) the spatial make-up of this total connectivity, we argue that a third indicator should be taken into account when describing the structure of a spatial network, namely, (iii) the degree of 'polarisation' in a node's connectivity configuration. We measure 'polarisation' by applying multiple linkage analysis, a technique that allows determining the number of meaningful connections for each node in the network. In this paper, we illustrate this approach by clustering 65 European cities based on their insertion in European air transport networks in 2005. The number of meaningful flows of a city is hereby considered alongside both traditional measures of connectivity. The results of the cluster analysis suggest that including a measure of polarisation may indeed lead to a more satisfying typology.","[van Nuffel, Nathalie; Derudder, Ben; Witlox, Frank] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"van Nuffel, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",nathalie.vannuffel@skynet.be; ben.derudder@ugent.be; frank.witlox@ugent.be,"Derudder, Ben/A-1616-2008; Witlox, Frank/A-5143-2008; Derudder, Ben/ABH-5648-2020","Witlox, Frank/0000-0002-8966-6823; Derudder, Ben/0000-0001-6195-8544",,,,,51,16,16,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

An annullable bonus is a bonus that the agent receives unless he has been monitored and found shirking. Annullable penalties and bonuses stand in contrast with normal penalties and bonuses, which are only applied if monitoring has taken place. While real-life examples of annullable penalties are rare (an example is a sanction for which the burden of proof is reversed), there is a clear and oft-discussed example of annullable bonuses: efficiency wages. Under efficiency wages all employees receive a bonus (an overpayment), except for those who have been monitored and found shirking. This paper analyzes under what conditions annullable bonuses or penalties make economic sense. On the one hand, annullable bonuses and penalties have a degree of ineffectiveness that is absent in their normal counterparts: the penalty paid by or the bonus paid to non-monitored agents does not improve their incentives. Not only does this ineffective part make the expected sanction or bonus higher than necessary but it also creates an implicit tax on low monitoring levels and hence distorts monitoring choices. On the other hand. the annullable variants may change the ex post incentives of the agents (to come up with evidence) and the principal (to monitor as promised). As a result, annullable bonuses (such as efficiency wages) can be rational choices when the principal cannot credibly commit to paying bonuses with a certain probability, and annullable penalties can make sense when the agent needs an incentive to reveal information.

Although user acceptance has been extensively studied and has long been recognized as being affected by culture, there is a paucity of research on the topic in cultural settings other than North America. This paper enriches the literature by developing a model based on 12 prominent theories of technology acceptance and innovation diffusion in the Chinese cultural context. Perceived usefulness, ease of use, compatibility, result demonstrability, and facilitating saliently determine the behavioral intention of Chinese users to use information technology innovations. In addition, such relationships are mediated by attitudes toward behavior. The paper further contributes by providing a theoretical explanation through a lens of cultural clusters and dimensions theory. The findings are discussed with respect to cultural differences in power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and long-term orientation between the United States (U.S.) and China, which would influence users' acceptance of information technology innovations.","Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business & Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Dong, JQ (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business & Management, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",dongqi@ust.hk,,,,,,,50,21,23,6,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Avoidance reduces the probability or magnitude of punishment. In general, offenders can reduce their expected punishment either by substituting legal activities for criminal activities (the deterrence effect) or by increasing avoidance activities. This paper shows that increasing the direct costs of crime - by either increasing punishment or enforcement efforts - does not necessarily deter criminal activity and may actually trigger increased crime if avoidance is possible. Furthermore. this paper shows that increasing the opportunity costs of crime (e.g. by subsidizing legal alternatives or through educational and vocational programs) reduces both crime and avoidance and thus, in this respect, is advantageous. The conditions for these outcomes are identified, the economic mechanisms are explained, and an underlying intuitive approach for these results is proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Since the study's objective is to build solid theory on these new phenomena, descriptive analysis on the empirical results is provided.

Our localization index is based on plant (establishment) counts and more closely reflects the firm externalities of Marshallian industrial districts, in contrast with broader measures of localization that include an establishment's internal economies, such as Holmes and Steven's (2002, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 84: 682-690) analysis based on employment location quotients.

The article attempts to ground the logic of financialization by examining how it emerged at, and was shaped by one particular company. I employ economic geographers' conceptions of place-based corporate culture, and societal, territorial and network embeddedness (Hess, 2004, Progress in Human Geography, 28: 165-186) to explain how financialization and corporate dislocation can enable each other.

The second one is a model for a ship-based sharing method. In this model, yard trailers can only be shared by quay cranes of the same ship. Q-learning algorithm is designed to solve the model.

Indeed, a low false-acquittals rule, such as the Microsoft rule, may be equally effective as a low false-convictions rule, such as the exceptional circumstances rule, in reducing the costs of decision errors. However, it is also shown that the latter rule may well be welfare superior to the former rule because of its welfare-improving deterrence effects. Further, it is shown that when the presumption of legality is strong, both of these rules are likely to be welfare-inferior to per se legality (the standard chosen in Xerox), even though the exceptional circumstances test may be superior in decision error terms.","Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Katsoulacos, YS (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece.",ysk@hol.gr,"Katsoulacos, Yannis/AAA-1213-2021",,,,,,52,3,3,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Recently, some international evidence has emerged which shows that, by augmenting the price-earnings metric with information about consumer price inflation, further enhancements can be achieved in tactical asset allocation. This study reviews these arguments as they apply to South Africa, and finds that an inflation-augmented price-earnings ratio is more successful in forecasting equity returns than is the simple price-earnings ratio. Moreover, the metric is found to be significant in explaining relative asset class returns. On a risk-adjusted basis, however, the tool fails to improve the portfolio results when compared to a buy-and-hold strategy.

In this paper, we propose to forecast exchange rates with a large Bayesian VAR (BVAR), using a panel of 33 exchange rates vis-a-vis the US Dollar. Since exchange rates tend to co-move, a large set of them can contain useful information for forecasting. In addition, we adopt a driftless random walk prior, so that cross-dynamics matter for forecasting only if there is strong evidence of them in the data. We produce forecasts for all 33 exchange rates in the panel, and show that our model produces systematically better forecasts than a random walk for most of the countries, and at all forecast horizons, including 1-step-ahead.

J,"Sidak, JG",,,,"Sidak, J. Gregory",,,PATENT HOLDUP AND OLIGOPSONISTIC COLLUSION IN STANDARD-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ANTITRUST; BEHAVIOR; POWER; INCENTIVES,"Current controversies over patent policy place standard-setting organizations (SSOs) on a collision course with antitrust law. Recent theoretical research conjectures that, in an SSO, patent owners can hold up patent users in the sense of demanding high royalties for a patented input after the SSO has adopted the patented technology as an industry standard and manufacturers within the SSO have incurred sunk costs to design end products that incorporate that standard. Consistent with this conjecture, actual SSOs have recently sought no-action letters from the Antitrust Division for a variety of amendments to SSO rules that would require or request, at the time a standard is under consideration, the ex ante disclosure by the patent owner of the maximum royalty that the patent owner would charge under the regime of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory licensing. This price information-which is characterized as the cost of the patented input-would, under at least one recent SSO rule modification, be a permissible topic for potential users of the patent to discuss when deciding whether to select it in lieu of some alternative standard. This exchange of information among horizontal competitors would occur ostensibly because the cost of the patented technology had been characterized as simply one more technical attribute of the standard to be set, albeit an important technical attribute. The Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission have jointly stated that such discussion, by prospective buyers who are competitors in the downstream market, of the price of a patented invention that might become part of an industry standard should be subject to antitrust scrutiny under the rule of reason rather than the rule of per se illegality. The rationale that the antitrust agencies offer for applying the rule of reason to such conduct is that such horizontal collaboration might avert patent holdup. The Antitrust Modernization Commission (AMC) similarly endorsed the view that rule-of-reason analysis is appropriate for ex ante discussion of royalty terms by competing buyers of patented technology. This rule-of-reason approach, however, is problematic because it conflicts with both the body of economic research on bidder collusion and with the antitrust jurisprudence on information exchange and facilitation of collusion. Put differently, because of their concern over the possibility of patent holdup, the U. S. antitrust agencies and the AMC in effect have indicated that they may be willing in at least some circumstances to forgo enforcement actions against practices that facilitate oligopsonistic collusion by encouraging the ex ante exchange of information among competitors concerning the price to be paid for a patented input as an implicit condition of those competitors' endorsement of that particular patented technology for adoption in the industry standard. However, neither the proponents of these SSO policies nor the antitrust agencies and the AMC have offered any theoretical or empirical foundation for their implicit assumption that the expected social cost of patent holdup exceeds the expected social cost of oligopsonistic collusion. This conclusion does not change even if one conjectures that such collusion will benefit consumers by enabling licensees to pass through royalty reductions in their pricing of the downstream product incorporating the patented technology. Proper economic evaluation of the plausibility of the pass-through conjecture will require information about the calculation of royalty payments; the demand and supply easticities facing the licensees; and the structure of any industries further downstream between the manufacturer and the final consumer. Consequently, the magnitude of this effect will likely be a matter of empirical dispute in every case. Moreover, such a justification for tolerating horizontal price fixing finds no support in antitrust jurisprudence. Given the analytical and factual uncertainty over whether patent holdup is a serious problem, it is foreseeable that antitrust questions of first impression will arise and affect a wide range of high-technology industries that rely on SSOs. However, there is no indication that scholars and policy makers have seriously considered whether oligopsonistic collusion in SSOs is a larger problem than patent holdup.","Criter Econ LLC, Washington, DC 20009 USA",,"Sidak, JG (通讯作者)，Criter Econ LLC, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",jgsidak@criterioneconomics.com,,,,,,,109,32,34,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

It is argued that consumer confidence is an early indicator of future rates of growth in an economy through the consumption channel. Therefore, an increase in consumer confidence should translate into higher rates of consumption in the future, leading to a possible rise in economic growth. Our panel data analysis, conducting panel unit root tests and panel cointegration tests, tries to measure the effects of changes in consumer sentiment on personal consumption expenditures while accounting for other significant economic and financial variables such as stock exchange index, real exchange rates and interest rates. The empirical findings show the existence of a long-run relationship. Thus, consumers are able to detect early signals about future rates of economic growth as they contribute through the consumption channel.","[Celik, Sadullah; Ozerkek, Yasemin] Marmara Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey",Marmara University,"Çelik, S (通讯作者)，Marmara Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey.",scelik@marmara.edu.tr; yasemin.ozerkek@marmara.edu.tr,"Özerkek, Yasemin/AAH-6491-2019; Çelik, Sadullah/B-2435-2018","Özerkek, Yasemin/0000-0002-8816-109X; Çelik, Sadullah/0000-0003-4124-3589",,,,,48,17,19,0,12,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In the Netherlands, however, the focus of the integration debate has recently shifted to an affirmation of sovereignty. Three cases in which ethnic minorities in the Netherlands were exposed to (possible) action from their homelands (Turkey and Morocco) elicited political discussion in which dual citizenship and transnational political influence were rejected. We conclude that a changed policy of homeland governments (diaspora engagement) is not the most likely explanation of the public excitement. The new sovereignty discourse fits into a neo-nationalist trend but may also be explained as a way to contain the unpredictable effects of the sustained multiculturalism underlying Dutch policy toward migrant communities.","[Dijkink, Gertjan; van der Welle, Inge] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Dijkink, G (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",g.j.w.dijkink@uva.nl; i.c.vanderwelle@uva.nl,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The objective is to provide an understanding on audit market share of these companies among audit firms of different sizes. Studies in this area show that more than 60% of audit service market of public listed companies (PLCs) in Malaysia belongs to big audit firms. Big audit firms develop audit industry specialisation and brand name through the audit market dominance. Studies show that audit industry specialisation and brand name have a positive impact on the cost and product quality. It is expected that a similar economic impact also exists in audit practices of private limited companies. However, no studies have addressed the issue of SME audit market distribution among audit firms. This study attempts to examine the distribution of SME audit market among Big 4 and non-Big 4 audit firms. The objective is to see whether the development of audit industry specialisation occurs in audit services of non-listed companies. Also, this study hopes to gain an insight into the potential impact of the exemption of mandatory audit among private limited companies. The sample consists of 1,350 companies from all industries registered with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (CCM) with paid up capital between RM10,000 to RM25 million. Results show that Big 4 audit firms obtain about 53% of the SMEs audit market share. The remaining 47% is shared among the second tier and small audit firms. This phenomenon exists in all large industries. There is an indication that industry specialization may also exist among auditors of private limited companies which is expected to benefit these companies. Results also suggest that if mandatory audit among private limited companies is exempted, the economic impact may not only be felt by smaller audit firms but also by the Big 4.","[Iskandar, Takiah Mohd; Bin Rahmat, Mohd Mohid] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sch Accounting, Fac Econ & Business, Bangi, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,,takiah@ukm.my; mohead@ukm.my,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,5,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"INST TENAGA, BANGI 43600, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-942-923-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,696,715,,,,,,20,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBC87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306479500034,0

As hypothesised, significant differences between the Danish and Lithuanian samples were found in the levels of organisational empowerment and job satisfaction. The levels of organisational empowerment and job satisfaction were higher in Denmark, a country with lower power distance and uncertainty avoidance. No significant differences were found in the levels of psychological empowerment and affective commitment between the samples. Research findings showed a statistically significant positive relationship between organisational empowerment and all three measured attitudes in both samples.

Drawing upon empirical research conducted from 1999 to 2002 and from 2006 to 2007, it will illustrate how Chinese migrants practise transnationalism and transculturality in their entrepreneurial activities. Instead of serving simply as a bridge between their two home economies, migrants engaged in the tourism sector are active and innovative agents in crossing and redrawing the borders of different geo-cultural spheres they are embedded in, producing modified tourism landscapes that suit the desire of their compatriot travellers. An examination of the spatiality of their business networks also suggests that transnationalism and diaspora studies should go beyond focusing only on ties between the sending and receiving societies. Furthermore, an analysis of the interactions among members of this business community from different places will exemplify the power of borders in the Chinese diaspora.","Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Leung, MWH (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",mwhleung@hku.hk,"Leung, Maggi Wai Han/D-4889-2009",,,,,,50,4,4,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

More importantly, interaction between these strategic variables has a greater significant impact upon internationalization by SMTEs than the individual strategic variables.

We compare the intergenerational wage and earnings elasticities of adopted children with these of non-adopted children. Because adopted children's genetic ability does not depend on that of their adoptive parents, the differences between these two samples reveal the importance of genetic ability in transmitting earnings ability across generations. We find that the earnings correlation between fathers and children would be halved if their biological link was removed. Our results suggest that inheritable ability plays a very important role in passing parents' earnings ability on to their children.","[Liu, Haoming; Zeng, Jinli] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Liu, H (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",ecsliuhm@nus.edu.sg; ecszj1@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,27,20,21,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Yet, large numbers of indigenous Dutch find it hard to acknowledge this fact. Likewise, the reception of newcomers has been rather awkward and sometimes in contradiction with the widely celebrated image of the Netherlands as the heartland of tolerance and multiculturalism. Also, many complaints can be heard about the supposedly 'tardy' progress of immigrants' incorporation.

Especially rating of a distinguished rating agency, such as Moody's, is of significant information value. Moody's index provides rating evaluation of the debts of companies, cities, or countries. Many empirical studies have researched the effect of rating changes on the change in value of listed companies. Many of them proved that especially the downgrade of rating results in a substantial value drop of given companies at the time of announcement but also in the following days. On the other hand, improvement of rating usually results in only a milder effect on increase in value. The aim of this thesis is to analyze the effect of rating downgrade on value drop in two groups of companies listed on a stock exchange. The first one is a group of 30 randomly selected German companies over a period of 10 years. The other one is a group of 19 Czech and Slovak companies over the same time period. The basis for the analysis is formed by the so called spreads calculated in relation to the reference market model and by the additional cumulated spreads derived from them. The research has shown a different effect of rating downgrade on value drop in individual groups. In the German companies a significant company value drop has been confirmed in the case of rating downgrade at the time of the announcement. On the other hand, values of the Czech and Slovak companies decreased significantly less. By analyzing cumulated spreads we have found out that the value drop in the group of the German companies occurred several days before the announcement and also at the time of the announcement. In the following days the prices oscillated within a narrow zone. Value drop in the group of the Czech and Slovak companies started later, but it lasted longer after the announcement of rating downgrade. Logical explanation of this phenomenon would be the fact that the Czech and Slovak capital markets are not yet sufficiently developed and the participants respond to this fact with time delay. It is the decreasing trend of cumulative earnings in the Czech and Slovak companies several days before, but especially after the announcement of rating downgrade, that could be used in active portfolio management.","[Uzik, Martin] Berg Univ Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany; [Soltes, Vincent] Tech Univ & Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Financil, Kosice, Slovakia",University of Wuppertal; Technical University Kosice,"Uzik, M (通讯作者)，Berg Univ Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany.",uzik@wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de; vincent.soltes@tuke.sk,"Šoltés, Vincent/AAA-2329-2020; Uzik, Martin/Q-2851-2016",,,,,,13,33,33,0,9,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The study showed that there exists a reverse mechanism to the farmer, village and agriculture in China's public finance. The government obtains more wealth from the comparatively impoverished farmers than the public product benefit it provides. The average reversion degree of the general budget during this decade is 40%. During this ten years period, through the general budget only, the wealth net that the government exacted from the farmer reached upwards of 2,339,727 million Yuan; 4,347,711 million Yuan, if adds on the land revenue in the fund budget. The existence of reverse fiscal mechanism is the implicit reason of enlarging the gap between the city and town and the persisting fiscal difficulties of the counties, townships and villages in China. Without changing this mechanism, there would be growing disparities in the public product benefit enjoyed by the urban and rural residents; the income gap would not disappear and it would be difficult for the measures taken to conquer the fiscal difficulties of the counties and villages to be effective. The existence of reverse fiscal mechanism is also the peculiar and secret phenomena of China's public finance. Revealing the existence and operating law of this special phenomenon has significant meaning in establishing the macro-financial policies correctly.","[Yang, Bin] Xiamen Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,,binyang@xmu.edu.cn,,,,,,,40,0,0,1,5,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-072-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,295,314,,,,,,20,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQE61,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280792600067,0

The exogenous shift in the cost of religious participation is a result of the repeal of so-called blue laws that restrict retail activity on Sundays. We find that repealing blue laws causes a significant decline in the religious participation of women and in their happiness. For men, we do not observe any effect on happiness, while the estimate of the effect on church attendance is similar in magnitude to that for women but is imprecise. We also use repeal as an instrumental variable for church attendance and provide direct evidence that church attendance has a significant positive effect on happiness.","[Cohen-Zada, Danny] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Sander, William] Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",Ben Gurion University; DePaul University,"Cohen-Zada, D (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",,,"Cohen-Zada, Danny/0000-0003-2336-1629",,,,,37,23,28,0,24,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

The estimates show that the permanent restriction had no impact on the use of private cars while the additional restriction curtailed their use by 5.5%. Also, on pre-emergency days the flow of passengers to the Metro increased by about 3% while the bus network showed no statistically significant increase.

The charging scheme was run in the form of a full-scale trial for seven months, after which it was deactivated, awaiting its evaluation and an advisory public referendum. Several parties, including representatives of the scientific community as well as media and special interest groups, have analysed and evaluated the system. A recurring theme in several of these analyses is that the cost to build and operate the system was excessive, compared to costs for other road charging installations. This study revisits some of the key project participants and archive data, to provide a deeper understanding of what were the major cost drivers and whether lower cost can be achieved in future installations. The approach taken is to emphasise understanding of the particular circumstances rather than comparing aggregates with other seemingly similar systems. The main conclusions include the identification of a rational actor paying an insurance against unacceptable risk, the importance of the election cycle, and the interplay between risk, acceptance, performance, and cost.

Doing this on a real time, out-of-sample basis is a bigger challenge than many academics might assume, due to factors such as data revisions and changes in economic relationships over time. The paper stresses the value of both simulated real-time analysis - looking at what the inference of a proposed model would have been using data as they were actually released at the time - and actual real-time analysis, in which a researcher stakes his or her reputation on publicly using the model to generate out-of-sample, real-time predictions. The immediate publication capabilities of the internet make the latter a realistic option for researchers today, and many are taking advantage of it. The paper reviews a number of approaches to dating business cycle turning points and emphasizes the fundamental trade-off between parsimony - trying to keep the model as simple and robust as possible - and making full use of the available information. Different approaches have different advantages, and the paper concludes that there may be gains from combining the best features of several different approaches.

If the relationship between the professional and clients is seen according to the principal-agent model, contingency fees can be economically justified. The case is quite different, however, if the situation is seen as one of authority under bounded rationality and unforeseen/asymmetrically gathered events. A game theoretical thought experiment aimed at checking the case for or against using agency models is carried out. It shows that (i) in the case of a self-interested professional, notwithstanding that overall utilitarian efficiency may be safeguarded, contingent fees leads to not respecting the fiduciary obligations (to detriment of Pareto optimality, impartial and loyal treatment of all clients, and the obligation to promote all the clients' welfare). (ii) In the case of the professional's willingness to comply with deontology standards-requiring impartial protection of all the clients' rights and welfare, under a condition of minimal individual rationality-contingent fees lead nevertheless to making useless deontological motivations and to a loss of efficiency in utilitarian sense. A Pareto optimal, impartial, as well as efficient, arrangement aimed at maximizing the total volume of damage compensation is then considered. Nevertheless the main result is that, even if motivations to conform to such principles were available, under a contingent fee contract the professional could not carry out them because of the logic of the incentive contract. Thus, notwithstanding its widespread acceptance in the law and economics literature, agency theory seems not suitable in general for designing efficient and fair contracts and economic institutions.","[Sacconi, Lorenzo] Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy; [Sacconi, Lorenzo] EconomEtica, Milan, Italy",University of Trento,"Sacconi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy.",lorenzo.sacconi@unitn.it,,"Sacconi, Lorenzo/0000-0003-1316-447X",,,,,48,2,3,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Recognising that transport uses a significant portion of global energy, the shortage of fossil fuel in post peak oil era will pose a global challenge in the transport sector. The paper presents an assessment of international research to illustrate the possible time frame of peak oil. It investigates the key implications of the oil shortage that threaten to render the urban transport system of Australia ineffective. Synthesis of documented research evidence suggests three major implications in the urban transport sector: (1) a reduction of mobility for individuals, (2) an increase of transport disadvantage, and (3) a disruption of urban freight movement. In addition, the paper explores strategies to cope with the devastating effects of the shortage of the fossil fuel in the post peak oil era. A number of strategies to achieve sustainable mobility in the future urban transport system are presented. These strategies are summarised into three main themes: (1) a mode shift to alternate transport modes, (2) an integration of land use and transport planning, and (3) a global technical effort for alternate fuels and vehicles. It is expected that a concerted global effort in this regard can have a far-reaching effect in achieving sustainability in urban transport mobility. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The empirical results reveal that psychological (rational and habitual) factors have stronger influences on mode choice behaviors than socio-economic factors, and furthermore that habitual factors explain traveler mode choice behaviors better than rational ones. The contextual effect with regard to public transport development is found to be significant for motorcyclists' mode choice behaviors.

It considers ten significant transactions in the energy sector: the eight largest energy transactions assessed by the European Commission since 2004, as well as two major gas-electricity mergers in Spain over roughly the same period. Merger decisions in the energy sector have been characterized by a significant concern for potential horizontal unilateral effects, even in situations where the merging parties accounted for a limited combined share of the market, or where one of the parties was only a small competitor. A variety of non-horizontal concerns have also been considered by the competition authorities, including effects flowing from the increasing use of gas for electricity generation or from limited ownership unbundling of network assets. Remedy packages have typically included extensive structural divestments to remove competition concerns. Given the nature of competition in energy markets, particularly effective remedies are those that involve the sale of price-setting generation plants, network assets, and controlling stakes in merging parties' competitors.","[Federico, Giulio] IESE Business Sch, Publ Private Sect Res Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Federico, Giulio] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain",University of Navarra; IESE Business School,"Federico, G (通讯作者)，IESE Business Sch, Publ Private Sect Res Ctr, Barcelona, Spain.",gfederico@iese.edu,,,,,,,16,3,5,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

We compare the sustainability of tacit collusion when uniform prices are used, when loyal customers are rewarded without using commitment, and when loyalty rewards are implemented by committing to offering customers either lower fixed repeat-purchase prices or fixed repeat-purchase discounts. We find that, relative to uniform prices, rewarding loyalty without using commitment on the equilibrium path makes tacit collusion easier to sustain, because a deviating firm is unable to steal one period of industry profit before losing all future profits. When loyalty rewards are offered by firms committing to repeat-purchase prices, collusion is even easier to sustain, because a deviating firm cannot renege on its discounted price for repeat-purchase customers. When firms commit to repeat-purchase discounts, they also commit to lowering the price for their repeat-purchase customers if they undercut the regular price, rendering tacit collusion to be even more readily sustainable.

When analysing the relation between poverty and transport, concern often centres on the affordability of public transport. In this paper we present two alternative definitions of affordability used in the transport literature and discuss their limitations. Any affordability measure covering only transport expenditure is bound to be a very partial view of household welfare. In addition, the required affordability benchmark to determine whether or not transport costs are high is arbitrary. Therefore, the approach that uses the absolute level of these affordability measures is meaningless. We also show in this paper that the change in the affordability measures, as opposed to its absolute level, can be given a more rigorous interpretation in terms of traditional welfare economics. In spite of this last result, we argue that to analyse whether transport subsidies are meeting their social or distributional objectives it may be more fruitful to use traditional income distributional tools such as the relative benefit curve and its associated Gini coefficient.","Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago 1501, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Gómez-Lobo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago 1501, Chile.",agomezlo@econ.uchile.cl,,,,,,,39,15,16,0,13,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Currently, the approach road (NJ 495) to the Lincoln Tunnel has six lanes, with three in each direction. During the weekday morning peak period, The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) operates a 2.5 miles exclusive bus lane (XBL) for traffic bound for Manhattan. The PANYNJ is considering creating, from existing lanes, a second XBL with the option for passenger vehicles to use it in return for an additional toll, in effect turning it into a high occupancy toll (HOT) lane. Such an approach to increase capacity and reduce congestion is unique nationally and this study looks at drivers' choices between using standard lanes, paying extra to drive on a HOT lane (the new XBL lane), switch to earlier or later departure times, or change their mode of travel. The analysis shows significant differences in the valuation of travel time savings between different population groups and also different departure time periods. The models also reveal a reluctance to change to other crossings, accept changes in departure time or switch to alternative modes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

According to the Court of Justice of the European Union in United Brands, a price is abusive if (1) the price-cost margin is excessive and (2) the price is unfair compared with other prices. However, there is little guidance to determine whether a price-cost margin is excessive and, if so, when the price is unfair. We consider whether the principle of dual entitlement, which is consistent with most people's perceptions of when prices are unfair relative to others, can be used to define explicitly what constitutes an unfair price in terms of the second stage of the United Brands test. We show that in general, this principle is in line with the goals of an effective prohibition on unfairly high pricing, and we develop a procedure that defines a price as unfair in terms of this principle. We also show that European competition law enforcers, in their attempts to define prices as unfair relative to other prices, have followed arguments similar to the procedure developed here. Therefore, this procedure could go some way to resolve one of a number of problems regarding the prohibition on unfairly high pricing.","[Akman, Pinar] Univ E Anglia, UEA Law Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Akman, Pinar] Univ E Anglia, Econ & Social Res Council ESRC Ctr Competit Polic, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Garrod, Luke] Univ E Anglia, ESRC Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of East Anglia; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of East Anglia,"Akman, P (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, UEA Law Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",p.akman@uea.ac.uk; l.garrod@uea.ac.uk,,"Akman, Pinar/0000-0001-5796-8598",ESRC [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,26,13,15,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Online games, as IT-based and creative service products, are important in the development trajectory of Korea, in that Korea created a new global leadership for the online games industry breaking the traditional catch-up innovation pattern. Two research hypotheses are examined and accepted based on questionnaire surveys and in-depth interviews. First, a quantitative analysis as to the hours of online game playing for 250 games over the last 19 months demonstrates that a few games dominate the online game market in Korea, which implies network externalities in the online games industry. Second, from the perspective of evolution, the innovation focus of online games changes from technology-oriented, through market-oriented, and finally to design-oriented soft innovation. This paper introduces network externalities as the reasons why design-oriented (non-technological) soft innovation has become significant in online games over time. The results of this study suggest managerial and policy implications. Online games companies are recommended to expand the research and development (R&D) capabilities of non-technological and soft innovation in combination with those of technological innovation to improve strategic competitiveness. From the point of innovation policies, the redefinition of R&D scopes is required as a pre-requisite step for diversifying the government R&D support into the areas of non-technological and soft innovation capabilities. The government effort to grow human resources with a high level of creative capabilities relevant to soft innovation also needs to be made.","Sci & Technol Policy Inst, Serv Innovat Team, Seoul, South Korea","Science & Technology Policy Institute (STEPI), Republic of Korea","Choi, J (通讯作者)，Sci & Technol Policy Inst, Serv Innovat Team, Seoul, South Korea.",choijs@stepi.re.kr,,,,,,,34,7,7,3,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Many firms in these industries have achieved a dominant market position, thereby attracting the attention of competition authorities, often resulting in major monopolization cases. Unfortunately, this attention has not resulted in improved market outcomes. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of Section 2 Sherman Act cases brought against IBM, AT&T, and Microsoft. We conclude that these cases had limited effect on consumer welfare because they did not stimulate entry or innovation. In these industries, competition authorities cannot expect to promote simply an expansion of output and lower commodity prices; rather they should focus their remedies on promoting innovation-new products that replace or compete with the dominant firm's products.","[Jackson, Charles L.] George Washington Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Crandall, Robert W.] Brookings Inst, Dept Econ Studies, Washington, DC 20036 USA",George Washington University; Brookings Institution,"Jackson, CL (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",clj@jacksons.net,,,,,,,22,7,10,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The objective of this article is to understand the practices of leadership and organizational learning that occur during the elaboration and implementation of such plans. Qualitative methodology of the descriptive and inductive type, based on the hermeneutic method, was used. Six elementary schools and one combined elementary and middle school belonging to a rural commune participated in this study. The design is longitudinal using semi-structured, active interviews with individuals and focus groups. Results recognized four types of leadership that emerge during the process of elaborating and implementing the plans: strategic, tactical, spontaneous and pragmatic.

In particular, the tourism industry and supporting industries have demonstrated impressive growth in business performance over the past decade. Cultivating the endowments of nature, people and physical infrastructure have been the driving forces and determinants for national competitive advantage. Since natural resources have long been over-exploited in Thailand, whilst new competition from neighbouring countries with fresh and unexploited environments have become formidable threats to the industry and Thai competitiveness. Furthermore, innovation approaches, conventionally focusing on the tangible resources: advanced technology, IT control, process improvement and physical environments, have become less competitive and make it difficult for customers to be able to distinguish new value propositions. Consequently, Thailand is striving to find a unique and competitive market position under intensified competition. The purpose of this study is to examine and conceptualize the driving factors for new business value creation approach through Thai Government Initiatives in tourism, hospitality and related industries. This paper investigates specific examples in southern Thailand where the legends and ancient wisdom have become rooted over decades and constitute significant constructive and creative cultural capital. The paper elaborates various areas of study, from expert opinions (16), literature review, field observations and personal participation in developing the working process (8 cases as pilot service providers). Characteristics of these determinants include (1) knowledge based service (2) creativity (3) market demand creation and these contribute to (4) new business value propositions. The findings show that the contents of 780 years of locally-produced ritual ceremony and legend, ways of life for people living on the river, ancient remedies, cultural identity and indigenous wisdom which all create strong and appealing stories to tell for the prospective market.From local dyed fabric, folk ritual events, typical types of accommodation and so forth become value added services and enhance their new service proposition and authenticity. This draws up the notion that intangible resources or cultural capital become a driving force behind innovation. Hence, it creates a new business model for small and medium enterprises with highly added economic value to their own enterprises and national competitiveness. The result of the study provides an insightful framework for government as catalyst and policy maker and industry as the ultimate beneficiary to fine tune their cooperative effort and to develop participative competitive strategies for a long term sustainable industry.","[Apivantanaporn, Thanan; Walsh, John] Shinawatra Univ, Bangkok, Thailand",Metharath University,,thanan.ted@gmail.com; jcwalsh@siu.ac.th,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,24,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8640-0,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,1.0,,,,,,220,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173400047,0

This paper examines the possibility to change the classical acrylic fibre finishing technology to make it more environmental friendly by recycling the wastewater from the dyeing process in preparation stages, after removing the colour through sorption. Primarily, we have tested the colour removal capacity of the sorbent. For that purpose, synthetic wastewater of known chemical composition has been decolorized using as sorbent an acrylic weak base anion exchange resin with ethylenediamine functional groups, selected from several anion exchange resins. The colour removal degree, expressed in percentage, was calculated from the relative decrease of absorbance. It was found that colour removal is efficient only for one of the studied dyes, but the other basic dye proved to be discoloured efficiently using an oxidative method. Afterwards, bleached acrylic plain knit fabric was dyed with the two dyes, and the wastewater has been treated and recycled in scouring processes, as it is or mixed with fresh water (1 :1). The colour parameters, the colour difference and the degree of whiteness of the acrylic samples scoured with recycled water were measured. The results of the study prove that the recycling in new preparation stages of the in-plant decolorized wastewater from acrylic dyeing is feasible only for some basic dyes, especially for low concentration dyeing, and has the potential to not only decrease wastewater volume and treatment cost, but also minimize water use as well as the discharge of textile pollutants such as salt and dyes. For high dye concentrations, mixing of discoloured wastewater with freshwater is recommended.","[Bertea, A-F.; Butnariu, A.; Bertea, A-P.] Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Iasi, Iasi, Romania",GH Asachi Technical University,,afbertea@tex.tuiasi.ro; anca_butnariu2001@yahoo.com; apbertea@tex.tuiasi.ro,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,4,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,21,24,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000006,0

Extending Fisher's narrative paradigm, we reconceptualise discovery as a dynamic, convergent process based on the coherence-seeking and narrative fidelity. Data from scientists and entrepreneurs grounds the analysis, while gedanken experiments facilitate interpretation and the development of a grounded theory of discovery that incorporates communication. We discuss implications for entrepreneurship research and present normative theory for discovery communication.","[Bock, Adam] Univ Edinburgh, Business Sch, 29 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh, Midlothian EH8 9JS, Scotland; [Kandasamy, Gajendran] Imperial Coll London, Business Sch, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of Edinburgh; Imperial College London,"Bock, A (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Business Sch, 29 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh, Midlothian EH8 9JS, Scotland.",Adam.J.Bock@ed.ac.uk; gaj@ic.ac.uk,"Bock, Adam J/A-8284-2010",,,,,,34,0,0,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,1059,1063,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800125,0

An Inter-Regional Model of Entrepreneurial School for Women (AntrES), implemented in six counties situated on the Western border of Romania (Bihor, Timis, Arad, Maramures, Caras-Severin, Satu-Mare). The study conducted between July 2010 and March 2011 followed the intentions of a number of 979 women from rural areas of Western Romania to start their own business. Tradition, stereotypes and religion have a major influence. But the Romanian women are very lucid. The special feature is the capability to make a realistic evaluation of their situation and to see all the time the positive part of this. On the other hand, the communist values, completely denying the values of the market economy, were superimposed over the values of free market economy. What has happened? The former were not consolidated and the latter had not been shared. So the situation is not simple. The main objective is to identify the stimulating / blocking factors which determine the Romanian women from the rural area of the Western part of Romania to initiate their own business in order to provide an useful tool to stimulate entrepreneurship in our country, like the modality to survive on a competitive market economy. The data base of the research is collected through questionnaires administered at the start and end of the course followed in July - October 2010, through non-directed interviews and study of documents prepared within the project mentioned above. The main conclusion of the study is that is time to demolish the myth of individualism in entrepreneurship. If traditionally, entrepreneurship has been seen as largely (if not 100%) individually, it seems that now it has become rather a collective effort resulted in the most obvious way in the collective ability to build and operate organizations, communities and effective and efficient institutions. The current problem in rural areas in Western Romania is not a lack of entrepreneurial potential and action at the individual level but the lack of production technology, the lack of internalized business values at a local level and the lack of social institutions and organizations to really support female entrepreneurship in the Romanian rural environment.","[Botezat, Elena] Univ Oradea, Fac Econ Sci, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea,,ebotezat@uoradea.ro,"Botezat, Elena Aurelia/AAL-2450-2021",,,,,,24,0,0,0,14,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,144,150,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800019,0

Agricola Andrieseni S.A has an organizational structure of hierarchical-functional type, but the information system is insufficiently developed. As regards the system and the used managerial style, it is an authority-involved one. The management of the agricultural organization highly promotes consultancy, delegation and cooperation in leadership, but in a authoritative way. The literature describes the general diagnosis, ensures the investigation of the agricultural exploitations and its structural components due to specific equipment in order to find the causes of the main strengths and weaknesses in order to draw recommendations for the increase of their viability potential. As regards the methodological elements used for the functioning of management and its components, these are far from following the basic requirements of the agricultural management science. Within the architecture, function and performances of the management system of the farm, its decisional component has a privileged role. No other element within the commercial company has a so obvious managerial specificity and such a large impact on all its plans and results. Within an agricultural farm, all the decisions taken and applied, structured properly for the objective system and the hierarchical managerial configuration, all these make up the decisional system. The information reveled by the records of the General meeting of the shareholders and the administration council of S.C.

However, previous research presents mixed results on the relationship between living in proximity to transport systems and reduced car-dependency. This research examines inner-city residents' transportation practices and perceptions, via 24 qualitative interviews with residents from high-density dwellings in inner-city Brisbane, Australia. Whilst participants consider public transport accessible and convenient, car use continues to be relied on for many journeys. Transportation choices are justified through complex definitions of convenience containing both utilitarian and psycho-social elements, with three key themes identified: time-efficiency, single versus multi-modal trips, and distance to and purpose of journey, as well as attitudinal, affective and symbolic elements related to transport mode use. Understanding conceptions of transport convenience held by different segments of the transport users market, alongside other factors strongly implicated in travel mode choice, can ensure targeted improvements in sustainable transport service levels and infrastructure as well as information service provision and behavioural change campaigns.

Contrary to recent studies, we show that immigration induced important net gains and small redistributive effects among natives. According to our simulations, the postwar US immigration is beneficial for all natives cohorts and all skill groups.

More specifically, this paper presents a clear case of collaboration among different types of Public Services and the Private Sector for the promotion of Entrepreneurial Culture via a program developed by one of the main universities in the Comunidad de Madrid (Spain). The vehicle to accomplish this task is the Centre for Entrepreneurial Initiatives (CIADE) of the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), set up 13 years ago for the promotion of entrepreneurial values and the creation of enterprises in the University. Since its creation, CIADE, lacking university-allocated financial resources, has been using a collaborative model with a wide range of entities. Under this model, named Triple Helix Model, by Etzkowitz y Leydesdorff (1995), the University (UAM) is supported by the following organizations: two levels of the Public Administration, national and regional (Ministry of Science and Innovation and the Regional Employment Service of the Comunidad de Madrid, respectively), private entities, in particular a financial institution (Caja Madrid Foundation) and different corporate civic entities (ACS Foundation, and 3M Foundation, among others). The Triple Helix model is nowadays one of CIADE's trademarks, both in its global design and in the operation of its different areas. The main objective of our research will be to analyze the roles Public Administration and the Private Sector play in the UAM with respect to entrepreneurship. This paper will show that the different entities involved in entrepreneurial programs with the University, despite having different goals and priorities, can establish and strengthen synergies under proper coordination, rather than overlap their functions leading to the recurrence or reduction of the results achieved).","[de Pablo, Isidro; Alfaro, Fernando; Rodriguez, Miriam; Valdes, Esperanza] Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,,isidro.de.pablo@uam.es; fernando.alfaro@uam.es; miriam.rodriguez@uam.es; mariaesperanza.valdes@uam.es,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,23,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,205,213,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800027,0

Objectives relate primarily to understanding customer priorities in the process of bank selection, reasons for retention, loyalty types and effects of satisfaction, trust and commitment on future behavior. Results are quantifiable, referring to the leading banks in the market. Prior work: Previous researches published in the relationship marketing literature have shown a strong link between satisfaction, trust, commitment, bank image and customer loyalty. Methodology: The research was carried out by applying the survey method using the structured interview techniques and the questionnaire as a tool for gathering information. The sample of 1010 subjects was selected from Romanian consumers of banking services over 18 years old, by using a stratified random sampling, a confidence level of 95 per cent and a 3 per cent error in precision of results. Correlations between variables were highlighted in the process of information analysis by using the nonparametric statistical test Chi square. Results: Show that customer priorities in the process of bank selection are related more with banking products and employee competences and to a lower extent with distribution network. Retail customers maintain relationships with banks from both positive perceptions and constraining factors or habit. Strong associations were found between customer satisfaction and trust, commitment and trust, satisfaction and cross buying intention. The research is limited to retail banking consumers, not taking into account corporate customers. Implications: The paper has implications for both academics and practitioners in the field of banking services. It highlights recent theories in marketing and shows which variables have a significant influence on customer-bank relationships. Results are useful to banks managers in order to decrease switching behavior by understanding customer priorities. Results offer clues about the strategies that may be adopted by Romanian banks for obtaining customer loyalty and a better market position. Originality value: The study contributes to the relationship marketing literature and banking practice by providing quantitative evidence regarding consumer attitudes and behavior towards financial companies. The prerequisites of customer loyalty and its effects are tested in the context of Romanian retail banking services.","[Filip, A.] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,filip.alina@gmail.com,"Filip, Alina/AAR-8642-2021","Filip, Alina/0000-0002-4753-9244",,,,,16,4,4,0,23,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,133,136,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900034,0

Much of this literature focuses on how the event embodied a neoliberalised state reaction to the crisis - heavily reliant on charities while actively promoting claims about the government's weakness in the face of such events. Though this literature is useful, it has generally not covered the role of religious charities and their role in the putative neoliberalisation of New Orleans. This paper attempts to explore the role of religious NGOs in the reconstruction of New Orleans.

Special attention is paid to the issue of work force mobility and flows. The review of chosen contemporary labour market theories has been conducted in three areas. The first one emphasizes mainly the structural and institutional factors as the ones causing unbalance on the labour market, which is exemplified by the segmentation theory. In the second one it is stressed that unbalance may he caused by interferences in long-term adjustment processes on the labour market, and which is presented in the human capital theory, natural rate of unemployment theory or the job search theory. The third area of discussion concerns the idea that unbalance on the labour market may result from the inflexibility of wage, which has been assumed in the efficient wage theory and in the insider-outsider theory.","[Jarmolowicz, Waclaw; Knapinska, Magdalena] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon & Natl Econ Res, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Jarmolowicz, W (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon & Natl Econ Res, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",waclaw.jarmolowicz@ue.poznan.pl; magdalena.knapinska@ue.poznan.pl,"Knapińska, Magdalena/AAM-7295-2021","Knapińska, Magdalena/0000-0002-6576-6416",,,,,28,4,4,5,34,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Because the supply of stumps and logging residues is tied to roundwood harvests, reaching the target seems unrealistic without investments in the new production capacity of the forest industry. In particular, the industries using sawlogs would need to get back to the high levels of production seen a few years ago. For instance, policies leading to the increased use of wood in construction would support the renewable energy goals as well. Also subsidies for CHP-production at sawmills would facilitate that. Tight carbon policy alone would lead to considerable increases in the use of forest chips, but because the prices of the CO2 emission permits are difficult to foresee, subsidies are needed to decrease the uncertainty faced by the market actors. The government is planning to set subsidies for wood-based electricity, which would be tied to the carbon price. Based on our results, we recommend binding the potential subsidies for chipping energy wood to the carbon price as well. (C) 2011 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umea, Sweden.

A definition of this sector is a result of different work groups in European and world level institutions. According to this definition, different companies in Albania offer in the market hardware and software and related services, telecommunication services and ISPs. The way in which electronic products and services are provided is also changing, due to technology. Albania, like many countries has lately replaced traditional services owned by the state with a model based on the market and competition. The further development of competition in ICT sector requires the necessary infrastructure as well as legal and financial support. The competitiveness differs according to different types of services like fixed telephony, mobile telephony, VoIP services.

Set against the background of post-Foucauldian perspectives on the material dimensions of citizenship and engagement - perspectives that treat matter as a tacit, constituting force in the organization of collectives and are predominantly concerned with the fabrication of political subjects - we outline an approach that considers material engagement as a distinct mode of performing the public. The question, then, is how objects, devices, settings and materials acquire explicit political capacities, and how they serve to enact material participation as a specific public form. We discuss the connections between social studies of material participation and political theory, and define the contours of an empiricist approach to material publics, one that takes as its central cue that the values and criteria particular to these publics emerge as part of the process of their organization. Finally, we discuss four themes that connect the papers in this special section, namely their focus on (1) mundane technologies, (2) experimental devices and settings for material participation, (3) the dynamic of effort and comfort, and (4) the modes of containment and proliferation that characterize material publics.","[Marres, Noortje] Univ London, Dept Sociol, CSISP, London SE14 6NW, England; [Lezaun, Javier] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of London; Cornell University,"Marres, N (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Sociol, CSISP, London SE14 6NW, England.",n.marres@gold.ac.uk,,"Marres, Noortje/0000-0002-8237-6946",,,,,103,240,261,0,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

We also use the more flexible approach that allows the overdispersion parameter to vary according to the characteristics of the visitors and we compare it with the more restrictive approach. The results show that the negative binomial model that accounts for truncation and endogenous stratification provides the better goodness-of-fit.

The aim of this research was to assess the cost effectiveness of a subsidy/tax system on carbon fluxes. First, it is shown that such a mechanism leads forest owners to extend rotation lengths. However, cost effectiveness analysis shows that: (1) marginal social costs are more expensive than the private marginal costs of carbon sequestration: (2) marginal costs are higher when carbon stocks are discounted, ranging from 170.1 (sic)/tC to 719.8 (sic)/tC with discounted carbon stocks; and from 38.8 (sic)/tC to 78.4 (sic)/tC with undiscounted carbon stocks; (3) marginal costs are in the range of measures of the social value of carbon for France; (4) marginal costs increase with timber prices and increase with discount rate.

Depending on the perception of consumers on a certain innovation, there can be determined the strategy which a company should implement in order to develop the innovation. The aim of this paper is to determine the perception of the consumers on the utility of such products and their willingness to buy and wear them. Intelligent garments represent the innovation of the garment industry. Depending on the type of garment, they can be used for several special situations as for instance in special conditions at work in sport with the purpose of achieving better performance or in medicine. These types of garments are made either of special materials, which are more resistant to humidity, high or low temperatures or they have incorporated several electronic devices. In order to determine the perception of the consumers regarding intelligent garments, a research was conducted on 502 respondents. In this survey there were asked questions about the utility and the willingness of consumers to wear such cloths. Depending on the results, a company producing such type of garment should know what communication strategy to develop in order to make these products successful. The first results of the research show that the Romanian consumers are not familiar with this type of products. Therefore a company should take measures in order to inform the consumers about this type of garments. Depending on the responses of the consumers a company should adjust its communication campaign. If the consumers know the products, these should be promoted in order to be worn. If the innovation is not known, several information campaigns should be started.

Her research of European tendencies brought her to the conclusion that in the face of a demographic crisis the introduction of mechanisms neutralising the fiscal burdens for families with children might stimulate the parents' professional activity and make it easier for them to reconcile the professional and family life rather than put family and fertility aside in flu your of professional development. If this is neglected, the economies may lose a significant factor of their growth and development - human resources. The author intends to continue and expand her research of the problem.","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Reg Econ & Tourism, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Rekas, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Reg Econ & Tourism, Nowowiejska 3, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland.",m-rekas@wp.pl,"Rekas, Magdalena/P-9552-2018","Rekas, Magdalena/0000-0002-1199-3103",,,,,30,0,0,0,13,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

A non-probability sampling method was used whereby a questionnaire was administered to 250 respondents and statistically analysed to determine the factors that are important in the choice between Islamic or conventional banks. It was found that Muslims are aware of Islamic banks, but their rate of use is low, as Muslim customers regard efficiency, lower bank charges, the availability of automatic teller machines and an extensive branch network as important factors when it comes to choosing a bank, rather than religious motivations for compliance with Islamic conventions. It was concluded that, if Islamic banks wanted to attract and retain customers and remain relevant in the South African context, they would have to develop relevant strategies designed to meet customers' needs. Religion as the sole motivation for choosing Islamic banks is inadequate.","[Saini, Yvonne; Bick, Geoff; Abdulla, Loonat] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Saini, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",,"Bick, Geoff/AAB-1698-2020","Bick, Geoffrey/0000-0002-1677-2561",,,,,47,24,29,0,10,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

An in depth interview was conducted to understand how these factors became critical success factors (CSFs) towards the implementation of good services to the local community. This study finds that the ICT only has become a culture for the administrator but not the resident community. This is in relation with the second factor, society, in which a majority of the community in the area is government servants where their work process is not heavily exposed to ICT but still depending heavily on manual and the paper-process. In terms of capacity, there are lack of skills, experience and knowledge by the employees of the local authority that will prevent the ability of the local authority to provide excellent infrastructure and restrict an innovative and creative process in the future. We also find that other than culture, society and capacity, a strong support from the central government is also critical for the ICT implementation in local areas.","[Salin, Ahmad Saiful Azlin Puteh] Univ Teknol MARA Perak, Fac Accountancy, Accounting Res Inst, Perak, Malaysia",,,ahmad577@perak.uitm.edu.my,"Salin, Ahmad Saiful Azlin Puteh/K-2625-2013","Salin, Ahmad Saiful Azlin Puteh/0000-0001-9652-712X",,,,,20,0,0,0,9,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8640-0,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,1.0,,,,,,256,260,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173400055,0

The assessment model is based on both a deterministic calculation following the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) methodology in a Danish manual from the Ministry of Transport and on a stochastic calculation, where risk analysis is carried out using Monte Carlo simulation. Special emphasis has been placed on the separation between inherent randomness in the modeling system and lack of knowledge. These two concepts have been defined in terms of variability (ontological uncertainty) and uncertainty (epistemic uncertainty). After a short introduction to deterministic calculation resulting in some evaluation criteria a more comprehensive evaluation of the stochastic calculation is made. Especially, the risk analysis part of CBA-DK, with considerations about which probability distributions should be used, is explained. Furthermore, comprehensive assessments based on the set of distributions are made and implemented by use of a Danish case example. Finally, conclusions and a perspective are presented.

Comments to the debate on reforms of the financial sector. In the light of the recent financial crisis the question was raised, if there is any chance of regulation at all to help prevent future crises. As lessons learned from the financial crisis regulators have already adopted numerous measures that aim to enhance financial regulation. Most prominent is the reform of the well-known Basel II soon to be Basel III framework. The following paper takes a closer look on the most important measures against the background of the economic aspects of financial intermediation. The overall focus of this paper is the question if the reform of Basel II can improve the regulatory environment. This includes an analysis of how the changes in financial regulation will affect financial institutions. As a result the paper will show that most of the discussed and adopted measures actually lead to greater regulatory effectiveness. Nevertheless, the key factor for more effective financial regulation is a deep knowledge with regard to financial institutions and their business models. Only a thourough understanding of each individual bank and the system as a whole puts the regulator in the position to assess risks which might lead to the next financial crisis and to react appropriately.",,,,,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,22,BUCHENVERLAG,BAD SODEN,"POSTFACH 1128, BAD SODEN, 65796, GERMANY",0044-3751,,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

The aim is to determine whether environmental stringency affects regional location decisions after controlling for other potentially important variables that may affect such decisions. Empirical results suggest that gold mining firms are strongly attracted to regions that are close to their head office and have low levels of corruption. They also have some preference for regions which provide a low risk, secure, transparent and stable environment for doing business. Gold mining firms also appear to be attracted to regions that have a clean environment, although evidence is less uniformly robust.

For application, we focus on the problem of estimating the high-frequency beta of an asset return when the returns are subject to the effects of market microstructure. Specifically, we study the correlation between intraday log returns of two assets. Our investigation starts with the effect of non-synchronous trading on intraday log returns when the underlying return series follows a stationary time series model. This is a random aggregation problem in time series analysis. We also study the effect of non-synchronous trading on the covariance of two asset returns. To overcome the impact of non-synchronous trading, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to recover the underlying log return series based on the observed intraday data. We then define a high-frequency beta based on the recovered log return series and propose an efficient method to estimate the measure. We apply the proposed analysis to many mid- or small-cap stocks using the Trade and Quote Data of the New York Stock Exchange, and discuss implications of the results obtained.

This allows us to evaluate if and how an economy locked into a dirty technology can be unlocked and move towards clean technology. The main extension involves the inclusion of the effect of recombinant innovation of the two technologies. A mechanism of endogenous competition is described involving a positive externality of increasing returns to investment which are counterbalanced by recombinant innovation. We determine conditions under which lock-in can be avoided or escaped. A second extension is osymmetry breakingo of the system due to the introduction of an environmental policy that charges a price for polluting. A final extension adds a cost of environmental policy in the form of lower returns on investment implemented through a growth-depressing factor. We compare cumulative pollution under different scenarios, so that we can evaluate the combination of environmental regulation and recombinant innovation.","[Zeppini, Paolo] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, CeNDEF, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Zeppini, Paolo; van den Bergh, Jeroen C.

I find that the presence of Indian casinos is strongly related to plausibly exogenous variation in reservations' legal and political institutions. Tribal governments that can negotiate gaming compacts with multiple state governments, because tribal lands span state borders, had more than twice the estimated probability (.77 versus .32) of operating an Indian casino in 1999. Tribal governments of reservations where contracts are adjudicated in state courts, rather than tribal courts, have more than twice the estimated probability (.76 versus .34) of investing in an Indian casino, ceteris paribus. These findings suggest that states' political pressures and predictable judiciaries affect incentives to invest in casinos. This study contributes, more generally, to the empirical literature on the effects of institutions by providing new evidence that low-cost contracting is important for taking advantage of substantial investment opportunities.","Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Cookson, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,50,21,25,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

Sometimes the risk estimates communicated using these models are too high, thereby leading to large capital requirements and high capital costs. At other times, the risk estimates are too low, leading to excessive violations, so that realized losses are above the estimated risk. In this paper we analyze the profit-maximizing problem of an ADI subject to capital requirements under the Basel II Accord as ADIs have to choose an optimal VaR reporting strategy that minimizes daily capital charges. Accordingly, we suggest a dynamic communication and forecasting strategy that responds to violations in a discrete and instantaneous manner, while adapting more slowly in periods of no violations. We apply the proposed strategy to Standard & Poor's 500 Index and show there can be substantial savings in daily capital charges, while restricting the number of violations to within the Basel II penalty limits.

How much does this argument hold for economic knowledge? Is economics helping in improving wealth and well-being? This article will show how the incentive structure and the internal organization of the discipline prevent a positive answer to such questions.

Given the availability of a wide range of forecasts for the same variable of interest, our goal is to apply combining methods to a restricted set of models. With this aim, a hierarchical procedure based on an encompassing test is considered. First, forecasting models are ranked according to a measure of predictive accuracy (RMSFE). The models are then selected for combination such that each forecast is not encompassed by any of the competing forecasts. Thus the hierarchical procedure represents a compromise between model selection and model averaging. The robustness of the procedure is investigated in terms of the relative RMSFE using ISAE (Institute for Studies and Economic Analyses) short-term forecasting models for monthly industrial production in Italy.

The problem is that public acceptance of such charges is low unless some obvious carrot can be identified.

Our analysis suggests that, although the removal of parking charges would reduce revenues and dilute the reduction in demand caused by the introduction of road charges, the combined effect might, in certain circumstances, be more beneficial to the local economy and might still yield a net increase in revenue. Given the incidence of impacts, it also appears that a combined scheme would be more equitable and might stand a greater chance of achieving public acceptance than a more conventional road charging scheme. The paper identifies the circumstances in which a combined scheme might work well and outlines the detailed analysis that would be necessary to confirm this. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Visibility differences, on the other hand, affect the mobility and career prospects of agents, and can generate nonassortative matching.

They are widespread in the grocery industry and a concern to antitrust authorities. A popular view is that slotting allowances arise because there are more products than retailers can profitably carry given their shelf space. We show that the causality can also go the other way: the scarcity of shelf space may in part be due to the feasibility of slotting allowances. It follows that slotting allowances can be anticompetitive even if they have no effect on retail prices.,"[Marx, Leslie M.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Shaffer, Greg] Univ Rochester, Simon Sch Business, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",Duke University; University of Rochester,"Marx, LM (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",marx@duke.edu; shaffer@simon.rochester.edu,,,ESRC [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,26,49,53,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

We find that the hub premium is increasing in the ticket fare. We find that control of gates is a crucial determinant of this premium.

Avoidance, such as concealment of evidence, perjury, or obstruction of justice, is generally deemed socially undesirable because it wastes resources and reduces deterrence. However, since avoidance is also costly to offenders, it may substitute for socially costlier punishments such as imprisonment and therefore be socially desirable. This, however, does not imply that punishing avoidance is socially undesirable. Rather, punishing avoidance should discourage avoidance as little as possible or even encourage avoidance. This article also questions the argument that sanctions should generally not be maximal if avoidance is present. It shows that this argument holds only if punishment takes the sole form of fines. If punishment takes the sole form of imprisonment, then imprisonment should nevertheless be maximal. This is another manifestation of the social desirability of punishment avoidance.

Primary and secondary sources were used to collect information. A questionnaire consisting of twenty (20) items was used, validated by five experts, with a reliability coefficient of 0.84. Results revealed that support for social economy organizations, especially cooperatives, is oriented to offering financing, education, training, granting guarantees and integral assistance. Most of the favored cooperatives operate in the service sector, are classified as mixed and basically, are small and medium in size. Conclusions indicate a tendency in national government policies to promote civil society organizations directed to the social economy, such as cooperatives; however, there are still many spaces to cover-desire for profit, an excess of cooperatives with political tendencies, ignorance of the existing regulations, among others.","[Graterol, Angela; Alizo, Maria Alexandra] Univ Politecn Madrid, LUZ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,,agraterol@hotmail.com; marialexa4@hotmail.com; nomofi25@hotmail.com,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,8,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Against the debilitating mantra of TINA (there is no alternative), these conceptualizations use an ontology of proliferation to insist that many viable and vital alternatives to capitalism do, in fact, exist. I aim to contribute to this project with a close reading of the diverse formal and informal economic practices associated with the village of Puno in the Philippines. In doing so, I respond to calls for work that begins in the majority world and that focuses on the broader political project associated with diverse economies. Research in this area has frequently been critiqued for not paying sufficient attention to the unstable yet persistent exclusions that may endure in, and may even be enhanced by, alternative economies. With this article, I aim to investigate the ways that power relations work through the diverse economies of Puno and the ways that residents act to transform these relations. In doing so, I draw on the experiences of three residents of Puno and their involvement in three social movement organizations. I find that the economy is usefully understood as a site of struggle in which residents work to redefine themselves and the economy. The diverse spaces of their economic lives are neither strictly alternative nor mainstream, inherently oppressive nor radical. Rather, the people of Puno are engaged in willfully cultivating spaces-beyond-capitalism through which they transform the very meaning of economic practice.","Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Wright, S (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",sarah.wright@newcastle.edu.au,,"Wright, Sarah/0000-0002-8595-4529",,,,,57,35,43,0,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0095,,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

To understand the extent of possible behavioural response bias when calibration is ignored is important, signalling a possible adjustment process to correct for the absence of calibration relative to calibrated RP and or RP/SP derived elasticities.

This paper seeks to shed light on this issue in the context of Australia. To this end, the vector autocorrelation (VAR) framework is employed to explore the causal relationship between Australia-China trade and the development of the Australian transport and logistics sector. This framework is then extended to allow for the effect of Australia's trade with the US, Japan, the rest of the world and other variables.

The U.S. market-based model is presented as a benchmark, since U.S. investors trade securities most frequently relative to other international equity investors.

We assume the existence of two relation forms. In the cooperation form, the business, legal, tax and financial conditions positively affect the production across the industries. In the competitive relations case, the industries compete for common resources and supply their production in the same consumer market. We assume that this kind of the competition/cooperation relations among the industries define an equilibrium, which can be modeled by vector error correction model. Using the vector error correction model, we identified both the long-run and the short-run equilibrium relationships among the sales indicators and other exogenous variables. We analyzed seven industrial production branches/sectors according to Branch Statistical Classification of the Economic Activities. The selected industrial indicators involve sales, wages and number of employees across the industrial branches. The research showed that even though the industrial branches are not obviously interconnected, the statistical significant relations among them may exist. Using the Slovak monthly time series cover the time period 1998-2007, we discovered the statistically significant long-term relations among the sales indicators. Here, the industrial branches Manufacture of electrical machinery and Manufacture of radio, television and communication as well as branches Manufacture of electrical machinery and Manufacture of medical, precision and optical instruments were in the hidden long-term competitive relation and the branches Manufacture of radio, television and communication and Manufacture of medical, precision and optical instruments were in the hidden long-term cooperative relation. On the other hand, the statistically significant sales short-term relations to restore the equilibrium were also proved. The short-term relations between the sales indicators on one side and both the cross-sales lagged variables and the exogenous variables on the other side were not statistically significant.","[Frenakova, Magdalena] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Dept Finance & Accounting, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia; [Gazda, Vladimir] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Jasovska, Jana] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Dept Management, Kosice 04130, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; Technical University Kosice; University of Presov; University of Economics Bratislava,"Frenáková, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Dept Finance & Accounting, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia.",magdalena.frenakova@euke.sk; vladimir.gazda@tuke.sk; jasovska.jana@gmail.com,"Gazda, Vladimír/AAH-3767-2019; Freňáková, Magdaléna/IXN-4508-2023; Freňáková, Magdaléna/AAC-6476-2021","Gazda, Vladimír/0000-0003-1954-9346; Freňáková, Magdaléna/0000-0002-8444-1334;",,,,,30,4,4,0,6,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

China's logistics service providers (Hereafter short for LSPs) should adopt more efficient logistics technologies to provide better services for their customers. However, there is a lack of empirical research on the adoption of logistics technologies in China. This paper has attempted to fill the knowledge gap by investigating the determinants of technological innovations in China's logistics industry. This paper focuses on the factors influencing the adoption of technological innovations by LSPs in China and investigates the outcomes of adopting new technologies on supply chain performance. A questionnaire survey is conducted among China's logistics industry. After data reduction through factor analysis, the validity and reliability are confirmed by its Cronbach's alpha value, and then we employ regression method to verify our theoretical model and all the hypotheses. Empirical test results prove that technological, organizational and environmental factors significantly affect the adoption of technological innovations by China's logistics industry, and adopting new technologies will increase supply chain performance for the logistics industry in China.","[Gou Yanzhong] Xinjiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Management, Xinjiang 830012, Peoples R China",Xinjiang University of Finance & Economics,,gouyanzhongxj@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,7,ORIENT ACAD FORUM,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204, AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,2010,,,,,,,417,422,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS34,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287959400068,0

Although decline figures are much lower than in more traditional areas of decline in Europe, Dutch planners and policy-makers feel the need to develop several strategies of planning for decline. This paper gives an overview of regional population trends in the Netherlands up to 2040, showing that at the regional level, population growth and decline can occur next to each other in both urban and rural areas. The number of single-person households is expected to continue growing. However, single households form a varied group, and population trends differ substantially between urban and rural areas. The strategies applied by policy-makers who focus, so far, on accommodating decline through measures on the housing market are analysed.

The difficulty appears due partly to the single-equation format that has constrained past work, and partly to a failure to fully appreciate how key standard independent variables should be measured in the French context. As a potential remedy, we offer a multi-equation model, where the first equation gives strict emphasis to prediction, the second equation to explanation.

As a result, a number of undesired market outcomes have occurred in this market, including oversupply of land and a high rate of deteriorating industrial estates. Policy interventions have been announced that must improve market outcomes. This paper analyses those undesired market outcomes and compares them with development processes in other European countries. We will argue that the effectiveness of the present set of interventions - all meant to adjust the present institutional order - can be improved, when they are accompanied by interventions meant to restructure this institutional order. The latter set of interventions, based on recent Coasian planning literature, includes the pricing of externalities, reduction of the rights of municipalities to develop industrial estates and a change of the conditions in industrial properties tenancy contracts.","[van der Krabben, Erwin] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Spatial Planning, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van Dinteren, Jacques] Univ Groningen, Fac Ruimtelijke Wetenschappen, Groningen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Groningen,"van der Krabben, E (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Spatial Planning, Postbus 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",e.vanderkrabben@fm.ru.nl; j.vandinteren@rug.nl,,,,,,,34,12,13,0,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

It employs the highest pro-portion of workers, forms a substantial part of GDP and its products constitute the largest share of exports. It is highly probable that the development of industrial production highly contributes to the growth of regional disparities. The main aim of this paper will be to statistically assess the development of industry in the various districts of the Slovak Republic in the periods 2003, 2007 and 2008. Significant changes in the structure of the industry with respect to FDI inflows occurred in the economy between the years 2003 and 2008. Significant contribution of this paper is the comparison of the regional situation in the industry with respect to multiple criteria using multidimensional analysis. Measurement of efficiency of industrial activities in the regions where they come from the multi-character, can establish the current impact on the analysis of several variables, which are regarded as determinants of industrial activity. Second aim of this paper is to show the possibilities of using the principal component analysis and the method of cluster analysis in measuring of the regional level of the industrial activity. Increasing efficiency of industrial activities in Slovakia has had a positive impact on increasing the competitiveness of enterprises and services, value added growth, increase efficiency, modernize equipment and numerous other areas.","[Vojtkova, Maria] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Informat, Dept Stat, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,,maria.vojtkova@euba.sk,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,3,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-180-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,289,304,,,,,,16,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BGW05,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000324343700024,0

This essay systemizes previous literatures and finds out that they almost concentrate on attribution of blame, tolerance of ambiguity and individual trait. After the viewpoints of relevant theories being summarized, this study proposes attribution of blame predominates in individual's crises cognition, and tolerance of ambiguity is the internal factor of triggering crises and deciding attributions, while individual trait acts as an external factor on attribution of blame or tolerance of ambiguity. Finally, subsequent studies of this topic are proposed.","[Wang Zhiliang; Mao Xuehong; Bao Shujie] Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200041, Peoples R China",Shanghai University,,w.zhiliang@yahoo.com.cn,"Liu, Junyang/A-9731-2018",,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,ORIENT ACAD FORUM,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204, AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,2010,,,,,,,393,400,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS34,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287959400064,0
