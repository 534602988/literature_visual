One of the key sites for such development has been the military. A principal attribute of traditional military subjects has been fortitude, an assemblage of moral strength, will-power and courage deeply inscribed in the soul. In the new military, fortitude is now seen as of only conditional value to the latest configuration of the 'liberal way of war'. Instead, resilience is centred as appropriate to 'warriors', and resonates with an advanced liberal political environment. Resilience appears as a set of cognitive skills that anyone can develop with correct training. Founded in cognitive behavioural therapy, resilience centres innovativeness, enterprise, responsibility and flexibility. It now takes its place as part of a complex of scientifically grounded techniques of the self necessary to optimize autonomous subjects in an age of high uncertainty.","Univ Sydney, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"O'Malley, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",pat.omalley@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,46,196,206,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Using policy relevant NUTS4 level data horn 1999 to 2006. we employ tools typically applied to income convergence analyses to inquire the patterns of unemployment distribution. We apply diverse analytical techniques to seek traces of convergence, including beta and sigma convergence as well as pass-through analysis We demonstrate that the unemployment rate distribution is highly stable over time, while only weak convergence of clubs is supported by the data and only for the high unemployment melons Results suggest no support in favour of beta-type convergence, i.e. convergence of levels. Even controlling for nation-wide labour market outlooks (conditional convergence) does not provide any support to this hypothesis. Further, legions with both very high and very low unemployment show signs of high persistence and low mobility in the national distribution, while those in the middle tend to demonstrate higher mobility and essentially no persistence of regional unemployment differentials This diagnosis is confirmed by sigma-convergence analysis which indicates no general divergence or convergence patterns Transitions seem to be slightly more frequent, but at the same nine less sustainable for middle range districts. while movements up and down the ladder occur predominantly for the same districts. This methodology allows to define the patterns of local labour Market dynamics, pointing to differentiated divergence paths. Importantly. these tendencies prevail despite cohesion financing schemes, which allocate relatively more resources to deprived regions.","[Tyrowicz, Joanna; Wojcik, Piotr] Univ Warsaw, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,,,"Wójcik, Piotr/R-5395-2019; Wójcik, Piotr/E-8094-2015; Tyrowicz, Joanna/I-3270-2019","Wójcik, Piotr/0000-0003-1853-8784; Tyrowicz, Joanna/0000-0002-5928-332X",,,,,31,4,4,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTR 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-916X,,978-3-7908-2163-5,AIEL SER LABOUR ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,149,173,,10.1007/978-3-7908-2164-2_6,0.0,,,25,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BOM48,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277011100006,0

We find there are 15 structural breakpoints. Having classified the type of each breakpoint, we find that most of them are variance changes. In all of the events that have effect on the volatility of China's bond market, the events of adjusting reserve ratio and interest rate and the release of macroeconomic data account for a substantial portion. We also find there are not Treasury bond auction announcements in these significant events, the reason may be due to the different issuing ways of Treasury bond between China and the US. In addition, comparing the empirical results in this paper with the researches on structural breakpoints of China's stock market, we find that the degree of influence caused by significant events on China's bond market is less than that on stock market.","[Yang Jiping; Zhang Cheng] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beihang 100191, Peoples R China",Beihang University,,yangjp@buaa.edu.cn,"LI, Xiang/JBJ-8387-2023",,,,,,18,1,2,0,1,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 5-11 QUEENS RD,, MELBOURNE, VC 3004, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54649-0,,,,2010,,,,,,,249,258,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZQ34,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000302388300043,0

All of them had to reform their economies as a consequence of the economic and political transformation. Their transition from the centralised to free-market economy entailed various social tensions and economic costs. However, they did not choose the same fiscal solutions to attain their economic goals. Each of the countries decided to apply its specific set of fiscal instruments to arrive at economic growth. Some of the new post-communist members of the European Union have already joined - and others aspire to join - the Euro zone, whose stability depends on compliance with the adopted fiscal criteria. All those developments give rise to questions about the most efficient fiscal solutions available to the national economies in the process of attaining the assumed economic goals. This paper presents results of an analysis of the choice and efficiency of the fiscal instruments applied in the Central and Eastern Europe countries in reaching the primary objective of any fiscal policy, which is to facilitate sustainable economic growth.","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Econ Policies, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Zabinski, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Econ Policies, Nowowiejska 3, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland.",azabi@gazeta.pl,,"Zabinski, Arkadiusz/0000-0002-0352-688X",,,,,33,3,3,0,12,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

On the basis of analyzing the relationship between international logistics (IL) and trade, this article uses the method of theoretical and empirical analysis and analyzes the situation development of international logistics and its influence on China's Import and Export Trade. Based on related statistical data, this paper conducts a relative and flexibility analysis between IL and China's import and export trade. The conclusion is: the development of IL positively promotes China's import and export trade. If the logistic demand changes by 1%, the trade amount of import and export will increase or decrease by 3.88%, 2.72% and 0.98%. However, by analyzing the conclusion, we can find the issue in China's logistics industry. Therefore, governments at all levels should place importance on the development of the logistics industry and use international logistics in a positive role in China's import and export trade.","[Zhang Xiaofen; Li Xiaomei] Liaoning Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Jinzhou 121001, Peoples R China",Liaoning University of Technology,,dtz218@sohu.com; lglxm@yahoo.com.cn,"wang, dong/HMP-1439-2023; WANG, JIAXUAN/JMP-8599-2023; Wang, Xuezhen/IUN-6267-2023; Li, Xiaomei/HNI-0635-2023",,,,,,3,2,2,0,3,AMERICAN SCHOLARS PRESS,MARIETTA,"3238 HARVEST WAY, MARIETTA, GA 30062 USA",,,978-0-9845209-1-6,,,,2010,,,,,,,52,57,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTV50,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288188100011,0

This study shows the recent signs of Malaysia's transition from an industrial to a post-industrial age. This is similar to Japan's transition from an industrial society in the 1980s, with manufacturing technology at its center, to a knowledge-based society, with information technology as its core, in the 1990s. Studying the Malaysian industries' technological progress suggests that Malaysia is about to undergo a transition from a dominating industrial age towards an economy with a strong service industry. Continuous technological learning and management should be emphasized to help Malaysian industries in adjusting to a new era of global challenges while remaining highly competitive. Measuring and monitoring technological learning is essential for technological capacity building and for policy management. This study measured the learning rates in the manufacturing and service industries of Malaysia. A dynamic cubic learning curve model was incorporated into a neoclassical production function and was used to measure learning coefficients in the Malaysian manufacturing and service industries. The findings demonstrated that the learning trend in each sub-sector in both the manufacturing and service industries behaved in three distinct manners: convex with a minimum, concave with a maximum, and concave with no maximum. The identification of the performing, forgetting, and non-performing years of each individual industry attests to the dynamism in the technological learning of Malaysia's manufacturing and service industries.","[Asgari, Behrooz] Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, Coll Asia Pacific Management, Beppu, Oita 8748577, Japan; Malaysia Univ Sci & Technol, Petaling Jaya 47301, Malaysia",Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University,"Asgari, B (通讯作者)，Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, Coll Asia Pacific Management, 1-1 Jumonjibaru, Beppu, Oita 8748577, Japan.",behrooz@apu.ac.jp,"Asgari, Behrooz/GNW-6476-2022",,,,,,45,5,6,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

In practice, however, regulators have increasingly adopted a variety of hybrid regulatory constraints that embody elements of both these, and other, regulatory forms. In this paper, we draw upon elements of both the positive economic theory of regulation and standard efficiency-based economic analysis of regulation to develop a model that endogenously yields hybrid regulatory constraints as a regulatory optimum. In this context, the paper further demonstrates that a commonly observed side payment-profit sharing-enhances regulator welfare. The results provide a plausible basis for understanding the pattern of modern regulatory constraints.","[Mayo, John W.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, McDonough Sch Business, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Blank, Larry] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Econ, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",Georgetown University; New Mexico State University,"Mayo, JW (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, McDonough Sch Business, 37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",Larryb@nmsu.edu; mayoj@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,55,10,11,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Using publicly traded bond data for a sample of large firms, we find that firms incorporated in states with more restrictive payout statutes (for example, New York and California) have better credit ratings and significantly lower yield spreads (about 8.7 percent) than do firms incorporated in less restrictive states (for example, Delaware). These results suggest that incorporation in a more restrictive state provides a credible commitment mechanism for avoiding some of the moral hazard problems associated with long-term debt. This commitment corresponds to an economically and statistically significant difference in market yields and firm-financing costs and is robust to controls for ownership, governance, debt type, Delaware or non-Delaware incorporation, and covenant usage. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion that Delaware incorporation has hidden costs for some firms.","[Mansi, Sattar A.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Maxwell, William F.] So Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Wald, John K.] Univ Texas San Antonio, San Antonio, TX USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Southern Methodist University; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Mansi, SA (通讯作者)，Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,"maxwell, william/B-2669-2009; maxwell, william/ABF-6515-2020; Wald, John K/M-2016-2018","Wald, John/0000-0001-7159-9549",,,,,49,31,36,3,20,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Second, we argue the focus in that paper on Ellsberg examples is an overly narrow concern; the Ellsberg examples have their uses but they are not the best context to understand why reasonable real-world agents may find acting in an ambiguity-sensitive manner normatively or prescriptively appealing.

Moreover, less than 20% of the most frequent diagnoses account for more than 80% of the results of consultations. This finding, confirmed empirically during the last fifty years, suggests a power law distribution, with critical consequences for diagnosis and decision making in primary care. Our results prove that primary care has a severe black swan element in the vast majority of consultations. Some critical cases involving avoidable life-threatening dangerous developments (ALDD) such as myocardial disturbance, brain bleeding, and appendicitis may be masked by those often vague symptoms of health disorders ranked in the 20% most frequent diagnoses. The Braun distribution predicts the frequency of health disorders on a phenomenological level and reveals the black swan problem, but is not a tool by itself for arriving at accurate diagnoses. To improve predictions and enhance the reliability of diagnoses we propose standards of documentation and a systematic manner by which the risk facing a patient with an uncertain diagnosis can be evaluated (diagnostic protocols). Accepting a power law distribution in primary care implies the following: (1) primary care should no longer be defined only by low prevalence properties, but also by its black-swan-incidence-problem. This includes rethinking malpractice and the requirements of malpractice litigations; (2) at the level of everyday practice, diagnostic protocols are tools to make diagnoses more reliable; (3) at the level of epidemiology, Braun's system of classification is useful for generating valid information by which predictions of risks can be improved.

A new resident decides whether to come to the nuisance by locating next to an existing business or to locate elsewhere where there are no negative externalities between occupants. Faced with a new resident, the existing business can relocate. Once situated, local residents bargain to address negative externalities. However, location decisions are non-contractible. In this setting-contrary to PS-the first best is achieved by allocating property rights to the first party, entitling the initial resident to full compensation for damages. This rule is consistent with the Spur Industries decision. Allocating property rights to second parties excessively encourages residents to come to the nuisance, whereas stronger first-party rights (injunctive or exclusion) excessively deter nuisances from moving to areas less prone to external harm.

When the individual investment professionals are highly specialized themselves, the marginal effect of increasing overall firm specialization is much weaker. The poorer performance by generalists appears to be due to both an inefficient allocation of funding across industries and poor selection of investments within industries.

Starting with the colonial epoch in New Spain, this study approaches the role conceded to Mexican indigenous peoples and their slow inclusion in society through the adoption of practices considered western and civilized in detriment to the traditional indigenous practices, considered primitive and backward, as a means of assimilation; a phenomenon that later would have to propose the mestizo as a stereotype of Mexican national identity during the nineteenth century; and that would culminate in its consolidation at the beginnings of the twentieth century. Likewise, the perception of racial mixing is approached as a means for civilization in the idiosyncrasy of the Mexican and the Mexican-American to culminate with an evolution of the constant search for what is western, this time through assimilating the US way of life, as a continuation of the civilizing process understood as racial mixing.",,,,gcervantes@uach.mx,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

On balance, we find that CEOs have higher compensation and more job security, and their compensation and retention are less sensitive to stock-based performance after the enactment of ATLs. We also find that CEO compensation and retention are more sensitive to accounting-based performance after ATLs, but the increased sensitivity is attributable to the accruals component of accounting-based performance. Based on prior evidence that CEOs often exercise discretion in measuring accounting-based performance, we interpret our results as evidence that CEOs have strong negotiation power vis-A-vis their corporate boards.

One of the main contributions of our analysis is the evidence provided for the need very clearly to isolate and spell out the port activity for which the efficiency assessment is being conducted.

Using case-level U. S. data spanning 1982-96, we model the dynamic relationship between AIDS infection rates and the proportion of men in the age-, state-, and race-matched cohort that are incarcerated. We find strong effects of male incarceration rates on male and female AIDS rates. The dynamic structure of this relationship parallels the incubation time between human immunodeficiency virus infection and the onset of full-blown AIDS. These results persist after controlling for year fixed effects; a fully interacted set of age, race, and state fixed effects; crack cocaine prevalence; and flow rates in and out of prison. The results reveal that higher incarceration rates among black males over this period explain the lion's share of the racial disparity in AIDS infection among women.","[Johnson, Rucker C.; Raphael, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Johnson, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,36,115,147,0,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

The number of candidate explanations is large relative to the number of states. To overcome this problem, we use zip-code-level data to identify the importance of demographic variables using within-state variation. This preserves state-level degrees of freedom to identify the impact of state policy variables. Demographics, wage garnishment restrictions, and the fraction of bankruptcies filed under Chapter 13 explain 70 percent of the variation in filing rates across states. Exemption rates, size of public safety nets, and payday loan regulations contribute virtually nothing to the cross-state variance in filing rates. Our findings suggest that state bankruptcy rates reflect the relative costs of filing for formal bankruptcy versus informal default. States without effective wage garnishment provisions allow easy informal default. Furthermore, repayment plans mandated under Chapter 13 bankruptcy often lead to repeated bankruptcy filings.","[Lefgren, Lars; McIntyre, Frank] Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University,"Lefgren, L (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",,"McIntyre, Frank/B-8646-2014","McIntyre, Frank/0000-0003-3285-6770; Lefgren, Lars/0000-0002-8198-8094",,,,,26,66,78,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

Starting from the state space formulation, a formula for the forecast is derived and reduced to a two-dimensional integration that can be computed numerically in a straightforward way. In contrast to much of the work for exponential smoothing, this method produces the forecast density and, in addition, it considers the initial level and initial trend as part of the parameters to be evaluated. Another contribution of this paper is that we have derived a way to reduce the computation of the maximum likelihood parameter estimation procedure to that of evaluating a two-dimensional grid, rather than applying a five-variable optimization procedure. Simulation experiments confirm that both proposed methods give favorable performance compared to other approaches.

Indicators of patent quality are used to form an index of regional innovation, which is argued to be an improvement over patent counts, which are seen as indicators of inventions. Innovations are more concentrated than inventions, which in turn are more concentrated than production, gauged by employment levels. Innovations are, moreover, concentrated to regions with already high production and invention levels. This indicates that the concentration of innovation is understated, as raw, patent counts are used to proxy for innovation rather than quality patents. The results further point to the need for revaluing effect of R&D on local innovative activity.","Lund Univ, CIRCLE, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Ejermo, O (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, POB 117, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",olof.ejermo@circle.lu.se,"Ejermo, Olof/K-7293-2012","Ejermo, Olof/0000-0002-4604-5912",,,,,98,34,37,5,79,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Even though no statistical correlation was specified between the percentage of mineral exportations as part of the GDP with the HDI or some of its components, a significant relationship was found between the percentage as a part of total exportations even though, in its relationship with the HDI and with the index of educational achievement, only slight inverse relationships were found. In regard to the demographic variables, only slight relationships were found between the percentage of mineral exportations over total exportations with the total fecundity rate and the infantile mortality rate, without finding any significance in the mortality rate of children below 5 years of age. It was specified that, even though most of the countries with mineral dependence have medium HDI values, the values reflect strong regional differences, positive, qualified, asymmetrical distributions in reference to mineral exportations and the unequal dispersion of the HDI values, where this is greater among countries with a high dependence on minerals.","Univ Zulia, Ctr Estudios Sociol & Antropol, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"Oquendo, LJG (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Ctr Estudios Sociol & Antropol, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",ludwig73ve@yahoo.com,"González Oquendo, Luis J./GMX-3372-2022",,,,,,27,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Standard approaches to this problem regard the addition of an alternative to a set containing one element as enhancing choice. We argue that this monotonicity axiom may not be desirable when an agent is uncertain as to the value of this additional alternative. We replace monotonicity with an uncertainty aversion axiom, and also introduce an axiom that produces lexicographic behaviour. These axioms, in conjunction with an independence axiom, enable us to prove a characterisation theorem. This theorem says that sets are ranked in terms of the number of uncertain elements that they contain, the fewer the better. This is the only ranking rule that satisfies our axioms.","[Gekker, Ruvin; Piggins, Ashley] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Gekker, R (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland.",ruvin.gekker@nuigalway.ie; ashley.piggins@nuigalway.ie,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,3,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Basic data on human capital are drawn from the ONet information system. A first analytical exercise shows that for the USA as a whole, occupations marked by broadly cognitive human capital assets gained in employment over the period from 2000 to 2006, whereas employment in occupations marked by broadly physical human capital assets declined. These same types of assets bear a distinctive relationship to the urban hierarchy, with the former being concentrated in large metropolitan areas, and the latter in small. Changes in these assets over the 20002006 period are then examined. Surprisingly, cognitive assets increased most strongly in small metropolitan areas and physical assets increased most strongly in large. Further analysis of these findings suggests that they are quite consistent with a wider view of the contemporary urban economy. In particular, in large metropolitan areas, expanding human capital assets focused on the physical abilities of workers has nothing to do with the old economy as such, but represents a majorand hitherto much overlookedsegment of the labor force whose functions revolve around the maintenance of the material and social fabric of life in those areas.","[Scott, Allen J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Scott, Allen J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Scott, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",ajscott@ucla.edu,"Scott, Allen John/A-8111-2008","Scott, Allen/0000-0002-8742-5970","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0749038] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,29,68,79,2,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data, we show that patenting is a minority activity: a majority of the faculty members in our sample never patent, and publication rates far outstrip patenting rates. Most faculty members estimate that patents account for less than 10% of the knowledge that transfers from their labs. Our results also suggest that in two important ways patenting is not representative of the patterns of knowledge generation and transfer from MIT: patent volume does not predict publication volume, and those firms that cite MIT papers are in general not the same firms as those that cite MIT patents. However, patent volume is positively correlated with paper citations, suggesting that patent counts may be reasonable measures of research impact. We close by speculating on the implications of our results for the difficult but important question of whether, in this setting, patenting acts as a substitute or a complement to the process of fundamental research.","[Agrawal, Ajay K.] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Henderson, Rebecca] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",University of Toronto; Harvard University,"Agrawal, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,18,3,3,1,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0742-3322,,978-1-84855-486-3,ADV STRATEG MANAGE,Adv.

We analysed the demand for new car fuel economy in the UK using a two-stage econometric model to investigate the drivers of this demand in the short and long terms over the period 1970-2004. We found that higher incomes and long-term price changes were the main drivers to achieve improvements in fuel economy, particularly for petrol cars, and that new car fuel economy changes were scarcely affected by the Voluntary Agreement on CO, emissions reductions adopted in the 1990s. We found, in agreement with other studies, that the demand for fuel economy was price inelastic for both fuels. Our calculated long-term income elasticity (petrol with -0.31 and diesel fuels with -0.20) values are above the range of international studies for petrol but within the range for diesel. An aggregate model of fuel economy gives a fuel price elasticity of -0.32 and an elasticity of -0.26 with respect to UK disposable income.","[Bonilla, David] Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford,"Bonilla, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Transport Studies Unit, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",cenv0044@herald.ox.ac.jp,"Vargas, David/IQV-3151-2023","bonilla, David/0000-0002-5818-1698",,,,,59,17,18,0,7,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Drawing on the resource-based view and an in-depth case study analysis of 15 firms in Scotland, the chapter discusses core rigidities that may inhibit growth of mMNEs. Six interrelated areas of organizational rigidities are identified, namely, failure to monitor external changes; existence of production orientation; failure to prioritize opportunities; existence of an opportunistic and reactive international management style; failure to acquire access to financial resources; and the existence of a centralized and non-participative organizational culture.

The algorithm is implemented onto a real-life urban sub-network which includes a private highway. The results of the case study show the ability of the DS algorithm to relatively quickly converge to a solution and signify its potential to provide a competitive alternative to the currently used genetic algorithm (GA) approach for solving such types of nonconvex bilevel programs in the sector of road transport services.","[Tsekeris, Theodore] Ctr Planning & Econ Res KEPE, Amerikis 11, Athens 10672, Greece",,"Tsekeris, T (通讯作者)，Ctr Planning & Econ Res KEPE, Amerikis 11, Athens 10672, Greece.",lucdimit@central.ntua.gr; tsek@kepe.gr,"Tsekeris, Theodore/H-5838-2019","Dimitriou, Loukas/0000-0002-8427-058X",,,,,28,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",0075-8442,,978-3-642-00939-6,LECT NOTES ECON MATH,,,2009,624.0,,,,,,45,61,,10.1007/978-3-642-00939-6_4,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BLV72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271188100004,0

The prevailing amendments of the quarterly reports among companies however question the effectiveness of audit committees. This paper examines the association between audit committee characteristics (independence, expertise and activities of audit committees) and the amendments of quarterly financial reports of Malaysian companies. Control variables, namely size of board of directors, size of company, profitability and auditor are also included in this study. In this study, each of the 63 sampled companies that amended their quarterly reports in 2005 is matched with a company that did not make any amendments. The univariate analysis shows that companies that amend their quarterly reports are likely to be those having audit committees that are less independent, and are comprised of less than two financial experts. They also tend to have smaller board of directors. Consistent with the univariate test, results of the regression test indicate that companies having audit committees with two or more financial experts are less likely to amend their quarterly reports.

This study also observed that most of the amendments are due to oversight, mathematical mistakes and typographical errors.

The recent financial crisis highlights the importance of these topics for understanding economic development and points to the complex relationship between structures and processes at various geographical scales. This introduction to the financial geography special issue provides background information on the development and the functioning of financial markets. The most prominent change of Germany's financial system is a growing capital market orientation resulting from internationalisation while the country at the same time is sustaining a distinctly regionalised financial structure - thus high-lighting the importance of multilevel analyses in financial geography. The contributions to the special issue are positioned and discussed against this background.

After 1990 the political and economic transformation of the country generated far reaching changes in socio-economic patterns within Budapest. Due to privatisation of housing, the liberalisation of the property market, and the growing presence of global capital, the inner-city neighbourhoods have been rapidly changing their facades as well as their social milieux. Increasing concentration of corporate capital, a general decline of residential function, as well as the striking social polarisation of neighbourhoods have been the most important outcomes. This paper provides empirical evidence about socio-spatial differentiation and the changing patterns of residential segregation in the inner-city of Budapest. It is argued that social differentiation and polarisation of these neighbourhoods was not started by the transformation but existed before the collapse of communism. Extreme forms of segregation, including ghettoisation, are the outcome of neoliberal political and economic conditions and the weakness of the welfare state. The post-1990 trajectory of some of these neighbourhoods and the dual character of the inner-city strongly resembles patterns in US cities.","Univ Szeged, Dept Econ & Social Geog, Szeged, Hungary",Szeged University,"Kovács, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Dept Econ & Social Geog, Szeged, Hungary.",zkovacs@iif.hu,"Kovacs, Zoltan/AAF-4317-2020","Kovacs, Zoltan/0000-0003-2697-4682",,,,,45,48,51,1,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The paper adds the metropolitan level to those macro and microlevel approaches, and links the priority approach to a more general theory of the urban life cycle (Van den Berg and colleagues) in order to understand the processes of population change in this group of countries. The empirical content of the paper comes from the Tallinn metropolitan area (TMA), Estonia. We demonstrate through our analysis how the key metropolitan actors (families, companies, and the public sector) guided metropolitan residential change in the course of the late-Soviet (1980s), transition (1990s), and post-transition (present) decades. First, the priorities of the communist regime shaped the spatial structure of the TMA and the residential changes that have occurred in the post-communist period have been affected by the Soviet-era suburban housing stock and areas available for new developments around the city. Second, the passive attitude of the public authorities after 1991 increased the role of business actors in metropolitan dynamics. We exemplify how the changing balance of metropolitan actors interplays with inherited metropolitan space and shapes the residential choices set for families in the TMA.","[Leetmaa, Kadri; Tammaru, Tiit; Anniste, Kristi] Univ Tartu, Dept Geog, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Leetmaa, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Dept Geog, Vanemuise 46, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",kadri.leetmaa@ut.ee; tiit.tammaru@ut.ee; kristi.anniste@ut.ee,"Leetmaa, Kadri/G-9875-2017; Tammaru, Tiit/AAL-4404-2021; Tammaru, Tiit/I-1679-2018","Leetmaa, Kadri/0000-0002-4418-5022; Tammaru, Tiit/0000-0003-1590-1269;",,,,,79,67,70,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This recognition follows a change in our understanding of the characteristics of the innovation process as a non-linear process and having a systemic character. This changed understanding is also reflected in the movement in policy focus from science and technology (ST) policy towards innovation policy. In recent years, the IS approach has been downscaled from the national level (NIS) to the regional level (RIS), a system's level that has gained the interest of policy makers. There are many rationales for this regionalization of innovation policy. However, as this paper points out, there are several challenges to implement an IS policy on the regional level. Based on a case study of a Swedish regional policy programme, this paper highlights (some of) the challenges related to defining the regional system's domain, implementing functional regions and securing sufficient regional knowledge infrastructure. This paper argues that when the IS approach is put into policy practice and downscaled to the regional level, it stands the risk of losing its strength as a tool for coping with the structural problems connected to innovation and globalization. Based on the identified challenges, the paper is concluded with a number of more general policy implications for IS-based policies with regional intentions.","[Nuur, Cali; Gustavsson, Linda; Laestadius, Staffan] Royal Inst Technol KTH, Dept Ind Econ & Management INDEK, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Nuur, C (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol KTH, Dept Ind Econ & Management, PO Lindstedtsvagen 30, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",Cali.Nuur@indek.kth.se,"Nuur, Cali/K-9298-2019","Nuur, Cali/0000-0001-5912-441X",,,,,51,23,26,2,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

It is argued that in post-socialist countries, where patterns shaped in previous decades still apply and new patterns conditioned by the mechanisms of capitalist society are emerging, the current pattern of segregation can be better understood by referring to specific socio-spatial formations. Localities with concentrations of particular social groups (high and low social status populations, Roma and foreigners) are identified using a press survey, a survey of local government and analysis of census data. The concluding discussion is devoted to socio-spatial formations that represent the most distinct forms of segregation and separation in the contemporary Czechia.","Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Sykora, L (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Prague, Czech Republic.",sykora@natur.cuni.cz,"Sýkora, Luděk/E-9994-2013","Sýkora, Luděk/0000-0002-9880-4650",,,,,72,75,79,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

However, there are national experiences that seem to be hard to explain from this theoretical perspective. In this article we underline that this is particularly true for countries that are characterized by a high degree of internal diversity, such as the Italian case. For this reason we propose to combine the national and regional dimensions, studying what can be defined as a 'regionalized capitalism': a complex and heterogeneous system that entails both remarkable dysfunctions and elements of strength. Analysing the Italian case, we show the importance of centre-periphery relations, which produce a mix of local economic dynamism and national public disorder (public deficit and debt, inefficient policies). At a local level, SMEs and their networks cooperate in a flexible and neo-voluntaristic way to produce territorial competitive advantages: a networked economy based on relational capacities. However, the success of local economies has delayed the adjustment of public policies at a central level. In the last decade, this process has endangered economic development, while Italian firms were challenged by increasing globalization. Drawing attention to the regional dimension, this research approach offers not only useful insights for understanding a single national case study, but also holds broad theoretical implications for the analysis of change and restructuring of advanced economies.","[Trigilia, Carlo] Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociol, I-50127 Florence, Italy; [Burroni, Luigi] Univ Teramo, Dipartimento Sci Comunicaz, I-64100 Teramo, Italy",University of Teramo,"Trigilia, C (通讯作者)，Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociol, Via Pandette 21, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",trigilia@unifi.it; lburroni@unite.it,,,,,,,58,42,44,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The main focus is to model the dynamics of interacting marketing and production strategies. Such models are needed to find the right tradeoff between two general main targets: adopting the product to customer needs and/or communicate the products' features to the market. One essential key factor for a successful product launch is to set up the right product profile, which fulfills the market needs or respectively the needs of the targeted segment. The development process of new innovative products is quite complex and cost-intensive and due a potentially strong competition in most high-tech markets, the companies are forced to launch new products regularly to fulfill the steadily increasing needs of the customers. The model approach presented in this study can be used to determine the optimal product release cycles and to define suitable advertising claims to succeed in highly competitive markets. One considered advertising channel effects all consumers at the same time representing traditional large-area advertising instruments like broadcasting or print media, and a second represents the dispersion of post-purchase information in the customers' social circle-so-called word-of-mouth advertising. Here a model of an artificial consumer market has been used to provide an experimental environment for the simulation and optimization task-modelling typical stylized facts of software business. So the stylized facts are modeled using a hybrid approach of combining a continuous process described by an ordinary differential equation with discrete update processes of cellular automata and further network structures like 'random' and 'scale-free'-networks. The stability of the model is shown by comparing different market scenarios with different communication structures. Additionally the gap between the products features and the advertising claim has been varied to figure out the influence of the resulting dissatisfaction to sales and profit of the companies. It is shown that some exaggeration generates a higher outcome, but due to the word-of-mouth effects too much exaggeration destroys the market at all.","[Woeckl, Juergen] Univ Vienna, Econ & Business Adm, Inst Prod Management, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,,juergen.woeckl@wu-wien.ac.at,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-4-431-87435-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,143,153,,,,,,11,Economics; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Sociology,BLU06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271014200012,0

Our paper considers the problems from a specific point of view; it focuses on the relation between property rights and creativity. If property rights allow the allocation of the majority of standard industrial goods without any special difficulty, however, when they are applied to creative goods, new problems arise. Then, for us, the persistence of a low system of IPRs in the fashion industry does not mainly derive from its efficiency but from the characteristics of the inputs that are used in the creative production process. They constitute strong constraints for defining, entitling, legitimating, enforcing, valuating and exchanging property rights. Thus, the different economic actors develop different kinds of strategic behaviour in order to obtain earnings and can try to protect copyrights, trademarks, new assets, old assets (heritage), private or collective assets, and so on. The institutional characteristics of this specific industry-such as the models of management, the type of ownership, the size of the firms, aEuro broken vertical bar lead to different historical models of management through IPRs. Peculiarly, the financial groups that integrate fashion into the new luxury industries currently try to implement new IPRs and to move towards a stronger system of IPRs but the management model of the street fashion puts an obstacle to this project.","[Barrere, Christian; Delabruyere, Sophie] Univ Reims, OMI, Reims, France",Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne,"Barrère, C (通讯作者)，Univ Reims, OMI, Reims, France.",christian.barrere@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,8,8,1,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Drawing on a survey of 270 Irish dementia caregivers, the hours of informal care per day are estimated using variables of individual characteristics, functional limitations and behavioural problems. This estimation finds that an interlinked work-cohabitation effect significantly predicts the total informal care available and suggests that increasing burden on carers may alter overall welfare. Given conflict in carers' personal priorities, this paper calculates the market value of formal services to inform equitable distribution of dementia care required. By associating proxy-good' market values to dementia symptoms requiring specific types of care, the per diem costs of care are estimated to range from (sic)240.96 (early-stage) to (sic)570.04 (late-stage). As burnout is a major risk factor in prolonged care, this paper indicates the formal value of the output of care from a public health service perspective. Policy initiatives to improve technical and allocative efficiency of formal dementia services are required to reduce reliance on informal care.","Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Trépel, D (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.",,"Trépel, Dominic/J-9292-2014","Trépel, Dominic/0000-0002-1421-2966",,,,,47,9,10,0,7,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

If consumers take some product (e.g., the first product they consider) as the reference point when evaluating others and they exhibit loss aversion, then the more prominent firm whose product is taken as the reference point by more consumers will randomize between a high and a low price. We also find that consumer loss aversion in the price dimension intensifies competition while that in the product dimension softens competition. With consumer reference dependence, asymmetric prominence can arise as an equilibrium outcome when firms advertise before engaging in price competition.","NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Zhou, JD (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, 44 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",jidong.zhou@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,36,40,52,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

A government forecast based on an econometric model is replicable, whereas one that is not fully based on an econometric model is non-replicable. Governments typically provide non-replicable forecasts (or expert forecasts) of economic fundamentals, such as the inflation rate and real GDP growth rate. In this paper, we develop a methodology for evaluating non-replicable forecasts. We argue that in order to do so, one needs to retrieve from the non-replicable forecast its replicable component, and that it is the difference in accuracy between these two that matters. An empirical example to forecast economic fundamentals for Taiwan shows the relevance of the proposed methodological approach. Our main finding is that the undocumented knowledge of the Taiwanese government reduces forecast errors substantially. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Recent research has viewed these events as relational spaces in which countless actors interact and learn spontaneously without a central actor governing the process. In the case of permanent clusters, however, studies have started to unpack the practices through which key actors, such as entrepreneurial and professional associations, stimulate learning and interaction. In this article, we hold that these central subjects also have an important role in activating the benefits of colocalization with regard to temporary clusters. In an empirical study of the European Union clothing fabric trade shows between 1986 and 2006, we identified four types of practices through which trade show organizers shape learning and interaction at their events. Contrary to current views, our study found that exchanges of knowledge at these events do not always occur at the global level. Instead, the geographic scale of the processes of exchanging and acquiring knowledge in temporary clusters is socially and politically constructed at several levels-from the merely local to the truly global. We also found that organizers of trade shows facilitate vertical relationships between exhibitors and typical visitors (i.e., buyers), whereas other knowledge flows are neglected or even hindered. We conclude this article by highlighting the theoretical implications of our study for the literature on the spatial consequences of interaction and innovation.","[Rinallo, Diego; Golfetto, Francesca] Bocconi Univ, Dept Mkt, Ctr Res Mkt & Serv, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Rinallo, D (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Mkt, Ctr Res Mkt & Serv, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",diego.rinallo@unibocconi.it; francesca.golfetto@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,70,56,64,2,65,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Increasing the speed of public transport is also progressive whatever the mode. The most progressive option is to increase the speed of buses in the suburbs, while targeting the metro or the suburban rail are the least progressive alternatives. More generally, low-income individuals benefit more from fare reductions than from increases in public transport speed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The case of Croatia,ZBORNIK RADOVA EKONOMSKOG FAKULTETA U RIJECI-PROCEEDINGS OF RIJEKA FACULTY OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,manufacturing sector; Croatia; types of capitalism; institutions,,"The paper analyses the typology of capitalism in Croatia. The Croatian form of capitalism is specific, in form and origin, with links between the pre-independence and post-independence periods, implying that capitalism has gradually evolved from the political during the eighties towards current clientelistic capitalism. The manufacturing focus aims to facilitate the analysis of institutional, political and economic changes over the past forty years, emphasising the implications of institutional changes which have to a great extent, apart from the war of course, influenced the evolution of capitalism. The paper finds that the transition generated a number of costs, mainly generated by the state (fall in employment, manufacturing and social capital). The claim that the manufacturing industry has inherited low competitiveness neglects the necessary discussion on the role of the state in the formation of industrial policy and market actions. It is also an ex post argument for the claim that restructuring should have been implemented prior to privatisation as this would reduce negative impacts. Institutional changes led to a drastic reduction of the role of the manufacturing sector in the economy. The main finding in this paper is that the change in the interaction between the financial and the real sectors of the economy, the educational system and industrial relations system exposed the vulnerability of the current institutional environment. Despite similarities, institutional advantages of political capitalism are lost in the new type of Croatian capitalism, due to the complexity of the double transition process and the institutional or socio-economic particularities.","[Cvijanovic, Vladimir] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Redzepagic, Denis] Inst Econ Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Cvijanovic, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedy A 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",vcvijanovic@efzg.hr; dredzepagic@eizg.hr,,,,,,,41,19,20,0,19,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The literature on settlement, however, takes no account of models of trial. In this paper, we develop a unified model of settlement and trial expenditures. We do this by discarding the usual assumption of settlement models that trial costs are constant across cases. Instead, we follow the literature on trial by permitting trial costs to vary with the legal merit of the plaintiffs case. Our approach can be used to extend standard models of settlement such as the well-known Priest-Klein model as well as models based on asymmetric information. As a demonstration, we extend the Priest-Klein model and generally overturn that model's canonical results. In particular, we show that even in a fully symmetric model, predicted win rates at trial can deviate substantially from 50 percent. Furthermore, win rates will vary in response to legal reforms that shift the decision standard. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We find that, first, firms with higher quality management and greater growth options are associated with a greater number of antitakeover provisions. Second, firms with higher management quality and a greater number of antitakeover provisions outperform other firms in the sample in terms of post-IPO operating and stock return performance and obtain higher IPO valuations.

Our model departs from the existing literature in that candidates do not exchange policy influence for campaign contributions; rather, they must decide how to allocate their efforts between policymaking and fundraising. If high-ability candidates are better policymakers and better fundraisers, then they will raise and spend campaign funds even if voters care only about legislation. Campaign finance reform alleviates this phenomenon and improves voter welfare at the expense of politicians. Thus, we expect successful politicians to oppose true campaign finance reform.

In addition, the threshold variable for regime switching is formulated as a weighted average of endogenous variables to eliminate excessively subjective belief in the threshold variable decision and to serve as the proxy in deciding which market should be the price leader. The estimation is performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, several meaningful criteria are introduced to assess the forecasting performance in the conditional covariance matrix.

To analyse this phenomenon, we build on the theory by Gabaix (1999 Quarterly Journal of Economics, 94:739-767) that Zipf's law follows (under certain conditions) from a stochastic urban growth process. In particular, Gabaix shows that if urban growth in all regions follows Gibrat's law, we should observe the Zipfian rank-size rule among large cities both at the regional and national level. This theory has never been addressed empirically. Using non-parametric techniques and various definitions of a 'region', we find that Gibrat's law holds at the regional level.

This formulation is ambiguous: one ambiguity concerns the possible existence of a gap between what is true of each worse-off individual and what is true of the group of worse-off individuals, fault or choice-wise, the other concerns the notion of fault. I show that certain ways of resolving these ambiguities lead to counterintuitive results; and that the most plausible way of resolving them leads to a theory of distributive justice in which responsibility plays a role significantly different from that in standard luck-egalitarian thinking. My main conclusion here is that luck-egalitarianism is best formulated as the view that it is [in itself] bad - unjust and unfair - for an individual to be worse off than others if, and only if, her being worse off does not fit the degree to which she is at fault in a not purely prudential sense.","[Lippert-Rasmussen, Kasper] Univ Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Lippert-Rasmussen, K (通讯作者)，Univ Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",,"Lippert-Rasmussen, Kasper/J-1629-2019","Lippert-Rasmussen, Kasper/0000-0003-0950-0215",,,,,17,7,9,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

We analyze a large panel of individual forecasts that has not previously been analyzed in the literature. We provide evidence on the properties of forecasts for all G7-countries and for four different macroeconomic variables. Our results show a high degree of dispersion of forecast accuracy across forecasters. We also find that there are large differences in the performances of forecasters, not only across countries but also across different macroeconomic variables. In general, the forecasts tend to be biased in situations where the forecasters have to learn about large structural shocks or gradual changes in the trend of a variable. Furthermore, while a sizable fraction of forecasters seem to smooth their GDP forecasts significantly, this does not apply to forecasts made for other macroeconomic variables.

Concerning the effects of spillovers, it shows that the density of economic activities contributes mainly to the performance of plants within a short distance and that the composition of economic activities is more influential farther away. Regarding the influence of the local industrial setup, proximity increases the need to be located near different, but related, industries, whereas increased distance implies a greater effect of intraindustry spillovers. The analyses also demonstrate that knowledge flows via the mobility of skilled labor are primarily a subregional phenomenon. Only inflows of skills that are related to the existing knowledge base of plants and come from fewer than 50 kilometers away have a positive effect on the performance of plants. Concerning outflows of skills, the results indicate that it is less harmful for a dispatching plant if a former employee remains within the local economy rather than leaves it for a job in another part of the national economy.","Umea Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Eriksson, RH (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",rikard.eriksson@geography.umu.se,,"Eriksson, Rikard/0000-0003-3570-7690",,,,,81,96,110,2,95,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Moreover, when the differenced series is heteroscedastic, authors commonly model it using an ARMA-GARCH model. The corresponding ARIMA-GARCH model is then used to forecast future values of the original series. However, the heteroscedasticity observed in the stationary transformation should be generated by the transitory and/or the long-run component of the original data. In the former case, the shocks to the variance are transitory and the prediction intervals should converge to homoscedastic intervals with the prediction horizon. We show that, in this case, the prediction intervals constructed from the ARIMA-GARCH models could be inadequate because they never converge to homoscedastic intervals.

The impact of factor of production on the level output is being examined, using time series data RGDP as an aggregate level of output and the inputs of labor, capital accumulation, in addition to two other factors that's believed to have an essential impact on the level of output, (expenditure on educating and life expectancy). Time series have been tested for stationary using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test of unit root, and cointegration test. At the level the test suggests that some variables are nonstationary at first difference the null hypothesis of unit root is rejected and we conclude that the data are stationary at first difference. Cointegration test indicate that the analysis so far only suggests the long-run associations amongst the variables in the analysis. VAR technique was used to examine the variability of the GDP of Bahrain. Important finding of this analysis is that Life expectation, Labor force, EDUR have a significant impact on the level of GDP, and less contribution is found by GCF. The elasticity of output with respect to inputs suggests that the inputs of labour force and capital formation have essential impact on the level of Real GDP, in addition to the life expectancy. Moreover, increasing return to scale is indicated. The more powerful input is the labour force.","[Alezzee, Ibrahem H.] Univ Bahrain, Business Dept, Manama, Bahrain",University of Bahrain,,alezii@yahoo.com,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8640-0,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,1.0,,,,,,372,379,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173400079,0

We present results from a dynamic programming model used to determine the optimal harvest decision for a forest stand in the boreal forest of western Canada that provides both timber harvest volume and carbon sequestration services. The state of the system at any point in time is described by stand age and the amount of carbon in the dead organic matter pool. Merchantable timber volume and biomass are predicted as a function of stand age. Carbon stocks in the dead organic matter pool changes as a result of decomposition and litterfall. The results of the study indicate that while optimal harvest age is relatively insensitive to carbon stocks in dead organic matter, initial carbon stock levels significantly affect economic returns to carbon management.

The argument put forward is that regional innovation benefits from, and is stimulated by, horizontal and vertical knowledge flows and trans-regional networks, enabling firms to benefit from wider knowledge transfers between old and new establishments, large and small operations, and within and across sectors. The empirical study focuses on the Kitchener and Guelph metropolitan areas, referred to as Canada's Technology Triangle (CTT), where a larger number of firms related to information technology (IT) have been successfully launched since the 1970s in the area surrounding the University of Waterloo.

Two dimensions of social capital are investigated-the degree (i.e. size) of individuals' networks of ideation relations, and the structural holes (i.e. gaps between nodes) of those relations. Previous research has presented different and even conflicting empirical results concerning the effect of structural holes on innovation activities, and has not dealt specifically with the ideation phase of the innovation process. By drawing upon an idea database from a Swedish company that has worked systematically with idea management for an extensive period, this study investigates the interrelationship between social capital and ideation. The empirical study reveals that the larger the size of an individual's ego network, the higher is this individual's innovative performance in terms of high-quality ideas, whereas the larger the number of structural holes in an ego network, the lower is the quality of ideas generated by the individual in question. These findings support the conclusion that social capital, in terms of individuals' relationships with fellow employees within firms, has a positive influence on idea-generating behavior. Moreover, the results reveal that the presence of structural holes is negative for ideation performance, thus providing important new input to the recent debate on the interrelationship between structural holes and innovation in general.","[Bjoerk, Jennie; Magnusson, Mats] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Ind Engn & Management, IPD, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Di Vincenzo, Fausto] Univ G DAnnunzio, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Studies, Pescara, Italy; [Mascia, Daniele] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Publ Hlth, I-00168 Rome, Italy",Royal Institute of Technology; G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli,"Björk, J (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Ind Engn & Management, IPD, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",jenniebj@kth.se,"Mascia, Daniele/AAB-9384-2022","Mascia, Daniele/0000-0002-9255-3520; /0000-0002-6024-7908; Bjork, Jennie/0000-0002-9746-4498",,,,,58,36,39,4,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

What is missing, however, is a discussion of what innovation performance of a region or nation means. How do regions or nations exactly contribute to the innovation output of firms? And how can this contribution be investigated in an empirically sound way? We argue that while the literature offers many suggestions, their theoretical foundation is often weak and the underlying assumptions are rarely discussed. In this paper, we systematize various mechanisms by which spatial units influence firms' innovation activities. On the basis of this, common innovation performance measures and analyses are discussed and evaluated. It is concluded that there is no general best way of measuring the innovation performance of spatial units. In fact, the most interesting insights can be obtained using a multitude of different approaches at the same time.","[Brenner, Thomas] Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Broekel, Tom] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands",Philipps University Marburg; Utrecht University,"Brenner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, Deutschhausstr 10, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",thomas.brenner@staff.uni-marburg.de,"Broekel, Tom/K-7048-2014","Broekel, Tom/0000-0003-4516-4626",,,,,61,54,55,4,77,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The methodology used is based on a scenario approach, with real business opportunities created from a connect the dots perspective using the dimensions of the business opportunity prototype presented by Baron and Ensley (2006). The study is experimental with a 2 x 3 design: 2 (scenario A and B) X 3 (business' characteristics: solves customers' problems, positive cash flow and manageable risk) with an analysis between subjects. Results show how individuals use the business opportunity prototype in the two stages of the entrepreneurial process. In both the business opportunity recognition stage, and the decision to launch a venture stage, attention is given initially to manageable risk. The second focus of attention, however, is different: at the recognition stage it is on cash flow (first stage: M Manageable Risk > M Cash Flow > M Solves Customers Problems), and at the deciding to exploit the opportunity stage it is on meeting customers' needs (in second stage: M Manageable Risk= > M Solves Customers Problems> M Cash Flow). These results make an important contribution to our understanding of how individuals recognize business opportunities and how they evaluate the characteristics of those opportunities according to a prototype framework. Risk plays a fundamental role in the analysis and whereas at the first stage money and profit are the second most highly considered factor, when it comes to actually launching the venture (decision making) customers take all the individuals' attention. Entrepreneurship plays such an important role in society nowadays that efforts to understand how business opportunities are recognized are highly relevant. This work provides an interesting contribution to the study of entrepreneurship as it explains how individuals use prototypical dimensions and how this analysis is done at two different stages of the process.","[Costa, Silvia Fernandes; Caetano, Antonio; Santos, Susana Correia] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,,silvia.fernandes.costa@gmail.com; antonio.caetano@iscte.pt; susana.santos@iscte.pt,"Santos, Susana Correia C/W-1489-2017",,,,,,22,0,0,0,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,269,277,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800034,0

The proposed analysis will provide policymakers with the necessary tool to identify the critical areas that should be addressed by future policy action in order to boost short sea shipping on Spain's Mediterranean coast. By applying the proposed method, we will be able to obtain estimates of the subjective values of transport attributes - value of time, value of reliability and value of frequency in freight transport, values for which barely any empirical evidence on a national scale exists.

This paper also analyses the value added of master degree in higher education system. Paper is based on the estimation of tax duty on personal income tax and direct public expenditures into higher education system. The following experimental computations may affect the future higher educational policy. We are close to quantification of the real value added of the study fields from the state point of view. This could lead to changes in funding of higher education institutions.","[Finardi, Savina] Univ Econ, Dept Publ Finance, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic; [Fischer, Jakub] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econ Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Finardi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Publ Finance, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic.",savina.finardi@vse.cz; fischerj@vse.cz,"Fischer, Jakub/J-7874-2012","Fischer, Jakub/0000-0003-4658-1974; Finardi, Savina/0000-0002-4844-6015",Internal Grant Agency of University of Economics [MF/28/2010],Internal Grant Agency of University of Economics,"This paper has been prepared under the support of the project of Internal Grant Agency of University of Economics, Prague, project.

We estimate the impact of socioeconomic and workplace-related variables on union membership by means of Chamberlain-Mundlak correlated random effects probit models, using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. Drawing on the estimates, we project net union densities (NUD) and analyze the differences between East and West Germany, as well as the corresponding changes in NUD over time. Nonlinear Blinder-Oaxaca-type decompositions show that changes in the composition of the work force have only played a minor role for the deunionization trends in West and East Germany. In West-East comparison, differences in the characteristics of the work force reflect a lower quality of membership matches in East Germany right after German unification.","[Fitzenberger, Bernd] Univ Freiburg, Dept Econ, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Fitzenberger, Bernd; Wang, Qingwei] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Fitzenberger, Bernd; Kohn, Karsten] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Fitzenberger, Bernd] IFS, London, England; [Kohn, Karsten] KfW Bankengrp, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany",University of Freiburg; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Fitzenberger, B (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Dept Econ, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",bernd.fitzenberger@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,51,46,47,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The data come from the Spanish National Statistics Institute's Survey on Firms Technological Innovation. The sample is composed by 881 observations referred to firms that have carried out innovation activities in the Basque Country (one of the most developed regions in Spain). The main results show that cooperation, human resources, contingent factors (type of market and industry technological level) and financial resources affect positively R+D activities. At the same time information management, technological resources, contingent factors and R&D have a positive effect on innovation.

Then we explained the evolution mechanisms from the angle of labor division and put forward two concepts: involution of labor division and externalization of labor division. The circulation process includes both involution and externalization of labor division which are opposite processes. Involution of labor division increases administrative costs but decreases transaction costs.

One example is China, which has been the largest international students sending country for over a decade, has now started to regain brain power through design and implementation of policies to attract overseas students to work or start up new ventures in their home country. This paper focuses on Chinese government's policies towards returnee entrepreneurs whose critical role of transferring much needed technology know-how in strengthening the country's innovation capacity have been widely reorganised as key strategic assets by the Chinese government. A set of policies have been developed and evolved over the last decade to promote such type of entrepreneurship. This study traces the origin and development of those policies and summarises the major policy measures that have been introduced at both national and local levels. An initial assessment of the impact of those policies shows the policies are successful in terms of creating awareness among Chinese overseas and they also work well in certain industries and certain cities, but the policies reside on the premises that those who can benefit from such favourable policies need to be verified and approved by government and their businesses also need to be in so-called strategically important sectors. The policies' highly selective nature means a large number of returnee entrepreneurs are excluded from benefiting from those policies and this also further fuel the debate whether the state should be using policy tools to deliberately favour certain types of entrepreneurs in certain sectors than others.","[Liu, Kai] Univ Northampton, Northampton Business Sch, Northampton, England",University of Northampton,,kailiuk@email.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,2,27,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,579,582,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800070,0

The intricate issues concerning plurality of consumer preferences not limited to particularities of mode choice only - paved the way for more elaborated and computationally intensive procedures such as random parameter models that relaxed some strict assumptions inherent to conventional logit estimation. Only recently there have been attempts to address another limitation of the conventional discrete choice models, i.e. assumption on the distribution of random terms. In this paper we explore the magnitude of these limitations by comparing the common estimation procedures with semi-parametric techniques suggested by Fosgerau (2007). To this end we use the data from a recent travel behaviour study conducted on a sample of Czech population travelling between two major cities - Prague and Brno - by any of the three main land transport means - by car, train or bus. We investigate the consequences of the choice of modelling approach on the value of travel time as well as on the value of travel time variability measured by standard deviation of the travel time.","[Maca, Vojtech; Melichar, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Environm, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,,vojtech.maca@czp.cuni.cz; jan.melichar@czp.cuni.cz,"Máca, Vojtěch/P-4525-2016; Melichar, Jan/I-8494-2012; Melichar, Jan/JAN-9040-2023","Melichar, Jan/0000-0003-1688-3752;",,,,,11,0,0,0,5,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-77-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,317,324,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDJ83,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313565200032,0

Nevertheless, foreign research indicates that it is not being dealt with using efficient production technology. This research has not yet been undertaken in the Czech Republic, and therefore the aim of the proposed paper is to evaluate the technical efficiency of Czech organic farms, including determining which factors are causing the inefficiency. A partial aim is also to identify the determining factors in choosing organic production technology. The primary methodological tool for achieving these aims is an analysis using a frontier production function estimated by the maximum likelihood method. The determinants for choosing organic production technology are analyzed by means of an estimation of a probit model, which is also quantified by the maximum likelihood method. These analyses are conducted on the basis of unbalanced panel data from 129 organic and 379 conventional enterprises obtained over the time period 2004 - 2008. Farms, whose data was entered into this database, represent legal entities concentrated primarily on mixed agricultural production. Results of the analyses indicate the inferiority of organic production technology, because they document that conventional producers operate, on average, closer to the frontier production function than organic producers. Moreover, conventional production technology enables all organic producers to increase their production. This inefficiency is determined by the endowment policy of the Czech Republic and the European Union. The completed research documents that subsidies for support of organic agriculture deepen the technical inefficiency of organic producers. However, at the same time, those subsidies are an important stimulus for converting producers to organic production technology. In reaction to these conclusions, the submitted paper suggests changes in the endowment policy which would enable organic producers to increase their efficiency.","Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Malá, Z (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",malaz@pef.czu.cz,"Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021","Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338",,,,,15,17,17,0,22,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Consumer's rights and their perception by individual subjects are the factor which can influence company business strategy in a substantial way. Sometimes it is possible to get an impression that protection of consumer rights is felt more like a brake than an engine of mutual relations between the entrepreneurs and consumers. Consumers are better informed about products, their quality and characteristics and also about problems of products on the market. It is getting harder to hide from the consumer everything which was not a problem 10 or 15 years ago. At the same time permanent pressure on a product price, while keeping their quality and services, makes producers take costly measures which cause, together with continuously growing cost of fuel, that many producers left their existing manufacturing centres and moved towards East. If this was the right measure only future will show. Consumer rights and their perception by consumers, being an important component influencing purchase and sales behaviour of particular participants of market relations, are a fact which can be scarcely discussed about. The level of perception in case of consumer rights is, of course, changing with experience, age and education as well as purchasing preferences of consumers. The aim of this contribution is to present results of a survey focused on analysis of consumer rights perception in a chosen group of respondents. The target group became so called Generation Y, which is a group of respondents about 18 to 26 years old, with necessary intellectual background, expected high level of information technology awareness and ability to learn quickly and react to new inputs. It is possible to find a different kind of surveys about consumer's area but they are usually regarding perception of brands, products, satisfaction with environment etc. Orientation on perception of consumer rights has not been applied yet. Marketing experts, bank institutions, PR managers and employment agencies are all interested in the subject target group called GY.

Probability laws are used in finance to determine the accuracy of measurements and other expressions of magnitudes. Their use is based on the premise that the definition of finance variables and the initial conditions of the random set are based on deterministic laws. In particular, the concept of return, on which finance theories are based, is believed to arise from scientific knowing. Scientific knowing facilitates the application of probability laws. However, research in finance suggests the absence of deterministic laws that prove the existence of scientific knowing. This study argues that the use of probability laws in finance arise from human ignorance of the particulars of individual finance cases. That is, measurements and magnitudes constructed from finance variables should not be given a deterministic interpretation; they should rather be viewed in terms of the universal flux of economic events and processes. For this reason, a universal approach to the construction of finance concepts and principles is recommended.","[Musvoto, S.

While some change initiatives reported success in achieving expected results, a great many conducted to date have failed to meet previously agreed expectations. In order to plan and implement organizational change as effectively and efficiently as possible, managers must be aware of the fact that change initiatives are in most cases accompanied with resistance. Since organizational changes are usually introduced as an alteration of structure, technology and culture, the fear of unknown is somewhat inevitable, and basically immanent to all or at least to majority of people in the organization. However, obstacles can be avoided through careful planning, specifically in the sense of different strategies of motivating employees to accept the change. The overall results of change programs can in larger part depend on the strategy of motivation chosen to facilitate the change process. For that reason, in this paper we conducted a research via questionnaires in order to investigate different material an non-material rewards that young highly-educated Croatian employees perceive as more or less important in accepting the change initiatives, that is, in managing change processes in their firms. Moreover, it has been examined how often firm's in Croatia are conducting various types of organizational changes and whether employees have a say in the organizational changes undertaken. Results have shown that, as an element of the work place material rewards are very important to employees, but when change takes place most of them are more motivated by non-material rewards. We found as well that most of the employees consider that they are not involved enough in the change implementation process and would like to be more involved and more often acknowledged by their superiors.","[Omazic, Mislav Ante; Vlahov, Rebeka Danijela; Klindzic, Maja] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,,momazic@efzg.hr; rvlahov@efzg.hr; mklindzic@efzg.hr,"Klindzic, Maja/C-9268-2018; Klindžić, Maja/U-4270-2019; Vlahov, Rebeka Danijela/I-1893-2018; Omazic, Mislav Ante/H-9222-2018","Klindžić, Maja/0000-0001-7199-9542; Vlahov, Rebeka Danijela/0000-0001-9301-4636; Omazic, Mislav Ante/0000-0001-5704-0108",,,,,27,4,5,0,11,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8641-7,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,2.0,,,,,,10,14,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173500003,0

This study draws on the experiences of students in a corporate entrepreneurship course, employing a mixed methodology that utilises quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. It is in the comparison of the before and after data regarding students' peer review experiences that this study's approach differs from previous work in this area, mostly addressing post-peer review outcomes. While the perceptions of students were positive regarding their experience of the peer review process, there was actually a demonstrable shortfall between the outcomes that they anticipated and those that they perceived at the end of the peer review exercise.

Business ethics pays close attention to the international character of business. The key question is whether or not there is any common set of values shared by all people of all cultural and historical backgrounds. Western multinationals are in practice unable to prevent shoddy labour practices in their overseas factories. The discrepancy between the-what-is and the-what-should-be is probably the main problem in the field of ethics. With this in mind, we have been teaching Business Ethics at the Faculty of Informatics and Management for more than 10 years. The method of teaching which proves to be the most suitable is based on studying and discussing case studies. Students are taught how to approach these problems and that the pursuit of profit should always be ethical. Teaching ethics at FIM UHK is based on basic anthropina, i.e. basic human characteristics, which differentiate humans from other living creatures, as well as on the European philosophical tradition and also on pre-philosophical, non-philosophical as well as non-European philosophical foundations of ethics. We ground our course in traditional ethical concepts and problems (e.g. the origin, essence and function of morality, relations between morality and law, reason and emotion in decision-making and acting, individualism and universalism, subjectivism and objectivism as well as transversalism) and concentrate on the discussed problems of contemporary ethics - mainly business ethics.

In Latin America this shift towards 'codifying culture' began with a series of constitutional reforms during the 1990s which recognized a series of rights of indigenous people and the ratification by many states of the International Labour Organization's Convention 169 on the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples. For many, this regional 'neoliberal multicultural' turn (Hale, 2002, 2006) was not about recognizing rights as such, but rather heralded a series of governmental policies signalling limited acceptance of cultural diversity which ultimately facilitated transnational forms of capitalist accumulation. The limited gains of state-endorsed multiculturalism and the threats posed to indigenous livelihoods by the current commodities boom have encouraged a growing number of counter-hegemonic legal engagements, or legal globalization 'from below', which resort to ever more transnationalized legal pluralities (Santos & Rodriguez-Garavito, 2005). Indigenous people across Latin America continue to judicialize their protests, appealing to legal entitlements, including both 'hard law' (treaty and constitutional law) and 'soft law' (such as the internal norms of multilateral development institutions), in order to claim greater autonomy and protest against the effects of dominant patterns of economic development. Using Boaventura de Sousa Santos's heuristic device of the regulatory and emancipatory dimensions of law (Santos, 1998, 2002), in this article I examine the effects of legal globalization and the appropriation of legal instruments and discourses by indigenous people in post-war Guatemala. Specifically, I highlight the distinct legal frameworks, and conflicting notions of property, development, citizenship and democratic participation and voice at play in recent mobilizations against mining projects.

The objective is to contribute to a field of education with the economic principles and therewith to identify basic fields in an education. Based on the identification of an economic field in the education the research within the education sector was carried out. The Career Center is one of the area at the university that could make more integrative and operational environment for the students. We can define the Career Center as the challenge and the opportunity for universities all over the world. Also, the Career Center may result as the total care for the development of student's careers, the deepening their knowledge and qualifications. The level of student's knowledge and competences can be raised, and thier personality developed. However, the education sector should enhance a human capital also with the support of the new activities in the education. The fact that the human capital is not important only for the one human being and that relates to the whole society is the crucial point that we have to be concerned with while we analyze the meaning of the education.

This paper is focused on identifying the essential characteristics of technology transfer and its aim is not only to assess the current situation and level of technology transfer in the South Moravian Region but also to find out whether there are any barriers to its further development and eventually to specify possible solutions. The key findings are the problems that can be seen in the present system supporting the technology transfer with the fact that these problems have ultimately a national rather than regional character.

Mobile marketing provides the tools for a very precise, one-on-one communication between companies and consumers, which can be integrated in their marketing mix in order to attract and satisfy the needs of a new generation of consumers. Mobile marketing instruments can provide the necessary client satisfaction by establishing both a direct and bidirectional communication form to the costumer, but also the promise of an honest and personal approach.

By the existing results in the evolutionary graph theory (EGT), we then find that stock corporations (SCs) are more stable than MDCs while MDCs are more stable than CIDs.","[Zhou, Ai-nong] Guangzhou Inst Railway Technol, Dept Econ Management, Guangzhou 510430, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,,,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,,978-3-642-23022-6,COMM COM INF SC,,,2011,208.0,,1.0,,,,1,7,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BXA64,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295545200001,0

The divergent territorialization is analyzed by broadening the concepts of global pipelines and local buzz to the context of developing countries. The research is based on a large-scale survey conducted in 2006-2007 in three mega-city regions of China: Beijing, Shanghai-Suzhou and Shenzhen-Dongguan. The research found not only marked regional differences in industrial structure, ownership, export-orientation and technological investment, but also a surprising convergence of technological dynamism among foreign and domestic firms within each region. The data established an unmistakable negative association between transnational corporation-led export industry and technological investments. Beijing-the least foreign-oriented region-outperformed all others by a substantial margin in all measures of technological dynamism, highlighting the importance of indigenous R&D for domestic capital and for attracting technology intensive foreign capital.","[Zhou, Yu] Vassar Coll, Dept Earth Sci & Geog, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA; [Sun, Yifei] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Geog, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Wei, Y.

Although a welfare-improving network can emerge as a technically stable or unstable equilibrium, one that decreases welfare is always formed by a technically unstable equilibrium. However, the adverse welfare effects of a network and its corresponding type configuration may persist because ex post high-type entrepreneurs prefer to stay high type whereas those who wish to become high type may need some time to react.","[Bac, Mehmet; Inci, Eren] Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey",Sabanci University,"Bac, M (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey.",bac@sabanciuniv.edu; ereninci@sabanciuniv.edu,"Inci, Eren/B-6010-2012","Inci, Eren/0000-0001-8990-9672",,,,,41,6,8,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

A significant number of these migrants have successfully applied their entrepreneurial flair in establishing small enterprises and employing workers, often to the envy of their local counterparts. This paper presents the findings of an empirical study conducted in 2007 on job creation for South Africans by African immigrant entrepreneurs, including face-to-face interviews with 120 African immigrant entrepreneurs. These findings were triangulated with 7 non-governmental organisations that interact with immigrants in Cape Town. A review of the literature on migration, entrepreneurship and immigrant entrepreneurs formed the basis for the study. The findings indicate that more than 80 per cent of African immigrant entrepreneurs interviewed employ South Africans in their businesses. Despite a generally negative national perception of immigrants, this study has also revealed that entrepreneurial skills are transferred from immigrant entrepreneurs to their South African employees. While the study was conducted only in the suburban areas of Cape Town, the researcher believes that the results represent the general trend in South Africa. Further, the study involved only migrants from the African continent. The overall result is an acknowledgement of the contribution that non-citizens are making to the country's growth and development. The findings include recommendations relevant to policy changes on South African immigration law, to inclusive research on the role of immigrants in job creation in South Africa, and to the need for consideration of immigrant entrepreneurs in the allocation of financial support.","[Visser, Kobus] Univ Western Cape, Sch Business & Finance, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,,,,,,,,,38,46,61,1,27,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"RM EMS 4-51, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

A quantitative study was done, by interviewing sixty spaza shop owners in the township. The empirical results identified the gaps in the management abilities of spaza shop owners in terms of the eight management functions and show that the purchasing, financial and information management function are the most neglected. Guidelines on how each of the functions could or should be applied are given.

We use the bias-corrected bootstrap based on two alternative bias-correction methods: the bootstrap and an analytic formula based on asymptotic expansion. We also propose a new stationarity-correction method, based on stable spectral factorization, as an alternative to Kilian's method exclusively used in past studies. A Monte Carlo experiment is conducted to compare small-sample properties of prediction intervals. The results show that the bias-corrected bootstrap prediction intervals proposed in this paper exhibit desirable small-sample properties. It is also found that the bootstrap bias-corrected prediction intervals based on stable spectral factorization are tighter and more stable than those based on Kilian's stationarity-correction. The proposed methods are applied to interval forecasting for the number of tourist arrivals in Hong Kong.

However, this negative response has prevented geographers from engaging constructively with the World Bank's analysis and proposals.

In addition, this paper establishes two empirical stylized facts. Specifically, most predictors for output growth lost their predictive ability in the mid-1970s, and became essentially useless over the last two decades. When forecasting inflation, on the other hand, fewer predictors are significant, and their predictive ability worsened significantly around the time of the Great Moderation.

Decentralization in high income countries has, if anything, been linked with a reduction of regional inequality. In low and medium income countries, fiscal decentralization has been associated with a significant rise in regional disparities, which the positive effects of political decentralization have been unable to compensate.

Data from 504 questionnaires linked to 81 family businesses were collected and analysed. An Oblimin oblique rotation was carried out on the principal components of the exploratory factor analysis. Five factors with eigen-values greater than one, explaining 62.64 per cent of the variance, were extracted. These five factors describing the theoretical dimensions of the dependent variable were: the senior generation owner-manager's readiness to let go, and the independent variables of retirement planning, perceived suitability of the successor, estate planning, and the perceived liquidity of the business after the transfer. No significant practical differences relating to these five factors could be found between the perceptions of male and female respondents, the senior and younger generation family members or family members involved in medium-sized or small businesses. Practical recommendations are suggested to ensure a smooth final transfer of the management and control of the business to the younger generation family members.","North West Univ, Potchefstroom Business Sch, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"van der Merwe, S (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Potchefstroom Business Sch, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",,,"Van der Merwe, Stephan/0000-0001-8361-5139",,,,,67,3,4,0,15,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Party choices provide incentives to the politicians who represent them. Depending on whether politicians are opportunistic or partisan, we identify four effects. First, a selection effect: intraparty competition gives parties more candidates to choose from. Second, an incentive effect: intraparty competition adds a hurdle and impacts on candidates' incentives. Third, a trust effect: because of the incentive effect, intraparty competition is a signal to uninformed voters. Finally, with partisan preferences, an ideology effect appears. Ideology is a public good in a competitive party and induces free riding. lntraparty competition is valuable when voters are badly informed or intraparty competition is weak.

More disagreement (due to, e.g., fundamental uncertainty) increases the value that players attach to control. The article shows that all income and control of a project should then be concentrated in one hand: income rights should go more to people with more control since such people value income higher (because they have a higher opinion of the decisions made); control rights should go more to people with more income since they care more (and believe that they make better decisions). Different projects may be optimally owned by different people. Furthermore with residual income exogenously allocated complementary decisions should be more co-located, whereas substitute decisions should be more distributed.

The empirical analysis exploits a unique panel dataset of the Italian manufacturing sector at the regional and industry levels. We explore whether FDI and firm agglomeration can be drivers of total factor productivity (separately and jointly), with this effect being robust to different estimators, and different assumptions about inter-regional effects. In particular, we isolate one form of firm agglomeration that is especially relevant in the Italian context, industrial districts, in order to ascertain their impact on productivity. In so doing, we distinguish standard agglomeration and localization economies from industrial districts to understand what additional impact the latter has on standard agglomeration effects. Interaction effects between FDI spillovers and different types of agglomeration economies shed some light on the heterogeneity of regional development patterns as well as on the opportunity to fine tune policy measures to specific regional contexts.","[Menghinello, Stefano] Ist Nazl Stat ISTAT, Direz Cent Stat Econ Strutturali, I-00100 Rome, Italy; [Menghinello, Stefano; Driffield, Nigel] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [De Propris, Lisa] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Aston University; University of Birmingham,"Menghinello, S (通讯作者)，Ist Nazl Stat ISTAT, Direz Cent Stat Econ Strutturali, Sede Via Anagnina,Via Cesare Balbo 16, I-00100 Rome, Italy.",menghine@istat.it,,"De Propris, Lisa/0000-0002-1476-1674",,,,,53,40,43,2,54,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) are the main countries of origin of issuers, and stock exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Luxembourg are the main destinations involved in the process. We use a comprehensive data set for these home and host markets for the end of 2008 to explore the intensity of foreign listings, the subnational geography of cross-listed firms, and the destinations of foreign listings. Cross-listing firms tend to be relatively large and come from capital-intensive, export-oriented, and high-growth sectors. Trading links with and industrial specialization of the host markets affect the choice of destination markets. These patterns, however, are not universal across countries. There is a high concentration of cross-listed firms in the leading financial centers of the BRIC countries, particularly in Russia and Brazil. Firms outside of the leading centers rarely cross-list, and when they do, they enter second-tier host markets. While BRIC countries have a large potential for further foreign listings, the process remains politically sensitive. Our results highlight the shortcomings of the literature on cross-listing in economics and the significance of the cross-listing phenomenon to future research in financial geographies.","[Wojcik, Dariusz] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; Univ Oxford, St Peters Coll, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Wójcik, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",dariusz.wojcik@spc.ox.ac.uk; csaba.burger@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Burger, Csaba/JBI-7138-2023","Burger, Csaba/0009-0003-9566-6410; Wojcik, Dariusz/0000-0003-2158-284X",,,,,42,25,33,0,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Between 1995 and 2006 Irish gross national product increased from 60 per cent of the EU average to 110 per cent. Real incomes increased across the income distribution during this period but income inequality between the top and bottom income deciles increased marginally. This paper examines whether socio-economic differentials in Irish perinatal mortality rates changed between 1980s and 2000s. This task is complicated by demographic change in Ireland since the 1980s and its interaction with the birth registration process. Overall perinatal mortality rates have fallen from 14 per 1,000 in 1984 to 7 per 1,000 in 2006. Without adjusting for demographic change, differentials between professional and unskilled/unemployed groups have decreased from 1.99 to 1.79.

The result was a range of policies based on an unwarranted over-optimism which left Ireland terribly exposed to the international downturn.

Additionally, gift cards for the discount retailer Wal-Mart exhibit less price dispersion than other large retailers' gift cards, consistent with the perception that greater search by price-sensitive shoppers can lead to less friction in markets.","[Pate, Jennifer] Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA; [Chiou, Lesley] Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA",Loyola Marymount University; Occidental College,"Pate, J (通讯作者)，Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Econ, 1 LMU Dr,Suite 4200, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA.",jennifer.pate@lmu.edu,,,,,,,17,5,5,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Efficient and equitable urban transport policies are essential to China's sustainable development, in which urbanization plays a critical role. Can Chinese cities solve these challenges by copying or modeling the policies of other nations? This paper argues that understanding the unique contexts of Chinese cities is necessary for predicting whether policies implemented elsewhere will perform well in China. The study explores four examples of hotly contested urban transport policies. The previous experience of each policy is compared with its likely efficiency and distributional consequences in China. Specific attention is paid to how the policy context - the spatial and institutional characteristics of the Chinese cities - can affect the adoption of foreign urban transport policies in China. Suggestions regarding the four policies are proposed to policy makers, followed by conclusions and discussions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The study examines access to the health care system in a community characterized by social and economic variance. The data have been taken from a health survey carried out in a suburb of the city of Zaragoza in Spain. The sample (1,032 people over the age of 15) was selected according to specifications of sex, age, and place of residence. The sample shows a confidence interval of 95.5 percent with a +/- 3 margin of error. Descriptive and inferential statistical techniques are used. Sex differences are reflected in social conditions, lifestyles, health perception, and health care behaviors. The research describes how differences in health attitudes can be contextualized by the neighborhood. The results of this type of research are essential for the design of preventive strategies that are better adapted to need.","[Gil-Lacruz, Marta] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza 50006, Spain; [Gil-Lacruz, Ana I.] Autonomous Univ Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",University of Zaragoza; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Gil-Lacruz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, C Alfonso X el Sabio 4,6 D, Zaragoza 50006, Spain.",mglacruz@unizar.es; ana.gil@uam.es,"Lacruz, Ana Isabel Gil/AAI-8302-2021; Gil-Lacruz, Marta/M-6242-2019","Lacruz, Ana Isabel Gil/0000-0002-7994-923X; Gil-Lacruz, Marta/0000-0001-8261-058X",,,,,49,17,20,0,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

A fair agent cares to some extent for the well-being of other people and thus he also cares for the principal. Therefore, if the agent performs individual work, the principal is always better off to hire a fair agent. However, we show that when a third party with conflicting interests is introduced, it may be advantageous for the principal to hire a selfish agent. The reason is that the selfish agent will be a tough bargainer not only when negotiating his employment contract with the principal but also when dealing with the third party, for example, when selling the principal's product to a buyer.","WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,"Lammers, F (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany.",frauke.lammers@whu.edu,,,,,,,24,5,6,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

If the defendant did not go into exile, then the trial continued with additional arguments presented. If the judges voted to convict, the sanction of death was imposed. Given the limited set of feasible sanctions available to the Athenians, it is argued that this institution is effective as it separates some guilty from the innocent.

Analytical investigation shows that the dynamic properties of the Venables model are significantly affected by the presence of spillovers. In particular, the own-cost reduction effects at low transport costs can be so strong that runaway agglomeration dynamics appear in a manner consistent with the black hole concept found in the literature. However, due to the decay of information over space, these black hole dynamics are endogenous to the model and disappear when transport costs are high enough. Importantly, the location predictions obtained in simulations of the model are consistent with the empirical finding that industrials sector that benefit from spillovers are typically more agglomerated than sector that do not benefit from such spillovers.","Observ Francais Conjonctures Econ, Dept Res Innovat & Competit, F-06560 Valbonne, France",,"Barde, S (通讯作者)，Observ Francais Conjonctures Econ, Dept Res Innovat & Competit, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",sylvain.barde@ofce.sciences-po.fr,"Barde, Sylvain/AAF-3768-2020","Barde, Sylvain/0000-0003-1465-8236",,,,,23,1,1,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The demand of the product is represented by fuzzy numbers with triangular membership function. The holding and shortage cost parameters are considered as imprecise and also represented by triangular fuzzy numbers. As the selling season draws closer, suppliers lead times shortens and thus production costs increase. In contrast, caused by the oncoming selling season, demand fuzziness decreases and more accurate demand forecasts can be maintained that lead to lower overage/underage costs. The objective of the model is to find the best order period and the best order quantity that will minimize the fuzzy expected total cost.

The method AHP was published already in 1980s whereas FVK is a newly created tool enlarging application possibilities of the AHP. Both methods provide a mathematical support to human decision making process in many areas. They can be supportive for decision making in problems like buying a new car, buying a house, which could be a task for a private person, but this decision making methods could be also useful as a supportive tool for institutions. Just to give a support for solving a problem like selecting a new employee, how to lead marketing campaign or how a specific policy would influence voters. In short, both methods are based on defining decision criteria and variants in a logical hierarchy. In a process of structuralization of the problem we firstly decompose the decision problem analytically from the upper to the lowest level and then synthesis follows in evaluating the decision variants and eliciting the best one. We apply this multi-criteria methodology to the problem of a portfolio manager decision making when selecting the best possible instrument on the financial market for his use. This decision making method is useful because the portfolio manager is not able to evaluate too many parameters at the same time and objectively rank candidates.

This is characterised by a historical and geographical stratification, with an emphasis on the congruence of economic and social geography in Dharavi. His analysis is conducted primarily at the community level. In this commentary the reader's attention is drawn to the livelihood strategy approach, which originated from the rural context but is also relevant in the slum setting. Such an approach could be useful in documenting the dynamic of slums and of the households that inhabit them. But households are just one of the actors in this struggle for space. Also making an appearance are public authorities, NGOs and businesses, each with a claim to the same space. At the same time, the struggle is played out at several levels and is imbedded in the local situation, which makes comparative and longitudinal research an interesting way to define the place of slums and their inhabitants.","Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Druijven, P (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",p.c.j.druijven@rug.nl,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

On the other hand, we investigate the conditions under which the first four moments of the distribution of the stock returns are able to provide information about the future direction of change. From this perspective our analysis is realized in the lines of Christoffersen and Diebold (2006) and Diebold and Yilmaz (2007). We found that the market fir the most liquid assets listed at the Bucharest Stock Exchange is not efficient at the highest frequencies and becomes efficient as we reduce the frequencies. We also found evidence that for certain frequencies the sign is dependent on the mean in the previous period return and the first four moments hold some autocorrelations with their lags at some high frequency levels.","[Lupu, Radu; Dumitrescu, Sorin; Dumitrescu, Dan Gabriel] Acad Econ Studies, Dept Int Business & Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Lupu, R (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Dept Int Business & Econ, 6 P Ta Romana,Sector 1,5, Bucharest, Romania.",radu.lupu@rei.ase.ro; sorin.dumitrescu@rei.ase.ro; dandumiase@gmail.com,"Lupu, Radu/AAZ-5907-2020; DUMITRESCU, DAN GABRIEL/O-3101-2016; Lupu, Radu/H-4389-2014","DUMITRESCU, DAN GABRIEL/0000-0001-7839-3164; Lupu, Radu/0000-0002-2231-1753",,,,,17,0,0,0,7,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The analysis is based on regional employment data (NUST 3) in Slovakia at the 2 digit NACE classification. We start with a brief overview of the theoretical and empirical literature dealing with the subject of the spatial distribution of economic activities. Main question is to uncover to what extent the structure of the regions changes over time and how the industrial composition influences their evolution. Many studies in the regional economics literature consider the issues of industrial specialization of regions and spatial concentration of industries as two sides of the same coin. The models in empirical studies which focus on regional specialization and industrial concentration follow the ideas of traditional or new trade theories and location theories. These concepts suggest that the growth should be derived from economic specialization based on competitive advantage. On the other hand, when the economy of the region becomes more diversified, it becomes less sensitive to fluctuations caused by factors outside the region. In the empirical part of the paper we study the main characteristics of the regional industrial shifts and explore the main changes that have occurred during the period 1997 - 2008. We analyze the process of spatial concentration of the industries with a specific focus on regional specialization in Slovakia. Besides the basic statistical analysis we also calculate several indexes to document processes of spatial concentration and regional specialization.","[Rehak, Stefan; Stofko, Michal] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Publ Adm & Reg Dev, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,,stefan.rehak@euba.sk; miso.stofko@gmail.com,"Rehak, Stefan/AAL-7063-2021; Rehak, Stefan/AHA-4234-2022; Rehak, Stefan/AAT-7795-2020","Rehak, Stefan/0000-0003-2503-3979",,,,,17,0,0,0,3,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-180-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,196,207,,,,,,12,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BGW05,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000324343700016,0

We incorporated protection costs and timber product values in this system to evaluate economic aspects of spruce budworm control. The analysis allows pest managers to evaluate the degree to which the traditional volume protection priority objective corresponds to three economic criteria, namely the Volume protected per dollar protection program cost, the benefit-cost ratio of the protection program, and the net present value of the protection program. Twelve alternative spruce budworm protection strategies were analyzed on Crown License 1 in New Brunswick and Prince Albert Forest Management Area (PAFMA) in Saskatchewan, based on a number of protection program extents and intensities. For both landbases under base-case market conditions, the largest, most intensive protection scenario provided the highest amount of volume saved and net present value (at 3.94Mm(3) and $39.98M for PAFMA, and 4.04 Mm(3) and $41.49 M for License 1, respectively) while smaller, less-intensive programs provided the highest benefit-cost ratios and volume protected per present value dollar of protection cost (at 8.22 and 0.52 m(3)/$ for PAFMA. and 10.26 and 0.65 m(3)/$ for License 1, respectively). Sensitivity analysis on product values and protection costs revealed that smaller, less-intensive programs could also produce the highest net present values when costs are higher and/or product values lower. These results highlight the conditions under which pest managers should consider deviating from their traditional strategy of maximizing volume saved to one that maximizes the economic returns of protection.

Two data-driven methods are used for the evaluation - entropy method and principal component analysis. They were chosen because they both are non-parametric but they differ in weight calculation. The same set of criteria will be used for both methods and the results will be compared in order to estimate the effect of the chosen method. Since both methods are static, average data from 2004-2007 will be used to compensate for temporal changes.

The service sector became considered as a sort of development index for economy, society and general civilisation level. The development level of service sector affects not only the economic growth rate and the competitive edge of national economies, but also secures a high standard of living and social security for the nations. The fast developing economies get more and more dependent on efficient generation, acquisition, diffusion and application of knowledge The application of knowledge and use of information is becoming the main factor of international competition and consequently of wealth creation and living standards improvement. In order to facilitate this process, it seems necessary to pay special attention to the development of services, especially the knowledge-supporting ones.

Focusing on the labour market, we study how a firm's labour supply augmenting investment affects the equilibrium when oligopsonistic firms set wages. Relative to a non-strategic benchmark, optimal investment strategies involve boosting investment that leads rival employers to cut wages, but involves cutting back on investment that causes the latter to increase their wages. Implications of existing labour market policies for strategic investment are also discussed. Finally, the model is generalised to nest wage and employment competition and is extended to include other types of investment.","[Dewit, Gerda; Leahy, Dermot] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",Maynooth University,"Dewit, G (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",Gerda.Dewit@nuim.ie; Dermot.Leahy@nuim.ie,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Using a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy, we explore the economic viability of hydrogen transportation in several different tax and carbon stabilisation policy scenarios. For each scenario, various combinations of hydrogen fuel price and vehicle mark-ups are used as inputs to explore what technological improvements in terms of cost reductions Would be necessary for the technology to penetrate the market. The effect of introducing reduced-carbon fuel substitutes, such as ethanol-blend fuels, on the economic viability of hydrogen transportation is also explored. Hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles could make a significant contribution to decarbonisation of transportation if production of hydrogen itself is not carbon-intensive. For those involved in hydrogen research, this analysis provides cost targets that Would need to be met for hydrogen transportation to be economically viable within the next century. Cost targets needed for the technology to penetrate in the USA are such that the hydrogen fuel would need to be in the range of 1 to 1.7 times the 1997 price of gasoline and the vehicle mark-up of an average fuel cell automobile would need to be no more than 1.3 to 1.5 times an average conventional vehicle.","[Reilly, John M.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Reilly, JM (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E19-411, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jreilly@mit.edu,,"Karplus, Valerie/0000-0001-5493-9150; Paltsev, Sergey/0000-0003-3287-0732",,,,,28,8,8,0,19,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Many sociological studies, by contrast, consider social network structure as an embodiment of various forms of social capital, including the creation of obligations, information channels, and enforceable trust (Coleman 1988; Portes and Sensenbrenner 1993). When firms hire by referral, social network segregation can lead to labor market segregation (Tilly 1998). Various social network structures may arise from the actions of self-interested individuals (Watts and Strogatz 1998; Jackson 2006); by incorporating concepts of social capital into an economic framework of profit-maximizing firms, this article develops a model of labor markets in which segregation arises endogenously even though agents are homogeneous and have no dislike for each other. Firms hire through referrals, and can enforce discipline by bribing a referrer to prevent a hiree from getting any outside job offers from other friends if he or she shirks. This is possible only if social networks are reasonably closed, so that the referee knows a majority of his or her friends' friends. By segregating into small communities, workers can more effectively create closed social networks. Social networks with different reservation wages will receive different wages; firms can induce such segregation and wage discrimination in the interest of profit. Workers may not benefit from such segregation, except as a best response to being in a society where it already exists; the friends in these social networks act as a worker discipline device, and in this way treat each other inimically.","Long Isl Univ, Dept Econ, Brookville, NY 11548 USA",Long Island University Post,"Barr, T (通讯作者)，Long Isl Univ, Dept Econ, CW Post Campus,720 Northern Blvd, Brookville, NY 11548 USA.",tavis.barr@liu.edu,,,,,,,52,5,5,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

By reducing fertility and promoting growth, both birth policies may achieve higher welfare than conventional education subsidies financed by income taxes. A birth tax for education subsidies can achieve the first-best solution. The welfare gain of the first-best policy may be equivalent to a massive 10-50% rise in income, depending on the degree of human capital externalities and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.","[Zhang, Jie] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Shi, Yuhua] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Ctr Econ Res Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Zhang, Jie] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",National University of Singapore; Australian National University; University of Queensland,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",ecszj@nus.edu.sg,"SHI, YH/HLG-1159-2023; Shi, Yun/JWP-3360-2024; SHI, YAN/HNI-1042-2023",,,,,,41,5,6,4,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

In the last years, both the number of LGVs and their participation in accidents significantly increased. The improvements evaluated include the installation of active speed limiters with two different set speeds, electronic stability program (ESP) systems, digital tachographs, event data recorders (EDR), seat belt reminder and seat-belt lock systems, and implementation of a professional driver training program. The monetary evaluation of the various safety measures has been done using cost benefit analysis (CBA). The CBA has been carried out by means of B/C ratios and includes a sensitivity analysis, as well as a computation of the cost per life saved and the payback period. Our results indicate that speed limiter set a the lower speed, a professional driver training program and devices to increase seatbelt wearing are economically justified and should serve as the core of safety improvements for LGVs. These results remain robust even if large changes occur in the unit costs or in the safety effects of these measures.","[Toledo, Tomer; Hakkert, Shalom] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Transportat Res Inst, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Albert, G (通讯作者)，HIT, Dept Technol Management, Holon, Israel.",gilaa@technion.ac.il,"Toledo, Tomer/B-7296-2015","Toledo, Tomer/0000-0003-3611-6024; Albert, Gila/0000-0002-9351-4750",,,,,30,0,0,0,7,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Different kinds of responses of the public authorities are assessed, whether financial ones at the risks of huge deficits, allocation of road space to public transport at the risks of reducing overall transport speed, or charging for road use in urban areas. Modelling exercises, assessment of ongoing schemes, efficiency issues as well as acceptability issues are considered in order to discuss the relevance of this last option.","[Bonnafous, Alain; Raux, Charles] Univ Lyon 2, CNRS, ENTPE, Lab Econ Transports, F-69363 Lyon 07, France",Universite Lyon 2; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bonnafous, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon 2, CNRS, ENTPE, Lab Econ Transports, 14 Av Berthelot, F-69363 Lyon 07, France.",alain.bonnafous@let.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr; charles.raux@let.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,3,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Drawing upon the philosophical writings of Michael Polanyi and an original case study of e-learning in Cisco Systems, the paper challenges the widespread argument that ICT-mediated communication is inadequate for the sharing of tacit knowledge. The main conclusion is that advanced e-learning systems-particularly remote laboratories-make possible efficient sharing of tacit knowledge between internationally dispersed technicians. However, successful knowledge-sharing depends crucially on the degree to which the users are motivated to acquire new knowledge online. Motivation can be facilitated through the participation in online networks of practice, but in order to access and benefit from these networks people require a certain threshold level of technical relevant knowledge, which is the most easily generated in local communities of practice.","[Hildrum, Jarle Moss] Univ Oslo, Ctr Technol Innovat & Culture, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Hildrum, JM (通讯作者)，Work Res Inst, Pb 6954, N-0130 Oslo, Norway.",jarle.hildrum@afi-wri.no,,,,,,,62,40,46,0,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,,,IND INNOV,Ind.

As the development of the financial sector in Europe's emerging markets is largely dependent on foreign investments, explicit attention is directed towards emerging centres that exhibit sufficient power to attract multinational financial service firms. In addition, it is empirically assessed from which locations these investments are controlled. The results show a distinct spatial order of financial centres organised around three main city clusters: a 'south-east' cluster controlled by Athens, a 'central-east' cluster controlled by Vienna and a 'Baltic' cluster controlled by both Copenhagen and Stockholm. Based on these results it is argued that these centres of control, and Vienna in particular, may enhance their competitiveness as a financial centre due to their strategic position in the growing markets of Central and Eastern Europe.","Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Karreman, B (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",karreman@few.eur.nl,,,,,,,20,20,22,0,17,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Under U.S. law, an enforcement agency may challenge any anticompetitive aspect of the merger and the consequent delay associated with litigation would impose costs on the firm. These costs may give the enforcement agency leverage to extract a settlement even when the firm would prevail in court. This paper explores whether the FTC's decisions to challenge transactions approximate the case law. We find that the representative enforcement regimes of the FTC and the courts are remarkably similar, although the FTC credits efficiencies, while courts consider buyer sophistication as a mitigating factor.","[Coate, Malcolm B.; Ulrick, Shawn W.] Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA",,"Coate, MB (通讯作者)，Fed Trade Commiss, 600 Penn Ave, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",mcoate@ftc.gov,,,,,,,21,8,8,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

J,"Devlin, A",,,,"Devlin, Alan",,,THE STOCHASTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATENTS AND ANTITRUST,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; POWER; PRESUMPTION; COPYRIGHT; MONOPOLY,"This article develops a novel theory by which to construe the interaction between the patent and antitrust laws. The rules of these respective disciplines are often portrayed as conflicting in means, yet harmonious in purpose. Although the intellectual property and antitrust laws have ostensibly divergent views on the role of competition, their interaction is typically limited to one of constraint. More specifically, antitrust rules have been (poorly) designed to limit the exclusivity inherent in a patent grant to the claimed invention alone. This article, however, articulates a new vision for the role of antitrust: it posits that competition rules operate as a stochastic regulator of exclusionary patent rights. The Sherman Act constrains patentees' efforts to positively transform the probabilistic nature of their intellectual property rights through contract. Yet, because the empirical calculation of optimal innovation rates is an elusive, if not Sisyphean, task, the normative desirability of the foregoing fact is abstruse. Nevertheless, policymakers' inability to pinpoint precisely the ex post rewards required to trigger ideal levels of ex ante investment need not bind our hands to inaction. If contemporary rates of innovation are deemed acceptable (even if not necessarily perfect), there may be ways to trigger equivalent levels of ex ante investment with lower social cost. In this regard, it is clear that currently enacted competition rules significantly accentuate the uncertainty surrounding patents' apotropaic effect. Concluding that contracts securing otherwise stochastic rights may be highly desirable, the article calls for the incorporation of this concern into contemporary rules, with modest substantive effect, and further advocates a qualified antitrust immunity for gold-plated patents if and when they are introduced.","Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Devlin, A (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",Alan.Devlin@lw.com,,,,,,,112,4,4,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Utilising the Living in Ireland Survey data we model the impact of costs (direct and indirect), the estimated life cycle returns, environmental and parental influences and also household credit constraints on the higher education participation decision. We find that foregone earnings and youth employment rates have a negative impact on this decision; this suggests weaker labour markets for young people may have a positive impact on higher education participation. The insignificance of credit constraints in the shape of household income and maintenance grant eligibility from our estimations can also help draw some tentative policy conclusions.

The results highlight the role of a firms internal resources as crucially important in the access to external knowledge, i.e. to absorption capacity. As such, the external resources in clusters are exploited and combined in different ways according to a firms internal resources. In addition, evidence is presented of a synergistic effect from the interaction between a firms internal and relational resources. These results support the idea that absorptive capacity is crucial to the effective exploitation of external know-how and to obtaining benefit from complementarities between internal and external resources.

Much of this debate focuses at the scale of the nation-state, or of the whole globe, and, while often sophisticated in an ideological sense, is scant in terms of consideration of the 'grounded' outcomes of the processes and discourses of globalisation. This paper argues that an appreciation of the contingent economic geography and political economy of any given local and regional transformation is essential for understanding the outcomes of economic globalisation. In order to illustrate this, the paper analyses two regional non-traditional agricultural export (NTAX) complexes in the highly globalised Chilean economy. By focusing on 'hotspots' or 'globalised spaces' at the regional and local scales we are able to cut through the rhetoric associated with generalised arguments for and against economic globalisation and illustrate that both the roots and impacts of the insertion into global commodity complexes are highly geographically contingent. Our analysis concludes that NTAX development in Chile over the past 25 years has radically restructured local and regional economies, has concentrated wealth 'extra-regionally', has exacerbated social differentiation, and threatens environmental sustainability. We argue that policy that seeks to address these trends requires more grounded consideration of the complex and uneven geography of economic globalisation that does not privilege analysis at any one scale and that seeks to elucidate the links between the 'global' and the 'local'.","[Barton, Jonathan R.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Estudios Urbanos & Territoriales, Santiago, Chile; [Murray, Warwick E.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Inst Geog, Wellington, New Zealand",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Victoria University Wellington,"Barton, JR (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Estudios Urbanos & Territoriales, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",jbarton@uc.cl; warwick.murray@vuw.ac.nz,"Barton, Jonathan/E-8512-2011","Barton, Jonathan/0000-0001-6250-8684; Murray, Warwick/0000-0002-2597-3779",,,,,57,29,33,0,26,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In particular, it aims to uncover the contextual factors influencing the design of MAS that would enhance managerial performance in Egyptian hospitals. The proposed research framework utilizes the premise of contingency theory to identify the contextual factors that may influence the use of MAS; namely organizational strategy, technology, structure, external environment and size. The mediating role of MAS on the impact of managerial performance will also be examined through the extent to which managers use the four information characteristics associated with the design of MAS: scope, timeliness, aggregated and integrated. This will provide clarity in linking the perceived usefulness of MAS information characteristics to managerial performance that has been viewed as problematic by past studies. Further, the proposed research framework seeks to provide invaluable insight to the literature regarding performance implications of MAS design and functionality, especially within the health care sector. The Egyptian hospital industry is chosen as the ideal setting to investigate this relationship because of its complexity and continuous inept administration despite years following its reform.","[Hammad, Salah A.; Jusoh, Ruzita; Oon, Elaine Yen Nee] Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,,shammad2005@yahoo.com,"Hammad, Salah/JJF-2975-2023; JUSOH, RUZITA/B-9646-2010; Oon, Elaine Yen Nee/B-3929-2009","JUSOH, RUZITA/0000-0002-8561-4743; Oon, Elaine Yen Nee/0000-0001-9692-7350",,,,,100,0,0,0,9,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"INST TENAGA, BANGI 43600, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-942-923-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,469,492,,,,,,24,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBC87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306479500022,0

The information provided by the management accounting systems (MAS) is also claimed to be obsolete and unable to compete in the condition of intense competition, thus, should be modified to be in line with the increasing competition and advancement in technology.

The choice and development of the right relationship is not easy and the knowledge about the perception of both partners from this dyadic relationship may be a good base for elimination of mutual barriers that could imply improvement of the relationship. Many aspects from this field may be examined; the main goal of our article was to research attitudes (specifically their emotional part) of Slovak and Czech enterprises towards particular stakeholders that can reflect one dimension of the relationship. To obtain basic information about the attitudes we interviewed 115 micro and small enterprises from the Czech and Slovak Republic, out of which 54 were micro companies and 61 were small companies. The method of semantic selection test was adopted for the purpose of this research. We used correspondence analysis to provide structural and quantitative information about the relationships of the respondents towards particular types of stakeholders. In our article we present information about the situation in the Slovak Republic, in the Czech Republic and a comparison of both countries under study. We found out that there were not notable differences between both countries. The most positive attitudes were expressed towards customers, employees and academic centres, the most negative ones were towards competition and state and local administration authorities. Other future research might reveal the background of negative attitudes with particular stakeholders, their reasons, and after obtaining this information it would be possible to recommend solutions how to change the perception, eliminate barriers and subsequently improve relationships and develop a stakeholder strategy.","[Petrovicova, Janka] Univ Mateja Bela, Ekon Fak, Katedra Ekon & Manazmentu Podniku, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Kasparova, Klara] Masaryk Univ, Ekon Spravni Fak, Katedra Podnikoveho Hospodarstvi, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Matej Bel University; Masaryk University Brno,"Petrovicová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Mateja Bela, Ekon Fak, Katedra Ekon & Manazmentu Podniku, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",janka.petrovicova@umb.sk; klarad@econ.muni.cz,"Taborecka, Janka/ABA-6774-2021; Kasparova, Klara/D-4660-2018","Taborecka, Janka/0000-0003-4351-782X; Kasparova, Klara/0000-0002-0411-9223",,,,,42,1,1,0,12,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

I have also shown the necessity of reinventing the business processes and I have characterized the common elements of the new processes resulted after the reengineering, concentrating myself on the impact over the improvement of the organizations' performance. Extremely relevant is the fact that to improve a certain process, it is necessary, first of all, to measure its performances through estimating the satisfaction of the involved parts' interests, as well as the results of all the participants to the process. I have presented the four categories of measurements regarding the performance of the process and respectively the alignment to objectives, the conformation with the standards (measurements for productivity), the costs and the process duration (measurements regarding its efficiency).","[Todorut, Amalia Venera; Cirnu, Doru] Constantin Brancusi Univ, Targu Jiu, Romania",Constantin Brancusi University,,amalia_venera@yahoo.com; doru.cirnu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,304,310,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS70,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984000049,0

We find that in-house R&D makes substantial and significant contributions to productivity growth in Chinese manufacturing industries, and that technology transfers, whether foreign or domestic, have no significantly positive effects on productivity growth. When the productivity growth is decomposed into technical efficiency change and technological progress by using Data Envelopment Analysis, we also find that the important role of R&D in improving industry performance is mainly attributable to the contributions of R&D to technical efficiency change.","[Wu, Yanbing] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Econ, Beijing 100836, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,,wyb1229@163.com,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,2,CHINA WATERPOWER PRESS-CWPP,BEIJING,"6 SANLIHELU, FUXINGMENWAI, BEIJING, 100044, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5084-6533-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,95,111,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNO72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275143800012,0

A member state encountering a loss in its benefits caused by a decision made by majority voting may now demand compensating transfers by using the right of withdrawal. It might threaten to leave the EU if the compensation is denied. Hence, does this mean that member states now have regained a negotiation power comparable to the right to veto?

The results show that firms take the strength of, and distance to their interorganizational relationships, as well as regional characteristics, into account when determining the distance of their relocation search. They provide empirical validation of the importance of external resources in the resource-based view of firms.

J,"Currie, G; Delbosc, A",,,,"Currie, Graham; Delbosc, Alexa",,,Understanding bus rapid transit route ridership drivers: An empirical study of Australian BRT systems,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bus Rapid Transit; Ridership; Service level; Public transport infrastructure,SUCCESS,"Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems are an increasingly popular public transport option internationally. They provide rail-like quality for bus services for a fraction of the cost of fixed rail. Many claims of high and increasing ridership have resulted from BRT system development: however, it is unclear exactly which aspects of BRT system design drive this. This paper explores whether BRT design features, among other influences, significantly increase ridership above and beyond the impact of service levels. It does so using a series of regression models undertaken on 77 BRT and non-BRT bus routes in Australia which is known for its diversity in BRT route design. Explanatory variables used included service level, frequency, speed, stop spacing, share of segregated right of way, vehicle accessibility, employment and residential density, car ownership levels and BRT infrastructure quality. Five models explored the role of these variables. Two models found that service level dominates predictions of boardings per route km although they suffer from endogeneity. Further models control for this influence by modelling boardings per vehicle km. Overall results suggest that some BRT infrastructure treatments such as right of way have a significant impact on ridership but the influence of infrastructure is within the context of high service levels. The role of accessible vehicles has also been highlighted in this research, although more research is needed to clarify this influence. The paper concludes with a discussion of the various influences on ridership and recommendations for existing policy and future research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Such non-recurrent traffic congestion amounts to 10% of total traffic congestion in the U.S. and 31% in Germany. Non-recurrent traffic congestion has been estimated by using the capacity and the number of closed lanes in work zones and the upstream traffic demand of work zones. However, the number of the closed lanes may be insignificant due to operational strategies such as using the shoulder area and composing additional lanes by temporarily reducing the existing lane width to mitigate traffic congestion. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a method to quantify non-recurrent traffic congestion caused by freeway work zones based on traffic flow data and spatio-temporal work zone information. In addition, to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed method, a case study is conducted based on one-year historical traffic data and work zone data on major freeways in Korea. Then, multivariate statistical analysis with unobserved heterogeneity is performed to describe factors of non-recurrent traffic congestion caused by work zone activities. Due to the fact that a work zone project is usually implemented according to schedule, such negative impact as non-recurrent traffic congestion is inevitably produced. Thus, the results can be practical for the performance evaluation of congestion management programs for work zone by quantifying non-recurrent traffic congestion. Additionally, the results from the statistical analysis can be potentially useful in developing a forecasting model for providing travelers with traffic information such as an alternative route to escape non-recurrent traffic congestion by freeway work zones.

In such a legal system, the courts seek a double objective: maintaining job positions through continuation, and determining the best outcome for the claimants. We discuss this dilemma empirically, using a unique sample of bankruptcy files on French SMEs. We address successively three critical questions. First, we highlight the determinants of the final bankruptcy outcome (continuation through reorganization or sale, or piecemeal liquidation): does continuation (the most employment-friendly outcome) depend on the firm's characteristics, and/or on the way the procedure is managed? Second, we study the determinants of the creditors' recovery rates: do the courts play an active role in increasing recoveries? Third, we address the dilemma directly by focusing on sales as a going concern. We model the court administered selection process between rival buyout offers: do the courts balance the social content against the financial content of each offer? Is there an explicit arbitrage between employment preservation and creditor recoveries? Our main results are: (1) the French courts actively work to facilitate continuation against liquidation, and thus play a role in employment preservation. Besides, we find continuation is more likely to prevail when default is an outcome of specific difficulties (outlets, finance, and production). (2) We confirm the Radulovic (2008) findings: the global recovery rate mainly depends on the firm's ex ante characteristics at the time of triggering, while the way the procedure is managed by the court has little impact. Similarly to LoPucki and Doherty (2007), continuation via reorganization does not generate lower recovery rates on average than the other outcomes. (3) Last, the courts' choice between rival buyout offers confirms that social considerations prevail in the arbitration. Yet, the courts still consider financial issues as well (a higher sale price increases the chances that an offer is selected), but without clear connection with the amount of due claims (one direct consequence is a moderate recovery rate on sales).

Colleges that in the 1970s had some moderate expectations for faculty research activity changed their names to universities, started doctoral programs, and now require faculty to produce significant research publications for tenure or promotions. Other schools moved from expecting minimal evidence of research to requiring publications in major journals. Where business faculty used to be professionally qualified by running consulting businesses, they now have to obtain doctorates and publish research work on a regular basis. Unasked is whether the proliferation of researchers and their output is desirable.

The first two contentions are untrue, and the question of whether individuals make 'rational' decisions as judged by the axiomatic definition of neo-classical economic theory is vestigial to the ideas and policy prescriptions of classical liberal and libertarian political economy. The paper, fraught with definitional confusions and methodological difficulties, is a superior example of how correct empirical observations and laudable advancements in identifying cognitive characteristics that may be relevant to economic analysis can lead to unsound theories due to methodological deficiencies. Policy prescriptions in the long run must take an institutional form; the greatest deception of the paper lies in its omission of any discussion on such an institution, which, I believe by logical necessity would be a Platonist autocratic bureaucracy.

We build probit models to investigate the further decline in government ownership after listing. We differentiate between share issuance, where state ownership is diluted as a result of rights issues and seasoned equity offerings, and government divestment. We find evidence that share issuance results in the dilution of state ownership in the highly profitable and leveraged firms that rely more on subsidies, while assets growth has a negative effect. The issuance decision is timed to occur when stock market conditions are favorable. Chinese authorities tend to sell part of their shares in the smaller and unprofitable firms reporting higher sales growth. Variables capturing the size of managerial incentive problems do not play an incremental role after controlling for firm performance.

They were accused of colluding to reduce the coverage levels of their plans. Between March 2002 and March 2003, they reduced the coverage offered from 100 percent for hospitalization and 80 percent for ambulatory care to 90 percent and 70 percent, respectively. These facts were undisputed, but, logically, the mere observation of parallel conduct is not enough to infer collusion. In this article, we analyze the merits of the accusation and find strong support for it. We first present evidence on the definition of the relevant market (that excludes the public insurer) and the presence of entry barriers. We then present a simple model of imperfect competition that gives some testable predictions to separate the hypotheses that insurers colluded to reduce coverage and the one-argued during the trial by the insurers-that the coverage reduction was a competitive reaction to a cost shock. We then present econometric evidence consistent only with the hypothesis of collusion: The accused insurers reduced sales efforts and marketing expenses relative to the non-accused insurers, the monthly transfer rates of insurees among accused insurers decreased during the period of the alleged agreement relative to the rate of the non-accused insurers, and profits of both accused and non-accused insurers increased after the coverage reduction.","[Agostini, Claudio A.] ILADES Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Econ & Negocios, Sch Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Alberto Hurtado,"Agostini, CA (通讯作者)，ILADES Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Econ & Negocios, Sch Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile.",agostini@uahurtado.cl; saavedra@uahurtado.cl; mwilling@uahurtado.cl,"Willington, Manuel/ABD-8214-2020; Saavedra, Eduardo/IQS-4264-2023; Agostini, Claudio A./HLG-7336-2023; Willington, Manuel/H-4035-2018","Willington, Manuel/0000-0002-2803-6641; Saavedra, Eduardo/0000-0002-2842-2526; Agostini, Claudio A./0000-0002-3916-1501; Willington, Manuel/0000-0002-2803-6641",,,,,22,4,4,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

For high crime regions, the crime rate in one locality is negatively influenced by the crime rate of the other. The magnitude of the displacement depends on the distance between the two regions and on their relative size. For given sized neighbors, a closer distance implies greater displacement. When one region is larger, relative to the other, this increases the displacement, holding distance fixed. Examples show that the displacement from the treated to the adjacent areas can be small, if the relative size of the former is small. Nonetheless, the displacement can be large for other nearby areas, provided that the treated region is relatively big. Neglecting this result can cause an upward bias at the estimated impact of a policy. We also analyze the consequences for the design of public policies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To do so, we assemble data on the ethnicity and performance of each student in all classes at two law schools - for three years at one, and for 16 years at the other. Although these schools enrolled a smaller fraction of African-Americans than most law schools, they are located in states with a much smaller fraction of African-Americans than in the United States as a whole. There is also a large amount of variation in the percent African-American across classes. At these schools, we find no consistent evidence that having additional students from one's ethnic group raises a student's performance.

Disequilibrium is normal and space/time an emergent feature. This approach is very different from geographical economics. Mutual engagement is desirable and most easily approached via the geographical sub-field of regional political economy.

These findings have important policy implications for media markets where regulators are considering imposition of a la carte pricing.","Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Richard T Doermer Sch Business, Dept Econ, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA",Purdue University System; Indiana University Purdue University Fort Wayne,"Adilov, N (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Richard T Doermer Sch Business, Dept Econ, 340 Neff Hall,2101 E Coliseum Blvd, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA.",adilovn@ipfw.edu,,"Adilov, Nodir/0000-0002-9616-0433",,,,,15,0,0,1,10,LAWRENCE ERLBAUM ASSOC INC-TAYLOR & FRANCIS,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT STREET, STE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0899-7764,,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

While previous studies have revealed that the public is willing to give priority to particular groups of patients based on their personal characteristics, the present article goes beyond previous efforts in attempting to explain these results. In the present study, there was strong support among respondents for giving equal priority to people regardless of their personal characteristics. However, respondents did reveal a preference for married patients over single, for children over adults, for carers of children and the elderly, sole breadwinners, and good community contributors. Further, they would give a lower priority to those perceived as self-harmers-smokers, individuals with unhealthy diets, and those who rarely exercise. Variation in the answers according to broad economic and social beliefs across seven different categories (factors) influenced the pattern of the public's attitudes towards rationing. The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicated that most of the items in our survey are associated with seven factors that explain or capture much of the variation. These relate to a patient's avoidance of self-harm behaviors (Safe Living), their Life Style (diet, exercise, etc.), their contribution to the community through caring for others (Caring), their talents (Gifted), their sexual behavior (Sexuality), their age and marital status (Family), and whether they are an Australian citizen or employed (Citizen). The strength of social preferences-e.g., how strongly respondents would discriminate against a recreational drug user or preference a person with a healthy diet-is related to the particular class of preferences.","[Anderson, Malcolm; Richardson, Jeff; McKie, John; Iezzi, Angelo; Khan, Munir] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Anderson, M (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",m.anderson@unimelb.edu.au; jeff.richardson@buseco.monash.edu.au; john.mckie@buseco.monash.edu.au; angelo.iezzi@buseco.monash.edu.au; munir.khan@monash.edu,,"Richardson, Jeff/0000-0002-4248-4280",,,,,23,10,10,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Social entrepreneurship involves individuals and groups that create independent organisations in mobilising ideas and resources to address social needs. A focus on strategy in this context becomes paramount, as it can give a long-term direction to social enterprises and resolve some of its long-standing issues such as the position of social enterprises in being largely regarded as only suppliers to the state, often providing services for people. In this respect, a strategic framework is produced regarding aspects of mission, decision making power, profit distribution, effectiveness of service delivery and benefits for the local community. Methodology-wise the paper is based upon work that can be identified within the geographical context of Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch, in Dorset, South West of England. It is based upon conduct of qualitative research including semi-structured interviewing, collection of secondary data and observations of local social enterprises. It is anticipated that potential research outcomes would include: specific strategic practices in the way social enterprises operate and deliver services.

The key assumption is that project-orientation is a core competence in changing organizations. In order to illustrate this, we will focus on universities as engines of change and innovation by analyzing the project-oriented university model. There is a significant concern for exploring the project management maturity models. Several professional associations have developed project management maturity models: Project Management Institute has developed the Organizational Project Management Maturity Model, whereas Association for Project Management has launched the PRINCE2 Maturity Model. Some theoreticians consider that maturity models can be a very useful tool assisting organizations in becoming more flexible and competitive (Kerzner, 2005). Others think that project management maturity models are indispensable to the development of organizations (Gareis, 2005). The project-oriented university, though strongly linked to the project-oriented organization model, is a new model. Literature dedicated to it was inaugurated in 2007, when we signaled the emergence of the project-oriented university as a feasible alternative to the Humboldtian university. In order to explore the causal relation between project-orientation of universities and their change and innovation capabilities, we are going to follow three steps. First, we will evaluate the project-management maturity of three Romanian. Second, we will assess each university's preparedness for change and innovation. Third, we will seek correlations between the innovative capacity and the project-management maturity of the universities. The scores obtained by the Romanian universities for innovation capacity and project orientation represent accurate predictors of the competitiveness and dynamism of Romanian higher education. They form the starting point of initiatives towards the promotion of the project-oriented university as an organizational model that would allow universities to respond to change, and the development of an adequate culture of innovation and of projects in universities. If project-orientation is validated as a core competence of changing universities, we can see two important implications. First, we will observe a scholarly urgency towards further developing the conceptual framework of the project-oriented university model. Second, an organizational revolution in higher-education can be started, in the sense that universities would make the shift towards project-orientation in order to survive and thrive under circumstances of complexity and constant change. The project-oriented university model is new and research dedicated to it is at the very beginning. The aim of the model is to provide the university with the necessary means of conceiving a coherent response to external inputs. In our opinion, this is a new and feasible model for higher education institutions, a model that views maturity in project management as a means of enabling development and of increasing organization's (i.e. university) chances to cope with multiple transformations in the external environment.",,,,alina.bargaoanu@comunicare.ro; loredana.calinescu@comunicare.ro; elena.negrea@comunicare.ro,"Busuioc, Elena Negrea/M-1305-2016; Vladu, Loredana/IWD-4800-2023; radu, Loredana/AAP-9854-2020","Busuioc, Elena Negrea/0000-0001-5590-6852;",,,,,9,1,1,0,13,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,473,476,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000119,0

The economic and social impact of the demographic ageing of population in Europe forces European policy makers to encourage firms to increase research and development on new products and services which provide social benefits to the senior population. We hereby present findings based on two exploratory studies which were funded by the European Commission. The first one captures through non-participative focus group observation the perceptions of high-tech innovations of 15 senior consumers. The second study consists in a series of semi-structured interviews with 50 technology enablers in order to better understand the firms' approach in developing high-tech innovations for senior consumers.

Our research focuses on the SNCF company with 160.000 railworkers. It is a bureaucratic structure (Weber 1971, Mintzberg 1982 and Alter 1995, 1996). The SNCF activities concern various sectors such as freight, equipment, infrastructure and travelers in France and Europe. The company faces a large number of challenges in this context of openness to competition. We analyze the Participative Innovation routine that has deeply changed since the 1990s although a routine in the literature is considered to be stable (Nelson and Winter, 1982; Cohen and al., 1996). Our questions include how this Participative Innovation routine has changed so deeply ? How could a suggestion system limited to the field maintenance become one of the pillars of the SNCF's strategic plan, called Industrial Project ? Since 2005 this routine has become a tool of communication both internally and externally as part of the campaign Ideas ahead (des idees d'avance), which became a part of the SNCF company's identity. We rely on the methodological approach by Barley and Tolbert (1997) since 1990 to understand the different steps of an organisational routine's transformation through the notion of script.

We show that this routine has changed and we describe its interrelations with the SNCF company.

Their goals are often aimed at an outside audience of tourists, investors and potential (high income) residents. While the target may be external, the ways in which these spaces are perceived by the local population is an important, and, as yet, under-researched, area. Many scholars suggest that flagships have a negative impact on cities, but their research stops short of asking local residents what they think themselves. This paper attempts to redress this imbalance in the literature by analysing a survey of residents' perceptions towards the Kop van Zuid in Rotterdam, a large waterfront regeneration project. The survey included residents in different neighbourhoods across the city to determine the roles played by spatial proximity, and socio-economic and demographic variables. Responses were more positive than expected, particularly among poorer residents in the vicinity of the flagship. We argue this has to do with the quality of life enhancements which the Kop van Zuid has brought. This can offer some insightful lessons when regenerating brownfield sites in the future.","[Doucet, Brian; Van Kempen, Ronald; Van Weesep, Jan] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Doucet, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",b.doucet@geo.uu.nl,,,,,,,46,36,37,4,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In new economic models of industrial corporations, like automotive ones, the inter-transportation system is considered as an important factor alongside production, knowledge, budget, and human resource. In this article an approach for solving logistic problem in an automotive corporation has been developed by means of a multi-objective linear programming model. The main question is the optimized way of delivering sold cars by trucks to customers who are scattered in different parts of the country, and in various cities. The aim of this article is to propose an answer in order to minimize the transfer costs and also the customers' time of receiving their new car, and each car has a priority to be delivered to a customer.

We show that the term structure of interest rates is a static function that relates the term to maturity to the yield to maturity for a sample of bonds at a given point of time. We also short describe four mainstream theories attempt to explain the shape of the yield curve. The yield curve is a basic instrument for understanding the relationship between the interest rate of bonds and the maturity of a financial instrument. It has the same relevance for all economic subjects in the form of interest rates determination. Estimation of the term structure discussed in the paper involves obtaining zero coupon interest rates, or discount functions from a set of coupon bond prices. The bootstrapping method is used here to determinate the particular zero coupon interest rates of bonds, where the method consists of iteratively extracting zero coupon interest rates using a sequence of increasing maturity coupon bond prices. Using these rates it becomes possible to derive interest rates for all maturities by making a few assumptions including linear interpolation as we discuss in conclusion of this paper. The particular spot and forward zero coupon interest rates resulting from the bootstrapping method can be used as input in different economic categories like financial management, portfolio management, actuary science, company valuation, management of firm value, financial risk management, etc. The matrix approach derived and described in this paper can be used instead of solving the zero coupon rates sequentially for obtaining a direct solution with particular zero coupon rates. This helps us to diminish the computing severity related to the sequential determination of interest rates using an iterative approach. Fortunately, however, the application of matrix theory helps us to solve this issue very well.","Tech Univ Koeiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia",,"Glova, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Koeiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia.",jozef.glova@tuke.sk,"Glova, Jozef/Z-2482-2019","Glova, Jozef/0000-0001-5972-7771",,,,,15,1,1,0,5,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Such new behavioural business market statistics can be used for several analyses in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of business and network processes, as companies are now able to compare with other companies and the data describing the whole network is available. In this paper, two concepts of such analyses - benchmark and network performance assessment - are proposed. Both concepts are based on data related to procurement procedure of companies. First proposed concept - benchmark indicator - assesses, whether procurement procedure is conducted in proper way concerning supplier's competition aspect. Second proposed concept - network performance indicator assesses, whether the network supply is adequate to network demand.","[Janke, Frantisek] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,,frantisek.janke@tuke.sk,"Janke, Frantisek/K-1558-2014; Janke, Frantisek/AAH-3715-2019","Janke, Frantisek/0000-0002-2688-3505",,,,,12,5,5,0,5,UNIVERSITATSVERLAG RUDOLF TRAUNER,LINZ,"KOGLSTR 14, 4020 LINZ, AUSTRIA",,,978-3-85499-873-0,SCHRIFTEN INFORMATIK,,,2011,36.0,,,,,,341,348,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYL01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299185000035,0

The adoption of measures of global and local spatial autocorrelation has recently been suggested as a way of introducing a more explicit spatial approach to studying segregation. This paper uses two of those measures - Moran's I and Getis and Ord's G* - to explore segregation of the four main ethnic groups in Auckland, New Zealand's largest and most multiethnic city, at the four most recent censuses held there. They are used to identify the clusters of census reporting units (meshblocks) where each group is significantly over- and under-represented, and to chart the degree of segregation within such clusters.","[Johnston, Ron] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; [Poulsen, Michael; Forrest, James] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",University of Bristol; Macquarie University,"Johnston, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England.",R.Johnston@bristol.ac.uk; mike.poulsen@mq.edu.au; jforrest@els.mq.edu.au,,"Forrest, James/0000-0002-1103-5757; Johnston, Ron/0000-0003-3031-8573",,,,,30,33,34,3,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We analyse key institutional developments that frame the emerging European Higher Education Area and synthesize their influences on higher education in transition countries. With increased importance of knowledge for competitiveness of European businesses the traditional 'public good' paradigm is being replaced by a 'marketable goods' view. As university business schools in transition countries are particularly exposed to competition in the business education market and serve as key business knowledge providers to future generations of managers, we present a consistent model for the requisitely holistic and strategic management of business education institutions that enables managers to better align their institution with the challenges of an increasingly competitive market in business education.","Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Jurse, M (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",milan.jurse@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,52,3,3,0,19,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

These measures are focused on the effect of the aviation to the climate change which is strictly related to the energy consumption. In previous studies by the author a systems approach was adapted to energy systems in the industrial and residential sector (two of the three major sectors of energy consumption). It has been proven that it is possible to detect gaps in the structure of energy systems and to choose appropriate interventions that can lead to sustainable energy management. A similar approach will be presented as a framework for the energy management in the aviation.

This text is focused mainly on the problem of support of mobile processes, but the possibility to transform selected static processes to the mobile ones can be also considered. Business process modelling is based on visual models well understandable for all people participating in the process of business analysis. Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) is widely used tool for business modelling. The article first discusses BPMN's ability to deal with mobile business processes and introduces some suggestions for its extension in order to describe and mark better mobility in business process modelling. The second part of the article introduces basic terminology of the area and the next one analyses different aspects of mobility (time, location, position context). Useful mobile extensions of BPMN, like positional events, mobile activities, mobile participants etc. are developed at the end of the article.","Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informatiky & Managementu, Katedra Informatiky & Kvantitativnich Metod, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Kozel, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informatiky & Managementu, Katedra Informatiky & Kvantitativnich Metod, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",tomas.kozel@uhk.cz,"Kozel, Tomas/R-3592-2019","Kozel, Tomas/0000-0002-7008-0523",,,,,12,1,1,0,8,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The central question in the analysis is the extent to which regional actors have embraced a new type of investing. To explore this question, the paper looks at the distribution of syndication ties, that is, patterns of co-investment among venture capital firms. In particular, the analysis explores patterns of syndication and network structure among venture capital firms to identify not only the extent of syndication but also cliques and clusters among syndication partners. The analysis utilizes an extensive database consisting of venture capital disbursements and investments in the Philadelphia region from 1980 to 1999. The paper finds that the use of syndication among Philadelphia venture capital firms was limited in nature. Although Philadelphia venture capital firms syndicated extensively with venture capital firms from outside the region, syndication among partners tended to be highly parochial. In addition, the emergence of a dominant clique of venture capital firms is documented, and their impact is discussed.","So Illinois Univ, Dept Management, Coll Business, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Mote, J (通讯作者)，So Illinois Univ, Dept Management, Coll Business, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",jmote@cba.siu.edu,,"Mote, Jonathon/0000-0003-0203-3992",,,,,35,1,1,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Recently many urban streets or entire districts were converted into 30 kph zones and in many European countries the maximum permissible speed of trucks on motorways is under discussion. However, besides contributing to traffic safety, reducing the maximum speed is also seen as beneficial to the environment due to the associated reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions. These claims however are often unsubstantiated. To gain greater insight into the impact of speed management policies on emissions, this paper examines the impact on different traffic types (urban versus highway traffic) with different modelling approaches (microscopic versus macroscopic). Emissions were calculated for specific types of vehicles with the microscopic VeTESS-tool using real-world driving cycles and compared with the results obtained using generalized Copert-like macroscopic methodologies. We analyzed the relative change in pollutants emitted before and after the implementation of a speed reduction measure for passenger cars on local roads (50-30 kph) and trucks on motorways (90-80 kph). Results indicate that emissions of most classic pollutants for the research undertaken do not rise or fall dramatically. For the passenger cars both methods indicate only minor changes to the emissions of NOx and CO2. For PM, the macroscopic approach predicts a moderate increase in emissions whereas microscopic results indicate a significant decrease. The effects of specific speed reduction schemes on PM emissions from trucks are ambiguous but lower maximums speed for trucks consistently result in lower emissions of CO2 and lower fuel consumption. These results illustrate the scientific uncertainties that policy makers face when considering the implementation of speed management policies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Within this context, standardized management systems represent a powerful control instrument of any organization's activities. But when developing and implementing standardized management systems, it is important to quantify the changes that the implementation will produce upon the processes in particular and the system in general. This turns out to be even more important if it is considered that changes will affect the short term productivity and create uncertainty within the system. With respect to this, the authors propose a mathematical model that enables one to asses and compare management systems regarding their complexity, by taking into consideration two main parameters: structural complexity and data complexity. In order to verify whether the model is capable of producing relevant and consistent results, a case study has been carried. Therefore, three companies from the services domain were chosen, with respect to the European Commission's criteria regarding small and medium enterprises.

The results from research in ICR are usually relevant for several firms (e.g. results related to new norms and standards).

In social sciences a movement can be found related to the successes and developments of natural sciences the ideal of social sciences was to imitate the natural sciences' mathematical methods. But since Durkheim, Dilthey, Weber, Gadamer and others, the social sciences have been based on a fundament different from natural sciences and even superior to them. In my article I'd like to show the relevance of wellbeing for economics, point to the objective and subjective approaches to wellbeing, the efforts to quantify it and criticize these attempts from the verstehen (understanding) point of view.

The statistical analysis of these data pointed at an economic life in the vicinity of 18,000 h for both harvesters and forwarders, which confirms previous assumptions. The average annual use for the machines in the database is 1424 and 1581 h year(-1), respectively for the harvesters and the forwarders. Nordic users achieve a higher annual use than central European users, and the difference is statistically significant. Nevertheless, the average annual use recorded for both groups falls below the levels commonly adopted in current estimates, which may therefore represent ideal reference figures rather than actual averages. Residual value is strongly related to machine age, and the authors calculated some simple functions for estimating it. The study points at a better retention of the original value, compared to the figures reported in previous literature. At 5 years of age the harvesters and forwarders in the study keep respectively 38% and 44% of the new value. The information contained in the study is crucial to machine rate calculation, which has often been based on rule-of-thumb assumptions, in the absence of empirical data.

The Beveridge curve is used as the main description of labor market performance in the paper. Beveridge curve implicitly depicts a negative relationship between the rate of unfilled job vacancies and the unemployment rate and so it can properly link related creation of new job vacancies and the unemployed. In recent years, labor markets were affected by the financial and consequently economic crisis that resulted in an increase in unemployment in the most EU Member States. Quarterly Eurostat and OECD data were used for the analysis of labor market performance. It is clear from the analysis that the economic crisis had the greatest impact on labor markets in the Baltic countries. It was also found that the crisis hit more men and low-skilled labor force with pre- and primary education. Another finding is that shifts of individual Beveridge curves correspond to shifts of the theoretical Beveridge curve.","[Tvrdon, Michal] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm, Dept Econ, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,tvrdon@opf.slu.cz,"Tvrdon, Michal/J-4806-2012","Tvrdon, Michal/0000-0001-9029-883X",,,,,18,4,4,0,3,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",1792-7331,,978-960-474-269-1,INT CONF BUS ADMIN,,,2011,,,,,,,38,43,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYQ67,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299796300006,0

Yet, in most universities engineering studies still feature only conventional methods of learning. By comparing results of different surveys that have been performed to measure the readiness of students to participate in an eLearning offer and experiences with students obliged to actually participate in an eLearning courses, their preparation for active participation in Life Long Learning is observed. The results show that students inexperienced with new forms of learning are restricted in their capability to participate in innovative qualification offers. Therefore, it is necessary to familiarise young engineers during their university education with different methodologies for learning, thus imparting an indispensable key competence to involve in Life Long Learning and contribute to quality and innovation in their later vocational work.","[Werner, Teresa; Weckenmann, Albert] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,,teresa.werner@qfm.uni-erlangen.de; albert.weckenmann@qfm.uni-erlangen.de,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIV CLUJ-NAPOCA,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"28 MEMORANDUMULUI STREET, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400114, ROMANIA",,,978-973-662-614-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,231,236,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDA57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312344600052,0

The report lays out a series of policy responses to spatial unevenness that are intended to mobilize the growth-enhancing advantages of unbalanced development while ensuring inclusive development. However, the report mobilizes a narrow view of economic development that is disconnected from place, politics, and society. In geography, which lends its name to the report, economies are theorized as embedded-as produced in and through space, rather than merely on it. Geography and spatial patterns are constitutive coproducers of political-economic processes, not just outcomes. I elaborate how a critical geographic understanding of an everywhere embedded economy (Peck 2005) highlights the inseparability of economic processes from the social, political, historical, and geographic contexts which give them meaning. I connect the idea of embedded economy to a consideration of centrality of care to a humane and inclusive development. I argue that the report's emphasis on labor mobility as a key mechanism for enhancing development ignores the global division of care work that is itself built on the invisibility and undervaluation of care in mainstream versions of economic development. I conclude that thinning borders will not resolve questions of inequality but rather will allow those who are more powerful to exploit the resultant power differentials expressed in migration and care deficits across the globe.","Univ Washington, Dept Geog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Lawson, V (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Geog, Box 353550, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lawson@u.washington.edu,,,,,,,35,32,40,0,38,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

A common claim is that legislative redistricting has been a major contributor to polarization in the American political system. Previous attempts to test for a relationship between redistricting and polarization have generally relied on cross-state comparisons of redistricting methods and examinations of behavior in the House of Representatives. In this paper, I exploit the alternation between legislatively drawn and panel-drawn districts in California since the mid-1960s. Using data at the state legislature level, I find evidence that legislatively drawn districts have been, on average, less competitive than panel-drawn districts. Moreover, as districts become safer,legislators tend to take more extreme voting positions. Finally, I find evidence that legislative redistricting (compared with panel-drawn redistricting) is associated with increased polarization.","Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Grainger, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,"Grainger, Corbett/0000-0001-5789-3725",,,,,24,13,17,1,18,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

We also examine evidence to support the suggestion that the main problem of the Greek judicial system is not only of insufficient staffing, but also a problem of insufficient organization, excessively burdensome procedures and severe restrictions in the way legal services are supplied in Greece. In particular, we present evidence of poor justice quality that can be also used to interpret the Greek case focusing on the quality of the judiciary and on inefficiencies in legal service markets. We also present a number of case-files that demonstrate the large delays in the Greek judiciary.

The disadvantage of SMEs and their own characteristics of investment in innovation justify public intervention using government aid for innovation. The objective of financial support is to motivate a greater innovative effort that produces an increase in social wealth. The purpose of this work is to study public assistance for innovation in SMEs, analyzing the relationship between innovative behavior and performance. An empirical study was carried out at 143 manufacturing SMEs in the state of Yucatan, Mexico. Data was collected using a questionnaire directed to company managers and analyzed using univariate and multivariate techniques. Results showed that: 1) the current innovative behavior (IB) of subsidized firms is higher than non-subsidized firms, 2) the IB increases in subsidized firms after the government support and 3) the IB affects performance evolution in a positive way. However, the effect of public subsidy on firm performance is null. The results obtained are of great interest for public administration in order to design public assistance programs for innovation in SMEs.","[Gongora, Gabriel] Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain; [Garcia, Domingo] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Econ Financiera & Contabilidad, Cartagena, Spain; [Garcia, Domingo] Observ Econ Pyme Reg Murcia, Cartagena, Murcia, Spain; [Garcia, Domingo] Asociac Espanola Contabilidad & Adm Empresas, Comis Valorac & Financiac Empresas, Cartagena, Murcia, Spain; [Madrid, Antonia] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Catedra Jovenes Emprendedores Bancaja, Cartagena, Murcia, Spain; [Madrid, Antonia] Univ Murcia, Catedra Empresa Familiar, Cartagena, Murcia, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; University of Murcia,"Góngora, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain.",ggongora@uady.mx; domingo.garcia@upct.es; Antonia.madrid@upct.es,"MADRID-GUIJARRO, ANTONIA/G-9574-2015",,,,,,55,6,6,1,23,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

We find, however, that the degree of bias declines significantly over the period studied, with a lower bias being evident in the five years after 2000 than in the five preceding seasons. These findings have important implications for methods of forecasting race outcomes that include odds as an endogenous variable.

Most attempts to explain this obesity epidemic have been found inadequate, including the Big Two (the increased availability of inexpensive food and the decline of physical exertion). This article explores the possibility that the obesity epidemic is substantially due to growing insecurity, stress, and a sense of powerlessness in modern society where high-sugar and high-fat foods are increasingly omnipresent. Those suffering these conditions may suffer less control over other domains of their lives. Insecurity and stress have been found to increase the desire for high-fat and high-sugar foods. After exploring the evidence of a link between stress and obesity, the increasing pace of capitalism's creative destruction and its generation of greater insecurity and stress are addressed. The article ends with reflections on how epidemic obesity is symptomatic of a social mistake-the seeking of maximum efficiency and economic growth even in societies where the fundamental problem of material security has been solved. I confess I am not charmed with the ideal of life held out by those who think that the normal state of human beings is that of struggling to get on; that the trampling, crushing, elbowing, and treading on each other's heels, which form the existing type of social life, are the most desirable lot of humankind, or anything but the disagreeable symptoms of one of the phases of industrial progress. (Mill 1848: 748) Thus we have been expressly evolved by nature-with all our impulses and deepest instincts-for the purpose of solving the economic problem [the struggle for subsistence]. If the economic problem is solved, mankind will be deprived of its traditional purpose . . . Will this be a benefit? If one believes at all in the real values of life, the prospect at least opens up the possibility of benefit. Yet I think with dread of the readjustment of the habits and instincts of the ordinary man, bred into him for countless generations, which he may be asked to discard within a few decades.

In particular, it argues that references to the so-called conduit metaphor, which represents markets as a series of information flows, hide the localized, historically contingent and materially mediated practices of the economy. Following the tradition of the performative theory of social institutions, this article argues that the specific meaning of 'market information' and its concrete manifestations (e.g. prices) depend on the sociotechnical character of the calculative practices through which market participants orient their economic actions. The point is illustrated through a historical reconstruction of the introduction of price and quote dissemination technologies in the London Stock Exchange between 1955 and 1990.

It segments the consumers based on their attitudes, and examines the differences among the attitude segments relative to their retail patronage behaviour, consumer spending and consumer attitudes towards buying Croatian-made products. The empirical analysis is based on data obtained from consumer survey. The data were analyzed using t-test, chi-square test and ANOVA. The results show that consumers perceive domestic retailers as being similar to foreign retailers on three out of four store attribute factors. Cluster analysis produced three consumer segments: (1) consumers who prefer domestic retailers (28%); (2) consumers who prefer foreign retailers (17%); and (3) indifferent consumers (55%). The significant differences across segments exist in retail patronage, but not in consumer spending behaviour and the attitudes towards buying Croatian-made products. It may be concluded that consumers' attitudes towards domestic and foreign retailers might predict retail patronage behaviour. When designing retail strategy, managers should take into consideration both consumer attitudes and consumer segments.","Inst Econ, Dept Microecon Anal Org & Management, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb,"Anic, ID (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Dept Microecon Anal Org & Management, Trg JF Kennedy 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",danic@eizg.hr,,,,,,,45,3,5,0,12,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Marshall's concept of class is not well-studied. His idea of class is different from what Weber and Marx have proposed. In contrast to many other economists, he has a discussion of class that is developed. It is shown that Marshall sees classes as made up of people whose work offers similar chances of developing their higher faculties. An integrated idea is that different class positions are associated with different discount rates of future outcomes. Marshall's class theory combines physical and mental components.","[Aspers, Patrik] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Aspers, Patrik] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany",Stockholm University; Max Planck Society,"Aspers, P (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,"Aspers, Patrik/ABG-2864-2020","Aspers, Patrik/0000-0001-9840-8669",,,,,27,2,2,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We argue that the controversy arises because, both theoretically and empirically, only a binary, open vs. closed, strategy has been considered. In this paper, we distinguish among three firm strategies: open, semi-open and closed, drawing upon a panel of Spanish firms (2004-2006) using data from Community Innovation Survey (CIS)-type surveys, and two different indicators of openness. Our results show that open innovators are smaller and less RD intensive than semi-open ones, although larger and more RD intensive than closed innovators. These results reduce some of the controversies, and show that two conflicting forces, absorptive capacity and a oneedo effect, are at stake in open innovation strategies.","Univ Complutense, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Barge-Gil, A (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense, Campus Somosaguas S-N, Madrid 28223, Spain.",abarge@ccee.ucm.es,"Barge-Gil, Andrés/K-5817-2014","Barge-Gil, Andrés/0000-0003-0208-3914",,,,,76,84,86,0,67,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Secondly, regulation of economic activities carried out by the Regions; in other words, the design of self-regulatory systems within the frameworks of the EU and Spain. In this paper we made an Economic Freedom Index on Spain's Regions. The international indexes of economic freedom have become very useful tools for the study of comparative economic policies since they allow analyzing correlations between regulatory framework and growth rates. A few indexes of economic freedom applied to different regions at sub national level has been made but has not been done -so far- a study of its kind in Europe. One of the basic requirements for this type of indexes is that the regions have a high degree of autonomy in the field of economic policy.

The Delphi method has been used to identify factors influencing effectiveness of e-learning implementation for employee training in small and medium-sized enterprises. The Delphi study was realised as a part of doctoral dissertation at Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague. The three round Delphi study was conducted during the year 2009 over a period of six months. Delphi panel members (experts) were chosen on the basis of their expertise in the areas of both e-learning and corporate training. In the first round of the study panel members identified factors with positive and negative influence on e-learning effectiveness. In the next step the factors were according to modified Khans model (2007) divided into following groups of factors: Management, Staff, Infrastructure and institutions support, Pedagogy, Others - none included. Based on the panel members responses of the first round a closed-ended online questionnaire was developed for use in the second round. In the second round the panel members assessed degree of influence of each identified factor. In the third and final round of the Delphi study the panel members only re-evaluated the factors that were recognized as a key and influential in the second round. The experts identified altogether 32 factors with positive influence on effectiveness of e-learning in SMEs and 21 factors with negative influence. The experts perceive effectiveness of e-learning in SMEs more in relation to the positive factors and less to the negative factors. For both groups of factors (positive and negative) were most factors identified in the area of Pedagogy, followed by factors from the Management. The experts perceive effectiveness of e-learning in relation to these two areas. The results of this study show the key role of aspects of andragogy in effective e-learning implementation process for SMEs. The study also demonstrates the importance such factors as: management support employee training and development, management support e-learning solutions of some corporate training, there is technological and organizational background for e-learning that also determine the effectiveness and success of e-learning in employee training.","[Egerova, Dana] Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekonomicka, Katedra Managementu Inovaci & Projektu, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Muzik, Jaroslav] Univ Karlova Praze, Filozoficka Fak, Katedra Andragogiky & Personalniho Rizeni, Prague, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen; Charles University Prague,"Egerová, D (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekonomicka, Katedra Managementu Inovaci & Projektu, Plzen, Czech Republic.",egerova@kip.zcu.cz; a-muzik@seznam.cz,,"Egerova, Dana/0000-0003-1824-9288",,,,,22,8,8,1,33,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

While the worldviews of the military and neo-liberal economists of the time were very different, their common concern for distortions in economic and political life made them translatable. These economists provided a new economic identity that would be in tune with monetarist theory, replace 'distorting' collective identities and allow individuals to be governed from a distance. I argue that the homo economicus was performed through two sets of tools: consumer campaigns and the financial press. However, individuals did not always behave as expected. The contradictions of neo-liberalism, between its liberalism and its quest to create self-regulating spheres through active government intervention, led to the financial crisis of 1980. Economists later blamed the crash on the irresponsibility of market actors and expressed doubt regarding the self-regulating model they had promoted. In the conclusion, the legacy of the attempt to perform the homo economicus is assessed.","Columbia Univ, Dept Sociol MC9649, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Fridman, D (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Sociol MC9649, 606 W 122nd St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",dgf2101@columbia.edu,,,,,,,83,27,37,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Nevertheless, the relation between the motives to collaborate and the different forms of collaboration has not been examined. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by highlighting and explaining the heterogeneity in the forms of collaboration as a result of several interdependent simultaneous choices. Using a sample of more than 3,000 RD collaborations, a typology of their characteristics allows us to distinguish five discrete forms of collaboration. Then using a multinomial logit estimation, we show how the forms of collaboration vary according to the firms' attributes (size, RD internal effort, group membership), market and objectives pursued.

If we hypothesize that the EU15 is one geo-political unit called Euroland, such an empirical observation is accurate both for the aggregate number of Prime Ministers in office and for the aggregate vote share. In our Euroland, we consider each country of the EU15 as a region where citizens can choose between five political families when voting (the classic Right, the moderate and social-democratic Left, the Left of the Left, the far Right and rightist populists, and the ecologists). Our panel data from these countries includes results from 130 legislative elections, 1978-2008. After building a politico-economic vote function for each political bloc, we estimate a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) from which we forecast their respective electoral weights in Europe for the years to come.

A theoretical concept and an empirical case study in East Germany. Migration is an important channel for the transfer of human capital. A growing emphasis has been placed on re-migration as a possibility of re-gaining human capital. The paper aims to critically review theoretical approaches to re-migration and introduces a multi level research concept. This concept has been implemented in an exploratory case study on the effects of re-migration in East Germany.

This paper analyzes questions based on the complexity theory addressed to the hegemony of the western instrumental epistemological perspective, which, having formulated antagonism between subject-object in the knowledge construction process, conceives nature as an environment capable of enduring any kind of human manipulation and denies the value of other knowledge coming from different gnoseological perspectives. The predatory attitude of modernity toward nature imposes the urgent need to develop an ecological ethic that guarantees the continuity of life on our planet.

Larry initiated and supported the symposium on eugenics published by the American Journal of Economics and Sociology in July 2005. He edited the volume Social Inequality, Analytical Egalitarianism and the March Toward Eugenic Explanations in the Social Sciences in August 2008. These constitute obvious signs of Larry's concern. He conjectured that the Trinity College Dublin political economists who held the Whately professorship should be thought of as a school. Such a school was in fact identified in 1850 by an outsider who pointed to their shared opposition to racial explanations within an institutional setting. That shared opposition allowed them to speak against the narrow interests of the rulers of the country. Of course, other political economists of the time, Mill in particular, were also emphatic in their anti-racism. Thus, not only do we need to take up Larry's challenge to describe the Trinity College school but we must also seek its connections with the Scottish-English group of anti-racists.","[Peart, Sandra J.] Univ Richmond, Jepson Sch Leadership Studies, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Levy, David M.] George Mason Univ, Ctr Study Publ Study, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",University of Richmond; George Mason University,"Peart, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Richmond, Jepson Sch Leadership Studies, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.",,"Levy, David/GPS-4945-2022",,,,,,16,0,0,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

It presents the results of a survey on 280 French academic inventors, that is, French university professors who are also designated as inventors in at least one European patent. This survey provides new insights into the effect of university patenting on the commercialization of university inventions, the transfer of scientific research, the incentives to do basic research and the access to upstream knowledge. In particular, the study suggests that patenting university research can, on the one hand, facilitate the transfer of technology from university to industry, especially in the fields of life sciences and pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, it almost systematically delays the publication of research findings, thus hindering the dissemination of scientific knowledge.","[Penin, Julien] Univ Strasbourg, BETA, CNRS, UMR 7522, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Lorraine; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Penin, J (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, BETA, CNRS, UMR 7522, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",penin@unistra.fr,,"penin, Julien/0000-0001-7375-993X",,,,,54,10,11,2,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Using the concept of governmentality as a means of interpreting the course of recent UK pension policy and its attempts to influence individual saving behaviour, it critiques that policy. The paper then goes on to consider the effect of the introduction of personal accounts upon the pensions landscape, and in particular its potential to push forward the government's recent approach to pension provision. It argues that these reforms, rather than furthering individual saving for retirement, may alternatively create the very real possibility of undermining it.","Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Div Accounting Finance & Risk, Caledonian Business Sch, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow Caledonian University,"Ring, PJ (通讯作者)，Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Div Accounting Finance & Risk, Caledonian Business Sch, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",P.Ring@gcal.ac.uk,,,,,,,74,17,18,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The agents are assumed to determine their strategies based on intended but bounded rationality. The field of strategic games provides the possibility to an agent to understand the optimality of his behaviour. In coalition and network games stability, Pareto-efficiency and fairness of agreements is investigated. The paper shows the relationship between the different fields of game theory in the case of 3 agents. On that basis it shows the ubiquity of time-inconsistency in dynamic setting due to bounded rationality, deception and environment changes. The paper explains why allocation rules like the Shapley-based Aumann-Dreze-value and the Myerson-value for coalition structures must be modified in dynamic setting in order to consider the influence of excluded agents, the outside option. An accordingly modified allocation rule is introduced and investigated. It is shown that the Aumann-Dreze-value and the Myerson-value for coalition structures remains relevant for the case that the switching of the partner is connected with high costs. It is shown through the example of enterprise cooperation in supply chains that low partner switching costs require the introduced allocation rule that considers the outside option.","Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Stein, HD (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",hd.stein@web.de,,,,,,,104,9,9,0,22,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Gregory; Teece, David J.",,,DYNAMIC COMPETITION IN ANTITRUST LAW,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MARKET POWER; INNOVATION; INDUSTRIES; CAPABILITIES; SCHUMPETER; ECONOMISTS; EVOLUTION; PATENTS; MERGERS; POLICY,"How would competition policy be shaped if it were to explicitly favor Schumpeterian (dynamic) competition over neoclassical (static) competition? Schumpeterian competition is the kind of competition that is engendered by product and process innovation. Such competition does not merely bring price competition. It tends to overturn the existing order. A neo-Schumpeterian framework for antitrust analysis that favors dynamic competition over static competition would put less weight on market share and concentration in the assessment of market power and more weight on assessing potential competition and enterprise-level capabilities. By embedding recent developments in evolutionary economics, the behavioral theory of the firm, and strategic management into antitrust analysis, one can develop a more robust framework for antitrust economics. Such a framework is likely to ease remaining tensions between antitrust and intellectual property. It is also likely to reduce confidence in the standard tools of antitrust economics when the business environment manifests rapid technological change. It appears that the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has attempted to incorporate more dynamic analysis, but the result has been inconsistent across different mergers and different doctrinal areas of antitrust law. Moreover, a complicating factor in the transformation of the law is the fact that the federal courts have, by embracing the reasoning in the Merger Guidelines promulgated several decades ago by the Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), caused antitrust case law to ossify around a decidedly static view of antitrust. Put differently, in the years since 1980, the Division and the FTC have successfully persuaded the courts to adopt a more explicit economic approach to merger analysis, yet one that has a static view of competition. The result is not a mere policy preference. It is law. To change that law to have a more dynamic view of competition will therefore require a sustained intellectual effort by the enforcement agencies (as well as by scholars and practitioners) that, once more, engages the courts to re-examine antitrust law, as they did in the late 1970s during the ascendancy of the Chicago School, when antitrust law became infused with its current, static understanding of competition. A necessary but not sufficient condition for that effort is a public process by which the Division and the FTC revisit and restate the Merger Guidelines in a manner that clarifies and defends the role of dynamic competition in antitrust analysis. We therefore applaud the announcement of the antitrust agencies in September 2009 to solicit public comment on the possibility of updating the Merger Guidelines. Assuming that the Division and the FTC decide to revise the existing Merger Guidelines, those revised guidelines (and useful complementary undertakings, such as generalized guidelines on market power and remedies) then will require leadership by the enforcement agencies to persuade the courts that antitrust doctrine should evolve accordingly. That neo-Schumpeterian process may take a decade or longer to accomplish, but it is a path that we believe the Roberts Court is willing to travel.","[Sidak, J.

Such disguised transfers mitigate the reputational penalties to appropriators of interfering with a merit-driven system. I use data on all peer-reviewed grants by the National Institutes of Health during the years 1984-2003 and find that performers in the states of certain House Appropriations Committee members receive 5.9-10.3 percent more research funds than those at unrepresented institutions. The returns to representation are concentrated in state universities and small businesses.

Theoretically, such migration can follow from the increasing demand for amenities that accompanies increasing wealth. Under the baseline calibration of a general equilibrium model, a place with amenities for which individuals would initially pay 5% of their income grows slightly faster than an otherwise identical place. As local quality of life becomes more important in determining relative population density, local productivity independently becomes less important. Together these two trends cause local amenities to eventually become the sole determinant of relative local density. From a quantitative perspective, high quality of life together with low relative productivity can boost metropolitan population growth by several percentage points.","Econ Res Dept, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA",,"Rappaport, J (通讯作者)，Econ Res Dept, 1 Mem Dr, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA.",jordan.rappaport@kc.frb.org,,,,,,,59,61,76,3,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Moreover, we find that this pattern is mainly true when looking at fields where lawyers are involved in dispute resolution rather than in structuring transactions. We then analyze which combinations of specialists tend to work in the same firm and which tend not to do so. We relate our results to theories of law firms' boundaries from the organizational economics literature.

J,"Libecap, GD",,,,"Libecap, Gary D.",,,Chinatown Revisited: Owens Valley and Los Angeles-Bargaining Costs and Fairness Perceptions of the First Major Water Rights Exchange,JOURNAL OF LAW ECONOMICS & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"I examine a complicated bargaining problem in the acquisition of private land and water rights by Los Angeles in Owens Valley. This is a pivotal episode in the political economy of contemporary western water. More broadly, Owens Valley provides empirical evidence on how the gains from exchange were divided among the parties and how equity concerns shaped the process and succeeding assessment of market allocation. Negotiations for key properties took place within a bilateral monopoly context, and the bargaining strategies of both parties raised the transaction costs of exchange and formed fairness perceptions about the outcome of the exchange. I analyze the bargaining environment and estimate the determinants of when properties sold and the prices paid for land and water. Farmers who colluded did better by selling the properties than if they had remained in agriculture. Their cartels, however, were not strong enough to secure more of the surplus from reallocating water from agriculture to urban demand. Most of the gains went to Los Angeles landowners, and this is a source of the notion of water theft that continues today.

Because there are spillover benefits of being associated with a winner, the perceptions of stakeholders and potential stakeholders can affect firm value. Our analysis indicates that while transparency (i.e., generating information about a firm's quality) may improve the allocation of resources, a firm may have a higher ex ante value if information about its quality is not prematurely generated. Transparency costs arise because of asymmetric information regarding the extent to which stakeholders benefit from having a relationship with a high-quality firm. These costs are higher when firms can undertake noncontractible innovative investments that enhance the value of their stakeholder relationships. Stakeholder effects of transparency are especially important for younger firms with less established track records.","[Almazan, Andres; Titman, Sheridan] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Finance, Red McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Suarez, Javier] CEMFI, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Titman, Sheridan] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Almazan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Finance, Red McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",andres.almazan@mccombs.utexas.edu; suarez@cemfi.es; sheridan.titman@mccombs.utexas.edu,"Suarez, Javier/T-5311-2019","Suarez, Javier/0000-0002-2012-3900",,,,,38,12,13,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

One is concerned with investments in productive technologies that improve productivity and better service consumer needs. The other is concerned with the creation of protective technologies that secure citizens' private property rights vis-a-vis one another. In the developing world where governments cannot or do not protect citizens against predation, institutional entrepreneurs devise private mechanisms of property protection, providing the security required for productive entrepreneurship to grow. However, private protection technologies can be a double-edged sword. While private protection technologies enable some investment and exchange by securing citizens' property where government does not, potential constraints on these technologies' effectiveness may simultaneously limit their ability to expand investment and exchange beyond modest levels.

In most U. S. cities, wholesale prices spiked significantly for roughly 2 weeks following the hurricane. However, in cities where this spike was particularly large, retail margins remained higher than in other cities for nearly 2 months. High retail margins dissipated more quickly after the hurricane in cities where competition between stations tends to generate cyclical retail price fluctuations independent of wholesale cost movements. I discuss why prices may have fallen faster in cities exhibiting retail price cycles and present additional results identifying differences in market characteristics between cities with and without price cycles. I find that cycling cities tend to have higher population density and have independent (nonrefinery brand) stations that are more highly concentrated into large retail chains.","Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Lewis, MS (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,"Lewis, Matthew S/D-2537-2010","Lewis, Matthew/0000-0002-2211-6595",,,,,15,52,61,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

The resulting method, which turns out to be a restricted form of damped trend corrected exponential smoothing, is compared with related methods on the annual data from the M3 competition.

J,"Schwarz, P",,,,"Schwarz, Peter",,,Why are countries reluctant to exchange information on interest income? Participation in and effectiveness of the EU Savings Tax Directive,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Review,,,,,,European Union; Interest taxation; Information exchange; Withholding tax; Tax havens,TAXATION; COMPETITION; FIRMS,"Since 1.7.2005 the EU Savings Tax Directive has ensured a minimum of taxation on foreign interest income by offering participating countries the opportunity either to apply a withholding tax or to exchange information on cross-border interest income. The aim of the paper is to examine why countries do not exchange information on interest income. The results suggest that the incentive to exchange information is weakened if the financial sector in a country is very profitable. A high profitability of the financial sector enables countries to maximize revenues from the corporation tax. A second reason for discouraging information exchange is related to the spillover effects on the domestic labor market. An inflow of financial capital is indirectly associated with the creation of employment and well-paid jobs. In its current form the savings tax directive enables individuals to avoid taxation, either by placing their income in non-participating countries or by investing in assets which are not part of the directive. Using German revenue data for 2005 and 2006 the paper shows that Germany receives significantly less revenue from countries applying a withholding tax. This result indirectly indicates that investors can take advantage of the directive's loopholes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, this powerful rhetoric has been accompanied by surprisingly little concrete analysis. Economic geography is only recently waking up to the potential of network analysis for interorganisational linkages within and between regions. We discuss network analysis as a strategic information tool for regional knowledge management and apply it to the metropolitan region of Hannover-Braunschweig-Gottingen-Wolfsburg in the northern German state of Lower Saxony. Producing network diagrams and parameters of network size, density, centrality, cohesion and connectivity from a large sample of actors and linkages, our survey shows striking differences between different fields of competence that highlight the potential of network analysis as a powerful tool and a necessary basis for decision-making to propel metropolitan regions into the knowledge economy. We outline both case-specific and generic implications for the practice of regional knowledge management.

Overall, our results highlight important differences in the forecastability of real housing price growth across US states, especially between interior and coastal states. More specifically, we find that autoregressive models, and especially models that incorporate information from numerous economic variables, often provide. relatively accurate housing price forecasts for a number of interior states during the period 1995-2006; all forecasting models, however, tend to perform relatively poorly for a group of primarily coastal states that experienced especially strong housing price growth during this period, pointing to a disconnect between housing prices and economic fundamentals for these states.

This is remarkable when several leading authors argue that the economic importance of cities is strongly determined by economic networks between cities worldwide. This discrepancy stems from the fact that limited empirical research exists on corporate networks. Furthermore, the relative importance of cities within various studies is based on different functional types and spatial scales of data, making the results incomparable. Therefore, in this paper, the relative importance of the four largest Randstad cities is explored within three independent, comparative networks (top 100 global firms, top 100 European firms, and top 100 Dutch firms). Employing network analysis techniques, this paper evaluates the local, supra-regional and global importance of the four Randstad cities within the three independent networks. The results show that the relative importance and network structures of these four cities are highly dependent on the economic size and locality of the initial headquarters and that Amsterdam proves to be the most important Randstad city in all three scales of corporate networks.","Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Wall, RS (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",wall@few.eur.nl,"Wall, Ronald/AAF-2228-2019","Wall, Ronald/0000-0003-2783-4294",,,,,31,9,11,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The empirical analysis focuses on whether their involvement in entrepreneurship may be explained by location attributes. As much as 75 percent of the KIBS founders have prior work experience from business services, suggesting that KIBS start-ups are more frequent in regions where the KIBS sector is already large. Controlling for the stock of potential entrepreneurs and the stock of KIBS firms, it is shown that variables reflecting both supply-side conditions and market size influence KIBS start-up activity. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that KIBS entrepreneurship in a region is stimulated by the simultaneous presence of (i) knowledge resources conducive for the generation and diffusion of knowledge and ideas upon which new firms can be established and (ii) a large market.","[Andersson, Martin] Royal Inst Technol, CESIS, SE-1044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin; Hellerstedt, Karin] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Jonkoping University,"Andersson, M (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol, CESIS, Drottning Kristinas Vag 30, SE-1044 Stockholm, Sweden.",martin.andersson@ihh.hj.se,"Andersson, Martin/AAB-5164-2021",,,,,,59,55,60,0,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

It defines the basic correlations between the quality and the motivation in an organization. The quality is a system phenomenon which includes three subsystems: human personalities (human potential), appearances, and elements of material and nonmaterial environment, also. The most important of these three subsystems is human potential, because only human motivation, intellect, competence, skills, and experience can achieve the increase in quality of the appearances and the elements of organization. It is possible not only to increase quality in the organization by a higher quality of the motivation but also it is possible to increase the quality of motivation by increasing of the quality of the conditions, processes, and relations in the organization. The achievement of a raise of quantitative level of performance of individuals and groups should not be achieved by only the intention of effectual motivating at present hypercompetitive environment. Probably, it is more important to achieve the total quality improving of motivational structures of individuals, a higher level of their identification to a vision and mission of the organization, higher loyalty, innovativeness, willingness to participate on realization of changes in the organization, and voluntary initiative of convenient changes. The interest of employees and managers in future of their organization, team work, perfectionism, mastering, and preceding of pathological conflicts, elimination of needless power rivalry should be supported in the organization.

First, we studied the genealogical records 'Zokufu' in China. Second, based on the study, we implemented an agent-based model with the family line network as an adjacency matrix, the personal profile data as an attribution matrix. Third, using inverse simulation technique, we optimized the agent-based model in order to fit the simulation profiles to the real profile data. From the intensive experiments, we have found that both grandfather and mother have a profound impact within a family to 1) transmit cultural capital to children, and 2) maintain the system of the norm system of the family. We conclude that advanced agent-based models are able to contribute to discover new knowledge in the fields of historical sciences.","[Kurahashi, Setsuya] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst Management, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tsukuba,,kurahashi@gssm.otsuka.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-4-431-87435-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,181,192,,,,,,12,Economics; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Sociology,BLU06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271014200015,0

On the basis of conducted analysis, one may say, that the international competitiveness and competitive position of the Baltic countries is relatively low yet. However, in the years 1996-2006 appeared file gradual growth of competitiveness and competitive position of the Baltic countries on international arena, what confirms favorable changes of analyzed competitiveness indexes. The possibilities of increasing international competitiveness of the Baltic countries depend on, whether lite Baltic countries will fully use existing chances resulting mainly from the membership in the European Union.

The purpose of the paper is to view how these SMEs adopted a model of self-assessment based on EFQM to address the problem. The EFQM has developed an evaluation approach, termed excellence model, and it has introduced the principle of evaluation by way of self-assessment to apply the model. Self-assessment is a comprehensive, systematic and regular review of an organization's activities and results. Many organizations from the private and the public sector have adopted this methodology. In this context, formal bodies were set up to carry out periodic quality assessments in furniture SMEs. In this paper we study and analyze an EFQM model self-assessment process used in an Iranian furniture enterprise. Hence, in order to work towards excellence, we were directed towards assessing the enterprise performance in five enabler and four results criteria. Leadership, policy, people, partnerships and processes are enablers and customer results, people results, society results and key performance results are results. The enablers cover what an organization does and the results cover what an organization achieves. Results are caused by enablers. In this article we focus on costumer results include customer satisfaction, customer consolidation, communication with customer and customer complaints. A case study is used, considering the analysis of primary and secondary data from the major product of the enterprise which have had success with self-assessment. The paper begins with a literature review followed by a methodology section. The case study then describes the stages in the development of a self-assessment exercise. The paper finishes with a discussion with focus on costumer results. The findings show the steps that one industrial Small-to-medium-sized enterprise can follow in order to apply EFQM to improve customer results.","[Sadeh, Ehsan; Arumugam, V.

Its current use in financial geography, however, seems to be more metaphorical than analytical. This paper firstly discusses specific sectoral characteristics which make it difficult to simply apply a concept which was developed for the industrial sector to the financial economy. Secondly, value networks in the production processes of financial products indicate that only certain parts of the production process, i.e. knowledge-based, non-repetitive transactions in the network, require local proximities. Following Gordon/McCann in their reasoning on industrial clusters, it is argued that the cluster approach to financial centres calls for a multi-scalar perspective combining the juridical national territory, the advantages of a large urban agglomeration, and, finally, the network externalities of a district within the urban agglomeration, i.e. the financial district. This is demonstrated using the example of the Financial centre of Frankfurt/RhineMain, a term which stands for the larger urban agglomeration.","Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Humangeog, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Schamp, EW (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Humangeog, Robert Mayer Str 6-8, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",Schamp@em.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,56,8,8,0,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

The time needed for completing the transshipments using multiple cranes is to be minimised. The contribution of this paper is to put forward a metaheuristic approach to deal with this challenging problem that has not been tackled before. The problem is first decomposed into three subproblems: (1) the assignment of a destination to each train, (2) the determination of container positions on the train wagons and (3) the determination of the operations sequence for the different cranes that perform the actual transshipments. The first subproblem is solved in a heuristic manner while the second subproblem is solved to optimality. The third subproblem is tackled by a Variable Neighbourhood Descent metaheuristic procedure. This approach is validated on a set of generated test problems. Solutions are obtained in a reasonable amount of calculation time.","[Souffriau, Wouter] KaHo Sint Lieven, Informat Technol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Souffriau, Wouter] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Ind Management, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Souffriau, W (通讯作者)，KaHo Sint Lieven, Informat Technol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Wouter.Souffriau@kahosl.be; Pieter.Vansteenwegen@cib.kuleuven.be; Greet.VandenBerghe@kahosl.be; Dirk.VanOudheusden@cib.kuleuven.be,"Vanden Berghe, Greet/A-3914-2015; Vansteenwegen, Pieter/W-2501-2018","Vanden Berghe, Greet/0000-0002-0275-5568; Vansteenwegen, Pieter/0000-0002-5646-669X",,,,,16,8,8,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",0075-8442,,978-3-642-00939-6,LECT NOTES ECON MATH,,,2009,624.0,,,,,,83,98,,10.1007/978-3-642-00939-6_6,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BLV72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271188100006,0

We compare Keynes's approach to the crisis with the work of contemporary distinguished economists. We conclude that a drop of marginal efficiency of capital is the main cause of the economic crisis and depression, and that such a drop is an unavoidable consequence of functioning of a market capitalist economy. Such a view differs significantly from the deliberations of many economists who hold insufficient demand as the main cause of the crisis. We think that insufficient demand appears on the surface as a cause of the crisis. However, insufficient demand is just a consequence of a previously overheated economy faced with the drop of MEC. Consequently, a crisis cannot be prevented by expansive financial policy. Therefore it should come as a surprise that Keynes in the last year of his life retreated from his ideas expressed in General Theory and declared himself as not Keynesian any more (Hutchison, 1981). We think that major systemic, institutional as well as structural changes need to be taken in majority of developed economies in order to cope efficiently with present and future crisis.","Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Stojanov, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipov 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",Vjeverica56@yahoo.com,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,2,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

It asks 'to what extent is Ong's work still relevant for the contemporary experiences of transnational migrants?' With a focus on research in Canada, I argue that, contrary to their 'flexible' intentions, transnational immigrants often demonstrate a high level of local civic involvement and a localised sense of identity in the 'new' country, even when continuing to practice transnationalism on a daily basis. In addition, the paper contributes to debates around the relationship between transnationalism and integration over time. It draws upon an indepth qualitative study of immigrant women over eight years to examine the extent of their transnational activities and feelings of belonging. It concludes that while the notion of flexible citizenship would in many cases seem to describe accurately the objectives of Chinese immigrants to Canada, it is perhaps less salient in relation to some of their experiences.","Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Waters, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog, Roxby Bldg, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England.",J.L.Waters@liv.ac.uk,,"Waters, Johanna/0000-0002-4545-2495",,,,,38,14,17,0,17,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Moreover, they are a genuine loss of welfare which have a negative impact on national income. Surprisingly, regulatory costs are often neglected or misinterpreted in regulatory assessments, except-though only recently-for administrative compliance costs. One important reason is the lack of a clear and consistent definition as well as a practical and exhaustive typology of regulatory costs. This conceptual paper presents a cost taxonomy that takes into account all costs of regulation. We identify 16 direct and two indirect regulatory cost types. The former are costs borne by society in preparing and implementing regulations. For the government, they consist of information, decision-making, drawing-up, planning, administrative start-up, operational, monitoring, and enforcement costs. Citizens and businesses, on the other hand, incur rent-seeking, information, planning, three types of compliance, delay and enforcement costs. The indirect costs comprise the efficiency loss plus, in the event of poorly designed or market-based regulation, also transaction costs. The neglect of any of these costs may lead to the underestimation of costs in absolute or relative terms and thus to inefficient regulatory choices.","[Marneffe, Wim; Vereeck, Lode] Hasselt Univ, Fac Appl Econ, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium",Hasselt University,"Vereeck, L (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, Fac Appl Econ, Agoralaan Bld D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.",lode.vereeck@uhasselt.be,,"MARNEFFE, Wim/0000-0001-9945-5731",,,,,26,8,12,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

From a stated preference survey of more than 250 drivers, we estimate mean willingness to pay values under various trip conditions and for various traveler characteristics. The study provides statistically significant evidence on the relationships between willingness to pay and the improvement in travel speeds in HOT lanes, the length of the trip, and the urgency of on-time arrival. Furthermore, our study confirms several literature findings from previous studies on the relationship between travelers' willingness to pay and income as well as prior experience with HOT lanes. Some of the findings are qualitatively validated on the basis of the observed travel behavior in choosing tolled facilities over untolled facilities during periods of heightened congestion and urgency.

His inquiry suggested a related but conceptually distinct issue: how does the extent to which a regional industry or industrial sector is concentrated in a small number of firms affect the local performance of that industry? The question has not been addressed systematically in empirical research other than case studies, principally because accurately measuring regional concentration requires firm-level information. This exploratory study uses confidential plant-level data to gauge concentration in manufacturing industries at the regional scale across the continental United States, to explore changes over time in geographic patterns of concentration, and to investigate associations between regional industrial structure concentration and changes in employment. The implications for understanding the impacts of regional industrial structure on economic development processes are discussed.","Univ Illinois, Dept Urban Planning & Policy, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Drucker, J (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Urban Planning & Policy, 412 S Peoria St,221 CUPPA M-C 348, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",jdruck@uic.edu,"Drucker, Joshua/L-2316-2019","Drucker, Joshua/0000-0002-6322-6395",,,,,115,29,40,2,93,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0095,,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Whereas the overall impact of urban road pricing on car use adaptation and public acceptability is known, there are only inconsistent results concerning the socioeconomic differences in the response towards road pricing. However, this knowledge is necessary for the development of urban road pricing packages. This paper uses a segmentation approach to identify groups of car users with a similar background in relevant socioeconomic variables and compares their responses towards road pricing. Three groups are identified: young families, suburban families, and singles and couples. These groups indeed differ in their car use adaptation towards urban road pricing as well as in their preferred revenues use. While all three groups significantly reduced their private car use, the young families reduced their car use most, followed by the group of singles and couples. Complementary measures are discussed that are believed to facilitate car use adaptation of each group in response towards urban road pricing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper contributes to the mounting evidence of a link between them by drawing attention to a very close relationship between trends in miles driven per licensed driver and adult obesity rates six years later. It also presents evidence on why the effect might be expected to be lagged by six years. A simple model is produced, which predicts reductions in obesity rates over the next few years. If these reductions come about, the model will be seen to offer a powerful insight into the relationship between driving and obesity. If the relationship is more than coincidental, it has implications for transport policy and supports the development of a multi-pronged, interdisciplinary approach to tackle increased driving and obesity.

A content analysis examined the type of information, the communication strategies and the judgmental heuristic cues presented in a total of 1,430 retirement financial service advertisements in six national US business-finance magazines from 2006 to 2009.","[Lee, Taejun (David)] Bradley Univ, Peoria, IL 61625 USA; [Haley, Eric] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Yun, Tai Woong] Hongik Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Chung, Wonjun] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA",Bradley University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Hongik University; University of Louisiana Lafayette,"Lee, T (通讯作者)，Bradley Univ, Peoria, IL 61625 USA.",davidtjlee@gmail.com; haley@utk.edu; taiwoongyun@gmail.com; wjc8855@louisiana.edu,,,,,,,53,8,10,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Even though nationalization is inefficient, it does occur in equilibrium when oil prices are high. The model's predictions are consistent with the analysis of panel data on nationalizations in the oil industry around the world since 1960.

Both countries created new technological paths, but the adoption and the further growth of the Japanese technological path was limited while the Korean path successfully expanded its market performance through the use of Intra-Path Integration and Inter-Path Reconfiguration.

However, little has been said regarding the role of and necessary conditions for the merchant as an agent that made it possible for the first Nation-States to become the future economic powers of the western world. Thomas Mun was one of those mercantilist writers who emphasized the role of the merchant during the heyday of the mercantilist system. A study of his ideas leads to the conclusion that his recommendations about what a merchant ought to be are still valid today. The reason for this affirmation lies in the fact that they were appropriate within a framework in which a significant transformation of the commercial organization system was appearing due to the presence of the Joint-Stock Company. Independent of that, many of the functions that Thomas Mun attributes to the merchant today are specialized; their domain continues to be the key to success for the commercial policy that any nation undertakes.","[Borgucci, Emmanuel] Cent Univ Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela; [Borgucci, Emmanuel] Univ Zulia, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",University of Central Venezuela,"Borgucci, E (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela.",eborgucci@yahoo.com,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,6,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

On the other hand, it was also the result of opening social and political mobility channels that brought about establishment of the republic, especially due to the convergence of three elements that fed searches for social and political spaces by that social sector: a) A more anthropological and historical vision of man, now conceived as a being under construction; b) social differentiation processes related to the lowest strata of the population, as well as struggles to overcome some of the social differentiation barriers such as the racial factor; c) the development of a new body of ideas and sensibilities regarding work.","[Solano D, Sergio Paolo] Univ Cartagena de Indias, Fac Ciencias Humanas, Programa Hist, Cartagena, Colombia",Universidad de Cartagena,"Solano, SP (通讯作者)，Ave 2A N 65-149, Barrio Crespo, Cartagena, Colombia.",ssolanod@unicartagena.edu.co,,,,,,,101,2,2,0,0,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

In particular, courts require that plaintiffs demonstrate using common evidence that all or almost all proposed class members would have suffered injury as a result of the defendant's alleged conduct. In this article, we show that there is generally a limit to what one can infer about injury to individuals from common evidence-that is, the inference gap. Moreover, this inference gap exists even in circumstances where ideal common evidence shows injury in the aggregate. To explain how economics can help bridge the inference gap, we examine three special cases where the inference gap can be bridged and discuss several recent class actions that show how courts are using economic analysis to determine whether Rule 23 has been satisfied.","[Peterson, Steven R.; Lemon, Andrew Y.] Compass Lexecon, Boston, MA 02109 USA",,"Peterson, SR (通讯作者)，Compass Lexecon, 200 State St, Boston, MA 02109 USA.",speterson@compasslexecon.com; alemon@compasslexecon.com,,,,,,,9,2,2,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In spite of substantial real increases in fares, patronage of subsidised railway services has increased by 4.6 percent per year over the last 20 years. To provide an understanding of this development the paper addresses the way in which the responsibility for public transport is organised. One feature of the organisation is that the design of tendering processes and contracting formats are not streamlined but differ across PTAs. Data about the particular contracts in use are however patchy and partly incomparable, making it difficult to establish whether one or the other contract design contributes better to sector performance. It is therefore not feasible to base an understanding of how traffic growth has been affected by sector internal performance on a rigorous analysis.

Article 106(2) TFEU is traditionally seen as a derogation to the Treaty provisions and has an awkward role in the Treaty Chapter on competition. Bekkedal notes the conventional reading of the provision is that it is an autonomous exception to all of the Treaty provisions and is not confined to specific types of infringement of the TFEU. The conventional view also takes the position that Article 106(2) TFEU can be invoked by the Member States and undertakings. Bekkedal, in contrast, takes a radical view. He argues that Article 106(2) TFEU can only be invoked by undertakings. He makes the point that Article 106(2) TFEU should not be turned into a general clause in EU law because it should be an exception primarily targeted at economic objectives. In relation to the fundamental free movement provisions economic objectives are not, in principle, accepted as legitimate justifications to the free movement rules. Bekkedal also notes that the European Courts take a softer approach to the application of the principle of proportionality when applying Article 106(2) TFEU, whereas a classical application of the principle should be strict: 'a least restrictive alternative' assessment of the challenged restriction on competition and cross-border trade. If Article 106(2) TFEU is applied as a general clause with these softer standards for review, it could compromise the Internal Market project. Bekkedal finds a new role for Article 106 TFEU in that it could be considered as a value statement fulfilling the concept of a 'European Social Model.'","[Bekkedal, Tarjei] Univ Oslo, Dept Private Law, N-0130 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,,tarjei.bekkedal@jus.uio.no; tarjei.bekkedal@jus.uio.no,,,,,,,41,6,6,0,1,TMC ASSER PRESS,J N DEN HAAG,"R J SCHIMMELPENNINCKLAAN 20-22, J N DEN HAAG, 2517, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-6704-733-3,LEG ISS SERV GEN INT,,,2011,,,,,,,61,102,,10.1007/978-90-6704-734-0_4,0.0,,,42,Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BVN53,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291967200004,0

The main objective of this paper is to advance our understanding of time in the area of corporate entrepreneurship research when growth is considered as final aim. Most studies of time take it for granted in the process of entrepreneurial growth. We suggest considering time as essential for understanding of corporate entrepreneurship, where the problem is rooted in the reconciliation of time contradictions pictured by what we called time wheel of corporate entrepreneurship. Our conceptual model is supported empirically. We present results from a survey carried out in 2008 on the sample of 199 organizations operating in Poland. The results support the existence of five separate time contradictions: nature of time; structure of time; temporal frame of reference; experience of time; and time flow. We focus on the relations between time contradictions and corporate entrepreneurship understood from the perspectives of entrepreneurial management and entrepreneurial orientation. We argue that organizations that take into consideration our concept into management practice, will achieve higher effectiveness.","[Gabrys, Bartlomiej; Bratnicki, Mariusz] Univ Econ, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,,bargab@ue.katowice.pl; mabrat@ue.katowice.pl,,,,,,,61,0,0,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,327,336,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800041,0

It entails specifying the organisation's vision, mission and objectives; then developing policies and plans which are designed to achieve these objectives through allocating resources in the most optimal ways. The achievement or otherwise of mission and objectives is dependent on a number of factors including quality of management, governance, monitoring and evaluation of performance outcomes. The public sector management however is new to this way of thinking, particularly in the developing countries such as Nigeria. The late 1970s through 1980s and 1990s witnessed the introduction of strategic management in Europe and USA to improve government service offerings. The United Kingdom for example streamlined civil service along market principles with significant improvement in performance and reduction in operational costs. These are the measurable benefits of strategic planning in the public sector. The evidence from Nigeria appears to differ significantly compared with developed countries and the nation has not benefited from the benefits of strategic planning, which have been employed with significant success and reduced bureaucracy in developed nations. Due to this failure, there is large-scale wastage of resources and abysmal performance in the public enterprise in Nigeria with the resultant effect that a nation with huge resources and potential is home to largest population of poor people in Africa. This paper argues that in order to improve service delivery as well as optimise costs, the Nigerian Government would need to adopt strategic management in its public enterprise with active monitoring and evaluation mechanism. We further argue that the process of strategic management is likely to encourage accountability and the issues of good governance as well as democratic processes in the country. Such a process will help in creating an enabling environment that would enhance the relationship between public and private sector organisations as they very much depend on one another. Overall direction will be set for macro-economic framework and economic institutions that would be seamlessly linked, creating conducive environment for higher productivity, performance, and reduction of extreme poverty and hunger.","[Gbande, Cephas; Jekelle-Mohammed, Helen Elena] Nasarawa State Univ, Keffi, Nigeria",,,cephasgbande@yahoo.co.uk; hejekelle@hotmail.com,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,346,352,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800043,0

Questions of what type of adult (citizen/subject) the education system should produce are directly articulated. From the point of view of social analysis, however, the actual production of subjectivities in schools remains a relatively opaque matter. Not only do many contradictory strands of political discourse exist side by side, but, even more importantly, the impact of these discourses on actual pedagogic practice is not direct. Moreover, it is doubtful that any pedagogic practice has the subjectifying effects that educators imagine. This paper examines educational rhetoric and practice in China's 'education for quality' (suzhi jiaoyu) reforms.

The performance of an acquisition is measured by comparing the acquisition's motives with its outcomes. The acquisitions were divided into three types: horizontal, vertical and conglomerate. The result of this research implicates that the so-called strategic and organizational fit between companies involved in M&A play an important role in improving the operational performance of the acquired companies in the post-acquisition period.

The results show that market access is statistically significant and quantitatively important in explaining cross-county variation in Romanian wages. Moreover, our results are robust to the inclusion of control variables thought to be important in explaining Romanian wages as it is the case with human capital and innovation levels. After controlling for these variables, market access remains still positive and statistically significant although its influence on wages decreases around 25 per cent.

The commercialization needs of social sciences and humanities (SSH) researchers which constitute a major brain power in the universities are largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a commercialization map for SSH disciplines by searching, extracting, and analysing the relevant existing literature. In addition, we have gathered evidence through internet search and content analysis of some successful case studies on commercialization of SSH research. This report provides insights and recommendations for both the policy makers and university administrators which could be used in developing the core strengths of universities and increased commercialization of SSH research.

The literature review discusses the fairness criteria advanced by Smith (1776) (Smith's tax canon) and the identified 'unfairness characteristics' of CGT. The correspondence analysis only tests the theories advanced in the literature review and reveals that there are potential sources of unfairness inherent in the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962 (the Eighth Schedule). These include the possibility that CGT gives rise to double tax and imposes a high burden on taxpayers' ability to bear the tax load. The findings are relevant in practical terms in that they may have policy implications for subsequent revisions to the Eight Schedule.

To a significant extent, however, the conceptual boundaries of the corporate governance debate have been set narrowly in accordance with the logic and language of the dominant 'agency' paradigm of governance. According to agency theory, the central problem of corporate governance is the question of how to minimize the (harmful) consequences of the separation of ownership and control within public companies first identified by Berle and Means (1932), by reference to competitive market pressures coupled with market-based incentive and disciplinary mechanisms. In this article, we present an alternative interpretation of the corporate governance problem premised on the logic and language of institution rather than the market, which we argue is both more empirically relevant and conceptually defensible than the dominant agency paradigm. To this end, we rely on some fundamental and longstanding doctrines of Anglo-American corporate law in conjunction with recent developments in the economic theory of the firm. According to the proposed 'institutional' model of corporate governance, the central governance problem is that of how to exploit, rather than minimize, the (beneficial) consequences of the separation of ownership and control, so as to engender the development of a more sustainable system of governance than that emanating from the free interplay of (stock) market forces. After setting out the key conceptual underpinnings of our revived institutional model, we analyse how worker involvement in corporate decision-making might be advanced as a way of instrumentalizing this framework within firm-level governance practices.","[Moore, Marc T.] UCL, Fac Laws, London WC1H 0EG, England; [Reberioux, Antoine] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, F-92000 Nanterre, France",University of London; University College London; Universite Paris Nanterre,"Moore, MT (通讯作者)，UCL, Fac Laws, Bentham House, London WC1H 0EG, England.",marc.moore@ucl.ac.uk; antoine.reberioux@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,88,17,20,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

They bring into being a new approach to business opportunities that resolves the dualistic divide between business ventures and altruistic endeavours, in favour of a new logic based on the creation of economic value beyond corporate boundaries while improving the social and ecological environments. Despite the recent surge of research interest on this topic, there remains a lack of understanding of the nature of this phenomenon. Therefore, there is a need to define boundaries, connect theoretical fields and provide deeper explanations of sustainability entrepreneurship beyond current approaches to corporate sustainability and social entrepreneurship. This paper seeks to address some of these issues by focusing on the distinctive importance of sustainability entrepreneurship within entrepreneurship research and developing a conceptual framework aimed at mapping out the field while at the same time adhering to empirical relevance. In doing so, we define sustainability entrepreneurship as the scholarly examination of how and by whom opportunities to create future goods and services are recognised, evaluated, and exploited, while improving the development of society, the economy and the environment, allowing future generations to meet their own needs. Based on this definition, we draw upon literature on entrepreneurship theory and sustainable development and propose three avenues for further research on this topic: theoretical and empirical definition of sustainability entrepreneurs, the process of development of sustainability-oriented venture opportunities and the interaction between institutions and sustainability entrepreneurship. Within each avenue we pose relevant research questions that are of both descriptive and explanatory nature, and aim to bring closer the conceptual and empirical aspects of sustainability entrepreneurship. Focusing on these dimensions and questions helps visualise and analyse currently disparate conditions, features, and outcomes of sustainability entrepreneurship, thus increasing the intensity and quality of future theoretical and empirical work.","[Munoz, Pablo; Dimov, Dimo] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,,pablo.munoz@newcastle.ac.uk; dimo.dimov@newcastle.ac.uk,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,20,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,684,691,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800082,0

A large part of the literature on this topic depends on the two main theories; product life cycle and Rogers's adopter categorization. These two models consider consumers being passive. In fact, active participation of consumers in innovation development process could enhance the success of innovations. In this theoretical study, a critical literature review has been accomplished in order to understand the role of consumers in innovation development process and its effects on the success of innovations. Categorization of current literature in a prosumer based view reflects that all the related theories on innovation development take into account buyer characteristics and behaviour. However, they are not concerned about suppliers' new product development and marketing activities as proactive variables. Moreover, not only introduction and diffusion but also adoption and consumption stages of innovations are also the main factors affecting the success of innovations in the market. Only demand or supply side factors might only partly succeed. The new innovation development perspective, which is proposed in this study, encompasses all the related variables under varying factors where many of them are context dependent. Thus, this view strengthens the studies and application in innovation development with consumer's integration. This perspective could be worked in a balancing and iterative way. After all, new products that perfectly meet consumers' needs and wants can be developed, which then succeed in the market.","[Nacar, Ramazan; Gozlu, Sitki] Istanbul Tech Univ, TR-80626 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,,nacar@itu.edu.tr; gozlus@itu.edu.tr,"NACAR, Ramazan/A-2016-2016","NACAR, Ramazan/0000-0002-4443-974X",,,,,17,0,0,0,13,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,692,699,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800083,0

The principal component of these descriptions and illustrations, and the core of this reputation, was the tropical island landscape and the first impressions formed from onboard a ship as islands were approached from the sea. Because of the highly competitive nature of the tourism industry, this longstanding reputation was maintained. While this strategy has been effective, there has been increasing interest in diversifying the Caribbean tourism product and creating a sense of distinction between destinations. The islands' identities have the potential to form the basis of this distinction, but this has largely been prevented by the ongoing reliance on the externally-oriented reputation. This paper examines the legacy of the Caribbean's longstanding reputation based on landscape as characterised in modern tourism promotions.","Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Geog & Geol, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA",Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University,"Nelson, V (通讯作者)，Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Geog & Geol, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA.",vnelson@shsu.edu,,,,,,,40,8,10,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In order to evaluate the effects of the implementation of a quality management system on the degree of satisfaction of customers and on the financial performance, we have undergone a questionnaire based research at the level of the SMEs in Romania. In the same time, one of the purposes was to determine the nature of the existing correlation between the degree of fulfilment of these requirements and the level of maturity of the quality management system implemented by these enterprises. As a result of the research we can conclude that the implementation of a quality management system according to the standard ISO 9001 had a positive impact on the SMEs capacity to satisfy customer requirements, ensuring their orientation towards attaining sustainable development. On the other hand, it was established that there is a positive correlation between the degree of fulfilment of these requirements and the level of maturity of the quality management system implemented according to the standard ISO 9001.","[Olaru, Marieta; Sandru, Diana] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Stoleriu, Ghiorghita] SC Tecnoserv Bucuresti SA, Bucharest, Romania; [Sandru, Diana] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Langa, Claudia] SC Romsir SRL, Bals, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Olaru, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",olaru.marieta@gmail.com; g.stoleriu@gmail.com; diana_sandru@yahoo.com; claudia@energie-verde.ro,"Olaru, Marieta/A-2032-2017; Olaru, Marieta/AAL-1550-2020",,CNCSIS -UEFISCSU [273//2007],CNCSIS -UEFISCSU(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)),"This work was supported by CNCSIS -UEFISCSU, through the ID_ 856 PNII - IDEI project, code 273//2007.",,15,0,0,0,7,TECHNICAL UNIV CLUJ-NAPOCA,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"28 MEMORANDUMULUI STREET, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400114, ROMANIA",,,978-973-662-614-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,151,154,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDA57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312344600034,0

Prior work: We based our approach on previous studies concerning knowledge sharing scale derived from De Vries, Van den Hoof and De Ridder (2006). Also, for relational social capital, we used a scale that integrated items from Doosje, Ellemers and Spears' (1995). Regarding worker behavior on changes, we used scales derived from Bennerbroek Gravenhorst (2003) to measure outcome expectation and support for change. Design/mythology/approach: This paper reports the findings of an online survey carried out to access the knowledge sharing practice concerning the context of changes in IT small and medium enterprises, located in Iasi, Romania. Findings: Information collected from the survey participants helped to answer the study research questions. The results indicate that individuals knowledge sharing can be influenced by context of changes. Research limitations/implications: The first limitation is the sample size. Another was the predominantly male demographic within the IT industries. Moreover, the study did not involve any attempt to examine different perspectives based on gender, or geographic location. Originality/value: The study is unique because it offers the perspective of individuals react in time of changes concerning the knowledge sharing culture.","[Pohontu, Alexandru-Ionut; Rusu, Costache] Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Iasi, Iasi, Romania",GH Asachi Technical University,,ai.pohontu@gmail.com; crusu@cetex.tuiasi.ro,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,6,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,241,244,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900061,0

However, studies focusing on the managerial level distinguish between different types of innovation, while studies at the shopfloor level regard innovation as a homogenous activity. No previous studies have explicitly accounted for innovation heterogeneity in relation to the adoption of new HRM practices at the shopfloor level. Thus, it is still an open question whether and to what extent the findings at the managerial level apply to the shopfloor level. We address this question by focusing on the introduction of exploitative technological innovation and the adoption of new HRM practices at the firm's lowest hierarchical level. We suggest a positive relation between the two via the firm's productive capabilities as employees' ability and learning incrementally improve the firm's existing products and processes.

Almost all have potential dangers and perhaps an undesirable impact on economy or society. This calls for their regulation through law to ensure safety and security. However, side-effects from this exist, as each country decides on these issues autonomously. One very important is competitiveness. Additionally this doesn't only influence the development of the new technology itself but also its home market and through this the national infrastructure and labour market. This paper identifies the various levels and areas where legal regulation can take place as well as their drawbacks and advantages regarding competitiveness, both between companies and between countries. Typically at the start of a new technology little or no information on the dangers exists, rendering decisions on prohibitions or restrictions very difficult. Which types of regulation can still be useful and reduce competitiveness to the least possible extent or even improve it is investigated.","[Sonntag, Michael] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Informat Proc & Microprocessor Technol FIM, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,,sonntag@fim.uni-linz.ac.at,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,UNIVERSITATSVERLAG RUDOLF TRAUNER,LINZ,"KOGLSTR 14, 4020 LINZ, AUSTRIA",,,978-3-85499-873-0,SCHRIFTEN INFORMATIK,,,2011,36.0,,,,,,131,139,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYL01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299185000013,0

Four external knowledge linkages were considered (search strategies, external R&D, research collaboration, and protection mechanisms) and their impact on innovative performance in terms of generating innovative revenue is empirically examined. Findings show that SMEs and large enterprises differ. First, the mix of external knowledge linkages is less relevant for SMEs. SMEs use external knowledge sourcing less than large enterprises, but use them more intensely if they do. SMEs also benefit from a limited set of external R&D channels and have less collaboration partners than large enterprises. SMEs benefit more from using protection mechanisms than large companies.

The psychological contract that exists between employees and organisations is brittle due to many organisational changes that stem from organisational restructuring. When psychological contracts are breached, employees may experience reduced commitment to the organisation. The target population for this study consisted of all employees working at three recently-merged higher education institutions in the Nelson Mandela Metropolis (n=100) and a self-administered questionnaire was distributed amongst staff. The results indicated that an increase in the number of positive human resource management (HRM) practices reported by respondents correlated with a decrease in violation and breach of the psychological contract, despite organisational restructuring. It was further revealed that effective management of the psychological contract is crucial during organisational restructuring, in order to maintain the commitment and loyalty of employees.","[Theron, Anthonie Van Straaten] Sovereign Foods Investment Ltd, Uttenhage, South Africa; [Dodd, Nicole Marguerite] Univ Zululand, Dept Ind Psychol, Zululand, South Africa",University of Zululand,"Theron, AV (通讯作者)，Sovereign Foods Investment Ltd, Uttenhage, South Africa.",,"Dodd, Nicole/M-6181-2017","Dodd, Nicole/0000-0001-6863-8535",,,,,26,8,13,1,30,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"RM EMS 4-51, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Efficiency of corporate governance is defined by the degree of governance structures' adjustment to poor performance. Efficient systems of corporate governance should replace poorly performing managers. In this aspect turnover-performance relationship can be viewed as an indicator of corporate governance efficiency. In this paper we analyze the turnover-performance relationship in Croatian state owned companies. Croatia, as a transitional economy, still has a relatively high share of state ownership. We find that reasons for top management turnover in Croatian state owned companies are primarily politically influenced and the results of our empirical research shows that there is a weaker relationship between forced turnover and performance in Croatian companies where the State is the dominant shareholder in comparison to privately owned companies.","[Tipuric, Darko; Mesin, Marina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia; [Lovrincevic, Marina] Univ Split, Fac Econ & Business, Split, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Split,"Tipuric, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",dtipuric@efzg.hr; mmesin@efzg.hr; mlovrinc@efst.hr,"Lovrincevic, Marina/GLV-0991-2022; Lovrincevic, Marina/AGK-6356-2022; Lovrincevic, Marina/F-8443-2017; Tipuric, Darko/H-8301-2018","Tipuric, Darko/0000-0001-8785-0179",,,,,8,0,0,0,4,UNIV MARIBOR,KRANJ,"FAC ORG SCI, ECENTER, KIDRICEVA CESTA 55A, KRANJ, 4000, SLOVENIA",,,978-961-232-249-6,,,,2011,,,,,,,131,138,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8BC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000403116000016,0

However, should the conditions for an abusive refusal to deal be satisfied, then margin squeezes should be prohibited even when prices are not predatory. It is sufficient that they are exclusionary. According to the U. S. Supreme Court decision in linkLine, when a vertically integrated company is not subject to an obligation to supply, there cannot be a margin-squeeze case. However, the Court does not establish how to define a margin squeeze when there is an antitrust duty to supply. In those circumstances, the EC approach in the Deutsche Telekom case helps to identify a standard.

To positively affect opportunities for active transport, public health and transport professionals are engaging with other sectors, including urban planning, housing, recreation, retail, education, and employer groups. A first step in such inter-sectoral collaboration is to understand the perceptions of key players in all of these sectors. This paper describes the results of structured interviews with senior and middle-level administrators from public, private, and community groups in a rapidly developing region in Queensland, Australia, to assess the perceived barriers and enablers to active transport. Key themes emerged relating to infrastructure delivery, public transport services, walk- and cycle-friendly community attributes, political leadership and government coordination, and societal travel norms and culture. There were also themes relating to limits due to resources and limited relevant technical expertise, institutional and practitioner cultures, and agencies not identifying with their roles in active transport. Policies and cross-government initiatives were seen to hold promise, including economic incentives and built environment guidelines, campaigns targeting public attitudes and opinions, and community participation in policy-making. These elements are potential keys to positively promoting comprehensive active transport initiatives among gatekeepers and leaders across different sectors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The study is a comparative investigation. Eight countries are mentioned: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Conclusions are that the decentralization process in Latin America reveals that the social political context affects the model applied by the countries under study, based on the changes and continuities of the implemented social policy patterns. Also, the absence of pure transference models for health competence is observed.

The data set is unusual, in that all forecasts are in the form of probabilities. Bets are made on paper against quoted market betting odds according to the (fractional) Kelly criterion. To identify expertise, individual forecasters are scored using conventional probability scoring rules, a Kelly score representing the forecaster's historical paper profits from Kelly-betting, and the more simplistic categorical score (number of misclassifications). Despite implicitly truncating all probabilities to either 0 or 1 before evaluation, and thus losing a lot of information, the categorical scoring rule appears to be a propitious way of ranking probability forecasters.

Instead, many papers have been written about the efficiency of sports betting markets. As it turns out, it is possible to derive a considerable amount of information about the forecasts and the forecasting process from studies that have tested the markets for economic efficiency. Moreover, the huge number of observations provided by betting markets makes it possible to obtain robust tests of various forecasting hypotheses. This paper is concerned with a number of forecasting topics in horse racing and several team sports. The first topic involves the type of forecast that is made: picking a winner or predicting whether a particular team will beat the point spread. Different evaluation procedures will be examined and alternative forecasting methods (models, experts, and the market) compared. The paper also examines the evidence with regard to the existence of biases in the forecasts, and concludes by discussing the applicability of these results to forecasting in general.

We show how several popular reform scenarios are geared either towards young or old workers or, indeed, both groups under appropriate conditions.

The existing empirical record is ambiguous and leaves unanswered many of the important questions facing policy-makers. To test some predictions driving the case for capital account liberalization in developing countries, this article investigates the relationship between net capital inflows and medium-term economic growth within a sample of rich, institutionally advanced economies between 1984 and 2004. No evidence of a strong or statistically robust relationship between net capital inflows and future economic growth is found. On the contrary, the evidence suggests that net capital inflows are more strongly associated with past economic growth than with future economic growth. This result implies that capital account liberalization is not likely to boost growth, even among countries with the most appropriate institutions and policies.","[van Hulten, Andrew] Victoria Univ, Ctr Strateg Econ Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Webber, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Sch Resource Management & Geog, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",Victoria University; University of Melbourne,"van Hulten, A (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Ctr Strateg Econ Studies, 300 Flinders St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",Andrew.Van-Hulten@vu.edu.au,,,,,,,114,3,3,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

I argue that this is not generally true when public-sector actors also lobby. Where the effectiveness of advocacy depends on total expenditures, some initial amount of privatization always decreases industry-expanding advocacy. The extent of privatization for which this no longer holds depends on the total benefits of provision to the public and private-sector actors, as well as the extent of collusion. Under relaxed assumptions, the effect of privatization on industry-expanding advocacy is ambiguous. The charge that privatization will increase advocacy is unfounded without further empirical development. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this concept is to increase or at least to stabilize the well-being per capita of the planet over time while preserving the interests of present and future generations. The measurement of the contribution of an economic entity (State, Institution, Enterprise, etc.) to the sustainability poses a problem today and is subject to several debates. The mass of information to treat and to integrate in the political strategies private and public is such that it is impossible in the reality of all days. It is that a series of actors are beginning to identify tools and scoreboards which, through a series of indicators, allow guide them in their daily work. Based on the information provided by the organizational entities themselves and the information made public, the approach of sustainable value constitutes today the approach most accomplished to assess the sustainable performance. The aim of this research is to adapt this methodology to the assessment of sustainability of countries. The sustainability performance of the fifteen European countries (EU-15) will be analyzed based in the sustainable value approach. The case of a country of the Eastern Europe (The Czech Republic) is also analyzed. The study period is five years (2002-2006) in order to see the evolution of the integration of sustainable development in Europe since the last Summit in Johannesburg. Sustainable value is a monetary measure of the actual value created by the country's use of a bundle of economic, environmental and social resources. A country creates positive (or negative) Sustainable value if it earns a higher (or lower) return than the average (EU-15) with its available economic, environmental and social resources. The analysis of country's sustainability performance based on the Sustainable value approach looks at the use of nineteen different economic, environmental and social resources. The results reveal a mixed pattern when it comes to the sustainability performance of each country. Germany and Netherlands are the countries leaders respectively in terms of the absolute Sustainable value and the Sustainable value margin. Both countries create extremely positive Sustainable value over the entire reviewed period. Germany use the majority of economic, environmental and social resources considered in a value creating way. The Czech Republic is the country that improved the efficiency of the use of its economic, environmental and social resources most.","[Ben Rhouma, Amel] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic; [Ben Rhouma, Amel] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France",University of Pardubice; IPAG Business School,"Ben Rhouma, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",amel.benrhouma@ipag.fr,,,,,,,5,6,6,1,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Despite all of the great deal of research effort, there remains a dearth of research that examines the dimensions of consumer guilt by providing a more complete understanding. The present study represents an attempt to develop a phenomenological account of consumer guilt and broaden the understanding of the dimensions and dynamics of consumer guilt grounded in consumers' lived experiences by using in-depth interviews and projective data. Regarding this, a thorough analysis revealed the existence of five dimensions of consumer guilt, namely, hesitation, sadness, reluctance to spend, regret and self-blame. Consumer guilt is felt due to transgressions, self-control failures and indulgence in hedonistic desires. The findings show that guilt feelings are found to be cyclic, short-lived and superficial and mostly arise as a result of good and bad actions but not always of right versus wrong actions. In the consumption society, guilt is attached to new concerns brought about by cultural drift.","[Dedeoglu, Ayla Ozhan; Kazancoglu, Ipek] Ege Univ, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Izmir, Turkey",Ege University,"Dedeoglu, AÖ (通讯作者)，Ege Univ, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Izmir, Turkey.",ayla.dedeoglu@ege.edu.tr; ipek.savasci@ege.edu.tr,,"OZHAN DEDEOGLU, AYLA/0000-0002-0179-0644; Kazancoglu, Ipek/0000-0001-8251-5451",,,,,67,13,19,4,54,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

It has thus become critical for marketers to ascertain the perceptions and attitudes of consumers regarding their acceptance of foreign products. The most commonly used instrument for this purpose is the 'Consumer Ethnocentric Tendencies Scale' ('CETSCALE') (Shimp and Sharma 1987), which has been validated in several developed economies, but which has not been applied and validated in many developing economies. The present study addresses this gap by applying 'CETSCALE' among 484 consumers in the developing market of North Cyprus. The study confirms the scale's validity and reliability in the setting of North Cyprus. Consumers' ethnocentrism is shown to be positively related to intention to purchase domestically produced goods. The study also analyses the relationships between certain demographic characteristics and consumers' ethnocentrism.

We apply cost-benefit analysis techniques to estimate the present value of Stone pine afforestation net benefit by considering an infinite series of forestry rotations. We simulate three Stone pine silviculture models at each of the two sites. In addition, we estimate landowner extended net benefits from Stone pine afforestation when we consider a hypothetical payment for the carbon sequestration service. Results show that, when government subsidies are included, Stone pine afforestation only offers positive landowner net benefit in Portillo when both medium and high-stocking silviculture models are applied. Taking into account carbon prices up to (sic)45 tC(-1) ((sic)12.3 tCO(2)(-1)), Stone pine afforestation gives landowner positive extended net benefits for the three silviculture models simulated at the Portillo and Viana sites.

We aim to answer the following questions: What are the main determinants that drive the demand and supply in the Czech Republic's credit market? What was the development of credit demand and credit supply? Whether the slowdown in the growth of the volume of credits disbursed was caused by demand or supply factors. The degree of equilibrium in the Czech credit market is assessed subsequently. We came to conclusion that the credit demand in the Czech Republic is a function of one-quarter-lagged gross domestic product, investments, capital market index PX50 and interest rate on loans. The effects of all variables except for interest rate are in line with expectations. Credit supply in the Czech Republic is a function of deposits, industrial production, interest rate on loans and classified loans. The results suggest that a considerable disequilibrium was typical for Czech credit market over the last ten years. During most of the period, the level of provided loans was determined by credit demand. From the second quarter of 2006, the volume of loans provided has been determined by credit supply. The decline in the volume of credits disbursed during 1998 2002 was caused by supply factors. Furthermore, we found that the Czech credit market suffered from a credit crunch in the first half of 2001 when the credit demand overhang substantially exceeded the limit of double standard deviation.","[Stavarek, Daniel; Vodova, Pavia] Slezska Univ Opave, Obchodne Podnikatelska Fak Karvine, Katedra Financi, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Stavárek, D (通讯作者)，Slezska Univ Opave, Obchodne Podnikatelska Fak Karvine, Katedra Financi, Opava, Czech Republic.",stavarek@opf.slu.cz; vodova@opf.slu.cz,"Stavárek, Daniel/A-7134-2010; Klepkova Vodova, Pavla/ABG-2948-2020","Stavárek, Daniel/0000-0001-5061-1721; Klepkova Vodova, Pavla/0000-0003-0382-5174",,,,,22,3,3,0,8,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Then the paper describes the utility factors of VCs and WOM in the purchasing process based on reviewing literature. It also proposes a conceptual model which indicates the utilities of WOM in VC on consumer purchasing decisions. Moreover, it supplies some focused marketing strategies.","[Wang Qianyu; Yang Xuecheng] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,,wqy1215@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,4,ORIENT ACAD FORUM,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204, AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,2010,,,,,,,230,235,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS34,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287959400038,0

Competitiveness in world trade depends, among other factors, on a country's level of connectivity and its integration in the global container liner service network. Recent investigations show that spatial frictions are considerably influenced by the level of connectivity rather than the pure notion of distance. Technological advances, i.e. increases in ship size, demand growth in trade volumes and concentration in the liner shipping industry, are constant drivers of change in the structure of liner services. What has been the effect of market concentration in the liner shipping industry on emerging markets in terms of service levels and competition? Based on the analyses of the evolution of liner shipping services in the period from 2000 to 2009, this research addresses the expansion of hierarchical liner service network structures and market concentration, focussing on South America as an example of emerging markets. The results identify the effect of economic downturns on liner shipping networks in network peripheral markets and the potentially detrimental effects on the competitiveness of countries and regions beyond the general challenges that come from a less favourable economic climate.","[Wilmsmeier, Gordon] Edinburgh Napier Univ, TRI, Edinburgh EH10 5DT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sanchez, Ricardo J.] UNECLAC, Nat Resources & Infrastruct Div, Infrastruct Serv Unit, Santiago, Chile",Edinburgh Napier University,"Wilmsmeier, G (通讯作者)，Edinburgh Napier Univ, TRI, Merchiston Campus, Edinburgh EH10 5DT, Midlothian, Scotland.",g.wilmsmeier@napier.ac.uk; ricardo.SANCHEZ@eclac.org,"Wilmsmeier, Gordon/K-3509-2016; Wilmsmeier, Gordon/ABG-9749-2020","Wilmsmeier, Gordon/0000-0001-8848-9004; Sanchez, Ricardo J/0000-0002-2676-2543",,,,,55,12,12,1,20,BUCHENVERLAG,BAD SODEN,"POSTFACH 1128, BAD SODEN, 65796, GERMANY",0044-3751,,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Localism, Content, and the Federal Communications Commission",JOURNAL OF MEDIA ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NEWS,"This study examines the relation between local news content and ownership structure in 17 television markets in the United States. It is an extension of the localism research that was conducted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2004 and the Local Television News Media Project at the University of Delaware in 2007 (see FCC, 2007). The findings point to the need to consider television markets as the appropriate unit of analysis when examining the effect of ownership on local content. Ownership does matter in the production of news on local broadcasts. When examining only station-level factors, independent stations broadcast more local content on their newscasts than those stations that were either (a) owned-and-operated (OO) and part of a duopoly, (b) OO-only, or (c) part of a duopoly-only. However, when examining station-level and market-level factors of television markets, the station-level ownership profiles positively affected local content. Market-level factors that indicated more consolidation negatively affected the proportion of local news presented in the entire designated market area.","Univ Delaware, Sch Urban Affairs & Publ Policy, Ctr Community Res & Serv, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware,"Yanich, D (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Sch Urban Affairs & Publ Policy, Ctr Community Res & Serv, Graham Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",dyanich@udel.edu,,,,,,,35,6,11,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

The exact method of identifying the recipient's needs varies, as does the range of the information and assistance provided. Impressive results have been reported in terms of changes in behaviour but there remains some scepticism about the reliability of the data used to estimate changes in behaviour and about the shortage of independent assessments. This paper summarises evidence and opinions on the robustness of the published results of PTP campaigns and concludes that, although the prominently published results show a degree of consistency, serious questions remain about the reliability of the methods used to produce these results and about the possibility of systematic bias. It is argued that the possibility of systematic bias undermines the weight that would otherwise be given to the consistency in published results. It is suggested that future evaluations should put more weight on independent and objective monitoring of effects but that it is unrealistic to expect any affordable evaluation to yield a robust, transferable and incontrovertible result.

Changes in talent distribution are observed by analyzing player mobility; an empirical model of player transfers is developed and tested.

In many countries, particularly in France, this tool is used to support decision-making related to transportation infrastructure. In the context of difficult budgetary arbitrations, taking the multiple effects of the different choices into account makes choosing among transport infrastructure investments a two-fold problem. On the one hand, public decision-makers have limited resources that they must use in the best way possible. On the other hand, when choosing among alternative investment projects, the decision-makers reveal their priorities (based on the importance they assign to the different projects), and these priorities must be perceived as legitimate. Based on a case study of how French institutions use the CBA method, this paper examines how the use of cost-benefit analysis interacts with the use of public debate and stakeholder participation in France today. This French case illustrates the difficulty of striking the right balance between the expert knowledge produced by CBA methods and the knowledge produced by the participation of various stakeholders in the decision-making process.

Whereas knowledge leadership capabilities used to be inside global corporations now they have given way to university laboratories and dedicated biotechnology firm networks to access innovative research. The basic argument is that research centre and small firm knowledge capabilities have generally outstripped those of the multinationals in knowledge-intensive industry, a consequence of which is a re-alignment in cause-and-effect outcomes shaping economic geography. This is particularly pronounced in biosciences and pharmaceuticals. The paper mobilises a new theoretical framework and new data that support the thesis that a realignment of industry organisation around knowledge capabilities was pioneered in biosciences, is active in other industries, and biosciences is now entering a new phase. This mirrors a rise in systems biology that re-asserts the dominance of key nodes in global bioeconomy hierarchies.","[Cooke, Philip] Cardiff Univ, Ctr Adv Studies, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Cooke, Philip] Cardiff Univ, CESAGen, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University; Cardiff University,"Cooke, P (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Ctr Adv Studies, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",Cookepn@cf.ac.uk,"Cooke, Philip/GRO-1618-2022; CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022",,,,,,41,7,7,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Besides all other benefits, industrial research collaboration significantly contributes to technological convergence, which is one of the major sources of contemporary innovations. Not all technological convergences, however, are the same. Some technologies converge more often than others, while other technologies rarely but newly converge as like entrepreneurs take new trials. This paper tries to measure the 'entrepreneurship' of technological convergence formed through industrial research collaboration by utilizing a methodology borrowed from Teece, et al. (1994). This methodology, initially developed to measure 'business diversification,' is applied to two sets of industrial research collaboration data-research joint ventures formed in the U.S. and cooperative research projects carried out in Korea. This empirical analysis shows that technological convergences through industrial research collaboration in both countries are not random but strategic behavior. However, the technological convergences formed through research joint ventures in the U.S. are more strategic and entrepreneurial than those in Korea. These results imply that public policies should explicitly take into account industrial research collaboration as an effective facilitator of technological convergence and also that the bigger and more diverse industrial research collaborations under an autonomous environment might result in more strategic and entrepreneurial technological convergences.","Specialty Construct Ctr, Sci & Technol Policy Inst, Seoul 156714, South Korea","Science & Technology Policy Institute (STEPI), Republic of Korea","Jang, Y (通讯作者)，Specialty Construct Ctr, Sci & Technol Policy Inst, 20th Fl,44 Borame Gil, Seoul 156714, South Korea.",jang@stepi.re.kr,"Jang, Yongsuk/A-9712-2009; Pereira, Fernanda/AID-4926-2022",,,,,,10,5,5,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

This article proves that loyalty discounts can create anticompetitive effects, not only because they can impair rival efficiency, but also because loyalty discounts can perversely discourage discounting even when they have no effect on rival efficiency. The essential reason, missed in prior work, is that firms using loyalty discounts have less incentive to compete for free buyers, because any price reduction to win sales to free buyers will, given the loyalty discount, also lower prices to loyal buyers. This in turn reduces the incentive of rivals to cut prices, because there will exist an above-cost price that rivals can charge to free buyers without being undercut by the firm using loyalty discounts. These anticompetitive effects occur even if buyers can breach or terminate commitments, and even if the loyalty conditions require no buyer commitments and less than 100 percent loyalty. These anticompetitive effects also differ from those created by most-favored-nation or price-matching clauses, neither of which requires the seller to commit to maintain a price difference between loyal and disloyal buyers. Further, I prove that these anticompetitive effects are exacerbated if multiple sellers use loyalty discounts. None of the results depend on switching costs, market differentiation, imperfect competition, or whether the loyalty discount bundles contestable and incontestable demand. Contrary to commonly held views, I prove that these anticompetitive effects exist even (1) when all prices are above seller or rival costs, (2) buyers voluntarily agree to the conditions, and (3) discount and foreclosure levels are low, although such low levels do lower the likelihood that buyers would agree to anticompetitive loyalty discounts. I also derive formulas for calculating the inflated price levels in each situation. However, because loyalty discounts can have efficiencies, rule of reason analysis remains appropriate.","Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Elhauge, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",elhauge@law.harvard.edu,,,ESRC [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,41,19,22,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

It is therefore meaningful to distinguish between institutional economic geography and evolutionary economic geography as their explanans is different. Yet the two approaches can be combined in a dynamic framework in which institutions coevolve with organizational routines, particularly in emerging industries. Furthermore, integrating the evolutionary and institutional approach allows one to analyze the spatial diffusion of organizational routines that mediate conflicts among social groups, in particular, those between employers and employees. An evolutionary economic geography advocates an empirical research program, both qualitative and quantitative, that can address the relative importance of organizational routines and territorial institutions for regional development.","[Boschma, Ron; Frenken, Koen] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Sect Econ Geog, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Sect Econ Geog, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, POB 80 115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.boschma@geo.uu.nl; k.frenken@geo.uu.nl,"Frenken, Koen/C-4486-2017","Frenken, Koen/0000-0003-4731-0201",,,,,49,153,171,5,90,ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY,WORCESTER,"CLARK UNIV, WORCESTER, MA 01610 USA",0013-0095,,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Recently, some researchers have sought to delimit and develop an evolutionary economic geography (EEG), aiming to create a more systematic theoretical framework for research. This article provides a sympathetic critique and elaboration of this emergent EEG but takes issue with some aspects of its characterization in recent programmatic statements. While acknowledging that EEG is an evolving and pluralist project, we are concerned that the reliance on certain theoretical frameworks that are imported from evolutionary economics and complexity science threatens to isolate it from other approaches in economic geography, limiting the opportunities for cross-fertilization. In response, the article seeks to develop a social and pluralist conception of institutions and social agency in EEG, drawing upon the writings of leading institutional economists, and to link evolutionary concepts to political economy approaches, arguing that the evolution of the economic landscape must be related to processes of capital accumulation and uneven development. As such, we favor the use of evolutionary and institutional concepts within a geographical political economy approach, rather than the construction of some kind of theoretically separate EEG-evolution in economic geography, not an evolutionary economic geography.","[MacKinnon, Danny; Cumbers, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Pike, Andy] Newcastle Univ, Ctr Urban & Reg Dev Studies, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Birch, Kean] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Geog & Sociol, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland; [McMaster, Robert] Univ Glasgow, Sch Business, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow; Newcastle University - UK; University of Strathclyde; University of Glasgow,"MacKinnon, D (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, E Quadrangle Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Danny.MacKinnon@ges.gla.ac.uk; Andrew.Cumbers@ges.gla.ac.uk; andy.pike@ncl.ac.uk; kean.birch@strath.ac.uk; r.mcmaster@lbss.gla.ac.uk,"Birch, Kean/AAG-1039-2019; Kim, Soohyun/N-6460-2014; Schiller, Gabrielle/H-7617-2012","Pike, Andy/0000-0001-7651-2983; MacKinnon, Danny/0000-0003-2901-5081",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,120,336,371,4,232,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The study is centered on electoral abstention, the transfer of votes among parties, the electoral decline of the other political forces represented in Catalonia and the increase of votes experienced by the Socialist Party, based on the analysis of election results from the different general elections of Deputies to Congress facilitated by the web page of the Spanish Ministry of the Interior. Therefore, conclusions could be made as to whether some determining factor existed to explain the socialist victory or if the victory was due to several factors, as the authors sustain in their party hypothesis.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Polit & Sociol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Sánchez, G (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Polit & Sociol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

However, in spite of the variety of studies, adopted approaches and statistical methodologies to be found it has not been possible to clarify the exact manner and conditions under which HRM can become a source of competitive advantage. This can be explained by the fact that most empirical works have ignored mediating hypothesis and merely examined the direct relationship between High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) and firm performance. This article, attempts to gain further insights into such an analysis by integrating the two main theoretical approaches in this field: The Resource Based New (RBV) of firm and Behavioural Theory. Using a sample of 62 financial firms we examined this mediating and moderating effect of Human Capital and HR Outcomes on the HPWS-Business Performance linkage. Hierarchical Regression Analysis revealed that HPWS was positively related to firm performance, Human Capital and HR outcomes. In addition, the level of Human Capital and HR outcomes mediate the relationship between HPWS and firm performance. These results shed new light on the mechanisms through which HPWS impacts business performance.","[Garcia Pardo, Isidro Pena; Fernandez Moreno, Ma del Valle] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Law & Socials Sci Ciudad Real, Dept Business Adm, Business Org Area, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Pardo, IPG (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Law & Socials Sci Ciudad Real, Dept Business Adm, Business Org Area, Ronda de Toledo S-N, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.",Isidro.Pena@uclm.es; Mariavalle.Fdez@uclm.es,"DEL VALLE FERNÁNDEZ, Mª/AAA-8172-2019; Peña, Isidro/Q-6467-2018","Peña, Isidro/0000-0002-3742-1752",,,,,106,3,4,0,24,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Our primary finding is that the presence of a municipal provider is negatively correlated with a city's having private providers. However, the marginal effects indicate that the effect of municipal competition on private provision is largely concentrated on the first entrant, suggesting cities may choose to provide telecommunications services in areas with inadequate demand to support private provision.","[Hauge, Janice A.; Jewell, R.

It analyses the post war development which started rather smoothly, but was interrupted by two oil shocks and one mini - shock since the 70's until 90's. The recent situation is quite different and no historical parallels or experiences cannot be used as for trends, first-round effects, nor the second-round ones. Recent price growth is lasting for almost a decade already, since 1998 with only minor spells. The authors are identifying some consequences and distinctive features of this rise, trying to introduce structural and geographical analysis for the world economy and international trade. They come into conclusion that the perspective is far from a good one and the prices will grow nominally and in real terms for a longer-term future. That is why the preparation for that is a sheer necessity in many aspects, which the limited frame of the article can only discuss in a rather scatchy way. Specific development of the recently steep failing of prices since September 2008 is not any supply - generated oil shock. It is interconnected with global economic crunch and will probably show parallel trend.

Furthermore, it discusses possible problems which could arise with this new approach.","Univ St Gallen, Dept Management BWA, IDT HSG, PMCE, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Helmuth, U (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Dept Management BWA, IDT HSG, PMCE, Dufourstr 40A, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",utz.helmuth@unisg.ch,,,,,,,40,2,2,0,7,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Strategic planning has been used in Lithuanian government for 10 years now, but little is known about how it is used and the results obtained. Strategic planning system in Lithuania was introduced in 1999. Public expenditure management process follows the principles of strategic planning and program budgeting across all public institutions. Financial resources are allocated according to the priorities (government and ministry level). Each year ministries and Government agencies prepare the strategic action plans where they state the mission; strategic goals; major new reforms; programme goals; results to be achieved and financial resources needed. The strategic plans are approved by Government and published to the society. institutions report on the progress achieved against planned targets. Findings do not show a dramatic expansion in the use of strategic planning, but there is some evidence of growing sophistication, as demonstrated by links to other management and decision-making activities. Managers were enthusiastic about their experiences with strategic planning and largely satisfied with their achievement of goals and objectives. Performance management, on the other hand, is an integrated strategy with the goal of improving the performance of organisations and the individuals in them. Performance management therefore consists of system. Due to the increasing challenge around funding Lithuanian public services, in addition to measuring and managing the quantity and quality of public sector goods and services, much more emphasis is being brought to bear on measuring and managing the cost thereof.","[Isoraite, Margarita] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University,,misorait@mruni.lt,"Išoraitė, Margarita/AAI-2036-2020",,,,,,32,0,0,0,2,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,KAUNAS,"K DONELAICIO 73, KAUNAS LT 3006, LITHUANIA",1822-7090,,,CHANGE SOC BUS ENV,,,2009,,,,,,,132,145,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTW62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288290300020,0

Consistent with the agency theory, some practices are outcome-based that focus on measuring and reporting of the hospital's quality performance, while other practices are behavior-based that mainly deal with actions and processes important to the provision of quality care. Better quality performance is significantly associated with adoption of six practices as well as the existence of a board quality committee.","[Jiang, H.

A standard Cobb-Douglas production function is employed to estimate lite ICT growth effect in 26 industries, during the 1995-2004 period. The obtained empirical evidence suggests that the overall ICT growth performance was generally insignificant in the EU-15 during 19901995, but improved substantially during 2000-04. Furthermore, returns to ICT were significantly higher in ICT producing industries. On lite other hand, EU-10 industries have benefited from the use of ICT.

Three state-owned companies are studied. Shanghai Auto Industry Corporation (SAIC) is a long-established favoured enterprise controlled on rather traditional lines. Chery is a small under-funded latecomer that receives exceptional engagement from its controlling local and provincial government. Guizhou Tyre (GTC) is long-established but also receives exceptional engagement. The firms' governance structures and their processes of technological capability building were tracked and compared. Data on SAIC and Chery was mainly from secondary sources; on GTC, from extensive interviewing of management and site observations. There were two main findings: first, it was the two with unusual engagement which were more successful in developing endogenous or self-reliant technological capability. Second, two alternative technological strategies could be distinguished: bundled or unbundled technology acquisition. Chery and GTC chose unbundling. We show why it was more successful and why it followed from the corporate governance situation.","[Liu, Jiajia; Tylecote, Andrew] Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Tylecote, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",a.tylecote@sheffield.ac.uk,"liu, jiajia/ISS-0316-2023; liu, jia/JAC-7852-2023; liu, jia/HKE-9796-2023; Liu, Jiayu/JCO-5073-2023; Yu, Kun/IAP-9807-2023; li, jiawei/HOA-5023-2023; liu, jiayu/JCP-0511-2023",,ESRC [RES-000-22-1504] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-1504] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,28,21,23,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Code of Administrative Justice court revokes the decision as unlawful if it finds that the administrative authority exceeded the legally defined bounds of discretionary power, or abused it. That means that court has no jurisdiction to review of very substance of administrative discretionary power, but shall review only reaming legally defined bounds inward that the discretionary power can be applied. Conjunctions,discrepancy in laws and,, hardness of the law used in Act No. 337/1992 Coll. to define legal conditions for providing tax relief represent just such legally defined bounds that remaining the administrative court shall review. The conjunctions,, discrepancy in laws and,,hardness of the law simultaneously represent uncertain terms that are different juridical institute from discretionary power.

This paper analyzes the implications of the use of composite commodity price indices in cointegration analysis and tests the validity of the assumptions underlying it. It tests for the presence of a common stochastic trend in disaggregated softwood lumber product price series in multiple US markets, a validity condition supported by the Generalized Composite Commodity Theorem (Lewbel, 1996. Aggregation without separability: a generalized composite commodity theorem. The American Economic Review 86(3), 524-543.). The presence of a common stochastic trend in softwood lumber product price series tested is consistently rejected by Johansen's (1988. Statistical analysis of cointegration vectors. Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 12(2-3), 231-254.) multivariate cointegration analysis. Together with rejection of non-stationarity property for a significantly large number of price series tested, the results highlight the significance of the assumptions underlying the use of composite forest commodity price indices for cointegration analysis.

First, wage functions, allowing for heteroscedasticity and sampled selection bias, for each group are estimated using the Heckman two-stage method. Second, within a static framework, the distributional impacts of tax policy changes are investigated in depth. The results show that, due to the increase of tax-free threshold, the tax revenue and average income tax rate decreased greatly and the higher incomes had higher increase in income after the policy changes. As the tax-free threshold increased, both the tax progressivity and the pro-tax social welfare increased. However, the pro-tax income distribution became more unequal and the redistributive effect of the income tax decreased accordingly.","[Pan, Mei] Xiamen Univ, Dept Publ Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,,panmei0558@hotmail.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-072-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,81,84,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQE61,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280792600019,0

Rather than timeless principles, human rights and the universality proper to them emerge in a process of suffering, conflict, political assertion, and institutional change. We can understand them as historical yet also universal by seeing that human rights arise in processes of social learning that take place in an increasingly globalized world. Such learning often has advanced in the face of dramatic violence, for example, the bombing of Hiroshima. But the demands on a global social ethic today are not only a matter of responding to threats and acts of dramatic violence in isolation. Attention to the example of Hiroshima suggests that the problem of violence is bound up with other questions about the regulation of emerging technical powers in a context of inequality and social conflict. To what extent can an ethic centered on human rights provide an ethics that can inform effective responses to these problems? To consider the promise of human rights, we look more closely at the kind of social learning they involve and explore in particular the role of social movements in forging new identities and reciprocities along with normative claims proper to a global public sphere (the anti-apartheid movement provides an example). We go on to see that these political experiences can inform interpretations of historical experience that can inform a widened sense of historical possibilities, both those missed in the past and those that confront us today. While this argument may thicken our sense of the promise of a human rights ethic, it remains speculative, not least because of the limited effectiveness of these norms in practice today. We close with the suggestion that nonetheless a coherent ethical response is possible, one that in the wealthy parts of the globe might take the form of an ethic of democratic responsibility. This would both represent a distinctive kind of learning and perhaps contribute to a wider advance of human rights.","Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Peterson, RT (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,,9,3,3,0,2,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This paper is a literature review which incorporates several reviews. The conditions and factors surrounding R&D/marketing collaboration problems are presented, discussed, and modelled. An analysis of the genesis and antecedent conditions for conflicts between R&D and marketing is made in order to develop a basic understanding of the causes of their organizational difficulties. The question regarding the necessity of differentiation and integration of these organizational units is also considered here. The conditions under which functional differentiation is needed and the mechanisms for integrating differentiated groups are discussed.

Siding with realist intellectuals who instead emphasize the rootedness of genocide in the structures of modernity and everyday life, I argue that the discourse of singularity aestheticizes historical trauma in problematic ways. Drawing on Kant's analytic of the sublime, in which the subject, in confronting an awesome or terrifying phenomenon from a position of safety, comes to realize his or her own powers of transcendence and moral superiority, I argue that the holocaust sublime encourages the viewing subject to face overwhelming horrors of the past, but without having to confront the subject's actual responsibility for the atrocities of the present. By pitting the extraordinary or singular against the banal and everyday, the holocaust sublime thus obscures, rather than reveals, the habits of thought and social structures that make genocidal practices inevitable.","Worcester Polytech Inst, Worcester, MA USA",Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Sanbonmatsu, J (通讯作者)，Worcester Polytech Inst, Worcester, MA USA.",,,"Sanbonmatsu, John/0009-0002-9053-3427",,,,,41,8,11,0,0,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Data shows that consumer surplus varies between (sic)0.66 per trip to (sic)112 with a median of 4.52 per trip. Results of the model with the best overall summary indicate that the application of the individual travel cost method, inclusion of opportunity cost of time and average distance travelled lead to increasing benefits whereas the year of the study and estimations from theses and dissertations reduce welfare estimates.

Consequently, innovation has not only become a more important topic in the context of the market and the firm, but also in the context of regional growth and development. Network structure of industrial clusters has attracted more and more attention from both researchers and policy makers. Why and how does KIBS embeddings impact the evolution of industrial cluster's network structure? Does the interaction between KIBS and member firms offer an effective way for it? In order to answer these questions and also better understand the roles of KIBS within industrial clusters, this paper takes the perspective of network structure, constructs the optimizing model of cluster network structure based on the embeddedness of KIBS, and then comprehensively reveals the functional mechanism by using three structure constituents, i.e. network structure, network betweenness centrality and network agglomeration, Finally, based on the results of calculation in UCINET6.125 of correlation matrix of cluster network in two phases, we can summarize the optimization of network structure by the change of three indexes, i.e. network density, between centrality and agglomeration.","[Zhu, Haiyan] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Business & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business,,petrel.zhu@gmail.com; weijiang@zju.edu.cn,"yang, liu/GVU-8760-2022; zhu, xueqiong/U-1320-2019; wei, jiang/GRX-7907-2022","zhu, xueqiong/0000-0002-8389-928X;",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,CHINA WATERPOWER PRESS-CWPP,BEIJING,"6 SANLIHELU, FUXINGMENWAI, BEIJING, 100044, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5084-6533-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,246,253,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNO72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275143800030,0

Since television advertising time is purchased on the basis of projected future ratings, and ad costs have skyrocketed, there is increasingly pressure to forecast television ratings accurately. The forecasting methods that have been used in the past are not generally very reliable, and many have not been validated; also, even more distressingly, none have been tested in today's multichannel environment. In this study we compare eight different forecasting models, ranging from a naive empirical method to a state-of-the-art Bayesian model-averaging method. Our data come from a recent time period, namely 2004-2008, in a market with over 70 channels, making the data more typical of today's viewing environment. The simple models that are commonly used in industry do not forecast as well as any econometric models. Furthermore, time series methods are not applicable, as many programs are broadcast only once. However, we find that a relatively straightforward random effects regression model often performs as well as more sophisticated Bayesian models in out-of-sample forecasting. Finally, we demonstrate that making improvements in ratings forecasts could save the television industry between $250 and $586 million per year. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters.

It focuses on a mechanism of self-regulation geared at avoiding market abuses: the use of blackout periods during which insiders are temporarily prohibited from trading on the market. Data concerning corporate characteristics, blackout periods, and internal dealing, seem to indicate that companies with a large number of independent directors and a consistent ability to monitor are more likely to adopt blackout periods. However, the research shows that during 2003 insiders did not comply with Italy's Code of Best Practice; they did not totally refrain from trading during the assigned blackout periods. All three variables measuring frequency trading - the numbers of transactions carried out, of active insiders, and of shares traded - were statistically significant during the specified blackout periods. Therefore, this paper could have practical implications for policy makers. If they decide to adopt self-regulation to fight market abuses, they must be aware that a law is only as effective as its enforcement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We further show that stricter enforcement reduces capital expenditures per employee. These results are consistent with a model in which enforceable noncompetition contracts encourage firms to invest in their managers' human capital. On the other hand, our findings suggest that these contracts also discourage managers from investing in their own human capital and that this second effect is empirically dominant.

Under such a scheme a cap or limit is placed on national CO(2) emissions and individuals are allocated an annual CO(2) allowance. The research presented in this paper focuses on travel-to-work trips specifically. CO(2) emissions for these annual work trips are calculated and a cap is determined based on these results. Cap levels are set based on average emissions and a 20% reduction in average emissions as per Ireland's reduction targets. A national and Dublin only cap are examined and the results are presented as a means of comparison. Binary logistic models are used to determine the socio-economic characteristics of individuals who fall above and below the cap. The results demonstrate the importance of car ownership, journey distance, mode choice and household composition in determining whether a commuter is above or below the cap. Many commuters who fall above the cap are likely drive to work over long distances, have dependent children in their household and own more than one car. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

From an evolutionary perspective, there are strong reasons to believe that regions are most likely to branch into industries that are technologically related to the preexisting industries in the regions. Using a new indicator of technological relatedness between manufacturing industries, we analyzed the economic evolution of 70 Swedish regions from 1969 to 2002 with detailed plant-level data. Our analyses show that the long-term evolution of the economic landscape in Sweden is subject to strong path dependencies. Industries that were technologically related to the preexisting industries in a region had a higher probability of entering that region than did industries that were technologically unrelated to the region's preexisting industries. These industries had a higher probability of exiting that region. Moreover, the industrial profiles of Swedish regions showed a high degree of technological cohesion. Despite substantial structural change, this cohesion was persistent over time. Our methodology also proved useful when we focused on the economic evolution of one particular region. Our analysis indicates that the Linkoping region increased its industrial cohesion over 30 years because of the entry of industries that were closely related to its regional portfolio and the exit of industries that were technologically peripheral. In summary, we found systematic evidence that the rise and fall of industries is strongly conditioned by industrial relatedness at the regional level.","[Neffke, Frank] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Henning, Martin] Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Lund University; Utrecht University,"Neffke, F (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",neffke@ese.eur.nl; martin@keg.lu.se; r.boschma@geo.uu.nl,,"Neffke, Frank/0000-0002-3924-6636",,,,,47,725,820,24,394,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0095,,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

J,"Gorecki, PK",,,,"Gorecki, Paul K.",,,Economic Regulation: Recentralisation of Power or Improved Quality of Regulation?,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The October 2009 Government Statement on Economic Regulation proposes a number of sensible reforms that are likely to improve regulatory performance in energy, airports, telecommunications, postal services and transport. However, the Government Statement also proposes to reduce the independence of regulators by holding them to account through a whole series of additional mechanisms, some of which are informal and lack transparency, while at the same time instructing regulators to take into account evolving/current possible transient priorities. There are good reasons for preserving and strengthening rather than undermining regulatory independence. For example, it facilitates investment in long-lived assets with a large element of sunk or irrecoverable investment, a common characteristic of network sectors. The Government Statement's unexplained move to reduce regulators' independence finds no support in either the government commissioned background report prepared by the Economic Intelligence Unit, Review of the Regulatory Environment in Ireland, or recent European Union legislation on energy and telecommunications regulation. Indeed, these sources are strongly in favour of regulatory independence. Two, not necessarily mutually exclusive explanations, for reducing regulatory independence are discussed: to remove an anomaly in the Irish political system; and, to assist in the delivery of social partnership. The paper concludes by arguing that some thought might be given to public consultation of the reforms in the Government Statement prior to further implementation.","[Gorecki, Paul K.] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Gorecki, Paul K.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Gorecki, PK (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",paul.gorecki@esri.ie,,,,,,,41,4,4,0,14,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

This venue enabled landholders and communities to exploit economic opportunities that could not be accommodated by the inflexible rights regime inherited from the past. In this essay, historical evidence, archival data, and statistical analysis demonstrate that Parliament increased the number of acts reorganizing property rights in response to increases in the demand for such acts. Tests with placebo groups confirm the robustness of this result. This evidence indicates that Parliament responded elastically to changes in the public's demand for reorganizing property rights.

Such behavior would be inconsistent with ordinary profit-maximization, that is, business by usual methods. This approach is applied to a period of unusually high prices in the New York wholesale electricity market in 2001.

However, the objective of the Finnish Company Reorganization Act (FCRA) is to recover a temporally financially distressed firm that is viable. In these acts, the viability concept is used to refer to a firm that is able to pay its financial obligations in the future. FBA is not efficient if a viable firm is filed for bankruptcy and liquidated. In the same way, FCRA is not efficient if a non-viable firm is filed for reorganization. The purpose of this study is to assess viability of Finnish firms filed for reorganization and bankruptcy. Logistic regression analysis is used to extract two measures for viability. The first measure is based on financial statement information only while the second one takes account of both financial and non-financial information. The estimation sample comprises data from 43636 viable and 98 non-viable firms. The resulted measures are used to assess viability of a sample of firms filed for reorganization and bankruptcy in 2004. In general, the results show that the greater part of firms filed for reorganization is non-viable whereas many of bankruptcy firms are viable. This reflects an occurrence of filtering failure.","Univ Vaasa, Dept Accounting & Finance, Vaasa 65101, Finland",University of Vaasa,"Laitinen, EK (通讯作者)，Univ Vaasa, Dept Accounting & Finance, POB 700, Vaasa 65101, Finland.",ekla@uwasa.fi,,,,,,,65,21,22,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Containerisation and intermodality progressively eroded such a paradigm and currently distance became only one of the factors across the overall equation. In this respect, a fundamental role is played by the effectiveness of inland connections. The better the connection of a port to the various inland markets, the bigger the potential to enlarge its overall captive area. Furthermore, the higher the frictions (bottlenecks, delays, etc.) for reaching the hinterland, the lower the inland traffic flows. The major purpose of the paper is to measure container traffic diversion from Ligurian ports (Genoa, La Spezia and Savona) to the main Italian and European competitors. The application of a gravity model will reveal the current role of distance in drawing hinterland market share among the selected ports. Moreover, for evaluating the unexploited potentialities of Ligurian ports, we compared real traffic flows with the outcomes of a spatial interaction model, reassigning inland container flows to the different sampled ports. The calculation of the traffic delta through a gap analysis, allowed measuring the frictions thwarting the connectivity between the Ligurian ports and the sampled hinterland regions. Finally, the paper discusses the nature and the reasons for the above traffic diversion. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Among others, the views of Manuel Castells, Robert Sack and Doreen Massey contributed to construct an opposition between a parochial, bounded, and reactionary notion of place versus a global, unbounded, and relation one. This latter view, under the label of 'progressive sense of place', has since become a dominant paradigm in geography. This paper aims to ground these theoretical arguments in relation to how people understand place today. Qualitative empirical information collected in four different regional contexts in Western Europe confirms the discursive existence of the above opposition. Yet, it also challenges the ways in which notions of thickness/thinness and boundedness/unboundedness relate to the regressive or progressive character of place.","Univ Birmingham, GEES, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Antonsich, M (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, GEES, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",m.antonsich@bham.ac.uk,,"Antonsich, Marco/0000-0003-1499-3202",,,,,55,21,25,2,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This paper summarizes findings, compares the anti-corruption safeguards in the Visegrad Group and other EU countries available in the Global Integrity Report since 2006 until 2010. The Czech Republic's score of 74 suggests the continued prevalence of anti-corruption and transparency challenges across much of Central and Eastern Europe. In the ranking of selected EU countries is the Czech Republic down at the bottom, with only Lithuania, Hungary, and Slovakia ranked worse. The most flagrant integrity deficiencies of the Czech Republic are political financing and conflicts of interest regulations. The second part of the paper analyses a relationship between Integrity Indicators and a widely recognized measure of corruption produced by Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. A correlation matrix of Global Integrity and Corruption Perceptions Index scores for available EU countries shows that more integrity is not the same as less corruption even though both are certainly intertwined. In addition, Global Integrity's ranking of the Visegrad Group countries proves to be more sufficient than the Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index when analysing 90% confidence intervals.","[Bajzikova, Anna; Zak, Milan] Coll Econ & Management, Ctr Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic",,,anna.bajzikova@vsem.cz; milan.zak@vsem.cz,"Zak, Milan/AAB-3520-2021","Zak, Milan/0000-0002-5814-7668",,,,,7,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-77-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,9,20,,,,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDJ83,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313565200002,0

Waste management is an important component of managerial decision-making in businesses and in the public administration sector. Environmental legislation creates continual pressure on finding new solutions that are both economically advantageous and environmentally friendly. In the context of the EU efforts to restrict the volume of emitted carbon dioxide, it is necessary to look for new solutions to fulfill the established requirements. The article focuses on issues of energy generation from municipal waste paper, a procedure that is also fully applicable in businesses. The work describes waste management legislation and evaluates the results of state regulation. After the analysis, which is made on the basis of evidence that recycling of waste paper does not always represent the best solution in terms of sustainability, a possibility for its energy use is proposed. Two models for the use of waste paper are forwarded - for the production of thermal energy and for the combined production of thermal and electrical energy. The models are developed separately for the production of thermal energy from waste paper and for the combined production of heat and electricity as proposed in the second model. The theoretical background and proposed models are verified for concrete calculation on the basis of waste management in the city of Decin. Software based on Petri nets was used for model construction; this allows the inclusion of the most relevant material and energy flows associated with energy production from waste paper, guaranteeing the high accuracy of the calculated results. The advantage of the model proposed in this manner is the simple and precise quantification of the environmental and economic impacts of the proposed measures; these are the main reasons for its good utilization as a tool for supporting managerial decision-making.","[Bat'a, Robert; Kadlecova, Pavlina] Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Verejne Spravy Prava, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Bat'a, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Verejne Spravy Prava, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",robert.bata@upce.cz; pavlina.kadlec@seznam.cz,"Baťa, Robert/JZS-8334-2024",,,,,,24,2,2,0,8,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

However various authors have noted that business life is not quite so simple. This paper explores the various processes of entrepreneuring (MacMillan 1986, Steyaert and Katz, 2004) and examines them in relation to a case study of the commercialisation of a new form of technology that detects and visually represents cancerous and precancerous cells. The technology is proven to work, and in 2009 a new CEO was appointed to drive the commercialisation; key to this is the creation and development of a relationship with the subcontractor design and manufacturing company. This relationship resulted in a completely new ergonomic design that more effectively met the requirements of the clinical process. It also had the benefits of being modular, enabling segmentation of the product for different markets; greatly reducing the cost of production, at the same time as facilitating its ability to be manufactured. The role of knowledge relationships and their importance in the mobilisation process are discussed in terms of relating this to the concepts of Actor Network Theory (ANT) (Callon 1986) and Interaction Rituals (Collins 2004). The paper demonstrates how complex and shifting these interaction relations are, but essential to the entrepreneuring process. We argue that the CEO is an important actor, but not the only one important in the success of the business. The authors propose that entrepreneuring takes place in a worknet (Latour 2010) of many people performing simultaneously many strands of activities, in no way a linear discrete process overall, but contains short sequences of linearity.","[Baxter, Lynne] Univ York, York Management Sch, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Wright, Cathie] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Management & Languages, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of York - UK; Heriot Watt University,"Baxter, L (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Management Sch, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",lynne.baxter@york.ac.uk; c.a.wright@hw.ac.uk,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,121,127,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800016,0

Public transport systems reduced their costs through organizational restructuring and outsourcing to newly founded subsidiaries; cutting employee benefits and freezing salaries; increasing work hours, using part-time employees, expanding job tasks, and encouraging retirement of older employees; cooperation with other agencies to share employees, vehicles, and facilities; cutting underutilized routes and services; and buying new vehicles with lower maintenance costs and greater passenger capacity per driver. Revenues were increased through fare hikes for single tickets while maintaining deep discounts for monthly, semester, and annual tickets; and raising passenger volumes by improved quality of service, and full regional coordination of timetables, fares, and services. Those efforts by public transport agencies were enhanced by the increasing costs and restrictions on car use in German cities. Although the financial performance of German public transport has greatly improved, there are concerns of inequitable burdens on labor, since many of the cost reduction measures involved reducing wages or benefits of workers.

Transparent and responsible behaviour reflects the pressure of the society and is becoming a competitive advantage.

We recruited 227 participants (11 groups per method) who were required to solve a quantitative judgment task that did not involve distributed knowledge. This task consisted of ten factual questions, which required percentage estimates. While we did not find statistically significant differences in accuracy between the four methods overall, the results differed somewhat at the individual question level. Delphi was as accurate as FTF for eight questions and outperformed FTF for two questions. By comparison, prediction markets did not outperform FTF for any of the questions and were inferior for three questions. The relative performances of nominal groups and FTF were mixed and the differences were small. We also compared the results from the three structured approaches to prior individual estimates and staticized groups. The three structured approaches were more accurate than participants' prior individual estimates. Delphi was also more accurate than staticized groups. Nominal groups and prediction markets provided little additional value relative to a simple average of the forecasts. In addition, we examined participants' perceptions of the group and the group process. The participants rated personal communications more favorably than computer-mediated interactions. The group interactions in FTF and nominal groups were perceived as being highly cooperative and effective. Prediction markets were rated least favourably: prediction market participants were least satisfied with the group process and perceived their method as the most difficult.

Markus Krajewski adopts a different approach and asks the question: to what extent can the international agreements signed by the EC/EU reflect, or even advance, a positive understanding of public services? This is an important perspective now that the Treaty of Lisbon 2009 places external relations policy in a larger value, and principle, driven framework. Krajewski also examines the role of the WTO and in particular the OATS. The telecom sector is the focus of attention because telecom provides an important model for liberalisation and the development of universal service obligations which are mirrored in other sectors opened up to competition. Two case studies follow, first the EC Chile bilateral association agreement and second, the EU-CARIFORUM Economic Partnership Agreement which is of particular interest in that it contains positive universal service obligations. Krajewski also examines a number of agreements which are currently under discussion to determine if there is an emerging trend to include and define PSO and USO in the external agreements of the EU. Underlying this approach is a quest to determine whether in its external role the EU is continuing internal trends of seeing public services not only as exemptions and derogations from EU law, but also as a positive requirement.","[Krajewski, Markus] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Fachbereich Rechtswissensch, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,,Markus.Krajewski@jura.uni-erlangen.de,"Krajewski, Markus/GZA-7924-2022","Krajewski, Markus/0000-0002-8342-7389",,,,,18,6,6,0,1,TMC ASSER PRESS,J N DEN HAAG,"R J SCHIMMELPENNINCKLAAN 20-22, J N DEN HAAG, 2517, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-6704-733-3,LEG ISS SERV GEN INT,,,2011,,,,,,,231,252,,10.1007/978-90-6704-734-0_10,0.0,,,22,Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BVN53,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291967200010,0

Specifically, this study examines how engineers cope with these demands of being simultaneously creative and efficient. The engineers described the demands in different ways; extremely lean organization, not enough time for development, and pressed time schedule. The answers the engineers provided also describe how difficult it was to be simultaneously creative and efficient. The engineers had either the intention to be or not to be creative when it came to efficient product development; that is, they either (1) confronted and opposed high demands or (2) adapted and worked more than they could handle or (3) avoided being creative and focused on efficiency. This study shows that the engineers themselves were forced to set the limit when unreasonable demands arose. The first group stressed the importance of resisting creative work when the demands of work were too high. The strategy was to discuss with the managers why it was impossible to be both creative and efficient. The second group adapted to the demand of being simultaneously creative and efficient, but often took more work than they could handle. The fear of saying no to a supervisor's demands forced creativity forward, but this was a dangerous balancing act as this could result in demands beyond worker's time constraints. For this group, this choice could be a health risk. The third group avoided being creative and concentrated only on being efficient when the pressure of both efficiency and creativity was perceived as being too much. This group often avoided presenting a good idea because then they would be responsible for implementing the new idea. This meant they chose a secure solution (even if the solution was incomplete) rather than taking a risk on a more innovative solution. The work organization needs to support the demand of being simultaneously creative and efficient.","[Loven, Eva] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn IEI, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,,eva.loven@liu.se,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,11,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,593,598,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800072,0

Apart from its place of origin in United States, more similarities can be tracked down. Both started in financial markets turbulence with its repercussions in decline in industrial production as well as world trade. Existing studies identify several categories of different causes that might have contributed to financial and subsequently economic crisis and its spread around the world. Short term explications point mainly to loose monetary policy, which kept interest rates lower than would have corresponded to real economic situation. In combination with revised Community Reinvestment Act, which enabled even lower-income population groups to invest into real estates, this was a start-up for real estate bubble and consequent problems of many financial institutions once this bubble burst out. However, long term factors of more fundamental nature should not be overlooked. Insufficient and/or rather missing regulations of financial markets at which financial instruments of different kinds evolved during previous period bear its soured fruit. Nontransparent operations of investment bank reinforced with positive ratings of rating agencies, excessive securitization as well as underestimation of systemic risk led to moral hazard with its ramifications in bankruptcies of many financial institutions. Some experts claim that savings-investment imbalance across the world together with increasing oil prices, as well as prices of other raw materials and food have played its role in escalation of the whole problem too. Indubitably, all analysed factors have had its more or less significant impact on current economic situation. Ensuing measures taken by governments and central banks to mitigate crisis impact on national economies together with state budgets current condition as well as spillover effects of such measures are to be discussed in more detail in following research.","Tech Univ, Ekon Fak, Katedra Ekon, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Lungová, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ, Ekon Fak, Katedra Ekon, Liberec, Czech Republic.",miroslava.lungova@tul.cz,,,,,,,16,13,13,0,51,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The article includes own EKC research result concerning particulate matter in the air. Economic growth, measured as GDP per capita in a given country, is connected with increasing pollution, but after some turning point pollution starts declining. This relationship has an inverted U-shape and is called Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). EKC was first identified in a research by Grossman and Krueger from 1991 [8], other studies came after soon. In the air pollution EKC was identified for SO(2), NO(x) a dark matter (smoke), in water pollution for biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, nitrates and some heavy metals (such as arsenic, cadmium or lead). EKC evidence for particulate matter (PM) is mixed, EKC wasn't found for CO or CO(2). However, some authors consider evidence for EKC statistically weak. Standard explanation of EKC comes from [17]: As the development and industrailization progress, environmental damage increases due to greater use of natural resources, more emissions of pollutants, the operation of less efficient and relatively dirty technologies, the high priority given to increase in material output, and disregard for - or ignorance of - the environmental consequences of growth. However, as economic growth continues and life expectancies increase, claner water, improved air quality, and a generally cleaner habitat become more valuable ...  EKC research has important policy implications: from some point environmental quality improves with ecomic growth.

This is supported by the fact that all industries struggled to deal with turbulent financial environment. Therefore all firms need a clear strategically perspective when deciding the optimal capital structure's mixture. Recent research found that firms do engage to deal with systematic risk by conducting trade off policy between financial leverage and capital intensity. This paper was design to present better analysis of how Indonesia's companies deal with systematic risk. We deploy Mandelker and Rhee (1984) decomposition method of systematic risk. Through the decomposition we found that based on mathematical perspectives, there should be inverse relationships between financial leverage and capital intensity. It shows how manager used capital structure (proxy by financial leverage) to deal with the turbulent in systematic risk. Using samples of 225 public companies in Indonesia from the year of 2000 to year of 2009, the paper try to answer the puzzle. In order to have better understanding concerning the relationships, we categorize the level of systematic risk in three groups; lower, middle and higher systematic risk. Deeper analysis in this study indicates strong support to the hypothesis that in the long run, there is a negative relationship between financial leverage and capital intensity among those three categories. The strongest relationships happened in the lower and middle category. While at the higher systematic risk, the trade off is less than other levels. Specifically, managers were found to structure the selection of debt and capital intensity in a means consistent with strategic goal of long run control of systematic risk.","[Prasetyo, Aries Heru] PPM Sch Management, Core Fac, Cent Jakarta, Indonesia",,,ahp@ppm-manajemen.ac.id,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,3,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8641-7,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,2.0,,,,,,132,138,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173500030,0

In practice, specific processes are linked together, they do not exist separately. It is therefore necessary to provide controlling management to related processes.

These work creation schemes drew on the cameralistic 'police sciences' that Foucault cites in his genealogy of bio-power.

For the latter position, Alexander Gerschenkron looms large, as one of the most significant theorists of state-led development under conditions of relative backwardness. There are striking similarities between Gerschenkron's explication of the advantages of backwardness and Leon Trotsky's concept of uneven and combined development and the privilege of backwardness. (These similarities have been commented upon often but rarely subject to closer comparison.) Indeed, both men share a common problematic - the comprehension of how economically backward countries could skip stages of development in order to join the ranks of economically advanced countries. This article compares their conception of this problematic and illustrates how in a number of areas the two are complementary. These are: their rejection of unilinear patterns of capitalist development, their appreciation of the role of states and institutions in facilitating late development and their understanding of development as a disruptive social process. However, in crucial areas the two diverge. These are: their comprehension of international economic and political relations, the role and position of labour in late development and, ultimately, the potential for late capitalist development to unleash social upheavals and further, non-capitalist transformations. Overall, I suggest how Trotsky's and Gerschenkron's approaches can complement each other, but that ultimately they represent fundamentally opposed approaches to human development.","Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Selwyn, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Arts C 378, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",b.selwyn@sussex.ac.uk,,,,,,,104,35,37,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The seven modes are evaluated at varied traffic volumes in hypothetical radial and circumferential commuting corridors. Using detailed estimates of private and social costs, the full cost of each mode is minimized by optimizing infrastructure investment and operation plans. On all corridors and across different scenarios, commuting by one or more forms of bus transit or bicycle costs less than automobile or rail. Nonetheless, in circumferential corridors, rail can be almost as cost-effective as bus under certain conditions, and bicycle can be less cost-effective than bus in some cases. Unlike results from similar studies conducted in the US, automobile commuting does not cost less than bus transportation at low traffic volumes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of this paper is to offer courts and competition agencies guidance on evaluating when differing intellectual property (IP) licensing within standard setting rises to the level of anticompetitive behavior. The paper reviews the economics literature on price discrimination in traditional markets for goods and services and on licensing IP outside of standard setting to identify lessons that can be applied to licensing within standards. There are a number of important teachings relevant for competition policy. Price discrimination is not necessarily harmful, and can even increase consumer welfare. Most IP licensing is characterized by discrimination in that rates and terms differ across licensees, making the task of disentangling anticompetitive practices difficult. Proof of market power must remain the first step in any inquiry on allegations of anticompetitive IP licensing. Moreover, as of yet, no widely applicable benchmarks or rules for distinguishing harmful from beneficial or nonharmful licensing discrimination have emerged, meaning that a careful, quantitative effects-based analysis remains the best approach.","LECG Consulting, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA",,"Layne-Farrar, A (通讯作者)，LECG Consulting, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.",alayne@lecg.com,,,,,,,44,11,11,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Intermodal hinterland transport services are provided by many different firms, each taking care of a part of the chain. Consequently, there is a need for cooperation and coordination in hinterland chains, to ensure an attractive overall service for shippers. However, different firms have different market positions and business models. This leads to differences in incentives, resources, capabilities, and attitudes concerning coordination and cooperation. Analysis of their business models suggests that there is so much competition between players with different business models, especially for involvement in design of scheduled transport networks, that initiatives to enhance coordination often have strategic implications. Consequently, coordination and cooperation do not (always) emerge, even when beneficial for the overall hinterland chain. This conclusion is relevant for the potential of ICT in improving coordination. Mechanisms to improve coordination will only be successful if they are in line with the business model of the firms involved. Distributed planning is a promising approach in this respect, as it may offer solutions to hinterland coordination problems, while, unlike traditional centralized systems, not effecting business models of the involved firms.","[de Langen, Peter] Port Rotterdam Author, Dept Corp Strategy, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [de Langen, Peter] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Innovat Sci, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Douma, Albert] Univ Twente, Fac Management & Governance, Dept Operat Methods Prod & Logist, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology; University of Twente,"de Langen, P (通讯作者)，Port Rotterdam Author, Dept Corp Strategy, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,"de langen, peter w/U-3588-2018; langen, peter d/G-3823-2011","de langen, peter w/0000-0002-7703-5370;",,,,,18,4,4,0,13,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

It shows that the price set by a Niskanen-type professional association will maximize consumer surplus only if consumers demand the highest possible average quality. If consumers demand services of lesser quality, the association's price will be too high if measured by consumer surplus. Moreover we show that a deregulated market will always reproduce the favorable result of a uniformly high price in the case of top quality demand, while delivering superior results in the case of a mixed demand for high and low quality services.","[Schwarze, Reimund] European Univ Viadrina, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany; [Meran, Georg] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany",European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Schwarze, R (通讯作者)，European Univ Viadrina, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany.",gmeran@diw.de; schwarze@euv-frankfurt-o.de,,"Schwarze, Reimund/0000-0002-2734-9259",,,,,32,0,0,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Since the blocked merger, the landscape of the baby food industry has evolved significantly. All of the major brands of jarred baby food have undergone changes in ownership. The relevant product market may have slightly broadened beyond jarred baby food. Market concentration has increased, although prices have not. Gerber increased its market share from 71-72 to 73-80 percent. Beech-Nut's market share slightly declined from 13 to 11-12 percent, whereas Heinz's former brand, Nature's Goodness, declined from 13 to 2 percent. With no substantial entry, only Gerber and Beech-Nut currently have double-digit market shares. Also, although the average price of baby food has fluctuated over the years, prices in 2008 were the same as prices in 2000, after adjusting for inflation and changes in the composition of consumption.

The paper argues that driver speed choice cannot be granted any normative status (i.e. be regarded as optimal from a societal point of view) unless it is objectively rational, even if it can be reasonably interpreted as subjectively rational. A distinction between subjective and objective rationality is very rarely made in modern analyses relying on the theory of rational choice, but it makes sense with respect to the choice of speed. Studies that have assessed which impacts of speed drivers consider, whether drivers correctly assess these impacts, and how drivers coordinate their choice of speed with other drivers are reviewed. It is concluded that driver speed choice is not objectively rational. It is concluded that the lack of rationality in driver speed choice implies that this choice needs to be regulated by means of speed limits. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimated model parameters, together with two separate case studies on (i) the dynamics of forecast disagreement in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attack in the US, and (ii) the successful inflation targeting experience of Italy after 1997, firmly establish the importance of these two pathways to expert disagreement, and help to explain the relative forecasting accuracy of these two macroeconomic variables.

One explanation that has been offered for the failure to find evidence of a deterrent effect in the long run is the natural rate of crime. This article applies univariate unit root tests to crime series for the United Kingdom and United States and panel unit roots to crime rates for a panel of G7 countries to examine whether there is a natural rate of crime. Our main finding is that when we allow for two structural breaks in the univariate unit root test and a structural break in the panel data unit root test, there is strong evidence of a natural rate of crime. The policy implications of our findings is that governments should focus on altering the economic and social structural profile that determines crime in the long run rather than increasing expenditure on law enforcement that will at best reduce crime rates in the short run.","[Smyth, Russell] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Nielsen, Ingrid] Monash Univ, Dept Management, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Narayan, Paresh Kumar] Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia",Monash University; Monash University; Deakin University,"Smyth, R (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",Russell.smyth@buseco.monash.edu.au,"Narayan, Paresh Kumar/AEM-2143-2022; Narayan, Paresh/AAE-8777-2019; Smyth, Russell/AAE-1492-2019","Smyth, Russell/0000-0001-6593-5462; Nielsen, Ingrid/0000-0002-9065-9778; Narayan, Paresh/0000-0001-7934-8146",,,,,47,11,12,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Results were analyzed through descriptive statistics (average), where 54.76% felt committed to the organizational principles, 57.53% reported the absence of workshops for creating ideas for decision making and finally, 64.81% indicated that changing ways of carrying out tasks is a waste of time. Conclusions were that a weak organizational culture exists, which does not integrate the personnel according to the objectives the institution pursues; also, that inadequate training of personnel to fulfill their functions makes decision making difficult, due to which changes are not accepted at the required moment. In this sense, the challenge remains for higher education institutions to incentivize the disappearance of orthodox postures in the organizational culture, transforming it into one that is stronger, more participative and less resistant to change.","[Perez Lugo, Jorge Ernesto] Univ Zulia, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela; [Urdaneta Quintero, Milagros del Valle] Univ Zulia, Fac Odontol, Div Estudios Grad, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela; [Lopez Ferrer, Patricia Carolina] Univ Zulia, Fac Odontol, Dept Sistemas Atenc Odontol, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,,omar_urdaneta_q@yahoo.com; jepelu@hotmail.com; miliur69@hotmail.com; pclf_2@hotmail.com,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Most research has focused on spectacular events in well-known metropolises, but far less is known about how smaller cities engage in competitive activities. This paper focuses on how, why and what Swedish cities hope to achieve by engaging themselves in hosting the tryouts to the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC), which provides an opportunity for a critical case study of place marketing and city competition in Sweden. The empirical material is based on interviews with stakeholders in the tryouts. Our findings show that the local authorities do not compete in the same way as suggested by the literature, but instead collaborate to a great deal. While there are various motives behind arranging a tryouts tryout, it is noted that whereas the ESC presents an opportunity for a host city to 'place itself on the map', hosting a tryout is often mainly seen as an opportunity to show the organisers of the event the city's potential for hosting other events in the future. Our findings suggest that the main outcome of hosting a tryout, an outcome that the local authorities seem content with, is having arranged a glamorous party for the local inhabitants. The paper concludes by discussing why competition was found to be less outspoken than the literature suggests.","[Niedomysl, Thomas] Inst Futures Studies, SE-10131 Stockholm, Sweden; [Andersson, Ida] Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Niedomysl, T (通讯作者)，Inst Futures Studies, Box 591, SE-10131 Stockholm, Sweden.",Ida.Maria.Andersson@gmail.com; Thomas.Niedomysl@Framtidsstudier.se,,,,,,,42,7,7,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Empirical evidence is drawn on the case of think3, an Italian medium-sized software company that has been offshoring its RD activities to Bangalore, India, since the year 2000. In 2004, the company started a brand new oglobalo business: from selling software solutions for computer-aided design, it began selling the engineering capabilities to use its solutions, leveraging highly qualified Indian mechanical engineers. Our analysis underlines three elements underpinning think3's ability in envisaging a new profitable business opportunity. These are its experiential knowledge of: (a) the markets, clients and competitors, (b) the offshore context, and (c) the internationalization process as a software house, embodied in the ability to promote offshore cultural integration and to align home and offshore operations.

Standard trade theory predicts that trade openness promotes specialization in production and an inter-industry pattern of trade. If business cycles are dominated by industry-specific shocks, trade-induced specialization leads to decreasing output correlations. By contrast, industry-specific shocks may lead to more symmetric business cycles if trade is dominated by intra-industry trade. Moreover, macro-shocks in one country generally have an effect on demand for goods from another country, leading to a higher degree of business cycle comovement. Similarly, financial linkages could increase comovement via supply and contagion effects. The supply-of foreign capital causes a positive correlation between source and target countries, Positive productivity shocks in the target country, conversely, are likely to attract investment from other economies (Backus et al., 1995) and to increase sectoral specialization. Thus the effects of financial integration are also unclear. Using dynamic correlations for different frequencies, we show that the traditional determinants of international business cycles have statistically different effects: The short-run cycles, which are responsible for a not negligible part of aggregate fluctuations, cannot be explained well by factors found to be important for business-cycle and long-term frequencies. The previous literature documented that trade flows and specialization pattern play an important role in this process. However, less evidence has so far been found for financial integration. A possible reason for this, as shown in this paper, may be that financial integration has different effects on comovements at different frequencies. In particular, financial integration is insignificant for the short-term frequencies, while it reaches a peak at the business cycle frequencies. Trade, by contrast, is found to be an important determinant for the whole range of frequencies.","[Fidrmuc, Jarko] CESifo Munich, OeNB, Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut,,jarko.fidrmuc@lrz.uni-muenchen.de; iwatsubo@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,5,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-180-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,368,368,,,,,,1,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BGW05,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000324343700032,0

The new step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis method (SWARA) allows including experts, lawyers or dispute parties opinion about significance ratio of the attributes in the process of rational decision determination.

Starting small scale in the fifties, the industry enjoyed enormous annual growth rates in the USA since the eighties and now also in Europe, in 2009 servicing worldwide ca. 17 mio. passengers. This success story was written mainly by the American big three cruise companies Carnival, Royal Caribbean and NCL, which dominate the industry with a global market share of ca. 80 %.

Dominant among the likely reasons for this graduated penalty scheme are 'default tracking costs' and 'imprisonment costs'. Although in conflict with the state's basic objective of deterring evasion, a graduated penalty scheme may emerge as an optimal balance between the dual objectives of deterrence and settlement delay minimization. Based on a welfare-maximizing objective where the state determines optimal monitoring intensity and time profile of fines, an intuitively plausible condition is derived such that the fine scheme is of the graduated type.

We match our liability measure to data on physician behavior from the Physician Practice Costs and Income Survey (PPCIS). Data from the PPCIS bracket a period of substantial state-level legal reform between 1983 and 1988, which provides identifying variation in our liability measure. We estimate the impact of liability reform on hours worked. We find an estimated elasticity of hours worked to liability exposure of -.285 for the full sample of physicians. The effect for physicians ages 55 or older is much larger: we find an elasticity of -1.224 for this category. We find that an increase in $1 of expected liability is associated with a $.70-$1.05 increase in malpractice premiums.","[Helland, Eric] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Showalter, Mark H.] Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Graduate School; Brigham Young University,"Helland, E (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",,,"Showalter, Mark/0000-0002-8154-2703",,,,,28,21,25,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

High-income majority citizens, who tend to have better academic qualifications, favor more diversity under affirmative action, which imposes its costs on marginal majority candidates. Low-income majority citizens prefer less diversity under affirmative action and would rather achieve diversity by de-emphasizing academic qualifications. Increasing income inequality among majority citizens tends to reduce the median citizen's support for affirmative action. Our results help explain why affirmative action has become increasingly unpopular among white voters and why white voters who oppose affirmative action may support top-x-percent rules like those recently introduced in California, Florida, and Texas.

The elements that determine the fundamental role of small and medium industries in a national endogenous development model were identified, defining two strategies: first, cooperation among different levels of the industrial network; and second, competition with the outer world. Conclusions were that this industry category has a very important role in any economy because of its capacity to create employment, generate and contribute to national income, as well as contribute to the democratization of capital.

I find that, during this sentence disenhancement, offenders were, on average, arrested for 2.8 criminal acts and were involved in 1.4-1.6 serious crimes per person during the period when they would have otherwise been incarcerated.

It is based upon an original data set on US inventors patent applications at the European Patent Office, in the fields of drugs, biotechnology and organic chemistry. The study combines the methodology originally proposed by Jaffe et al. (1993, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 108: 577598) with tools from social network analysis, in order to evaluate extent of the localization of knowledge flows, as measured by patent citations. After controlling for inventors mobility and for the resulting co-invention network, the residual effect of spatial proximity on knowledge diffusion is found to be greatly reduced. We argue that the most fundamental reason why geography matters in constraining the diffusion of knowledge is that mobile researchers are not likely to relocate in space, so that their co-invention network is also localized. In the light of these results, we revisit common interpretations of localized knowledge flows as externalities.","[Breschi, Stefano; Lissoni, Francesco] Univ Commerciale L Bocconi, KITES CESPRI, Milan, Italy; [Lissoni, Francesco] Univ Brescia, DIMI, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Brescia, Italy",Bocconi University; University of Brescia,"Breschi, S (通讯作者)，Univ L Bocconi, Dept Econ, Via Sarfatti 25, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",stefano.breschi@unibocconi.it,"Lissoni, Francesco/E-3600-2012","Lissoni, Francesco/0000-0002-2966-1414",,,,,35,531,583,7,241,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We analyze a model in which a judicially influenced bankruptcy process can enhance the efficiency of incomplete contracts by conditioning the allocation of control rights in bankruptcy on firm quality. We consider the optimal balance of debtor and creditor interests as a function of the legal environment and show that the optimal degree of creditor-friendliness in the bankruptcy code increases as judicial ability to recognize firm quality falls and as the quality of contract enforcement deteriorates. Our model shows that a bankruptcy law that attempts to preserve going-concern value, such as US Chapter 11, requires judicial expertise to be effective. Where such expertise is unavailable, a law that focuses more on creditor recovery is preferred.

But how do ownership types differ? Previous studies have compared costs among different hospitals. However, these studies have not been entirely successful because costs cannot be meaningfully compared without controlling for hard-to-measure quality of service. In this study, we look to the market for corporate control-or takeovers-for evidence of ownership-related differences. We find that nonprofit and for-profit firms pay different prices and that these differences relate to the nonprofit's mission. Specifically, nonprofits and for-profits pay the same price when buying for-profits, but nonprofits pay less when buying a like-minded nonprofit (so religious nonprofits pay less for other religious nonprofits, for example). The resulting dual-price equilibrium suggests that nonprofits have a different objective than do for-profits but also that nonprofits behave competitively and efficiently when interacting with for-profits.","[Gertler, Paul] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kuan, Jennifer] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Stanford University,"Gertler, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,29,12,13,4,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

We find KLD concern ratings to be fairly good summaries of past environmental performance. In addition, firms with more KLD concerns have slightly, but statistically significantly, more pollution and regulatory compliance violations in later years. KLD environmental strengths, in contrast, do not accurately predict pollution levels or compliance violations.

Like governance, risk management and compliance generally, IT GRC is about the decision rights and accountabilities that encourage desirable behaviour in the use of IT (IT Governance Institute, 2003). A case study approach was used in an organisation with many business units. The organisation selected is a mining company, RioZim, situated in Zimbabwe. Data was collected from business units on IT issues and business values. The interviews centred on the IT GRC practices based on responsibility and authority for IT decision-making. The results suggest that IT GRC does not adequately support business values.

The main components of the analysis are: structural changes to the organisations, participation on planning committees, access to financial resources, accountability frameworks, membership of forums and relationships with other actors. The conclusion is that, whilst the historical picture is complex, the trend is a strengthening of road planning institutions, and weakening public transport planning.

Exploratory data analyses suggest that the observed differences in the use of the bicycle to get to work are strongly linked to the urban hierarchy: commuters are more inclined to cycle in cities and specifically in regional towns (with 25 000 to 120 000 inhabitants). In large cities (more than 200 000 inhabitants), less commuting by bicycle takes place. The relationship between bicycle use and the risk of being seriously injured or killed in a road accident is also studied. A cluster analysis confirms that high proportions of commuter cyclists are correlated with low risks of becoming a casualty. It also shows that there are strong spatial differences (regional and between different types of towns) in bicycle use and the risk of an accident. This suggests that cycling policies should be spatially differentiated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus on these two models since they represent nicely the two opposing forecasting philosophies. The DSGE model on the one hand has a strong theoretical economic background; the factor model on the other hand is mainly data-driven. We show that incorporating a large information set using factor analysis can indeed improve the short-horizon predictive ability, as claimed by many researchers. The micro-founded DSGE model can provide reasonable forecasts for US inflation, especially with growing forecast horizons. To a certain extent, our results are consistent with the prevailing view that simple time series models should be used in short-horizon forecasting and structural models should be used in longhorizon forecasting. Our paper compares both state-of-the-art data-driven and theory-based modelling in a rigorous manner.

Using data on adults specifically collected for this study, we examine the internal cost of one such good by estimating the value that smokers and nonsmokers place on loss of health and longevity from a major lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). Differences in the nonpecuniary internal cost of getting COPD between current smokers and people who have never smoked range from $80,000 to $260,000, implying that one reason people continue to smoke is that they face a lower full price of smoking. Our results suggest that although taxation and regulation of cigarettes may be justified for externality reasons, the principle of consumer sovereignty implies that the case is much weaker for interventions based on helping smokers internalize costs they impose on themselves.","[Khwaja, Ahmed; Sloan, Frank; Wang, Yang] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Khwaja, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,,,,,44,14,15,0,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Despite the differences between for-profit and nonprofit firms stressed in conventional economic analyses, U. S. antitrust law generally does not distinguish between these two organizational forms. This paper argues that, under plausible assumptions and with possible exceptions, the same incentives to restrain trade exist in the nonprofit sector as in the for-profit sector. Altruistic firms benefit from exploiting market power, even when they would price below cost in the absence of competition. In fact, the efficiency gains from antitrust policy may often be larger for nonprofit firms. Therefore, a policy of promoting competition has social value even when producers' motivations are altruistic. The argument for uniform antitrust treatment of the two sectors extends to exemptions from antitrust law as well.","[Philipson, Tomas J.; Posner, Richard A.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Philipson, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,35,25,33,0,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The aim of this paper is therefore to reveal the role of marketing in companies and to identify tools mostly used for supporting their marketing activities. This article is the output of the so called specific research conducted at the University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, which was focused on firms from the Pilsen and Karlovy Vary region and should serve as a study for other projects and surveys. There participated 29 firms in this research. Following hypotheses were formulated before canvassing: 1. Marketing management is rather an intuitive then a systematic process. 2. Worldwide customer orientation is exerted in Czech firms too. 3. Product quality is perceived as the biggest competitive advantage. Whereas the first one has not been unambiguously approved nor disproved - although some firms carry out their marketing activities intuitively (the majority of them does not), many of them are not able to identify their own weaknesses, a lot of them do not perform any situational analysis. More than thirty per cent of the surveyed firms use no information system for supporting their marketing activities. On the other hand, Czech firms do not miss out the role of customers and their needs. It is a priority within the situational analysis for more than eighty-five per cent of companies. Furthermore, changes in the customers' preferences or their behaviour are pursued and evaluated mostly regularly. The third hypothesis has been approved too as the quality of products and services mentioned by more than third of all respondents leads the imaginary chart. Nevertheless, not only quality of product belongs to key factors while the quality of related services is very important as well. On the contrary, the former trend of focusing on price retreats.","[Hommerova, Dita; Kralova, Lenka] Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekon, Katedra Mkt Obchodu & Sluzeb, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Hommerová, D (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekon, Katedra Mkt Obchodu & Sluzeb, Plzen, Czech Republic.",hommer@kmo.zcu.cz; kraloval@kmo.zcu.cz,"Hommerová, Dita/U-9193-2019","Hommerová, Dita/0000-0003-1073-5994",,,,,9,6,6,0,1,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It provides insights which inform contemporary debates about pension reform in Latin America. This area of social policy intervention is central to ongoing analyses of state competence and state capacity that in turn inform efforts to theorize about the state. Much of the present discussion depicts social insurance 'crisis' as a modern phenomenon. Similarly, preoccupations with the macroeconomic objectives of reform, such as the promotion of profitable pension funds as an adjunct to capital market deepening, long-term sustainability, equity and coverage, are often assumed to be peculiar to the late twentieth century. By contrast, this article stresses the generational and cyclical nature of the crises that have plagued social insurance regimes in both countries. It notes that pension funds established for influential groups of workers in the early twentieth century quickly developed substantial deficits and that this was a key factor driving the extension of social insurance (and hence the pool of contributors). Financial instability was exacerbated by states frequently raiding pension funds in lieu of effective fiscal systems. As part of this, the article analyses historic shifts between different social insurance 'models' (individual, capitalized accounts versus pay-as-you-go schemes and monopolistic state systems versus competitive arrangements), evaluating their impact on coverage, equity, financial stability and administrative effectiveness. The article also identifies what may be learnt from differences, as well as similarities, between the two systems. Key points of divergence include the relatively large historic role of the private sector in Brazil and the earlier substantive provision for rural workers there. These differences call into question assertions about the common nature and origins of social insurance crises in Latin America, and in turn about the nature of the state itself. The article finds that, unlike models of Western European welfare capitalism with which they are sometimes compared, social insurance regimes in Brazil and the Argentine were precocious and institutionally fragile. They were also ad hoc and subject to repeated 'reform'. For much of the second half of the twentieth century, the economic weight of the state in middle-income Latin American countries (particularly as regards economic outreach and social policy interventions) seemed to approach that of socialist countries in Eastern Europe. Yet the 'ideology' of growth often owed more to liberal capitalism, echoing East Asia's emphasis on 'state-supported late industrialization'. These contradictions are neatly captured in the historical trajectory of social insurance systems, which demonstrate that Latin American does not fit neatly with categorizations established in the varieties of capitalism discourse.","[Lewis, Colin M.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ Hist, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Lloyd-Sherlock, Peter] Univ E Anglia, Sch Dev Studies, Norwich NR4 6HU, Norfolk, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of East Anglia,"Lewis, CM (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ Hist, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",c.m.lewis@lse.ac.uk; p.lloyd-sherlock@uea.ac.uk,,"Lloyd-Sherlock, Peter/0000-0002-1367-0703",,,,,77,15,17,0,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The additional objective allows to take priorities among locations into account while minimizing the costs of traveling. For this, cities in the input are given in a strict ordering, e. g., due to arrival times of delivery requests. The goal is to compute the set of efficient solutions when both objectives are optimized simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, this variation of TSP has not been studied before. After making the notion of priorities precise, we present a local-search algorithm to approximate the set of non-dominated solutions. While still being conceptionally easy, our algorithm employs different means of intensification and diversification in a way we call breadth-first local search. We maintain one candidate solution for each possible value of the additional objective in a polynomially-sized archive, and try to improve this set towards the Pareto front. Experimental results with test data from TSPLIB show that this is a reasonable approach to attack the problem.","[Schmitz, Heinz; Niemann, Sebastian] Fachhsch Trier, Dept Comp Sci, D-54293 Trier, Germany",,,schmitz@informatik.fh-trier.de,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",0075-8442,,978-3-642-00939-6,LECT NOTES ECON MATH,,,2009,624.0,,,,,,1,14,,10.1007/978-3-642-00939-6_1,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BLV72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271188100001,0

Theoretical solutions of ethics with regards to limitations of requirements for company code of conduct are studied here. The generally accepted approach of multilevel ethical analysis is made use of. The first level relates to global, universal context of company's activities. Here apply very well the theoretical and methodological solutions formulated by Hans Jonas in his work Das Prinzip, Verantwortung. Versuch einer Ethik fur technologische Zivilisation. The second level of ethical analysis deals with essential signs of socio-cultural changes. The issues of varied world are worked out, the paradigm of communication (also information and communication technologies) and transversal reason. The third level of ethical analysis looks for some connecting lines between personal morals, morals of institutions, organizations, companies, countries and global ethics. We meet these issues in connection with professional ethics or as professional code of conduct. Significant development in theoretical solutions of professional ethics can be followed since 60s and 70s. Creation of professional codes of conduct is connected with traditional ethical topics and is modified by current discussions in ethics. All solutions of social ethics affect individual ethics. The second part of the article discusses some concrete approaches to creation of codes of conduct e.g. operationalistic, intentionalistic, socioeconomic, pragmatic and neoaristoteles ones. Further on we examine principles promoted in particular areas of ethics which are applied in sphere of economics (i.e. in the ethics of marketing, management and economic decision-making). Codes of conduct fulfil the function of the empowering document, they express professional socialisation, they can function as prevention, they improve company's image, they can boost public trust and can serve as grounds for possible error resolution. Experienced companies regard the ethical component of their output as substantial and implement ethical education into their educational programmes.","Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informat & Managementu, Katedra Aplikovane Lingvist, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Semrádová, I (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informat & Managementu, Katedra Aplikovane Lingvist, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",ilona.semradova@uhk.cz,,,,,,,11,5,5,0,9,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

I give the space mainly to the basic goals in the directing of the firms, that I consider being a valuation of the company. Again, I advert to the relativity in the range of notions (e.g. the small company contra the big corporation) in nowadays company world were the fusions and the acquisitions dominated. This text is chronologically my third text where I point at the necessary comprehension of the maximization in the firm valuation as its basic goals of the business. The last two articles represented maximization of the firm valuation as the aim that ideally relates with the interesting of the owners and the managers of the firms - solving the problem of the master and manager to a certain degree - (1st article: UHMAN, J.: Maximalizace hodnoty firmy - zakladni cil podnikani) and they represented the necessity of the value firm directing (2nd article: UHMAN, J.: Value of company as a basic object of enterprise). This time I am more focused on the concrete decision processes of the financial direction in the firm where are shown the examples of the concrete possibilities in value implementation directing. In introduction of the text I introduce again the maximization of the company valuation as the basic and leading idea of my consideration. There is a short mention of the development company engine that they see in the development of the business electronization, accelerating flow of information and financial transaction. In the same time they are adverting to the necessity of the effectual, non-restrictive artificial market, to the regulation of the financial market. It should be specialized mainly to the protection of the small investors. I attend at the concrete case to the firm financial politics from the second to the forth part - using of the discount - using of the maximalization valuation company principles for the concrete financial decision making. I introduce the sense of the discount briefly. I draw attention to the problem of assessment and explication of their highness between the business partners with the view for their expected contribution from the realization of the law The view of the valuating firm directing places this problem to the other clear level.

Moreover, an imprecise notion of this well-known dilemma is an integral part of the discourse of politicians and policy-makers. The scientific status of the idea of a trade-off between efficiency and equality is, however, a matter of contention. Philosophical dissections of the idea have already deflated the analytical cogency of most of its versions, while the economic literature trying to assess the empirical relation between growth and equality has shown contradicting results. This article, by focusing on the role this idea plays both in the discourse and strategy of social-democratic parties, and in the social science explanations of their trajectories, argues that the pervasiveness of the notion of the trade-off between efficiency and equality is best explained in terms of the political functions it can fulfill.","UNED, Dept Log Hist & Philosophy Sci, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Jiménez-Buedo, M (通讯作者)，UNED, Dept Log Hist & Philosophy Sci, C Senda del Rey 7, Madrid 28040, Spain.",mjbuedo@fsof.uned.es,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

What stands out, but is seldom noted, is that this occurred within democracies where the relative losers-the overwhelming majority-could in principle have used the political system to block or reverse rising inequality. Why did they not do so? A glance at history reveals that peoples have only very infrequently contested inequality because they were led to believe that their inferior status in terms of income, wealth, and privilege was just, that it was not really so bad, or that it was necessary for their future well-being. Ideological systems legitimated a status quo of inequality, or in more modern times even increasing inequality. This article surveys the manner in which inequality has been historically legitimated, first predominantly by religion, then predominately by economic thought. Attention is then focused on the manner in which contemporary economic science and its popular interpretations in the media have served to legitimate inequality in the U.S. since the mid-1970s. The article concludes with a reflection on the unique conditions that enable the legitimation of inequality to be delegitimated.","[Wisman, Jon D.; Smith, James F.] American Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Wisman, Jon D.; Smith, James F.] Smithsonian Inst, Washington, DC 20560 USA",American University; Smithsonian Institution,"Wisman, JD (通讯作者)，American Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,,"Wisman, Jon D./0000-0001-7563-3150",,,,,83,27,29,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

To this end we consider a new test-based procedure, which assigns non-zero weights to candidate models that add information not covered by other models. The potential benefits of this procedure are explored in extensive Monte Carlo simulations using realistic designs that are adapted to UK and to French macroeconomic data, to which trivariate vector autoregressions (VAR) are fitted. Thus simulations rely on potential data-generating mechanisms for macroeconomic data rather than on simple but artificial designs. We run two types of forecast 'competitions'. In the first one, one of the model classes is the trivariate VAR, such that it contains the generating mechanism. In the second specification, none of the competing models contains the true structure. The simulation results show that the performance of test-based averaging is comparable to uniform weighting of individual models. In one of our role model economies, test-based averaging achieves advantages in small samples. In larger samples, pure prediction models outperform forecast averages.

The 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines appear to refer to a specific version of CLA that assumes that (1) pre-merger pricing satisfies the Lerner Condition; and (2) products' demand functions are linear in price in the vicinity of the pre-merger equilibrium point. We show that under general conditions, the linear demand assumption is not satisfied and can lead to significant errors in the application of the hypothetical monopolist test. We develop a model of differentiated products competition that shows that under reasonable assumptions, products' demand functions are concave around the pre-merger equilibrium point. The concavity of the demand curve appears to be related to clustering of consumers around products in the differentiated product space. When such clustering occurs, the model suggests that demand will tend to have a concave shape around the pre-merger equilibrium point.","[Simons, Joseph J.] Fed Trade Commiss, Bur Competit, Washington, DC USA",,,jezrielev@compasslexecon.com; JSimons@paulweiss.com,,,,,,,18,3,3,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Simultaneously, the road-space has been narrowed by about a third. A survey of 1000 users of the tramway shows that the tramway hardly generated any shift from private cars towards public transit mode. However, it did generate important intra-mode transfers: from bus and subway towards tramway, and from Marechaux boulevards towards the Peripherique (the Paris ring road) for cars. The various benefits and costs of these changes are evaluated. The welfare gains made by public transport users are more than compensated by the time losses of the motorists, and in particular, by the additional cost of road congestion on the Peripherique. The same conclusion applies with regard to CO2 emissions: the reductions caused by the replacement of buses and the elimination of a few cars trips are less important than the increased pollution caused by the lengthening of the automobile trips and increased congestion on the ring road. Even if one ignores the initial investment of 350 M(sic), the social impact of the project, as measured by its net present value is negative. This is especially true for suburbanites. The inhabitants (and electors) of Paris pocket the main part of the benefits while supporting a fraction of the costs. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, to find a complete explanation for these relationships, their own contributions, which agree with our socio-economic reality, must be generated. This research tries to construct a concept about knowledge networks between organizations, resorting to a method for generating theory proposed by Gutierrez (2009), interrelated with the hermeneutic method (Dilthey, 1990), the qualitative content analysis technique (Kockelmans, 1975), abduction (Barrens, 2007) and the criteria established by Rudner (1973) for constructing social theory. Results emphasize the construction of an analytical-conceptual scheme, through which knowledge networks are outlined as a system of organizational relations established to promote local endogenous development, social inclusion and sustainability. This theoretical foundation was generated using an inventive process marked by the rigor of a scientific method and the spontaneity of the creative instinct.","[Gutierrez Gonzalez, Lorena; Flores Urbaez, Matilde] Univ Zulia, Unidad Acad Estudios Desarrollo, Dept Ciencias Humanas, Fac Ciencias Expt, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"Gutiérrez González, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Unidad Acad Estudios Desarrollo, Dept Ciencias Humanas, Fac Ciencias Expt, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",ggutierrez@fec.luz.edu.ve; floresurbaez8@yahoo.com,,"Flores-Urbaez, Matilde/0000-0002-0704-7739",,,,,21,0,0,1,8,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

The objective is to sow some concerns and questions using an aggregated approach to economic relationships established a priori and contrasted with the available statistical information, in order to create a reference framework for studying the effects of such policies, particularly monetary policy, on manufacturing activity. Conclusions are that, according to the available evidence and taking into account the limitations of this analysis, it is probable that monetary policy actions, through changes in the money supply, generate real short term impacts on manufacturing activity; an exchange relationship could exist between production and inflation, and hence, a potential problem of incoherence or dynamic inconsistency in monetary policy.","[Ocando Oropeza, Caren Crisbel; Pozo Sulbaran, Bladimir David] BCV, Subsede Maracaibo, Venezuela",,"Ocando Oropeza, CC (通讯作者)，BCV, Subsede Maracaibo, Venezuela.",cocando@bcv.org.ve; bpozo@bcv.org.ve,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Buyers suffer some disutility if a seller exits the market and so their first-period purchase decision not only depends on current period preferences and prices, but also on the potential effect that their behavior has on the probability of seller survival. Specifically, some buyers may choose to purchase from the seller with the lower survival probability even though they like the other seller's product better, a behavior that we call strategic buying. We analyze how the incidence of strategic buying depends on parameters and also the implications of the strategic buying motive for sellers' first-period pricing decisions.","[Clark, C.

Econometric methods (fixed effects and generalised method of moments) are used to measure the relationship between the just-in-time process (mostly an organisational type of process), technology (R&D) and productivity. In these regressions we also include the control variables of wage gap incentive, capital-to-labour ratio, and education expenses for sales training to accommodate for other important influences. From the overall and quantitative analyses, we provide evidence to the hypothesis that both organisation and technology greatly improve productivity of Korean manufacturing firms and sectors. In addition, not all firms and industrial sectors are influenced in the same way by all these factors. This variety of organisational and technological 'behaviour' is clearly indicated in our empirical findings. The contemporaneous impact of both organisational and technical innovations has not been tested before.","[Lim, Jisun; Sanidas, Elias] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Social Sci, Dept Econ, Seoul 151746, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Lim, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Social Sci, Dept Econ, 599 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151746, South Korea.",ellass@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,56,4,4,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Recent evolutionary theories suggest that whether agglomeration economies generate increasing returns or diminishing returns depends on time, and especially the evolution of the industry life cycle. At the start of the 21st century, we re-examine Marshall's trinity of agglomeration economies in the city-region where he discovered them. The econometric results from our multivariate regression models are the polar opposite of Marshall's. During the later stages of the industry life cycle, Marshall's agglomeration economies decrease the economic performance of firms and create widespread diminishing returns for the economic development of the city-region, which has evolved to become one of the poorest city-regions in Europe.","[Potter, Antony] Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Univ, Sch Management, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Wattsy, H.

This work proposes the use of shrinkage type estimation for the parameters of such components. The amount of smoothing to be imposed on the estimates can be chosen using different methodologies: Cross-Validation for dependent data or the recently proposed Focused Information Criterion. We illustrate such a methodology using a semiparametric autoregressive conditional duration model that decomposes the conditional expectations of durations into their dynamic (parametric) and diurnal (flexible) components. We use a shrinkage estimator that jointly estimates the parameters of the two components and controls the smoothness of the estimated flexible component. The results show that, from the forecasting perspective, an appropriate shrinkage strategy can significantly improve on the baseline maximum likelihood estimation.

The viability of more complete typologies, which often suffer from a lack of clear criteria for differentiating types of norms, is questioned. Two main properties of a norm are emphasized: (1) whether or not the behavior is simply what is done or whether it is what one should do, and (2) the source of sanctions for violating a norm, whether oneself, others, both or neither.","Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",Mississippi State University,"Interis, M (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, POB 5187, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",interis@agecon.msstate.edu,,"Interis, Matthew/0000-0003-3779-5495",,,,,27,18,22,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The exercises attempt to measure the accuracy of model-based forecasts simulated both out-of-sample and in-sample. Both exercises incorporate alternative residual-projection methods, to assess the importance of unaccounted-for breaks in forecast accuracy and off-model judgement. Conclusions reached are that simple mechanical residual adjustments have a significant impact on forecasting accuracy irrespective of the model in use, likely due to the presence of breaks in trends in the data. The testing procedure and conclusions are applicable to a wide class of models and of general interest.

We construct a flexible duration model, which allows for frailty at multiple levels and interactions between the child's age and individual, socioeconomic, and environmental characteristics. The model is estimated using the Indian National Family and Health Survey 1998/1999. The estimation results show that socioeconomic and environmental characteristics have significantly different impacts on mortality rates at different ages. These are particularly important immediately after birth. The parameter estimates indicate that child mortality can be reduced substantially, particularly by improving the education of women, providing safe water, and reducing indoor air pollution caused by dirty cooking fuels. Finally, we still found substantial differences in mortality rates between states, which are associated with differences in schooling expenditures, female immunization, and poverty rates.","[van der Klaauw, Bas] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wang, Limin] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [van der Klaauw, Bas] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Klaauw, Bas] CEPR, London, England",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; The World Bank; Tinbergen Institute; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"van der Klaauw, B (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",bklaauw@feweb.vu.nl; lwang1@worldbank.org,,"Klaauw, van der;Klaauw, van der, Bas/0000-0003-0476-9397",,,,,36,10,14,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The lack of availability of concentration ratio series for Romanian economy has limited the research in this field. The paper reports the concentration ratios dynamics in Romania during the period 1996-2004, looking at the differences between industries and offers some possible explanations. We use the simple concentration ratio (CR) for the largest 5 and 20 companies to measure concentration in 25 industries according to the sales figure and the number of employees. Our study has been limited to the processing industry, because the mining industry continues to have a very high level of concentration, without any significant changes in the analysed period; commerce, services and constructions are sectors with low entrance barriers and a strong geographic concentration character, thus their analysis can become irrelevant for the national level. Based on the average values of the concentration coefficients that it was determined for the period 1996-2004 we proposed the map of Romanian industry concentration, as a graphical tool for a synthetic view of the general concentration level in a national economy.","[Marginean, Silvia; Toma (Orastean), Ramona] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Fac Econ Sci, Sibiu 550324, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Marginean, S (通讯作者)，Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Fac Econ Sci, Dumbravii St 17, Sibiu 550324, Romania.",silvia_marginean@yahoo.com; torasib@yahoo.com,"Marginean, Silvia/K-3541-2014; Orastean, Ramona/C-4501-2008","Marginean, Silvia/0000-0003-1265-4506; Orastean, Ramona/0000-0001-9881-9636",,,,,48,1,1,0,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The variables influencing travel pattern choices are investigated using: (a) Cluster Analysis (CA), grouping and characterizing the Traffic Zones (17), proposing the independent variable called Origin Cluster and, (b) Decision Tree (DT) to find a priori unknown relations among socioeconomic characteristics, land use attributes of the origin TZ and destination choices. The analysis was based on the origin-destination home-interview survey carried out in SPMA in 1997. The DT application revealed the variables of greatest influence on the travel pattern choice. The most important independent variable considered by DT is car ownership, followed by the Use of Transportation credits for Transit tariff, and, finally, activity participation variables and Origin Cluster. With these results, it was possible to analyze the influence of a family income, car ownership, position of the individual in the family, use of transportation credits for transit tariff (mainly for travel mode sequence choice), activities participation (activity sequence choice) and Origin Cluster (destination/travel distance choice).

In this paper we draw upon a unique data set of regulatory inspections conducted by the U. S.

We find that the canonical assumptions of the agency paradigm are strained by, if not altogether inconsistent with, the key practical realities of regulation by the FDA. Our analysis uncovers several dimensions along which regulators actively and endogenously seek to close the information asymmetry gap.

Furthermore, it is found that this relationship is asymmetric in the sense that when the freight market is in backwardation, volatility is higher compared to periods when the market is in contango.

We take advantage of a recent merger, which altered the extent of MMC throughout the US airline industry, to understand the nature of MMC's impact on the airlines' frequency of service. Evidence that non-price effects of MMC are a part of the longer-term industry equilibrium is not robust. However, we observe that following the merger the market players started taking the degree of MMC into account in making their frequency decisions in line with the 'mutual forbearance' hypothesis; however, the effect showed signs of diminishing over time. Our results have implications for merger evaluation in industries where consolidation may lead to a higher extent of multimarket contact.","[Bilotkach, Volodymyr] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Bilotkach, V (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",vbilotka@uci.edu,,,,,,,19,45,55,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

However, a vague reference to the usefulness of accounting information means nothing unless the utility being sought is properly defined. This paper reflects on the relevancy of decision-usefulness as a key financial reporting objective from two perspectives. Firstly, the ontology of accountancy with specific reference to decision-usefulness and utility versus ophelimity are considered. Secondly, epistemological issues around the quantification of accounting data and its predictive abilities are discussed. The article does not deny the importance of the usefulness criterion, but rather argues against a vacuous concept of decision-usefulness, which, as a key accounting and financial reporting objective, is devoid of any substantive meaning. Instead, a more realistic key objective of accounting should be to provide factual economic and financial information, which, since it presents any user with information in a unique company-specific context, can be considered judgement-useful, rather than decision-useful.","North West Univ, Sch Accounting Sci, Mmabatho, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Buys, P (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Accounting Sci, Mmabatho, South Africa.",,,,,,,,58,0,1,0,10,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The model demonstrates that class-based affirmative action cannot provide as many subaltern-group beneficiaries as group-based affirmative action, especially when access to the desired positions hinges on performance qualifications.

Previous data on this topic showed that education and training has a double positive impact: as a success factor for a business (highly educated women tend to run bigger firms), as well as an element of promoting entrepreneurship among women. Nevertheless experience showed us that training is an important factor yet it does not act alone, and entrepreneurs, have to face several challenges that require different type of resources. The data presented in this paper are both quantitative and qualitative and are focused on the type and the effects of different problems which need to be solved by women entrepreneurs in the initiation and development of a business. Accordingly, the main research questions addressed in this paper are: which is the hierarchy of obstacles faced by women entrepreneurs comparatively at business start-up and after activity? Which are the main obstacles of women who intend to develop a business? How can these obstacles be overcome? The first part investigates different obstacles faced by women entrepreneurs in Western Romania, such as taxes, bureaucracy, instable legal frame work, competition and access to finance. Our study is based on the results of a survey conducted within the project Entrepreneurship and Equality of Chances. An Inter-regional Model of Entrepreneurship Training for Women in Western Romania - ANTRES (POSDRU/9/3.1/S/5). We have investigated two categories of women: first entrepreneurs from urban areas in the western part of Romania and second women who intend to start a business from urban and rural western Romania - over 2000 questionnaires were analyzed in this paper. The main conclusion of this section is that most problems that entrepreneurs have to overcome in order to develop their business can be addressed solely by governmental policies and support in access to finance and other resources. This last category of factors was especially emphasized by women who intend to start their own business from the project mentioned above, which were interviewed as a follow up survey. From these interviews, which are analyzed in the second section of this paper, we can state that the main obstacle in the decision to initiate one's own business is the lack of financial resources along with other aspects derived from the current economic context. Consequently, in the third part we addressed this last aspect, and added a new research question: Is the access to finance a real obstacle to entrepreneurship, especially for women entrepreneurship? This section is based on analysis derived from the joint EBRD - World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) conducted in 2002 and 2005, as well as CEEDR 2000. This data supports the conclusion of our ANTRES survey, as business start-up finance is seen a major problem by most respondents, along with high tax rates.","[Dodescu, Anca; Badulescu, Alina; Saveanu, Tomina] Univ Oradea, Fac Econ, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea,"Dodescu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, Fac Econ, Oradea, Romania.",adodescu@uoradea.ro; abadulescu@uoradea.ro; tsaveanu@uoradea.ro,"Saveanu, Tomina G/D-8743-2014; Dodescu, Anca Otilia/AAL-5187-2021; Badulescu, Alina/B-6477-2015; Badulescu, Alina/AAC-4228-2020","Badulescu, Alina/0000-0002-0090-9340;",European Social Fund [POSDRU/9/3.1/S/5],European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"The project Entrepreneurship and the Equality of Chances.

The model is empirically tested among copreneurial businesses to assess potential relationships between selected independent variables (shared dream, leadership, personal needs alignment, division of labour, complementary skills, supportive employees, competencies and adequate resources) and measures of copreneurial success (perceived success and financial performance). In order to address the primary objective of this study, a questionnaire was administered to a sample of 1548 respondents (spouses in business together) of which 380 questionnaires were useable for statistical analysis.

As standard unit root tests, such as Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Philips and Perron (PP) tests, are biased towards the null of a unit root in presence of structural breaks, we use Lee and Strazicich (2003) test to address this issue and test the null of unit roots. The result reveals that the variables under consideration are not in the same order of integration. Therefore to investigate the long-run relationship between variables under consideration, this paper applies the bounds test approach to cointegration. This method was developed by Pesaran et al. (2001) and can be applied irrespective of the order of integration of the variables. The results reveal that there is a long run relation among these variables and in the long run 1 percent increase in money growth cause to increase 72 percent in inflation rate, which means money is the most important variable that effect inflation in long run. Moreover we find that inflation was largely a monetary phenomenon, supporting quantity theory of money.","[Heidari, Hassan; Salmasi, Parisa Jouhari] Urmia Univ, Dept Econ, Orumiyeh, Iran",Urmia University,,h.heidari@urmia.ac.ir; johari.p63@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,1,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8640-0,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,1.0,,,,,,192,195,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173400042,0

Additionally, it is expected that psychological capital and service orientation contribute to entrepreneurial success through entrepreneurial work engagement.
