The work-force is composed by cooperative and non-cooperative workers, while firms offer either explicit or implicit contracts. Both the distribution of preferences and the nature of labor contract are endogenized: firms invest in corporate culture in order to change workers' preferences and the proportion of each type of contract is driven by an evolutionary process. The complementarity between the transmission of cooperation and the implementation of implicit contracts leads to multiple equilibria and path dependence phenomenon. This property is illustrated by historical evolutions of American and Japanese labor contracts.","[Hiller, Victor] Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Hiller, V (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",hiller@univ-paris1.fr,"Hiller, Victor/HGF-7139-2022","Hiller, Victor/0000-0002-1616-6158",,,,,20,1,1,2,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0026-1386,,,METROECONOM,Metroeconomica,FEB,2010,61.0,1,,,SI,,152,179,,10.1111/j.1467-999X.2009.04064.x,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,664SP,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000282983100007,0

In the presence of unfunded income support policies, this increase in old age dependency is expected to increase the future fiscal burden of ageing, which is seen as a threat to living standards. Private intergenerational transfers in the form of bequests are also expected to increase in ageing societies, which may offset the adverse effects of the fiscal burden of population ageing on future living standards. This paper quantifies the ability of these private intergenerational transfers to offset the future fiscal burden of ageing in Australia. This is done through developing a dynamic overlapping generations simulation model with realistic demographics. Calculations based on steady-state simulations (with a pay-as-you-go tax rate equal to 3.3% of GDP) suggest that a bequest to GDP ratio of 1% offsets approximately one-third of the fiscal burden over the lifecycle when measured as a proportion of simple labour income and one-eleventh of the fiscal burden when measured as a proportion of full income (labour income plus leisure). The model is calibrated for Australia under a small open economy assumption such that the optimal solution mimics important cross-sectional and time-series fundamentals of the Australian economy. For the non-steady-state, intergenerational accounting suggests that the empirically plausible intergenerational transfers are strong enough to offset most of the tax burden (80-90%) when measured as a percentage of simple labour income and up to one-quarter of the burden when fiscal burden is measured as a percentage of full income.","La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"Khan, H (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",h.khan@latrobe.edu.au,,"Khan, Hayat/0000-0002-1959-0640",,,,,34,1,1,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

For the first, this is because agriculture is a large sector, with important multiplier effects on other sectors of the economy, competitive advantage given the current state of institutional development, and is necessary to support internationally competitive labour costs for the rest of the economy due to incomplete tradability of food. For the second, this is because a vast majority of the poor are rural people who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, and access to food importantly depends on local production. Yet, this achievement has largely been elusive, with Africa still to achieve a Green Revolution as other continents have done. Fundamental questions are thus: Why this has been the case? How could a Green Revolution be engineered? And what are some of the emerging opportunities and hurdles in securing success? These are the questions addressed by the papers contained in this volume. Together the papers argue that new opportunities exist to make a Green Revolution for Africa possible but that greater attention must be given to the design and testing of new approaches that correspond to the specific conditions of Africa and the corresponding development of human capacity (de Janvry and Sadoulet); that the release of profitable new technologies will be the driving force inducing the necessary institutional changes and public investments in agriculture as it did in Asia (Otsuka and Kijima); that the hurdles of adverse OECD farm policies, property rights on new biological technologies and concentration of market power in integrated value chains must be addressed and removed (Oyejide); and that adapting the Green Revolution to climate change is a huge new challenge that will require large investments to reduce vulnerability to warming and extreme weather events and to enhance farmers' capacity to respond (Hassan).",,,,,,,,,,,0,2,2,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

We use the inflation forecasts of 8 competing models in a standard Bayesian VAR to analyse the size and the timing of these effects, as well as to quantify the uncertainty relative to the different inflation models under two rules. The results suggest that model uncertainty can be a serious issue and strengthen the case for a policy strategy that takes into account several sources of information. We find that combining inflation forecasts from many models not only yields more accurate forecasts than those of any specific model, but also reduces the uncertainty associated with the real effects of policy decisions. These results are in line with the model-combination approach that central banks already follow when conceiving their strategy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Federal districts also have high capital/labour ratios, suggesting that expanded regional domestic and foreign investment across Russia in the future will enhance growth.","Georgia So Univ, Sch Econ Dev, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University,"Brock, G (通讯作者)，Georgia So Univ, Sch Econ Dev, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",gbrock@georgiasouthern.edu,"brock, gregory/I-5426-2013",,,,,,30,6,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,1,,,,,19,31,PII 919255581,10.1080/14631370903525579,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,596GX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277674300002,0

We find empirical evidence that a greater degree of disclosure has a significantly positive impact on the abnormal returns of firms with multiple successive profit warnings. We argue that negative abnormal returns will occur with firms which provide external reasons in their press releases indicating that the causes of the current situation are a market-wide phenomenon and beyond their scope.

Despite this difficulty, important advances have been made, though many more remain to be made in the search for procedures that will enrich these analyses. In this article we present a new proposal for the measurement of disparities between indicators of social welfare, applied to a group of countries especially affected by poverty: the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) which in the terminology of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) are the poorest of the poor. In our analysis we will refer to the Asian continent. Our index is novel in that it has been constructed taking into account a larger number of variables than the welfare indices most usually used, and the criteria defined in the Goals of the Millennium Declaration, which are generally considered to determine countries' levels of underdevelopment. As technique applied to the data, provided by the UN and listed in the Annual Report of the LDCs for 2007, the latest year for which definitive data were available, we have used the P-2 distance method. This index integrates socio-economic variables that permit a ranking of the LDCs of Asia, in terms of those partial indicators.","[Cuenca Garcia, Eduardo] Univ Granada, Jean Monnet Chair European Econ Integrat, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"García, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Jean Monnet Chair European Econ Integrat, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",ecuenca@ugr.es; josearm@ugr.es,", Eduardo/HIK-2340-2022","Cuenca-Garcia, Eduardo/0000-0001-9976-8930",,,,,47,3,3,0,7,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

We find that about one-half of the Russian population is disappointed with transition and a large majority is in favour of high state regulation and state provision of goods and services. High demand for government regulation and increased state intervention coexists with a low level of trust in government institutions and recognition of high and rising levels of corruption. The findings are consistent with the theory developed by Aghion et al. (2009). In an environment with poor social capital, private business imposes negative externalities on the society and society chooses to demand more state regulation and tolerate corruption to reduce these externalities. We also find that individual perceptions of social capital and corruption co-vary with the demand for regulation, as predicted by the theory.","[Denisova, Irina] Ctr Econ & Financial Res CEFIR, Moscow, Russia; [Eller, Markus] Oesterreich Nationalbank, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Zhuravskaya, Ekaterina] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB); New Economic School,"Denisova, I (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ & Financial Res CEFIR, Moscow, Russia.",idenisova@cefir.ru; Markus.Eller@oenb.at; EZhuravskaya@nes.ru,"Denisova, Irina/HTN-5278-2023","Zhuravskaya, Ekaterina/0000-0002-3496-2086",,,,,32,17,23,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0967-0750,,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

From the empirical perspective, the paper ranks the methods based on volatility and discusses the relation between volatility and the persistent and non-persistent changes in relative prices, focusing on the relation between the changes in the components of the CPI that tend to be irreversible and the CPI.

According to the National Account System, between 1988 and 2004 in Mexico the export growth had not a great impact on the economic growth due to the increase of imports. Only in a few branches of de manufacturing industry, especially the maquiladoras, had a higher level of product employment elasticity.

Comparisons with two other uni-sectoral composite leading indicators for the same reference series-the traditional KOF (Konjunkturforschungsstelle) barometer as published until March 2006 and a uni-sectoral composite indicator computed from the same indicators as the multi-sectoral instrument-show that the new approach is superior to the alternatives, which is due to both its broader information basis as well as to the structure that is imposed by the multi-sectoral design.

Both the trades in stock market and the changes of the position in the futures contracts are in the presence of proportional transaction costs. We assume that the agent is interested in an integrated discounted expected utility of the wealth process over an infinite-time horizon with HARA (Hyperbolic Absolute Risk Aversion) utility function. We propose a function which assigns this value to every admissible strategy and to every initial condition provided that (1) the stock market price follows a geometric Brownian motion and (2) the futures price follows an arithmetic Brownian motion. We show that these both cases can be treated simultaneously and that the setting of the problem leads to the explicit results that are completely analogical. We use a martingale technique, which means that we are able to express the conditional expectation of the aggregated discounted utility of the wealth process in terms of a certain transformation of the investor's position in the market. Such a transformation is an explicit solution of a certain ordinary differential equation.

Both the welfare effects of and the optimal response to international tax planning are therefore ambiguous. Evaluating these factors in a simple general equilibrium model, we find that citizens of high-tax countries benefit from (some) tax planning. Paradoxically, if tax rates are not too high, an increase in tax planning activity causes a rise in optimal corporate tax rates, and a decline in multinational investment. Thus fears of a race to the bottom in corporate tax rates may be misplaced. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our results spanning 88 countries over 1960-2005 show that a positive long-run relationship between trade openness and financial development coexists with a negative short-run relationship.

The present study focuses on a panel of 27 transition and 20 developed countries between 1990 and 2006 and uses the latest developments in panel unit root and cointegration techniques to disentangle the effects of international spillovers via inflows of trade and FDI on total factor productivity (TFP). The findings show that imports remain the main channel of diffusion for both sets of countries, while FDI, although statistically significant, has a lower impact on productivity of the recipients. The domestic RD capital stock plays an active role in Western Europe while in the Eastern part it is less significant owing to lower levels, transitional disinvestment and relative obsolescence. Human capital affects TFP directly as a factor of production as well as indirectly by enhancing a country's absorptive capacity. In aggregate, the results show that transition countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia seem to enjoy bigger productivity gains from the international diffusion process than their Western counterparts.","Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Krammer, SMS (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, 110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",krammm@rpi.edu,"Krammer, Sorin M.S./K-2164-2019","Krammer, Sorin M.S./0000-0002-5773-9514",,,,,59,44,47,0,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

There is also a necessity of presenting these indicators in market prices. The second important requirement is the need of calculation based on real service life of assets. That is why data from business accounting are insufficient and stocks and consumption cannot be easily taken from bookkeeping. Considering the impossibility of expert evaluation of each single asset in economy, the computation of the stocks and consumption of fixed capital is realised on the basis of PIM (Perpetual Inventory Method). The processes of retirement, decay and obsolescence of fixed assets in national economy are modeled, and required indicators are annually computed on the basis of surveyed or estimated gross fixed capital formation data. The PIM is a descriptive deterministic simulation model with constant time step. The paper deals with the elaboration of PIM from Markov chains point of view. The Markov chains based approach that satisfies the international standards and achieves results which are equivalent to established approaches is presented. This new approach is compared with the established.

Bayesian estimation is applied because maximum likelihood estimation is sensitive to the starting values of maximization, and the parameters typically fail to converge to the global optimum because of a multimodal likelihood. Thanks to a convenient prior distribution, the posterior simulation of parameters works fairly well. The results indicate that in the long run (over 100 years) the parameters for the elasticity of substitution and capital income share are intimately linked to the shape of capital-augmenting technological progress. In particular, the linear restriction excludes the possibility that the speed of capital-augmenting technological progress converges to zero, which seems to lead to upwardly biased estimates of the elasticity of substitution and income share parameters.","[Luoto, Jani] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Luoma, Arto] Univ Tampere, Dept Math & Stat, Tampere 33014, Finland",University of Helsinki; Tampere University,"Luoto, J (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ, Arkadiankatu 7, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",arto.luoma@uta.fi; jani.luoto@helsinki.fi,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

In particular the concept of real options methodology has modulated, into an innovative agricultural project called wema, to model design flexibility in the realistically uncertain environment of information and communication technologies (ICT). Taking into account the great importance of ICTs, as the principal driver of change in agricultural areas, as well as the drastic increase in ICTs adoption over the last decade, a study evaluating the adoption parameters of ICTs can prove significantly valuable. Besides, any issue related to ICTs is extremely interesting and it belongs to the modern subject-matters of the agricultural economics science. Empirical results revealed that, according to the traditional criterion (Net Present Value), the implementation plan of the wema project is feasible. However, assuming the presence of uncertainty, application of a real options approach demonstrates that the Net Present Value may lead stakeholders to faulty decisions, as the innovative plan is rejected. The results indicate that the options have a significant value and highlight the fact that ignoring options value process can lead to a significant error. This obviously indicates the importance of combining the Net Present Value criterion in agricultural extension investments with the real options approach.","[Michailidis, Anastasios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios] Technol Educ Inst Western Macedonia, Dept Agr Prod Mkt & Qual Control, Florina, Greece; [Theodosiou, George] Technol Educ Inst Larissa, Dept Business Adm, Larisa, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Michailidis, A (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece.",tassosm@auth.gr; fchatzitheo@gmail.com; geortheo@yahoo.gr,"Μιχαηλίδης, Αναστάσιος/AAC-9552-2019; Michailidis, Anastasios Ch./B-3537-2010; Theodossiou, George/ABM-5453-2022; Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios/E-3450-2017","Michailidis, Anastasios Ch./0000-0002-7560-4365; Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios/0000-0003-2008-1023; Theodosiou, Georgios/0000-0001-7241-8084",,,,,27,2,2,0,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The test results suggest that only the conditional mean of the inflation is a nonlinear process whereas the conditional variance is time variant but linear. Using the square root of conditional variance as a proxy for inflation risk, we estimate Fisher equation augmented with inflation risk. Although the estimated Fisher equations suggest that inflation risk reduces short-term interest rates, we find that the effects of inflation risk on interest rates are regime-dependent. Particularly, we find that the negative effects of inflation variability on nominal rates are greater in low-inflationary regimes when compared to high-inflationary regimes. On the other hand, it is found that both inflation and inflation uncertainty raise the expected inflation effect.","[Hasanov, Muebariz] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Omay, Tolga] Cankaya Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06530 Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University; Cankaya University,"Hasanov, M (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, Beytepe Kampusu, Ankara, Turkey.",muhas@hacettepe.edu.tr,"Hasanov, Mubariz/GMX-0254-2022; Hasanov, Mübariz/AAT-7120-2021","Hasanov, Mubariz/0000-0003-0216-9531; Hasanov, Mübariz/0000-0003-0216-9531",,,,,82,12,13,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

But the multi-variate elliptical stable distributions can be easily simulated and the estimation of their parameters can be obtained by methods whose preciseness is almost the same as the one of the maximum likelihood methodology.","[Omelchenko, Vadym] Charles Univ Prage, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Acad Sci Czech Republ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,,vadim224@yahoo.com,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,0,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,483,488,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900082,0

We adjust the definition of the current account to include the capital gains and discuss how this may affect our thinking about external adjustment and sustainability. We do so in the context of a two-country macro-finance model of Pavlova and Rigobon (2008a) that allows exploration of the interconnections between equilibrium portfolios and external accounts' dynamics. We calibrate the model and find that it generates several testable implications, some of which have already been validated empirically. Firsts we establish dynamic properties of the capital-gains adjusted current account and show that they are fundamentally different from those of the conventional current account. Second, we find that capital gains have a stabilizing effect on the trade balance and the current account. Finally, we demonstrate that in response to a shock, the conventional and the capital-gains adjusted current accounts may move in opposite directions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to trends in income inequalities, there is little evidence that regional poverty disparities have peaked and are falling in Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Using panel data for the transition countries, we find that high levels of regional poverty disparity have a positive impact on macroeconomic performance. Further evidence suggests this result may be driven by the positive effect of disparities on both saving and the pace of economic reforms. However, it appears that disparities are beneficial to progress on both economic and democratic reforms only for countries with per capita income levels above USD3000.","[Peters, Christina] Metropolitan State Coll Denver, Denver, CO USA; [Sprout, Ron; Melzig, Robyn] US Agcy Int Dev, Washington, DC 20523 USA",United States Agency for International Development (USAID),"Peters, C (通讯作者)，Metropolitan State Coll Denver, Denver, CO USA.",cpeter80@mscd.edu,"Peters, Christina/K-9327-2019","Peters, Christina/0000-0001-9854-8573",,,,,34,4,4,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,3,,,,,345,365,PII 925485462,10.1080/14631377.2010.498684,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,636WF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280773700005,0

In particular, delaying legal retirement ages and reducing the generosity of pension benefits have been widely implemented changes. This paper assesses the potential success of these policies in the case of the Spanish economy, and compares them with the results obtained by the (rather modest) reforms already implemented in 1997 and 2001. This evaluation is accomplished in a heterogeneous-agent dynamic general equilibrium model where individuals can adjust their retirement ages in response to changes to the pension rules. We check the ability of the model to reproduce the basic stylized facts of retirement behavior (particularly the pattern of early retirement induced by minimum pensions). The model is then used to explore the impact of pension reforms. We find that already implemented changes actually increase the implicit liabilities of the system. In contrast, delaying the legal retirement age and extending the averaging period in the pension formula to cover most of the individual's life-cycle can reduce the implicit liabilities substantially. These findings reveal the failure of the Spanish political system to distribute the costs of population aging more evenly across the generations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper sheds light on this issue by studying reviewer productivity and restaurant ratings at Yelp, where reviewers are encouraged to establish a social image, and two competing websites, where reviewers are completely anonymous. Using a dataset of nearly half a million reviewer accounts, we find that the number (proportion) of prolific reviewers on Yelp is an order of magnitude larger than that on either competing site, more productive reviewers on all three websites are less likely to give an extreme rating, and restaurant ratings on Yelp tend to be much less extreme than those on either competing site.","Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Wang, ZM (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",zho.wang@neu.edu,,,,,,,27,22,33,1,32,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

It finds that the supply-side structure, measured by sectoral shares in value added. increased production-related carbon emissions in 1992-2002, mainly due to the rapid growth of manufacturing sectors, but reduced them in 2002-2005 thanks to the decreased shares of carbon-intensive sectors. Whatever the supply-side structure, forward carbon multipliers of each sector or changes in supply-side sectoral shares and related emissions effects calculated by adopting the Ghosh input-output model were different from their demand-side counterparts estimated by adopting the Leontief input-output model. The results suggest optimizing the supply-side structure and lowering the forward carbon multipliers to control carbon emissions in the future. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

L22, M1, D20, L62) In economic and management theories, vertical scope is the predominant aspect of firm boundaries. Yet, as recent research indicates, firms make and buy, engage in concurrent sourcing, or make their boundaries permeable: vertical scope is not the only and, perhaps, not the. main lens for understanding firms' boundaries, in particular as firms redesign them today. This paper draws on a longitudinal qualitative case study of FIAT Auto in order to contribute to understanding how boundary design can go beyond vertical scope, what that means for conceptualizations of the design of firm boundaries, and how firm can use these additional mean of boundary design in order to generate positive performance consequences. The empirical findings highlight that in designing their boundaries firms can also leverage purely organizational solutions regarding intra and inter firm structures and processes rather than acting on vertical scope. The paper argues that the extant empirical focus on transactions and the ownership of vertically related activities in boundary design decisions should be complemented by an explicit attention to organizational design variables.","[Becker, Markus C.] Univ So Denmark, Strateg Org Design Unit, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Zirpoli, Francesco] Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Ingn Meccan, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy",University of Southern Denmark; University of Salerno,"Becker, MC (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Strateg Org Design Unit, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",mab@sam.sdu.dk; fzirpoli@unisa.it,"Zirpoli, Francesco/P-3377-2019; Zirpoli, Francesco/A-3634-2014","Zirpoli, Francesco/0000-0002-7760-8490",,,,,32,0,0,0,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

However, reliance on a centralized command-and-control model managed by government has also been shown to entail problems in practice. For this reason I argue that the best option at China's current state of development may be a compromise model in which competing private providers are given all important role, both for the production of health services and in the provision of health insurance. but in which the government intervenes (through regulation and direct provision) in such a way as to attain both a high degree of equity of access to health care, and to avoid the most significant forms of market failure that Would arise in an unregulated private system.

This productivity revival has been limited, however, to information technology (IT) production-has not been a broad-based productivity acceleration like that seen in the United States after the mid-1990s. This paper examines the relationship between IT and productivity gains by employing the augmented growth accounting framework for Japanese industry-level data from 1975 through 2005. In particular, we estimate purified technology change at industry level by accounting for cyclical mismeasurement of inputs. We find that the post-2000 increase in overall TFP growth does indeed appear to arise from an increase in technological change. Furthermore, the pickup in technology growth has occurred not only in the production of IT but also in the industries that use IT intensively. Our results suggest the possibility that stories of IT as a general purpose technology (GPT) could apply to Japan as well as to the United States. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

But tensions over distributional issues still plague the body politic. This paper investigates the evolution of Sri Lanka's expenditure distribution in the period 1980-2002 and uses three decomposition methodologies-the Fields, the Shapley value decomposition, and Yun's unified method-to determine underlying causes. The study finds that while average adjusted expenditure rose across strata, the rich experienced more rapid expenditure growth leading to greater inequality. Inequality change was driven by differential access to infrastructure, education, and occupation status. Demographic factors, including ethnicity, and spatial factors contributed very little. The study recommends policies that ensure more equitable access to income earning assets such as education and infrastructure services, and that contain the rise in inequality along sectoral, regional, and ethnic fault lines.","[Chotikapanich, Duangkamon] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Monash University,"Chotikapanich, D (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, POB 197, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",chotikap@buseco.monash.edu.au,,"Chotikapanich, Duangkamon/0000-0003-1011-9585",,,,,40,21,21,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The differences in education between population groups account for a substantive part (up to 40%) of the differences in completed fertility between the population groups. Our findings suggest that educational reforms aimed at equal access to education, which benefit African women most, may not only improve the quality of life of women but also, through their impact on fertility behaviour, yield long-run benefits, as they will have fewer children and more resources to invest in the next generation.","[Gustafsson, Siv] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kalwij, Adriaan] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; Utrecht University,"Worku, S (通讯作者)，Stat S Africa, NSS Registers, Pretoria, South Africa.",seblew@statssa.gov.za,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

We show that the presence of capital controls on residents and non-residents enabled the South African Reserve Bank to target domestic interest rates (and or the exchange rate) via interventions in the (commercial) foreign exchange market. This provides an early rationale for anchoring SA monetary policy via the exchange rate, rather than via domestic interest rates. This suggests not only that the capital controls themselves exhibited substantial institutional inertia, but that this same institutional inertia also applied to the monetary policy regime. A plausible reason for this is that for most of the 20th century in South Africa.

In a curious inversion of the traditional formulations drawing on Lenin, imperial hegemony in today's context would seem to be associated with net capital imports (rather than exports) by the dominant country. In particular, I argue that in a context where the role of world money rests on the monetary liabilities of a dominant state, in the form of credit money - fictitious capital - rather than bullion, there is an easing of the external constraint on the advanced countries in the core with the impact of the debt-deflationary spiral and financial fragility being borne disproportionately by the periphery. The theorization of world money needs to address the relation between the state and the financial system: the asymmetric manner in which countries outside the core were incorporated into the monetary system, and the role that financialization plays in preserving the hegemony of the dominant currency.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Vasudevan, R (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Ramaa.vasudevan@colostate.edu,,,,,,,49,14,16,2,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Two forms of skill accumulation are considered: learning by doing and on-the-job training. In our economy with learning by doing, individuals supply more labor early in the life cycle and less as they approach retirement than they do in an economy without this feature. The impact of this feature on the volatility of hours over the life cycle depends on the value of the intertemporal elasticity of labor Supply. When individuals accumulate skills by on-the-job training, there are only weak effects on both the steady-state labor supply and its volatility over the life cycle. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To test this, we use evidence from Australia, a country in which voting is compulsory, and in which voters are given 'How-to-Vote' cards, depicting photos of the major party candidates, as they arrive to vote. Using raters chosen to be representative of the electorate, we assess the beauty of political candidates from major political parties, and then estimate the effect of beauty on voteshare for candidates in the 2004 federal election. Beautiful candidates are indeed more likely to be elected, with a one standard deviation increase in beauty associated with a 1 1/2 - 2 percentage point increase in voteshare. Our results are robust to several specification checks: adding party fixed effects, dropping well-known politicians, using non-Australian beauty raters, omitting candidates of non-Anglo appearance, controlling for age, and analyzing the 'beauty gap' between candidates running in the same electorate. The marginal effect of beauty is larger for male candidates than for female candidates, and appears to be approximately linear. Consistent with the theory that returns to beauty reflect discrimination, we find suggestive evidence that beauty matters more in electorates with a higher share of apathetic voters.","[Leigh, Andrew] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Social Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [King, Amy] Univ Oxford, Trinity Coll, Oxford OX1 3BH, England",Australian National University; University of Oxford,"Leigh, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Social Sci, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",amy.king@trinity.ox.ac.uk; andrew.leigh@anu.edu.au,"King, Amy/AAQ-7656-2020; Leigh, Andrew/AAV-1366-2020","King, Amy/0000-0002-9614-5516; Leigh, Andrew/0000-0002-5639-0509",,,,,30,71,84,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2009,62.0,4,,,,,579,593,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00452.x,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,509QK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271033000009,0

To date, empirical studies have failed to find a high degree of ERPT in Croatia, even though exchange rate stability has been one of the goals of monetary policy throughout the transition period. Using a nonlinear model, this study demonstrates that ERPT is present in the data and shows why it cannot be detected with a linear model. According to our estimates, there is a threshold at 5.91 percent of the monthly growth rate of the nominal exchange rate of the German mark (euro), with the 95 percent interval between about 2.7 and 21.8 percent. Consistent with the theories of sticky prices or pricing to market, ERPT is asymmetric around the threshold: below it, the ERPT effect is weak or statistically insignificant, and above it, the effect is strong and significant.","[Tica, Josip; Posedel, Petra] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Tica, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",,"Posedel Šimović, Petra/HMD-2428-2023; Tica, Josip/B-7628-2013","Posedel Šimović, Petra/0000-0002-4447-1643; Tica, Josip/0000-0001-7937-1573",,,,,36,6,6,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Improved health is normally envisaged as simply a by-product of economic growth. Whereas growth does, indeed, tend to improve health status, the reverse is also true, namely that health improvements are a dynamic force capable of driving economic expansion. This paper underlines the importance of health improvements in escaping from Malthusian stagnation. Further, and in contrast to existing literature, which emphasizes the effects of changes in mortality rates, this paper focuses on the relationship between health status and the efficiency of human capital technology.

Corporate headquarters receives two types of signals about investment opportunities: private signals that can be distorted by managers, and public signals that are undistorted but noisy. Headquarters faces a tradeoff between the cost of attaining an accurate private signal and the value of the information the signal provides. In contrast to existing models of socialism in internal capital markets, I show that investment sensitivity to Tobin's Q is higher than first-best in firms where division managers hold equity (a result consistent with evidence presented in Scharfstein, 1998). When managers face high private costs from distorting information (equity holdings), headquarters may commit to investment contracts that place too little weight on private signals and too much weight on public signals (i.e. Q).

This paper develops a framework where policy choices in market regulation and taxation are constrained by past investments in legal and fiscal capacity. It studies the economic and political determinants of such investments, demonstrating that legal and fiscal capacity are typically complements.

J,"Kinsella, S",,,,"Kinsella, Stephen",,,Preference Falsification in Teaching,ECON JOURNAL WATCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Writing a course description is hard. In Irish universities ( and elsewhere), the individual lecturer must hew to a course description designed by either the head of department, or a committee of senior colleagues. The writer of this course description must contend with a host of issues; what concepts are to be included? What should be discarded? At what level should the material challenge the students? All the while, the writer must consider those who came before her in writing the course description, and those who will come after. The outcome of this process is, naturally, a course shaped around a textbook. In economics, one finds young professors teaching from the textbooks they squinted over not so long ago, replaying elements of their favorite lectures. Young professors want to stick rigourously to the course description, given to them by the Head of Department, because they wish to be good colleagues, not make any waves, and not make any presumptions with the students, who might damage their teaching evaluations. In Irish universities, changing the content of the course by more than 25% requires approval at the faculty level. The young professors must hew to the textbooks for guidance, because the course description is deliberately light on specifics. Often only keywords are present for guidance. Because most textbooks are written from similar methodological standpoints, (E.g. in macroeconomics: Barro and Sala-i Martin 2003, Blanchard 2005, Abel et al. 2007, DeLong 2002), the course content is, perforce, of a similar orientation. The course in macroeconomics, say, begins from the production function, adds the marginal conditions for productivities of capital and labour, and continues on to build a micro-founded macroeconomic model, where all the individual markets are in equilibrium, all the consumers maximize their consumption and saving profiles over time, and business cycles are simply the resultant outcomes of stochastic shocks to technology, labour, capital, and so forth. Teaching exclusively from a neoclassical perspective is distressing for one who tends toward less conventional thought. Say one is a post-Keynesian. If one believes in the inability of unregulated markets to satisfy effective demand, if one does not believe the production function is a reasonable way of modeling economic activity, if one endorses the influences of fundamental uncertainty, asymmetric information, and psychological biases as underpinning economic decisions, then to teach a theory which assumes away these features of reality is contradictory. Here I'm assuming a polar position for the sake of argument: of course one can alloy the textbook with supplementary readings, spend time critiquing the model, or simply disregard the course description, and teach what one wants to. But let's say for the moment the young professor has to choose between rigourously upholding her personal views, or teaching verbatim out of a standard textbook. I should confess at this stage that my personal orientation would be post-Keynesian. In this world, if one's preference is for a non-equilibrium macroeconomics, and one teaches equilibrium macroeconomics, then this activity can be referred to as preference falsification, in the sense of Kuran (1987, 54). Preference falsification can occur in teaching when a personal intellectual compromise takes place with respect to the content of a class being taught. The professor publicly espouses a theory or mode of storytelling whose policy prescriptions are, in some cases, orthogonal to their private and professional views or attitudes.","Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Kinsella, S (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Limerick, Ireland.",stephen.kinsella@ul.ie,"Kinsella, Stephen/ABH-3066-2020","Kinsella, Stephen/0000-0002-7943-4797",,,,,12,0,0,0,4,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

The data allow us to provide a unique cross-country comparison using rigorously the same variables and methodology for each country. We tackle the issues of endogenous sector allocation (public, formal private and informal sectors) and endogeneity of the education variable in the earnings functions. We find that the returns to schooling are most often enhanced once an endogenous education variable is accounted for. This effect holds particularly true in the informal sector. In most West African cities of our sample, the public sector gives more value to education, followed by the formal private sector and then the informal sector. We also shed light on convex returns to education in all the cities and sectors, including in informal activity. More generally, a major contribution of this paper is to provide evidence of significant effects of education on individual earnings in the informal sectors of the West African cities, even at high levels of schooling.

Using inverse virtual valuation functions as a novel tool, we characterize the set of distribution profiles satisfying Zheng's assumptions. Our characterization result shows that the assumptions, while being strong, are satisfied by many non-uniform distribution profiles. Hence, Zheng's result applies more generally than one may have thought before.

This evaluation aims to improve the understanding of how the sensitivity of private sector inflation expectations to macroeconomic surprises in South Africa compares internationally, as this provides an indication of the contribution of monetary policy in South Africa to anchoring inflation expectations. If a central bank is credible, the financial markets should react less sensitively to macroeconomics surprises, because they trust the central bank to manage these incidents and achieve the objectives they communicated over the medium to long term. In this paper, the methodology of Gurkaynack et al. is adopted in order to measure the sensitivity of South African inflation expectations to surprises. A comparison of South Africa's results with those of countries in the original studies supports the contention that the SARB (South African Reserve Bank) has encouraged inflation expectations to be relatively insensitive to macroeconomic surprises, and offers support for the inflation-targeting framework as a means to help anchor inflation expectations.","Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Reid, M (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",mreid@sun.ac.za,"Reid, Monique/AAF-8136-2021","Reid, Monique/0000-0001-8762-8631",,,,,29,9,9,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The unfavorable starting position of the transformation process toward a parliamentary, democracy and a market economy, as well as the fragmented political structure, complicate the building of a macroeconomic model and limit the availability of reliable data. Data before 1999 are strongly influenced by the effects of the war and transformation. Moreover some aggregates, such as the capital stock and quarterly national accounts series, are not officially published and had to be constructed. Nevertheless, the macroeconometric model can replicate the endogenous variables reasonably well.","IHS, Inst Adv Studies, Vienna, Austria",,"Weyerstrass, K (通讯作者)，IHS, Inst Adv Studies, Vienna, Austria.",,,"Weyerstrass, Klaus/0000-0002-5659-8991",,,,,3,2,2,0,2,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Literature review shows that, while the effects of new work practices on employees' welfare are still not clear, the positive impact on firms' economic, financial and productive performances seems quite evident. So, one can assume that the limited expansion of new work practices isn't caused by employers' scepticism on their effectiveness. The thesis of the paper is that firms structural and market variables play a determinant role in distinguishing innovative from conservative firms. Confirming a large part of the hypothesis existing in literature, multivariate discriminant analysis shows that innovative firms characterize themselves for more intense relationship with other firms, for higher degree of technological innovation and for higher degree of market competitiveness. From the industrial relations side results are less clear: on one side innovations in organization of work are more diffused in firms that have a formal workplace union representation; on the other side, where the level of unionization is high the adoption of innovative work practices is less widespread.","Assolombarda, Assoc Ind Lombarda, Ctr Studi, I-20122 Milan, Italy",,"Della Torre, E (通讯作者)，Assolombarda, Assoc Ind Lombarda, Ctr Studi, Via Pantano 9, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",edoardo-del-latorre@assolombarda.it,,,,,,,87,1,1,0,26,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

By collecting data from farm households in different agro-ecological zones of the county, net crop revenue per hectare was regressed on climate, household and soil variables. The results show that these variables have a significant impact on the net crop revenue per hectare of farmers under Ethiopian conditions. The seasonal marginal impact analysis indicates that marginally increasing temperature during summer and winter would significantly reduce crop net revenue per hectare whereas marginally increasing precipitation during spring would significantly increase net crop revenue per hectare. Moreover, the net crop revenue impact of predicted climate scenarios from three models (CGM2, HaDCM3 and PCM) for the years 2050 and 2100 indicated that there would be a reduction in crop net revenue per hectare by the years 2050 and 2100. Moreover, the reduction in net revenue per hectare by the year 2100 would be more than the reduction by the year 2050 indicating the damage that climate change would pose increases with time unless this negative impact is abated through adaptation. Additionally, results indicate that the net revenue impact of climate change is not uniformly distributed across the different agro-ecological zones of Ethiopia.","[Deressa, Temesgen Tadesse; Hassan, Rashid M.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, CEEPA, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Deressa, TT (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, CEEPA, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Room 2-4, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",ttderessa@yahoo.com,"Hassan, Rashid/CAG-5246-2022",,,,,,38,136,152,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The experiment tested various sequences in which the seller could offer the vehicles, such as high values first or low values first. Surprisingly, and contrary to intuition drawn from the theory of single item and single seller auctions, the worst performing sequence from those tested is for the seller to order vehicles from highest to lowest values.

Further, the uncertainty of exchange rate and output is associated positively with the uncertainty of all shocks while the contemporaneous occurrence of selected shocks imposes either a positive or negative impact on exchange rate and output volatility.

Myopic loss aversion and the equity premium puzzle.

We utilize a special feature at the Tel Aviv stock exchange (TASE): occasional shifts of securities from daily to weekly trading. If investors' decisions are influenced by trading frequency manipulation, then returns should be predictably affected. MLA results in a negative relation between risk aversion and the length of the evaluation period. Thus, the longer the evaluation period is, the lower the expected return is. This intuition also suggests reduced sensitivity to economic events in longer evaluation periods. We find strong support for MLA in the marketplace when testing expected return, as well as return sensitivity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Formally, we embed a strategic-form game into a multi-stage game, in which players can restrict their action spaces in all but the final stage, and select among the remaining actions in the last stage. We say that an action profile is implementable by commitment if this action profile is played in the last stage of a subgame-perfect equilibrium path. We provide a complete characterization of all implementable action profiles and a simple method to find them. It turns out that the set of implementable profiles does not depend on the length of the commitment process. We show, furthermore, that commitments can have social value in the sense that in some games there are implementable action profiles that dominate all Nash equilibria of the original game.

Foreign reserves have grown very rapidly since then, as if those countries were practicing a New Mercantilism that views foreign reserves as a war chest for defense against Sudden Stops. This paper conducts a quantitative assessment of this argument using a stochastic intertemporal equilibrium framework in which precautionary foreign asset demand is driven by output variability, financial globalization, and Sudden Stop risk. In this framework, credit constraints produce endogenous Sudden Stops. We find that financial globalization and Sudden Stop risk can explain the surge in reserves but output variability cannot.

But while real rural consumption growth averaged 7.7 percent over 1985-2005 in the eastern coastal region, it averaged 6.5 percent uniformly in the interior. In evaluating well-being, such rapid improvement in all regions arguably overshadows negative connotations of divergence. Twenty years of household survey data reveal dramatic increases in rural household savings, as rural consumption improved more slowly than income in some periods. This raises questions about the suitability of consumption as a basis for measuring well-being and its distribution. Increased savings appear to be transient, as some households save while others dissave to purchase durables and afford lumpy services like education and healthcare-supplies of which became more plentiful in the 1990s. The paper argues that more meaningful measures of regional disparities come from differences in regional poverty headcounts. It also suggests that higher regional inequality and accompanying interregional migration indicate that inequality plays an important positive role in inducing economic actors voluntarily to move to more productive locations and activities as a mechanism for ensuring sustainable improvements in individual well-being.",,,"Keidel, A (通讯作者)，5007 Rodman Rd, Bethesda, MD 20816 USA.",AKeidel@Keidel.us,,,,,,,18,12,13,1,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Recent literature also shows that a theoretical foundation for such a lower environmental discount rate requires rising willingness-to-pay for environmental quality (WTP). A widely believed better alternative is however to adjust instead future environmental benefits for rising WTP and to discount those benefits at the consumption discount rate. According to this latter approach, rising WTP is usually assumed not to change the consumption discount rate itself. Assuming environmental resource scarcity, the present paper shows that an unchanged consumption discount rate is however, by and large, only an appropriate assumption in the knife-edge case in which environmental quality and goods consumption are neither substitutes nor complements in the Edgeworth-Pareto sense (substitutes, respectively, complements in the Edgeworth-Pareto sense implies the marginal utility of goods consumption to be decreasing, respectively, increasing in environmental quality).","Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Kögel, T (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",tomas.kogel@wur.nl,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,1,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 11,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200927,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2009-27,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20MJ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208143800001,0

In this model, the elasticity of marginal utility simultaneously reflects preferences for intertemporal substitution, aversion to risk, and aversion to (spatial) inequality. While these three concepts are necessarily identical in the standard model, this need not be so: well-known models already enable risk to be separated from intertemporal substitution. Separating the three concepts might have important implications for the appropriate discount rate, and hence also for long-term policy. This paper investigates these issues in the context of climate-change economics, by surveying the attitudes of over 3000 people to risk, income inequality over space and income inequality over time. The results suggest that individuals do not see the three concepts as identical, and indeed that preferences over risk, inequality and time are only weakly correlated. As such, relying on empirical evidence of risk or inequality preferences may not necessarily be an appropriate guide to specifying the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.","[Atkinson, Giles; Dietz, Simon; Helgeson, Jennifer; Hepburn, Cameron] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Atkinson, Giles; Dietz, Simon; Helgeson, Jennifer] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] New Coll, Oxford, England; [Saelen, Hakon] CICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res, Oslo, Norway",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Hepburn, C (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",cameron.hepburn@economics.ox.ac.uk,"Atkinson, Giles/H-3009-2013",,,,,,53,11,11,1,12,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,JUN 10,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200926,,,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20MI,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208143700001,0

We argue that the resulting harshest haircut for private creditors in history can be at least partially related to a stag-hunt game played by creditors. We show that incentive schemes provided by the Argentinean government were factors facilitating this haircut. The analysis suggests that, contrary to the recognition in the literature, the effects of Collective Action Clauses and Exit Consents within a restructuring process are not equal. In the case of Argentina, the inclusion of Collective Action Clauses in the defaulted bonds could have benefited the holdout creditors. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that Gneezy's data are consistent with the simple hypothesis that people are one of two kinds: either a person will never lie, or a person will lie whenever she prefers the outcome obtained by lying over the outcome obtained by telling the truth. This implies that so long as lying induces a preferred outcome over truth-telling, a person's decision of whether to lie may be completely insensitive to other changes in the induced outcomes, such as exactly how much she monetarily gains relative to how much she hurts an anonymous partner.

These strategies include: (i) the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA: a being-left-alone strategy); (ii) an ASEAN Hub RTA (a hub-and-spoke type of overlapping RTA strategy); (iii) the AFTA versus a China-Japan-Korea RTA (a duplicating or competing RTA strategy); and (iv) an ASEAN+3 RTA (an expansionary RTA strategy). We find that an expansionary ASEAN+3 RTA could be a sustainable policy option because the members' gains would be significantly positive, with more equitably distributed gains between members than when using other strategies. The effect on world welfare would also be positive and the negative effect on nonmembers would not be very strong. More interestingly, if the East Asian countries cooperate with Pacific Basin countries to form an APEC-level RTA, such as a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific, the extension of the regional trade bloc might be considered a more desirable policy option than the proposed East Asian RTAs for East Asian economies, even though countries excluded from the free trade area of the Asia Pacific are worse off.","Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Park, I (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",iwpark@korea.ac.kr,"Park, Innwon/I-6310-2019","Park, Innwon/0000-0001-8567-7907",,,,,34,13,13,0,29,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1351-3958,,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Over the 1982-2000 period, median well-being increases faster when these adjustments are made than when standard money income is used. This adjustment also widens the income gap between African-Americans and whites but increases the relative well-being of the elderly. Adding imputed rent and annuities from household wealth to household income considerably increases measured inequality and the share of income from wealth in inequality. However, both measures show about the same rise in inequality over the period. We also find an increasing share of wage and salary income in our expanded definition of income among the richest 1% over the period but do not find that the working rich have largely replaced rentiers at the top of the economic ladder.","[Wolff, Edward N.] New York Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Zacharias, Ajit] Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12504 USA",New York University,"Wolff, EN (通讯作者)，New York Univ, Dept Econ, 19 W 4th St,6th Floor, New York, NY 10003 USA.",Edward.wolff@nyu.edu; zacharia@levy.org,,,,,,,32,61,69,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

In order to falsify/verify this theory, it has typically been assumed that the square root of the conditional variance of spot prices, a proxy for spot price risk, enters the conditional mean function of spot prices. Based on this simple representation, a typical but counter intuitive outcome has been that spot price risk has an insignificant impact on spot prices, see, e.g., Beck (Beck, S.. 1993. A Rational Expectations Model of Time Varying Risk Premia in Commodities Futures Markets: Theory and Evidence. International Economic Review 34, 149-168, Beck, S., 2001.

In this paper, we propose an alternative functional relationship (from GARCH(1,I) to GARCH(1,1)-AR(m)) between spot price risk and spot prices that is fully supported by the classical rational expectations model, and based on this new representation we are able to provide stronger empirical support for Muth's rational expectation theory.

This observation underlies an extension of Savage's expected utility theory to the state-dependent case that was proposed in this journal by Edi Kami. His result contains a condition requiring the existence of a set of acts which can play the role of constant acts and support a representation involving a state-independent utility function. This paper contains necessary and sufficient conditions on the preference relation for such a set of acts to exist. Results are obtained both for the Savage and the Anscombe and Aumann frameworks. Among the corollaries are representation theorems for state-dependent utilities. Relationships to Karni's work and extensions of the results are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This pattern undermines the credibility of conditionality, weakening incentives to implement policy reforms. The standard critique attributes this time inconsistency to bureaucratic factors within the aid agency such as pressure to lend, defensive lending, or short-sighted altruism. Pressure from powerful donors provides another potential explanation for lax enforcement. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the political economy of conditionality in international organizations using the case of the World Bank and the United States. The analysis examines panel data on World Bank disbursements to 97 countries receiving structural adjustment loans between 1984 and 2005. Using UN voting as an indicator of alignment with the U.S., the paper presents evidence that World Bank structural adjustment loan disbursements are less dependent on macroeconomic performance in countries aligned with the United States.

These results therefore provide a natural link between the two policy evaluation approaches.

Yet, strong evidence of clustering is found in previous empirical research. Researchers typically measure clustering by comparing observed location patterns to random assignment. The random assignment benchmark does note however, account for zoning and geography and therefore might overstate the extent of strategic agglomeration. As evidence, we find that public elementary schools cluster more than random, not because of agglomeration economies, but due to demand density and limited location options. We argue that a better measurement of strategic agglomeration is to compare across product markets with similar zoning and other location restrictions but different benefits from agglomeration. We use L-function analysis of five product markets in five cities. We find that retailers with greater ability to differentiate their products are more likely to strategically cluster.

Results show that educational mismatch is a not negligible fact and the observed patterns reflect those already reported for other Countries of continental Europe. Nonetheless, the Italian case is characterised by the prevalence of undereducation over overeducation and by consistently high levels of matching. The exam of the returns to educational mis-match confirms the relative penalisation of overeducation and the absolute penalisation Of undereducation. Moreover, the inclusion of additional explanatory variables proves that the focus on the sole human capital masks the impact of other important factors such as gender, professional Occupation, or industry. The patterns Observed for the full sample significantly change with the age of the employees. The lot Competition Model shapes the wage equation Of younger workers, while the Assignment model proves to be superior for other ape groups. Younger workers on temporary contracts suffer from consistent wage penalisations, but gender gaps and occupational gaps tend to blur. Substitution effects between firm-specific experience and formal education only take place among older workers.","[Cainarca, Gian Carlo] Univ Genoa, Fac Ingn, I-16145 Genoa, Italy; [Sgobbi, Francesca] Univ Brescia, Fac Ingn, I-25123 Brescia, Italy",University of Genoa; University of Brescia,"Cainarca, GC (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Fac Ingn, Via Allopera Pia 13, I-16145 Genoa, Italy.",giancarlo.cainarca@unige.it; francesca.sgobbi@unibs.it,,,,,,,55,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Results suggest that material offshoring worsens wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers; it also seems to make employment more volatile, by raising the elasticity of labour demand and the risk of job losses. Service offshoring exerts at most small negative effects on total employment, and changes the composition of the workforce in favour of high-skilled white-collar employees. Multinationals tend to substitute domestic and foreign labour in response to changes in relative wages across countries; substitutability is weak, however, and mainly driven by horizontal, market-seeking foreign direct investments.","CSIC, Inst Anal Econ, Madrid, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Crinò, R (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Anal Econ, Madrid, Spain.",,"Vyacheslav, Gromyko/I-5054-2012","Crino, Rosario/0000-0002-8562-1679",,,,,211,106,115,5,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

J,"Terviö, M",,,,"Tervioe, Marko",,,Superstars and Mediocrities: Market Failure in the Discovery of Talent,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INVESTMENT; UNEMPLOYMENT; ECONOMICS; WAGE,"A basic problem facing most labour markets is that workers can neither commit to long-term wage contracts nor can they self-finance the costs of production. I study the effects of these imperfections when talent is industry-specific; it can only be revealed on the job, and once learnt becomes public information. I show that firms bid excessively for the pool of incumbent workers at the expense of trying out new talent. The workforce is then plagued with an unfavourable selection of individuals: there are too many mediocre workers, whose talent is not high enough to justify them crowding out novice workers with lower expected talent but with more upside potential. The result is an inefficiently low level of output coupled with higher wages for known high talents. This problem is most severe where information about talent is initially very imprecise and the complementary costs of production are high. I argue that high incomes in professions such as entertainment, management, and entrepreneurship, may be explained by the nature of the talent revelation process, rather than by an underlying scarcity of talent.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Terviö, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,26,63,77,2,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Are these regulations desirable? This paper studies contribution caps in a menu auction lobbying model with limited budgets and costly entry. In the absence of entry, contribution caps improve welfare by leveling the political playing field. With entry, however, a competition effect and a bargaining effect may arise, resulting in inefficient entry and exit decisions. In particular, a cap may lead to worse policies than the status quo: and even if better policies are chosen, the resulting gain in welfare may be more than offset by the entry costs. Regulation can also lead to the simultaneous entry of competing groups, creating costly rent-seeking on issues previously unaffected by lobbying. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It goes beyond stylized and aggregate general equilibrium models by examining country-specific growth options to reach middle income country (MIC) status. We first examine a set of countries that have successfully transformed their economies to inform model and scenario building. We then simulate potentials and trade-offs of selected sector- and factor-specific growth paths for Ghana. Results show that no individual sector's growth acceleration is sufficient for Ghana to reach MIC status by 2015. Manufacturing growth is constrained by its high dependency on agricultural inputs indicating the need for diversification. Services can support rather than drive economy-wide growth. Agriculture must remain the mainstay of economy-wide growth. While this will delay structural change in sectoral composition, it demonstrates that emphasizing agriculture is a viable option for some countries to reach MIC status. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Trade-offs and Complementarities between Fiscal Discipline and Structural Reforms,CESIFO ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Economic effects of deficits; Stability and Growth Pact; structural reforms,POLICY,"While according to the so-called 'Brussels-Frankfurt consensus', sound fiscal policies and structural reforms support each other, it is often claimed that the EU fiscal framework, by reducing the budgetary room for manoeuvre and the political capital of governments, may deter reforms. The aim of this article is to explore which factors determine the relationship between fiscal discipline and reforms. By means of a simple model we show that, depending on the time horizon of the government, structural reforms may either be complementary to, or a substitute for, fiscal discipline. If governments are forward-looking, substitution is more likely; if governments are short-sighted, reforms and fiscal discipline may become complementary. We provide empirical evidence supporting this argument. In a sample of EU-15 countries over the past three decades, the introduction of the Maastricht constraints at the beginning of the 1990s does not seem to have affected the probability of labour market reforms on average, but had a positive and significant impact on countries with governments facing elections in the current or forthcoming year (which are hence assumed to behave myopically). Our results suggest that if governments are short-sighted, then the expectation that relaxing fiscal constraints may help to boost structural reforms may not be well-founded.

This study analyzes 96 reorganization filings in Taiwan during the period 1995-2006. It is substantiated that the market's reaction to these filings is not indiscriminate and that the forbearance lending to a reorganization filing borrower suggests the lead bank's little concern for its shareholder wealth. Additionally. the second lending banks experience stock price reactions in the opposite manner to those of the lead lending banks, indicating dominant positive effects. The multinomial logistic regression results show that smaller banks are likely to have lower equity volatility than larger ones.

We consider cost reducing R&D and allow manufacturing firms to decide whether to outsource the project to research subcontractors or carry out the research in-house. We use a principal-agent framework and consider fixed and revenue-sharing contracts. We solve for the optimal contract under these constraints. We find that allowing for revenue-sharing contracts increases the chance of outsourcing and improves economic efficiency. However, the principal may still find it optimal to choose a contract that allows the leakage to occur-a second-best outcome when leakage cannot be monitored or verified. Stronger protection of trade secrets can induce more R&D outsourcing without inhibiting technology diffusion and increase economic efficiency, as long as it does not significantly lengthen the product cycle.","[Lai, Edwin L-C.] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Dallas, TX 75265 USA; [Riezman, Raymond] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Wang, Ping] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO USA; [Wang, Ping] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; University of Iowa; Washington University (WUSTL); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Riezman, R (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",edwin.l.lai@gmail.com; raymond-riezman@uiowa.edu,"Lai, Edwin L.-C./ABB-8714-2020","Lai, Edwin/0000-0002-1188-4855",,,,,31,60,78,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

According to a simple economic model of rational behaviour, it is expected that the propensity to commit criminal activities should be negatively related to the risk of deterrence. Potential presence of higher risk profiles for certain population segments (urban groups, males, foreigners, the unemployed, and low-income earners) are controlled for. Panel data aggregated to regional levels and observed annually for the years 2000 to 2005 are applied. Controls are applied for endogeneity among criminal activity level and risk of deterrence, intra-regional correlation, inter-temporal heterogeneity and spatial spillover. The expected negative effect of risk of deterrence on criminal activity is found for all countries, whereby the hypothesised economic rationality is confirmed.","Univ So Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth Hlth Econ, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Lauridsen, J (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth Hlth Econ, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",jtl@sam.sdu.dk,,"Lauridsen, Jorgen T./0000-0001-9889-6236",,,,,28,1,1,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

We first show that when contracting is private, i.e. when downstream principals do not observe the mechanisms offered upstream and the decisions taken in these mechanisms, all PBE outcomes can be characterized through pure-strategy profiles in which the principals offer menus of contracts and delegate to the agent the choice of the contractual terms. We then show that, in most cases of interest for applications, the characterization of the equilibrium outcomes is further facilitated fly the fact that the principals can be restricted to offer incentive-compatible extended direct mechanisms in which the agent reports the endogenous payoff-relevant decisions contracted upstream in addition to his exogenous private information. Finally we show how the aforementioned results must be adjusted to accommodate alternative assumptions about the observability of upstream histories and/or the timing of contracting examined in the literature.

As the EU's economy approaches the world technology frontier, structural reforms that increase competition in intermediate goods sectors are necessary to boost innovation and productivity growth-the main objective of the Lisbon Agenda. Such reforms, however, raise the opposition of incumbents and, therefore, are politically difficult to implement. When there are important policy spillover effects, national governments are more easily captured by vested interests, as they fail to internalize the benefits of reforms on the rest of the Union. This suggests that the weak political governance of the Lisbon Agenda, which is centred on the peer pressure of national governments, and the ensuing inability to complete the single market in non-manufacturing sectors, explains the Lisbon failure.

These terms take on multiple definitions in the literature and are often used interchangeably even though they differ. The border effect refers to a higher proclivity to trade behind rather than across national borders and is usually defined by the coefficients of regional dummies from an estimated gravity model. It can be present both in data and in counterfactual model solutions. Sometimes the reduced form of the gravity model used is asserted to reflect an Armington type model. For the border effect to occur as a model outcome, a structural model with at least 2 home regions and I country abroad is needed. In contrast to current literature, we offer a characterization of various forms of preference bias in trade models and measures of their associated trade effects based on a concept we term trade neutrality. These effects go beyond conventional border effects, and can be both across and within borders. Home bias is typically specified as an Armington preference for domestic over comparable foreign products in a trade model where goods are heterogeneous across countries. It is reflected in both model structure and parameterization, but defined in several different ways in the literature. We assess the contribution of each form of bias to the set of possible trade effects using a calibrated model with 3 Canadian regions, the U.S., and the rest of the world using 2001 data. We also evaluate how much of the conventional border effect is accounted for when model biases are modified in various ways.

We find that entry restriction improves the average earnings for some individuals compared to free entry/exit or restricted exit. For a given group size, individuals under the restricted entry rule contribute more for the provision of the collective good.

For a panel of the 26 Swiss cantons over the 1980-1998 periods, this paper explores the role of fragmented governments on fiscal policy outcomes. We distinguish between two variants of fragmented governments: cabinet size and coalition size. in addition, we analyze whether constitutional rules for executive and legislature as well as formal fiscal restraints shape the size of government and how different rules interact with fragmentation. The results indicate that the number of ministers in the cabinet is positively associated with the size of government. While fiscal referendums effectively restrict the size of government, there is also evidence that fiscal referendums relax the fiscal commons problem to some extent. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Policy advisors have recently proposed that governments running a deficit should be forced to generate additional tax revenue. We show that this deficit taxation reduces each group's spending bias today because it decreases the fear that the financial resource will not be available tomorrow due to the other groups' spending behavior. This effect adds to the literature as previous findings focused mainly on the fact that deficit taxation reduces excessive spending because it increases the likelihood of politicians being voted out of office as the private sector dislikes taxation.

We show that cross-country correlations of consumption, investment, employment and output predicted by a standard international real business cycle model are highly sensitive to the share of capital goods in total trade.

The critical liquidation threshold is derived as a function of interest expenses, the firm's driving parameters and the tax rates and taxation brackets.

Average and stochastic production frontier functions are estimated to ascertain the effect of education on productivity and efficiency. A full set of proxies for farm education stock variables are incorporated to investigate the 'internal' as well as 'external' returns to education. The external effect is investigated in the context of rural neighbourhoods. Our analysis reveals that in addition to raising rice productivity and boosting potential output, household education significantly reduces production inefficiencies. However, we are unable to find any evidence of the externality benefit of schooling - neighbour's education does not matter in farm production. We discuss the implication of these findings for rural education programmes in Bangladesh.","[Rahman, S.] Univ Plymouth, Fac Social Sci & Business, Sch Geog, Plymouth PLA 8AA, Devon, England; [Asadullah, M.

The product-level index is used to show that, with increased competition, multiproduct plants exit markets where production technologies are farthest away from their core products and they also perform better than plants that continue to produce a wider range of products.","[Aw, Bee Yan] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lee, Yi] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; National Tsing Hua University,"Aw, BY (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",byr@psu.edu; ylee@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,25,8,11,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

However, this approach ignores both the imperfect substitutability between denominations and the degree of competition within denominations. These two shortcomings make the current index a suspect measure of religious competition; it often falsely identifies which market micro-economists would generally consider the more competitive one. We develop a new religious competition index that incorporates intra-denominational competition and creates a 'substitutability parameter' to better specify the appropriate degree of inter-denominational competition. While the model developed in this article applies specifically to religious markets, our index of competition could be expanded to other economic markets where such a substitutability parameter is meaningful.","[Bailey, Christopher; Taylor, Jason E.] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",Central Michigan University,"Bailey, C (通讯作者)，Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",baile1c@cmich.edu,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

On the methodological ground, this study is the first to apply a general Box-Cox transformation within the context of hedonic models which exploit all the variables (objective and sensorial characteristics, reputation) pointed out by previous literature as relevant in driving market prices. On the factual ground, the article fills the lack of empirical evidence on the issue for Italy, one of the leading wine producers, by using a large data set on two premium quality wines (Barolo and Barbaresco) covering the 1995-1998 vintages. Our results support the evidence obtained using data from other countries, showing that sensorial traits, the reputation of wines and producers, as well as objective variables are all important factors influencing the consumers' willingness to pay. More importantly, by resorting to a nonnested statistical test (Vuong, 1989) we compare two alternative specifications (taste vs. reputation) and find that the reputation model significantly outperforms the taste one, whereby suggesting that a greater amount of information on how the wine price is formed is contained in the reputation specification.","[Benfratello, Luigi; Piacenza, Massimiliano] Univ Torino, Dept Econ & Publ Finance G Prato, I-10134 Turin, Italy; [Benfratello, Luigi; Piacenza, Massimiliano] Ceris CNR, I-10024 Moncalieri, TO, Italy; [Sacchetto, Stefano] London Business Sch, London NW1 4SA, England",University of Turin; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); University of London; London Business School,"Piacenza, M (通讯作者)，Univ Torino, Dept Econ & Publ Finance G Prato, Corso Unione Soviet 218Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy.",piacenza@econ.unito.it,"PIACENZA, MASSIMILIANO/ABF-1996-2020","BENFRATELLO, Luigi/0000-0003-0402-5320; Piacenza, Massimiliano/0000-0003-2437-8254",,,,,38,80,91,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The paper's theoretical analysis predicts that the frequency advantage of RJs over jets, a consequence of their small size, should have led to the emergence of point-to-point (PP) service in thin markets where such service was previously uneconomical. However, the evidence contradicts this prediction, showing that markets attracting new PP service by RJs had demographic characteristics similar to those of markets that already had jet PIP service or attracted it after 1996. Additional descriptive evidence shows that RJs were used to provide service on a large number of new hub-and-spoke (HS) routes, and that they replaced discontinued jet and turboprop service on many such routes, as well as supplementing continuing jet service. When replacement or supplementation by RJs occurred, passengers benefited from better service quality via higher flight frequencies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Default is parsimoniously represented by equity value hitting the zero barrier so that, unlike in reduced-form models, the explicit linkage to the firm's capital structure is preserved, but, unlike in structural models, restrictive assumptions on the structure are avoided. Default risk is either jump-like or diffusive. The equity price can jump to default. In line with recent empirical evidence on the jump-to-default risk price, we highlight how reasonable choices of the pricing kernel can imply remarkable differences in the equity-price-dependent status between the objective default intensity and the risk-neutral intensity. As equity returns experience negative diffusive shocks, their CEV-type local variance increases and boosts the objective and risk-neutral probabilities of diffusive default. A parsimonious version of our general model simultaneously enables analytical credit-risk management and analytical pricing of credit-sensitive instruments. Easy cross-asset hedging ensues.

However, it is extremely difficult to quantify the various propositions put forward for measuring economic activities in the CBD due to the paucity of statistical data. Planning intervention thus becomes extremely difficult as other forces beyond the control or knowledge of the planner play crucial roles in determining what activities will locate in the CBD and where they will locate. This study, attempts to explore a view of how to measure and assess central business district economic activities for planning purposes. It follows a critical discussion of the nature of the CBD by pointing to empirical studies, including examples from the New York metropolitan region and the city of London. Moreover, it discusses indicators could be used to measure and assess economic activities in the CBD by highlighting planning purposes covering the entire issue.","Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Rural Planning, Taichung, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University,"Chang, SC (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Rural Planning, Taichung, Taiwan.",dr.kimi@msa.hinet.net,,,,,,,24,2,3,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Degree of agri-food trade specialisation dropped over the period for all most important markets. At the same time, Slovakia did not maintain positions of the most competitive commodities; however, it improved positions of a number of previously uncompetitive ones. After 2004, the dynamics of previously rigid trade specialisation with the EU-15 and the New Member States of the 2004 EU enlargement accelerated.

From this solution he constructed a utility function rationalizing the choices of a competitive consumer. We extend Afriat's theorem to a class of nonlinear, nonconvex budget sets. We thereby obtain testable implications of rational behavior for a wide class of economic environments, and a constructive method to derive individual preferences from observed choices. We also show that by increasing in a regular way the number of observed choices from our class of budget sets one can fully identify the underlying preference relation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The largest real depreciation, 13 per cent, occurred during the East Asian Financial Crisis. Since Taiwan was subjected neither to the economic turmoil of the crisis itself nor to the subsequent reforms, its experience provides a good opportunity for studying the effects of exchange rate changes on firm performance. This paper empirically examines the exchange rate effects on firm exports, domestic sales, total sales, value-added and productivity, by using data on firms listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange merged with customs trade data covering the period of 1992-2000. Our findings indicate that the real depreciation of the NT dollar led to an increase in exports, domestic sales, total sales, value-added, and productivity. In addition, we find that the productivity improvement induced by real currency depreciation may be a result of firm scale expansion. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Particularly in the light of the recent waves of EU enlargement these countries have been considered as highly attractive locations for offshored services both from a European and global perspective. While a fairly large amount of anecdotal evidence documents the NMS high potentialities in terms of service offshoring, academic research on this topic is limited. This paper aims to contribute to this discussion. Drawing on recent literature on the complex issue of service globalisation, the paper investigates NMS trade and FDI flows in services over the period 1995-2007 to find evidence of enhanced offshoring-related activities in these countries. The focus is on NMS-10, i.e. NMS-12 excluding Cyprus and Malta. Given the shortcomings of available statistical data and instruments for gauging the scale and impact of services offshoring, the paper adopts a three-tier approach based on BoP trade and FDI statistics, complemented by alternative sources of information. Notwithstanding the caveats associated with this kind of empirical exercise, the paper documents an accelerated pace of offshoring-related activities in the selected NMS, under both forms: international outsourcing and captive offshoring. Its findings show that the fast growing exports in some individual service categories in recent years, coupled with the favourable ongoing changes in the structure and performance of NMS services trade are largely driven by enhanced offshoring activities hosted by their economies. Further, the paper highlights the NMS capabilities to cope with the challenges raised by the increasingly competitive global offshoring landscape, as measured by competitiveness indicators. Finally, the findings of the paper confirm that current anecdotal information and consulting companies-based projections on NMS growing attractiveness as targets of offshoring decisions by TNC originating both inside and outside EU-15 are widely backed up by available statistical data.

Several agents have to cover their demand over a finite time horizon and shortages are allowed. Each agent has its own unit production, inventory-holding and backlogging cost. Cooperation among agents is given by sharing production processes and warehouse facilities: agents in a coalition produce with the cheapest production cost and store with the cheapest inventory cost. We prove that the resulting cooperative game is totally balanced and the Owen set reduces to a singleton: the Owen point. Based on this type of allocation we find a population monotonic allocation scheme for this class of games. Finally, we point out the relationship of the Owen point with other well-known allocation rules such as the nucleolus and the Shapley value. (C) 2007Elsevier Inc.

The coefficient of the euro interest rate for the demand for M1 is insignificant. Hence, depreciation of the forint or a higher euro interest rate would help raise Hungary's real output. The Box-Cox transformation shows that the log-linear form for M1 or M2 demand cannot be rejected at the 5% level while the linear form for M1 or M2 demand can be rejected at the 5% level. However, the log-linear form for M2 demand can be rejected at the 10% level. The CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests show that M2 demand based on the Box-Cox model and M1 demand are relatively stable.

In view of the influence that fees have on performance, the objective of this study is to analyse the variables that determine the management and custodial fees of individual pension plans. The Spanish market for pension plans and funds sets legal caps on these fees, and at the same time the majority of them are commercialized and managed by financial institutions, which can in turn generate a conflict of interests. In this article, we estimate models with censured variables and our findings show how the average investment per plan, the legal status and the size of the management company to which the plan belongs, and the style of the plan are all relevant determinants of the management fee. In turn, the custodial fee is determined by the legal status of the custodial company, the size, the return and the type of plan.","[Marti, Carmen; Matallin, Juan C.; Angeles Fernandez, Ma] Univ Jaume 1, Fac Ciencias Juridicas & Econ, Dept Finanzas & Contabilidad, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Martí, C (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Fac Ciencias Juridicas & Econ, Dept Finanzas & Contabilidad, Avda Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",cmarti@cofin.uji.es,"Martí-Ballester, Carmen-Pilar/C-6306-2018","Martí-Ballester, Carmen-Pilar/0000-0003-4085-7677",,,,,55,6,6,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Local Agenda 21 is a programme that involves the commitment of local government to this goal. In this paper, the characteristics of the social organization used by European municipalities to develop Local Agenda 21 are analysed to determine the effect that the organisational and political structures of town councils have on the social organisation practices carried out, controlling for certain municipal characteristics. To do so, diverse dependence models based on multiple linear regression estimations were carried out on a sample of 97 European towns subscribing the Aalborg Charter. The results point to the importance of organisational structure, but only a limited effect of the political structure is observed. Thus, a leftist ideology involves a fostering of social participation, whereas the leadership of the Mayor and his or her stay in power is only noted in certain specific aspects and in a different way. The existence of opposing effect in municipal characteristics is also observed.","[Prado Lorenzo, Jose M.; Garcia Sanchez, Isabel M.] Univ Salamanca, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain",University of Salamanca,"Lorenzo, JMP (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.",jmprado@usal.es; lajefa@usal.es,"Lorenzo, Jose Manuel/K-6375-2014; García-Sánchez, Isabel-María/F-4271-2016","Lorenzo, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-7725-9294; García-Sánchez, Isabel-María/0000-0003-4711-8631",,,,,34,0,0,0,5,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

And these differences may cause conflicts created within this relationship. The research question here is about the subject of CSR as an enhancing factor in the deepening of special interests of the owners and the managers, as well as in emphasising their different roles. The in-depth interviews contained 60 questions and were recorded With nearly all questions, two aspects were addressed: on the one hand, the difference between the periods 1995-1999 and 2000-2004, and on the other, between enterprises based on foreign and domestic capital. By the beginning of the former period - that is 1995 - the privatisation period in Estonia was predominantly over and the first legislative framework concerning the operation of corporations in the Western sense started to develop. The second turning point is represented by the year 2000, when the purge following the Asian and Russian crises presented new demands on economic activities and economic thinking as a whole. A total of 25 individuals were interviewed: 7 owners, 12 top managers and 6 of those who had been both as owners and top managers. This article concentrates on the results that concern the possible sources of conflict between the managers and the owners and their perception of social responsibility and the links between those questions. When summing up the opinions of the interviewees it should be admitted that the responses reflected the insignificance of the conflicts issue rather than their serious topicality. As the respondents remarked on several occasions, the existence of owner-manager conflicts is not considered normal or built-in; as the respondents added, this should not be considered such. Thus the claim of built-in conflicts in the owner-manager relations, derived from the agency theory (at least the classical agency theory) should be questioned according to the responses of the Estonian owners and managers. At the same time this does not mean that the responses coincide with the standpoints of stewardship theory, because the results of the interviews do not enable to make general conclusion that Estonian managers tend to act in the best interest of their principals. The results of the interviews lead us to conclude that the difference between the way top managers and owners understand ideas and activities is quite clearly presented in the context of social responsibility; despite the fact that the respondents usually do not admit the existence of conflicts when discussing them in general. When comparing the opinions of the owners and top managers about social responsibility, considering the theoretical literature, we may claim to certain extent that owners and managers have a different perception of social responsibility and this leads to the conflicts between them. To conclude, the authors present the understanding that the context of CSR brings out the conflicts between managers and owners more clearly, or even intensifies the conflicts between them.

(2) How does the level of harmonization of technologies between the multinational and the acquired firm change the optimal mode of entry? (3) What is the role of market concentration on the entry decision given positive levels of technology transfers to the acquired firm? We show that in the case of cross-border acquisitions higher tariffs may act as an entry barrier by raising the reservation price of the acquisition target. Our analysis also underlines the importance of the usefulness of transferred technology. Acquisitions become more likely as the degree of harmonization between the multinational's and acquired firm's assets increases.

After focusing on how the farm structure has changed over time, an instrumental variable generalized cross entropy estimator is used to develop and estimate a Markov model in order to explore how farm structure will probably develop in the coming decade. The estimator exploits both sample data and prior information, including general and plausible information on farm mobility and structural adjustments based on independent literature. Next, several statistical indicators are computed for farm mobility and for which farms are likely to survive. Finally, milk projections are made and related to policy scenarios. The projections show that the number of dairy farms will continue to decline, but the number of medium and large farms will increase. In the coming decade, subsistence dairy farms are expected to leave the sector slowly. Milk projections show that under the status quo, milk quotas will be binding and overrun, whereas under the 'soft landing' scenario they appear to be only binding after 2010.","[Tonini, Axel] European Commiss Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Seville, Spain; [Jongeneel, Roel] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Wageningen & Agr Econ Res Inst, The Hague, Netherlands",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); Wageningen University & Research,"Tonini, A (通讯作者)，European Commiss Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Seville, Spain.",axel.tonini@ec.europa.eu,,"Jongeneel, Roel/0000-0003-1349-5164",,,,,40,14,15,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Much of the English communication that takes place within business circles the world over occurs between non-native speakers. In cases such as these the object of the exercise is efficient and effective communication. The strict rules of grammar are in such cases sometimes ignored, when, for example, a stressed negotiator's only goal is to reach an agreement as quickly as possible. Business English means different things to different people. For some, it focuses on vocabulary and topics used in the worlds of business, trade, finance, and international relations. For others it refers to the communication skills used in the workplace, and focuses on the language and skills needed for typical business communication such as presentations, negotiations, meetings, small talk, socializing, correspondence, report writing, and so on. In both of these cases it can be taught to native speakers of English, for example, high school students preparing to enter the job market. It can also be a form of international English.

Using identical demand and supply specifications, both models are calibrated to the German electricity market by varying the contract cover of firms. Our results show that each model explains almost the same fractions of the observed price variations. We therefore suggest using Cournot models for short-term analysis, since these models can accommodate additional market details, such as network constraints, and the SFE model for long-term analysis (e.g., the study of a merger) since it is less sensitive to the calibration parameters selected.

However, it is not uncommon for these studies to match site or plant location to contemporaneous socioeconomic characteristics instead of to characteristics at the time of siting. While this may provide important information on disproportionate impacts currently faced by these communities, it does not describe the relationship at the time of siting. Also, variables that are important to a plant's location decision - i.e., production and transportation costs - are often not included. Without controlling for such variables, it is difficult to evaluate the relative importance of socioeconomic characteristics in a firm's initial location decision. This paper examines the role of community socioeconomic characteristics at the time of siting in the location decisions of manufacturing plants while controlling for other location-relevant factors such as input costs. When plant location is matched to current socioeconomic characteristics, results are consistent with what the environmental justice literature predicts: race is significant and positively related to plant location, while income is significant and negatively related to plant location. When plant location is matched to socioeconomic characteristics at the time of siting, empirical results suggest that race is no longer significant, though income is still significant and negatively related to plant location. Poverty rates are sometimes significant but act as a deterrent to plant location. Variables traditionally considered in the firm location literature - such as land and labor costs, the quality of labor, and distance to rail - are significant. The presence of pre-existing TRI plants in a neighborhood and average plant size are also significant.",,,,wolverton.ann@epa.gov,,,,,,,34,41,63,1,16,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The private firm maximises profits while the public firm maximises the weighted sum of the consumer and producer surpluses (weighted welfare). It is shown that the result obtained in equilibrium depends crucially on the weight given to the consumer surplus in weighted welfare and on the degree to which goods are substitutes or complements.

This paper quantifies the contribution of immigration to the relative decline in elementary and secondary public education spending per student in California in the period 1970-2000. A quantitative model of school choice and voting over public education is used to perform the counterfactual experiments of interest. The model predicts that education spending per student in California would have been 24% higher in the year 2000 if U.S. immigration had been restricted to its 1970 level. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It considers an overlapping generations model in which every generation consists of high earners and low earners with the proportion of types being determined endogenously. The number of children is deterministically chosen but the children's future ability is in part stochastic, in part determined by the family background, and in part through education. In addition to the customary externality source associated with a change in average fertility rate, this setup highlights another externality source. This is due to the effect of a parent's choice of number and educational attainment of his children on the proportion of high-ability individuals in the steady state. Our other results include: (i) Investments in education of high- and low-ability parents must be subsidized; (ii) direct child subsidies to one or both parent types can be negative; i.e., they can be taxes; (iii) net subsidies to children (direct child subsidies plus education subsidies) to at least one type of parents must be positive; (iv) parents who have a higher number of children should invest less in their education.

We account for the potential endogeneity of our audit measure and the censoring of our compliance measure using a censored trivariate probit, which we estimate using simulated maximum likelihood. We find that larger facilities and those subject to more stringent regulations are more likely to audit; facilities with poor compliance records are less likely to audit.

The measurewhich captures between-group inequality when groups are defined exclusively on the basis of predetermined circumstancesis shown to yield a lower-bound estimate of true inequality of opportunity. Absolute and relative versions of the index are defined, and alternative parametric and non-parametric methods are employed to generate robust estimates. In the application to Latin America, we find inequality of opportunity shares ranging from one quarter to one half of total consumption inequality. An opportunity-deprivation profile that identifies the worst-off types in each society is also formally defined, and described for the same six countries. In three of them, 100 percent of the opportunity-deprived were found to be indigenous or Afro-descendants.","[Ferreira, Francisco H.

Two hours and 40 minutes later she sank, resulting in the loss of 1,501 lives-more than two-thirds of her 2,207 passengers and crew. This remains one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history and by far the most famous. For social scientists, evidence about how people behaved as the Titanic sunk offers a quasi-natural field experiment to explore behavior under extreme conditions of life and death. A common assumption is that in such situations, self-interested reactions will predominate and social cohesion is expected to disappear. However, empirical evidence on the extent to which people in the throes of a disaster react with self-regarding or with other-regarding behavior is scanty. The sinking of the Titanic posed a life-or-death situation for its passengers. The Titanic carried only 20 lifeboats, which could accommodate about half the people aboard, and deck officers exacerbated the shortage by launching lifeboats that were partially empty. Failure to secure a seat in a lifeboat virtually guaranteed death. We have collected individual-level data on the passengers and crew on the Titanic, which allow us to analyze some specific questions: Did physical strength (being male and in prime age) or social status (being a first- or second-class passenger) raise the survival chance? Was it favorable for survival to travel alone or in company? Does one's role or function (being a crew member or a passenger) affect the probability of survival? Do social norms, such as Women and children first! have any effect? Does nationality affect the chance of survival? We also explore whether the time from impact to sinking might matter by comparing the sinking of the Titanic over nearly three hours to the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915, which took only 18 minutes from when the torpedo hit the ship.","[Frey, Bruno S.] Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Frey, Bruno S.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Savage, David A.; Torgler, Benno] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Frey, Bruno S.; Torgler, Benno] CREMA, Basel, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Warwick; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Frey, BS (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Savage, David A./AAP-6101-2020; Torgler, Benno/W-4556-2019; Frey, Bruno/AAW-9103-2021","Torgler, Benno/0000-0002-9809-963X; Savage, David/0000-0002-2110-4023",,,,,47,34,36,3,37,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

An interesting finding is that more attractive outside options for firms may constitute a win-win situation; the firm as well as its present host countries may gain when this occurs. The reason that it benefits the host countries is that an enhanced outside option reduces the inefficiencies of tax competition. An implication of the result is that better outside options for multinational firms may reduce the gains from host countries' policy coordination and thus reduce those countries' incentives to coordinate their policies. Also, with a development where outside options become more accessible, the perceived costs of tax competition, e.g., in terms of underprovision of public goods, may be overestimated. Our findings may also have implications for international negotiations, since it provides an argument for mutual reduction of entry barriers, as this may improve outside options.

Two approaches are used to examine the efficiency of the banking industry in central and east European countries: stochastic frontier analysis and data envelopment analysis. The empirical results show that the average efficiency of banks in central and east European countries grew in the period analyzed. The improvement may be due to increased competition upon EU accession and the entry of foreign banks, as well as to extensive legislative changes that led banks to become more efficient. Based on the results, we see that the highest level of technical efficiency is recorded for the banking systems of Romania and the Czech Republic, and the lowest is recorded for Slovenia. Looking at the average efficiency scores for each country, we observe significant variation across the banking systems of the central and east European countries. Technical efficiency value estimates with the stochastic frontier analysis method range from 0.6275 in Slovakia to 0.8644 in Romania. To assess the level of productivity growth of the banking industry, a Malmquist productivity index is calculated using linear programming. In the analyzed period, on average, the productivity of banks had increased in 2008 by approximately 24.27 percent from 2004, an increase due especially to technological modification.","Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Andries, AM (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania.",,"Andries, Alin Marius/B-5980-2011","Andries, Alin Marius/0000-0002-4415-4197",,,,,59,48,50,1,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Second, sellers can advertise prices on a price comparison website, so that consumers investigate the suitability of products in order of increasing price. Here, prices are lower when search costs are higher.

This essay considers the countries' economic readiness to adopt the Euro as well as the economic benefits and costs of adoption. Paper applies a method suggested by Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1997) and finds that the changes of real effective exchange rates between the Euro area and the new EU member states follow the pattern predicted by the optimum currency area theory. This finding allows the construction of the readiness for adoption index for every NMS. The tangible benefits (for NMSs) of adoption are also examined in this essay. Analyses suggest that the costs of currency exchange and hedging against the uncertainty in foreign exchange markets account for about 0.08-0.012% of the countries' GDP. In addition, countries that adopt the Euro might expect lower inflation and interest rates. This essay also examines the possible costs of adoption. These are in the forms of the lost ability to use monetary policy tools and set the level of seigniorage. Analysis suggests that many countries had given up their independence over monetary policy even before the accession to the EU. In addition, bigger NMSs have not used seigniorage as the source of fiscal income. However, they used exchange rate flexibility to depreciate their currencies during the recent crisis.","Univ Oxford, Oxford OX2 6QN, England",University of Oxford,"Bancevicius, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, 10 Bradmore Rd, Oxford OX2 6QN, England.",Rokas.Bancevicius@history.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,0,0,2,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2011,38.0,4,,,,,461,480,,10.1007/s10663-010-9136-1,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022WA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309993700001,0

This paper shows that whether valuation effects are stabilizing or not depends critically on the nature of the underlying productivity shocks. In response to transitory shocks, valuation effects are stabilizing; but in response to trend shocks, such effects amplify the impact of the current account on NFA position. These contrasting effects arise because optimally smoothing consumers respond differently to a transitory shock than to a trend shock to income. This theoretical result finds empirical support with G7 countries' data, and is illustrated by the pattern of external imbalances between the U.S. and other G7 countries since the 1990s.

Likewise, there is a large policy interest in the monetization of the economic effects of environmental damages, to enable the design of response and mitigation strategies. This paper focuses on the valuation of the welfare losses from forest fires in the fire prone Mediterranean region applying the life-satisfaction approach. Detrimental effects on utility relate to morbidity, losses of marketed goods and impacts on forest goods and services. For our empirical investigation, we employ self-reported life satisfaction, income and other socio-economic information from the Eurobarometer Survey Series matched with data on the number and extent of forest fires at the regional level. To account for endogeneity, we instrument forest fire characteristics with the mean daily precipitation in the region during the fire season ( April to September). Our sample covers Portugal, Spain, Italy and the Mediterranean provinces of France, and spans from 1986-1993 and 2001-2003. We find that both forest fire incidence and forest fire extent have a significant negative effect on individual welfare. We estimate the monetary loss from an additional fire incident to be (sic)0.20 and the loss from burning an additional 100ha of forest at (sic)2.03 per household respectively. Nevertheless, the negative effect of forest fires on life satisfaction is significant only for the rural population. Results therefore provide useful insights on the detrimental effects of forest fires at the regional level for different segments of the population that should be accounted for in policy formulation.","[Kountouris, Yiannis] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Remoundou, Kyriaki] Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Imperial College London; Newcastle University - UK,"Kountouris, Y (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, Kensington Campus,Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England.",i.kountouris@imperial.ac.uk; kyriaki.remoundou@newcastle.ac.uk,"Koundouri, Phoebe/AAI-2160-2021","Koundouri, Phoebe/0000-0001-5979-6128; Kountouris, Ioannis/0000-0002-1628-6221; Remoundou, Kyriaki/0000-0002-1627-7253",,,,,49,38,40,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2011,64.0,4,,,,,556,578,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00520.x,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,840RG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000296457900005,0

Central to the model is policy-augmented human capital (PAHC)-human capital with a road map for development-led by a capable leader. The model is unique in that it validates the critical role of human capital in a time of 'high development theory' when the emphasis was skewed towards the accumulation of physical capital, and the role of government at a time when interventionist policies were either failing elsewhere (in the 1950s and 1960s) or facing opposition (in the 1970s and 1980s).

In spite of the limited resources, increasing numbers of such export-oriented SMEs have successfully entered into global markets and then considerably improved their performances. Nevertheless, there are only a few empirical studies regarding determinants related to characteristics and internationalization of such firms. Based on a survey of 317 born-global SMEs, this study used characteristics of organizations, environments, and technologies as determinants affecting their international outcomes. It also devised 24 hypotheses concerning these determinants, the outcomes of internationalization, and partnership building between third-party logistics (3PL) providers having logistical competencies and export-oriented SMEs and then schematized a study model based on them. From the testing of the above hypotheses, it was found that among the organizational characteristics of export-oriented SMEs, only innovation-oriented culture and export-related information management have exerted positive (+) influences significant to the outcome of internationalization. All subordinate determinants of the environmental characteristics such as overseas environment, local environment, export support policy, and export financing support appeared to exert positive (+) influences significant to the outcomes, though only the level of IT utilization and standardization among the technological characteristics showed positive (+) influences significant to the outcomes. In addition, the study tested whether partnership building with logistics outsourcing providers having digital logistical competencies would control the relationships between determinants of internationalization and their outcomes. The results showed that only the following could modulate the relationships between determinants of internationalization and their outcomes: an interaction term among innovation-oriented culture, research and development competency, and logistics network competency; an interaction term among local environment, export policy support, export financing support, and logistics network competency; and an interaction term among technological competency, level of IT utilization, and logistics network competency The above result indicated that the building of successful partnerships with 3PL providers having digital logistical competencies are important to successfully internationalize and to improve the performance of export-oriented SMEs.",,,"Koh, YK (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Sch Int Econ & Business, Gyongsan, South Korea.",ilugit@naver.com; prumkoh@yu.ac.kr,,,,,,,44,2,2,0,53,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"RM 4503 WORLD TRADE CTR, 159-1 SAMSUNG-DONG,GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Testing the national-based view against the Europeanist perspective is a challenging issue, because voting inside the Governing Council is secret, and the final outcome depends both on the individual preferences and the procedures followed by the Governing Council to arrive at a decision. Accordingly, we model interest rate setting as a two-stage process: first, each member of the Governing Council sets his/her preferred rate, and next the Governing Council meets and decides the actual figure. Our empirical analysis shows that domestic developments play a major role in determining the preferred interest rate of the each member; and that some members exert agenda setting power, that precludes some interest rate policies to be considered at the meeting.

Services industries are less developed and less productive due to numerous protection policies interrupting competition. In recent years, the Korean government has developed a plan for service sector reform geared towards the development of the services industry. Achieving this goal requires strengthened competition through the reduction of trade barriers. The objective of this study is to measure the barriers to cross-border trade in Korean service sectors. Services trade barriers do not take the form of import tariffs, but rather of a complex variety of quantitative restrictions, prohibitions, and regulations. This study estimates tariff equivalents using a gravity model for overall services industries and for three traded service sectors of each of 47 countries. The estimate of tariff equivalents in overall Korean services is 73.3%, higher than the average tariff equivalent of 48.8% for 24 high-income Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries, but lower than values for most developing countries. Specifically, we show that Korean business and financial services are comparatively sheltered from international competition, resulting in low levels of import penetration. However, Korea's transportation services are more open than the other sectors.","[Park, Soonchan] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade & Commerce, Gonju, South Korea; [Yoo, Tae Hwan] Kyung Hee Univ, Grad Sch Pan Pacific Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Kongju National University; Kyung Hee University,"Park, S (通讯作者)，Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade & Commerce, Gonju, South Korea.",pine@khu.ac.kr; spark@kongju.ac.kr,"Yoo, Tae Hwan/AAM-1472-2020",,,,,,37,2,2,0,24,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"RM 4503 WORLD TRADE CTR, 159-1 SAMSUNG-DONG,GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

It explores two channels on how HIV/AIDS affects income that have not been sufficiently stressed by previous literature: the reduction of the incentives to stay in school due to shorter expected longevity and the reduction in productivity of experienced workers. In the model, individuals live for three periods, may get infected in the second period, and with some probability die of AIDS before reaching the third period of their lives. Parents care for the welfare of the future generations so that they will maximize lifetime utility of their dynasty. The simulations predict that the most affected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in the future will be, on average, 30% poorer than they would be without AIDS.

These results cannot be replicated in Denmark. where an increase in maternal work hours does not increase the likelihood of weight problems for their children. This paper tests four possible explanations for this difference: (1) the effect of maternal employment on child obesity is heterogeneous and varies according to the country's weight distribution; (2) the quality of child care is on average higher in Denmark; (3) the counterfactual care provided by Danish mothers is of lower quality; and (4) Danish fathers contribute significantly to their children's health. This paper finds evidence consistent with the hypotheses that Danish child care and fathers play a significant role in explaining the absence of a significant relationship between maternal work hours and children's overweight status.

We endogenously link both the cyclical fluctuations and the mean level of unemployment to the aggregate business cycle risk. The key result of the paper is that business cycles are costly: fluctuations over the cycle induce a higher average unemployment rate since employment is nonlinear in the job-finding rate and the past unemployment rate. We show this analytically for a special case of the model. We then calibrate the model to U.S. data. For the calibrated model, too, business cycles cause higher average unemployment; the welfare cost of business cycles can easily be an order of magnitude larger than Lucas's (1987) estimate. The cost of business cycles is the higher the lower the value of nonemployment is, or, equivalently, the lower is the disutility of work. The ensuing cost of business cycles rises further when workers' skills depreciate during unemployment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The behavioural finance literature suggests four main factors that influence investment behaviour: overconfidence, risk tolerance, self-monitoring and social influence. Adopting this approach, a cluster analysis of data from a representative survey of 345 investors in Greece identified three main segments of investors: high profile investors (a high degree of overconfidence, risk tolerance, self-monitoring and social influence), moderate profile investors (a moderate level of overconfidence, risk tolerance, self-monitoring and social influence) and low profile investors (a low degree of overconfidence, risk tolerance, self-monitoring and social influence). The major finding of the analysis shows that the higher the investors' profile, the higher the performance of these investors on stock trading. The results will expand investors' knowledge about the financial decision-making process and trading behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we examine the pass-through rate of state gasoline and diesel taxes to retail prices, and importantly we estimate the dependence of pass-through on factors constraining the gasoline and diesel supply chains. We consider several factors that alter the elasticity of supply, including within state heterogeneity in gasoline content requirements, refinery capacity utilization, inventory constraints, and variation in the demand for untaxed uses of diesel. In general, we find that in periods of time when the supply chain is constrained, and the constraint is plausibly unrelated to shifts in demand, the pass-through rate of fuel taxes declines. We describe several potential implications for tax policy, including tax breaks during peak driving season and during times of supply disruptions such as after major hurricanes.

First, MSS's findings hold using rainfall levels as instruments. Second, Ciccone (2011) does not provide theoretical justification for preferring rainfall levels. Third, the first-stage relationship between rainfall and growth is weaker after 2000, suggesting that alternative instruments are needed when studying recent conflicts.

Where product quality is differentiated between foreign and host country firms and assuming a firm's quality requirement is a long-term strategy and is not affected by a foreign firm's trade decision, we obtain the following findings. First, whether or not a host country firm produces high or low quality products, raising the quality requirement for foreign products will increase the possibility of a foreign firm choosing FDI instead of exporting a product to the host country. Second, raising the quality requirement for domestic products will lower the possibility of foreign firms choosing FDI without regard to the product's quality. Finally, given a competitor in the host country, in FDI, a foreign high-quality product-producing firm has an advantage over a low-quality product-producing firm.

A major hypothesis tested is that investment in productivity-enhancing and conservation techniques are influenced by land tenure arrangements.

The government privatised the State monopoly of match sale, eliminated the State monopoly on life insurances, sold most of the State-owned telephone networks and services to private firms, reprivatised the largest metal machinery producer, and awarded concessions to private firms to build and operate motorways. These interventions represent one of the earliest and most decisive privatisation episodes in the Western world. While ideological considerations may have had a certain influence, privatisation was used mainly as a political tool to build confidence among industrialists and to increase support for the government and the Partito Nazionale Fascista. Privatisation also contributed to balancing the budget, which was the core objective of Fascist economic policy in its first phase.","[Bel, Germa] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Bel, Germa] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Bel, G (通讯作者)，Fac Econ UB, Dep Polit Econ & EEM, Torre 6,Planta 3, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",gbel@ub.edu,"Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008","Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085",,,,,89,10,12,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Over the period 1965-2009, we find that China's economic growth is mainly attributable to the development of the non-agricultural (industrial and service) sector, driven by rapid labor migration and capital accumulation. We find that the sectoral reallocation of labor plays a significant role in promoting China's economic growth. Further, we find that the marginal productivity of agricultural labor stopped stagnating in 1978, which indicates that China entered quickly into phase two of economic development with the initiation of market reforms. Moreover, by 2009, the marginal productivity of labor has likely exceeded the institutional wage, as defined by the initially low average labor productivity indicating that China may be now in the process of entering phase three of economic development.","[Ercolani, Marco G.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Econ, Edgbaston B15 2TT, England; [Wei, Zheng] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",University of Birmingham; University of Nottingham Ningbo China,"Ercolani, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Econ, Edgbaston B15 2TT, England.",M.G.Ercolani@bham.ac.uk; Zheng.Wei@nottingham.edu.cn,"Ercolani, Marco/AAJ-8116-2020","Ercolani, Marco/0000-0002-0085-6664",,,,,58,11,12,1,13,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

However, little is known about what features of program design account for the observed outcomes. In this paper we analyze the impact of a program in Cambodia that made payments of varying magnitude to otherwise comparable households. The identification is based on a sharp regression discontinuity design. We find that a modest cash transfer, equivalent to approximately 2% of the consumption of the median recipient household, had a substantial impact on school attendance, approximately 25 percentage points. A somewhat larger transfer did not raise attendance rates above this level. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

My econometric analysis shows that American tobacco cards contributed via exclusion to the hidden from view treatment of minority lifestyles.

Fudenberg and Maskin (1986) assume full dimensionality of payoffs, while Abreu et al. (1994) assume the weaker NEU condition (nonequivalent utilities). In this note, we consider a class of n-player games where each player receives the same stage-game payoff, either zero or one. The stage-game payoffs therefore constitute a one-dimensional set, violating NEU. We show that if all players have different discount factors, then for discount factors sufficiently close to one, any strictly individually rational payoff profile can be obtained as the outcome of a subgame-perfect equilibrium with public correlation.

However, the size of any motherhood penalty is an empirical matter and the evidence for Australia is limited. This article examines the effect of motherhood on Australian women's wages and wage growth using a series of panel-data models. Based on data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, an unexplained motherhood wage penalty of around 5 per cent for one child, and 9 per cent for two or more children, is found. Further analysis suggests that the wage penalty emerges over time through reduced wage growth, particularly when the youngest child is an infant, rather than through an immediate wage decline after the birth of a child.

Central for this paper, however, is bargaining over joint profits from potential matches. We investigate, both theoretically and experimentally, a seemingly simple allocation task in a 2x2 market with repeated negotiations. When inefficiency is possible, about 1/3 of the complete matches are inefficient and, overall, more than 3/4 of the experimental allocations are unstable. These results strongly contradict existing bargaining theories requiring efficient matches. Even with regard to efficient matches, the tested theories perform poorly. Standard bargaining and behavioral concepts, such as Selten's (1972) Equal Division Core, are outperformed by the simplistic epsilon-Equal Split, i.e., an equal split of the joint profit plus/minus epsilon.","[Otto, Philipp E.; Bolle, Friedel] Europa Univ Viadrina Frankfurt Oder, Lehrstuhl Volkswirtschaftslehre, D-15207 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany",European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder,"Otto, PE (通讯作者)，Europa Univ Viadrina Frankfurt Oder, Lehrstuhl Volkswirtschaftslehre, Postfach 1786, D-15207 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany.",otto@europa-uni.de,"Otto, Philipp/AAA-8453-2020","Otto, Philipp/0000-0001-8630-108X",,,,,43,5,5,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

As such, it needs to be added to the short list of major determinants of financial development. First, structural conditions first postulated by Engerman and Sokoloff (2002) as generating long-term inequality are shown here to have strong empirical support as exogenous determinants of political instability. Second, that exogenously-determined political instability in turn holds back financial development, even when we control for factors prominent in the last decade's cross-country studies of financial development. The findings indicate that inequality-perpetuating conditions that result in political instability and weak democracy are fundamental roadblocks for international organizations like the World Bank that seek to promote financial development. The evidence here includes country fixed effect regressions and an instrumental model inspired by Engerman and Sokoloffs (2002) work, which to our knowledge has not yet been used in finance and which is consistent with current tests as valid instruments. Four conventional measures of national political instability - Alesina and Perotti's (1996) well-known index of instability, a subsequent index derived from Banks' (2005) work, and two indices of managerial perceptions of nation-by-nation political instability - persistently predict a wide range of national financial development outcomes. Political instability's significance is time consistent in cross-sectional regressions back to the 1960s, the period when the key data becomes available, robust in both country fixed effects and instrumental variable regressions, and consistent across multiple measures of instability and of financial development. Overall, the results indicate the existence of an important channel running from structural inequality to political instability, principally in nondemocratic settings, and then to financial backwardness. The robust significance of that channel extends existing work demonstrating the importance of political economy explanations for financial development and financial backwardness. It should help to better understand which policies will work for financial development, because political instability has causes, cures, and effects quite distinct from those of many of the key institutions most studied in the past decade as explaining financial backwardness.

The article summarizes the results of series of experiments that have been conducted with several groups of Czech university students. Using the threshold mechanism the impact of several factors (experience, communication and the form of experiment) on voluntary contribution to public goods is tested. The results confirm, to a great extent, findings published by foreign studies. The results show that Czech students also do not behave consistently with the traditional economic public goods model, i.e. they cooperate voluntarily in situations that favour free riding. Threshold is a traditional part of (mostly American) charitable collections and can be regarded as one of the most successful modifications of the voluntary contribution mechanism to public good.

A brief survey of Mukerjee's work highlights several elements of his theory that yield useful implications understanding the nonprofit sector. First, Mukerjee's theory implies that this sector's role is in helping the economies to better accommodate broader societal values, rather than in addressing market failure. Second, his theory suggests that the nonprofit sector provides an institutional framework for the pursuit of common interests that are not reducible to individual utility maximization. Finally, as he considered the state to be inherently coercive, he believed the nonprofit sector to be the only meaningful outlet for citizenship behavior, thus advancing an original theory of complementary state-nonprofit relationship.

Our analysis compares two fiscal regimes for local government bond management: the partially decentralized (PD) regime where the central government determines the amount of local bond; and the fully decentralized (FD) regime where each local government determines the amount of local bond. In both regimes, an inflation target has two effects: it harnesses surprise inflation; and it induces excess issuance of local bonds. Due to externality in determining the level of local government bond, however, the second effect, and thereby the optimal level of the inflation target, are smaller in the FD regime than in the PD regime. We also find that even if fiscal decentralization in its isolation deteriorates social welfare, we may be able to improve social welfare by introducing an inflation target when fiscal decentralization measures are adopted.

The simulations quantify a potentially large impact even in the most favorable environment, where export demand holds up, and, the dollar is pro-cyclical. A two-year investment boom in two sectors increases consumption by a Net Present Value (NPV) amount of nearly one per cent, due to a positive investment externality onto the US terms of trade. If the investment is wasted, however, the consumption loss is nearly one-half of a per cent. A 5-year 'capital strike' across the whole economy subsequent to the boom mimicking financial distress from a burst bubble shaves around 10 per cent off consumption. Given these significant costs associated with boom and bust equity markets, we consider some, policy options that might result in greater stability in these markets.

Borrowing constraints offer an alternative explanation that does not require consumers to be uncertain about their future income. This paper employs a three-cohort, overlapping generations model with quadratic utility and no capital to show that, if agents are patient enough, heterogeneity alone can account for more than half the decrease in the equilibrium interest rate caused by a borrowing constraint. The possibility of facing a binding borrowing constraint in the future induces saving, and this saving increases with the cross-sectional variation in income. Another channel that pushes down the interest rate is the direct effect caused by currently constrained agents not being allowed to dissave. For patient agents, the two channels have roughly the same impact on the interest rate. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Greene, DL",,,,"Greene, David L.",,,"Uncertainty, loss aversion, and markets for energy efficiency",ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy efficiency; Fuel economy; Loss aversion,DISCOUNT RATES; INVESTMENT; CHOICES; RISK,"Increasing energy efficiency is critical to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion, reducing oil dependence, and achieving a sustainable global energy system. The tendency of markets to neglect apparently cost-effective energy efficiency options has been called the efficiency gap or energy paradox. The market for energy efficiency in new, energy-using durable goods, however, appears to have a bias that leads to undervaluation of future energy savings relative to their expected value. This paper argues that the bias is chiefly produced by the combination of substantial uncertainty about the net value of future fuel savings and the loss aversion of typical consumers. This framework relies on the theory of context-dependent preferences. The uncertainty-loss aversion bias against energy efficiency is quantifiable, making it potentially correctible by policy measures. The welfare economics of such policies remains unresolved. Data on the costs of increased fuel economy of new passenger cars, taken from a National Research Council study, illustrate how an apparently cost-effective increase in energy efficiency would be uninteresting to loss-averse consumers.

We then document that the emergence of bank-issued credit, virtually non-existent outside of Moscow prior to 2000, has been an important engine of growth since 2000.

Specifically, we estimate whether Jose Canseco, a star baseball player in the late 1980's and 1990's, affected the performance of his teammates by introducing them to steroids. Using panel data, we show that a player's performance increases significantly after they played with Jose Canseco. After checking 30 comparable players from the same era, we find that no other baseball player produced a similar effect. Furthermore, the positive effect of Canseco disappears after 2003, the year that drug testing was implemented. These results suggest that workers not only learn productive skills from their co-workers, but sometimes those skills may derive from unethical practices. These findings may be relevant to many workplaces where competitive pressures create incentives to adopt unethical means to boost productivity and profits. Our analysis leads to several potential policy implications designed to reduce the spread of unethical behavior among workers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Under legal unbundling the bottleneck must be operated by a legally independent upstream firm, which may be partly or fully owned by an incumbent active in downstream markets. Access prices are regulated but the upstream firm can perform non-tariff discrimination. Under perfect legal unbundling the upstream firm maximizes only own profits; with imperfections it is biased and to some extent accounts also for the incumbent's downstream profits. We show that increasing the incumbent's ownership share increases total output if the upstream firm's bias is sufficiently small, while otherwise effects are ambiguous. Stronger regulation that reduces the bias without changing ownership shares generally increases total output. We also endogenize the bias and show that it can depend non-monotonically on the ownership share.","[Hoeffler, Felix] Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ EWI, Cologne, Germany; [Hoeffler, Felix] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany; [Kranz, Sebastian] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-5300 Bonn, Germany",University of Cologne; Max Planck Society; University of Bonn,"Höffler, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ EWI, Cologne, Germany.",felix.hoeffler@uni-koeln.de; skranz.@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,14,22,26,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In this paper, we show that with realistic parameters, the canonical Calvo-style model cannot explain the joint behavior of inflation and the labor share in Europe. In addition, we show that the model fails very badly in sectoral data with consistently negative estimated coefficients on the labor share in a number of different inflation specifications. Indeed, the use of a traditional output gap measure proved more successful in terms of a positive relationship with inflation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In this article we suggest a method based on decomposing individual predicted wages into a skill-related part and a part unrelated to skill, where the former consists of both observed and unobserved components. The predicted wages, associated with individual skill attributes, are sorted and classified into deciles. The median predicted skill-related wage in each decile is used to construct an alternative skill-adjusted index of labor services. We find that total factor productivity (TFP) growth decreases significantly when using the latter method. This means that when using the alternative method one explains more of the growth in labor productivity than what a more traditional labor quality adjustment procedure does.","[Raknerud, Arvid; Rybalka, Marina; Skjerpen, Terje] Stat Norway, NO-0033 Oslo, Norway; [Nilsen, Oivind A.] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Trondheim, Norway",Statistics Norway; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Skjerpen, T (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, POB 8131 Dep, NO-0033 Oslo, Norway.",terje.skjerpen@ssb.no,,"Nilsen, Oivind A/0000-0001-8252-8586",,,,,20,6,6,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Unlike Uruguay, Chile has one of the more unequal income distributions of the region. In 2003, Chile had Gini Coefficient of 8.5 points higher than Uruguay. Using micro/simulations, the analysis shows that most of the difference regarding income distribution comes from the wealthier households, particularly those that belong to the top 2%. Those households get the greatest proportion of resources coming from non-labor income. At the same time, the difference in returns to higher education explains another 20% of the income differences between Chile and Uruguay. Social conditions such as social security benefits and the participation of women in the labor market are not significant to explain the differences between these countries. Finally, this paper shows that national account adjustment to income information in Chilean households' survey explains a third of the Gini coefficient gap between Chile and Uruguay, without the national account adjustment, the income distribution gap among both countries would diminish in three points from earlier estimation. Even though this significative reduction the reasons to explain the gap would remain identical than previous analysis.","[Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Duryea, Suzanne] Banco Interamer Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Inter-American Development Bank,"Valenzuela, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile.",,", CIAE/R-5423-2017",,,,,,22,3,4,0,25,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0304-2758,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

There are three main results emanating from the analysis in this paper. Firstly, food price movements have played a large role in generating inflationary episodes in South Africa. Secondly, while external influences do matter, South African food price movements are mainly due to domestic influences. This implies that national policy has an important role to play in taming domestic food price inflation. Thirdly, given the strong second round impacts, food price movements warrant special attention in monetary policymaking. Core measures of inflation that exclude food price movements may not accurately reflect the underlying inflationary pressures in the economy and could compromise the attainment of the goal of price stability.","[Rangasamy, Logan] S African Reserve Bank, Res Dept, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; Univ North West, Grad Sch Business, ZA-2745 Mafikeng, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Rangasamy, L (通讯作者)，S African Reserve Bank, Res Dept, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",Logan.Rangasamy@resbank.co.za,,,,,,,54,12,14,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Agents are 'internally rational', i.e., maximize discounted expected utility under uncertainty given dynamically consistent subjective beliefs about the future, but agents may not be 'externally rational', i.e., may not know the true stochastic process for payoff relevant variables beyond their control. This includes future market outcomes and fundamentals. We apply this approach to a simple asset pricing model and show that the equilibrium stock price is then determined by investors' expectations of the price and dividend in the next period, rather than by expectations of the discounted sum of dividends. As a result, learning about price behavior affects market outcomes, while learning about the discounted sum of dividends is irrelevant for equilibrium prices. Stock prices equal the discounted sum of dividends only after making very strong assumptions about agents' market knowledge. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The latter allows expectation violations to be a driving force for responder behavior. We estimate the model on a large representative sample from the Dutch population. We find that the relative importance of distributional preferences and perceived intentions depends significantly on the socio-economic characteristics of responders. Strong inequity aversion to the other player's disadvantage is found for lower educated and older respondents.

When the order of the agenda is exogenous, a sufficient condition guarantees the existence of welfare gains, relative to simple majority voting. But is efficiency compromised if a chair controls the order of the agenda? The agenda becomes cheap talk and can be used to transmit information about the chair's priorities. The game has multiple equilibria, differing in the precision of the information transmitted, but the welfare impact is minor, and the comparison to simple majority voting is unchanged. In laboratory experiments, subjects have difficulty identifying the informative strategies, but payoffs are effectively identical to theoretical predictions.

Using data on emigrant stocks by schooling level and source country in OECD destinations, we find that a simple model of income maximization can account for both phenomena. Results on selection show that migrants for a source-destination pair are more educated relative to non-migrants the larger is the absolute skill-related difference in earnings between the destination country and the source. Results on sorting indicate that the relative stock of more educated migrants in a destination is increasing in the absolute earnings difference between high and low-skilled workers. We use our framework to compare alternative specifications of international migration, estimate the magnitude of migration costs by source-destination pair, and assess the contribution of wage differences to how migrants sort themselves across destination countries.

The paper has two objectives: (i) uncovering the macroeconomic circumstances that favored the rise of formal education: (ii) to reconcile the remarkable growth of the education sector with the constancy of other key macroeconomic variables, such as the interest rate, the consumption-output ratio, and the growth rate of per capita income (Kaldor facts). The transitional dynamics of human capital growth models, such as Lucas (1998), would attribute the arrival of education to the diminishing marginal productivity of physical capital. Conversely, the model proposed here suggests that it is the rate of learning that catches up with the rate of return on physical capital. As technical knowledge expands, the rate of return on education increases, inducing individuals to stay longer in school. The model's transitional paths are matched with long run U.S. educational and economic data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We examine how the threat of feuds affects individuals' willingness to engage in altruistic punishment in a public good experiment in which the number of stages is determined by participants' actions. The design imposes minimal restrictions on who can punish whom and when, and therefore allows participants to use a range of punishment strategies. We find that participants recognize the threat of feuds and respond to it by employing strategies that prevent their breakout. When feuds can span several periods, the extent of altruistic punishment is greatly reduced. This leads to progressively lower levels of cooperation and earnings relative to a baseline treatment where punishment cannot be avenged. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our finding has two important theoretical consequences. First, assuming that preferences depend on budget sets is illegitimate under the scientific commitments of revealed preference theory. Second, as long as consumers' preferences are not defined over budget sets, we can assume that preferences depend on observable objects other than own consumption without compromising the logical possibility to reject the model against observation. We however point out that, despite this logical possibility, in practice it can be almost impossible to reject a model where preferences are defined over objects that depend on budget sets. As an example of this we show that if preferences are defined over consumption choices of other individuals then rationalization fails only in cases of negligible practical interest.","Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, I-41100 Modena, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Bilancini, E (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, Viale Berengario 51, I-41100 Modena, Italy.",ennio.bilancini@unimore.it,"Bilancini, Ennio/J-6405-2019","Bilancini, Ennio/0000-0002-2027-3992",,,,,29,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

There are strong gender differences and women that are open-to-experiences, introverted or neurotic get lower satisfaction from household income increases.

The behavior of banks that suspended operations in hedge funds with backed or collateralized mortgages is examined, which in turn led to a lack of liquidity in the financial system, a situation that drove the state to rush a rescue. To reach this end, we propose a system of stochastic differential equations with mean reversion linking the capital requirement of banks to: risky assets, the volatility of the financial system, the risk premium market, the real interest rate, the level of inflation, and economic activity. The proposed model assumes that banks may suffer bank runs when their capital requirements is below a VaR (value at risk) threshold, and the effects of the run can be transmitted to the rest of the financial system. Additionally, by using Monte Carlo simulation, it is shown that the irresponsible behavior of banks can influence a breakdown of the rest of the system, depending on their relative size.","[Cruz-Ake, Salvador; Venegas-Martinez, Francisco] Escuela Super Econ, Inst Politecn Nacl, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Lopez Sarabia, Pablo] Inst Tecnol Estudios Super Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico",Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Cruz-Aké, S (通讯作者)，Escuela Super Econ, Inst Politecn Nacl, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",salcake@yahoo.com; plopezs@itesm.mx; fvenegas1111@yahoo.com.mx,"Ake, Saalvador Cruz/AAR-1829-2021; Venegas-Martinez, Francisco/F-9635-2010","Ake, Saalvador Cruz/0000-0003-1452-377X; Venegas-Martinez, Francisco/0000-0003-1157-0298",,,,,33,1,2,0,16,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

Often they overestimate their (relative) abilities. We conduct an experiment to test whether the self-assessment of individuals improves when they receive feedback and there are incentives to make a correct self-assessment. We investigate the subjects' reactions to feedback in several subsequent rounds to see not only if, but also when and how they react. Our main finding is that feedback influences subjects' decisions and can improve their overall self-assessment. The effects, however, depend on the kind of feedback. Furthermore, we observe differences in the reactions of subjects (e.g., to what extent they follow feedback), the robustness of their belief about their relative ability, and how they process feedback.","[Ludwig, Sandra] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Eberlein, Marion] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Nafziger, Julia] Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",University of Munich; University of Bonn; Aarhus University,"Ludwig, S (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Ludwigstr 28 Rgb, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",sandra.ludwig@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,"Nafziger, Julia/0000-0003-3307-3073",,,,,36,9,12,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

While results from the years prior to the crisis often cast doubts on the strength of the bank lending channel, recent evidence shows that bank-specific characteristics can have a large impact on the provision of credit. We show that new factors, such as changes in banks' business models and market funding patterns, had modified the monetary transmission mechanism in Europe and in the US prior to the crisis, and demonstrate the existence of structural changes during the period of financial crisis. Banks with weaker core capital positions, greater dependence on market funding and on non-interest sources of income restricted the loan supply more strongly during the crisis period. These findings support the Basel III focus on banks' core capital and on funding liquidity risks. They also call for a more forward-looking approach to the statistical data coverage of the banking sector by central banks. In particular, there should be a stronger focus on monitoring those financial factors that are likely to influence the functioning of the monetary transmission mechanism particularly in periods of crisis. - Leonardo Gambacorta and David Marques-Ibanez.",,,,Leonardo.Gambacorta@bis.org; David.Marques@ecb.int,,,,,,,67,169,184,0,54,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Despite ever more marked deviations of left-hand political platforms from the Bolshevik model, self-management has not taken the place of central planning in Marxist plans for the future. In this paper, in contrast, the author argues that an analysis of the self-managed firm system may offer dues for a discussion of major points of Marxian theory including the labour theory of value, alienation, dialectics or the subject-object inversion in capitalism. Accordingly, in the individual sections of this paper each of these central aspects of Marxists theory will be separately addressed M the light of insights flowing from the economic theory of producer cooperatives.","Univ Naples Federico 2, Fac Giurisprudenza, Dipartimento Teoria Econ & Applicaz, I-80121 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Jossa, B (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico 2, Fac Giurisprudenza, Dipartimento Teoria Econ & Applicaz, Via Giacomo Piscicelli 77, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",bruiossa@unina.it,,,,,,,171,0,0,0,6,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1120-2890,,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Apart from the commonly used economic determinants of inflation, we model the impact of remittances and institutional variables on inflation. Using the Arellano and Bond panel dynamic estimator and the Arellano and Bover and the Blundell and Bond system generalized method of moments estimator, we find evidence that in developing countries remittances generate inflation. The effect of remittances on inflation is more pronounced in the long run. Moreover, we find that openness, debt, current account deficits, the agricultural sector, and the short-term U.S. interest rate have a positive effect on inflation. We also find that improvements in democracy reduce inflation.","[Narayan, Paresh Kumar; Mishra, Sagarika] Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia; [Narayan, Seema] RMIT Univ, Sch Mkt Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Narayan, PK (通讯作者)，Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, 70 Edgar Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia.",paresh.narayan@deakin.edu.au; seema.narayan@rmit.edu.au; sagarika.mishra@deakin.edu.au,"Narayan, Paresh/AAE-8777-2019; Narayan, Seema Wati/GRY-3201-2022; Narayan, Paresh Kumar/AEM-2143-2022; Narayan, Seema/H-5698-2019","Narayan, Seema Wati/0000-0002-3993-4981; Mishra, Sagarika/0000-0003-0590-225X; Narayan, Paresh/0000-0001-7934-8146",,,,,45,50,54,0,6,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We conducted two studies involving behavioral interventions expected to affect performance, providing some of the first experimental data in this area. In the first we investigate whether evenly spaced interim deadlines lead to higher completion rates for a lengthy task, where procrastination could be a factor. We found that these interim deadlines in fact led to lower completion rates in our set-up; we also found no evidence in the aggregate data (although there was considerable heterogeneity) of an increasing profile of the number of hours spent at the task over time, suggesting that the degree of present-bias in the participant population is not that high. In the second, we examine how willpower depletion affects behavior. Our second study isolates the effect of direct willpower depletion on the first day of a two-day period, thus exploring procrastination over a shorter time horizon. We found that depleting willpower did indeed lead to less work (and poorer quality) on the first day, but that this intervention surprisingly led to a higher completion rate overall. Our results help to inform ongoing efforts to understand and model self-control, willpower, and commitment mechanisms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our results reveal the existence of non-negligible costs in terms of foregone employment for carers who live with the dependent person and/or provide more than 28 h of care/week.

We investigate the implications of the principle in the context of transferable utility games. Our first axiom, coalitional fair-ranking, requires that if the worth of a given coalition changes while the worths of other coalitions remain fixed, then the relative positions of all players in the given coalition should not be affected. We show that for games with at least three players, there is no core selection satisfying coalitional fair-ranking. If the change is limited to the worth of the grand coalition, then there is a core selection satisfying the requirement. In addition, we present a new axiomatic characterization of the Shapley value on the basis of strong coalitional fair-ranking: it requires that if a game is added to another game with two symmetric players, then the relative positions of the symmetric players should not be affected. The Shapley value is the only value satisfying strong coalitional fair-ranking together with efficiency, the null player property and strategic equivalence.","[Chun, Youngsub] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Boram] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Math Educ, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Chun, Y (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",ychun@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

Experimental trust and social distance in Cameroon,EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Experiment; Trust game; Dictator game; Risk game; Social distance; Cameroon,RECIPROCITY; ECONOMICS,"In this paper we use experimental data from rural Cameroon to quantify the effect of social distance on trust and altruism. Our measure of social distance is relevant to everyday economic interactions: subjects in a Trust Game play with fellow villagers or with someone from a different village. We find that significantly more money is sent when the players are from the same village. Other factors that influence transfers at least as much as the same-village effect are gender, education and membership of rotating credit groups. To test whether Senders are motivated by altruism, they also play a Triple Dictator Game. Senders transfer significantly more money on average in the Trust Game than in the Triple Dictator Game. However, there is also a social distance effect in the Triple Dictator Game. Results from a Risk Game suggest that Trust Game transfers are uncorrelated with attitudes to risk.","[Etang, Alvin; Fielding, David; Knowles, Stephen] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Fielding, D (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.",david.fielding@otago.ac.nz,,,,,,,32,54,59,3,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Because natural gas and LNG are substitutes, natural gas prices are expected to be an important determinant of LNG imports. Furthermore, an increasing share of LNG is traded under short-term contracts with spot shipments being diverted to markets offering the highest returns (netbacks). Relative natural gas prices as well as LNG transportation costs are important determinants of LNG netbacks. This paper examines the empirical relationship between U.S. LNG imports, the Henry Hub price of natural gas relative to U.K. and Asia gas prices, and a proxy for LNG transportation costs using monthly data from 1997 to 2007. Granger causality tests, error variance decomposition, and impulse response analyses using a VAR model are employed to establish Granger-causality as well as the dynamics of natural gas prices and LNG transportation innovations on LNG imports.

It is shown that the time-inconsistency problem causes the monopolist in the non-commitment case to release a new version more rapidly than in the commitment case.

This paper argues that the opposite direction of causality is more plausible, i.e. that populations with higher trust levels are more prone to creating and successfully maintaining universal welfare states with high levels of taxation where publicly financed social insurance schemes. The hypothesis is tested using instrumental variable techniques to infer variations in trust levels that pre-date current welfare states, and then using the variation in historical trust levels to explain the current size and design of the welfare state, and finally comparing the explanatory power of trust to other potential explanatory factors such as left-right ideology and economic openness. To infer variation about historical trust levels, we use three instruments, all used previously in the trust literature: the grammatical rule allowing pronoun-drop, average temperature in the coldest month and a dummy for constitutional monarchies. Using cross-sectional data for 77 countries, we show that these instruments are valid and that countries with higher historical trust levels have significantly higher public expenditure as a share of GDP and also have more regulatory freedom. This finding is robust to controlling for several other potential explanations of welfare state size.","[Bergh, Andreas] Ratio Inst, SE-10364 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bjornskov, Christian] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Sch Business, Dept Econ, DK-8230 Abyhoj, Denmark; [Bergh, Andreas] Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Aarhus University; Lund University,"Bergh, A (通讯作者)，Ratio Inst, POB 3203, SE-10364 Stockholm, Sweden.",andreas.bergh@ratio.se; chbj@asb.dk,"Bergh, Andreas/AAM-2478-2020; Bergh, Andreas/E-9962-2018","Bergh, Andreas/0000-0003-2621-6769;",,,,,49,120,128,0,23,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2011,64.0,1,,,,,1,19,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00492.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,705ES,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286112300001,0

A downstream firm trades off inventory holding costs against lost sales. Lost final sales impose a negative externality on the upstream firm. The solution requires a subsidy limited by the value of inputs. Allowing the downstream firm to pay with a delay is precisely such a solution. A reverse externality accounts for the use of prepayment. We clarify how input prices vary with such policies, and when trade credit/prepayment is more efficient than pure input price adjustments.

This hypothesis suggests that the suicide rate of a society could never be zero even if both the economic and the social conditions were made ideal from the point of view of suicide (Yang and Lester, 1991). This research relates the suicide rates to harmonized unemployment and divorce rates to test the natural hypothesis statistically. We also address methodological flaws by earlier suicide studies by employing autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration advocated by Pesaran et al. (2001). In majority of regression equations, the constant term was positive and statistically significant, indicating a non-zero natural suicide rate. In particular, we find evidence that at aggregate level. Turkey has the lowest (3.64) and Japan has the highest (13.98) natural rate of suicides. In terms of the male natural suicide rates, the United Kingdom ranks the lowest (4.73) and Belgium ranks the top (15.44).

Here we provide a progress report on some recent advances in the area. We start by reviewing the properties of random-effects likelihood approaches. We emphasize a link with Bayesian computation and Markov chain Monte Carlo, which provides a convenient approach to estimation and inference. The relaxation of parametric assumptions on the distribution of individual effects raises serious identification problems. In discrete choice models, common parameters and average marginal effects are generally set identified. The availability of continuous outcomes, however, provides opportunities for point identification. We end by reviewing recent progress on non-fixed-T approaches. In panel applications in which the time dimension is not negligible relative to the size of the cross section, it makes sense to view the estimation problem as a time-series finite-sample bias. Several perspectives to bias reduction are now available.

The article contributes to the hotel industry literature by adopting a somewhat novel approach that has never been applied to this industry despite its managerial implications.

A large-scale survey of small-and medium-sized businesses is used to infer how association services operate. An important focus is to determine the level at which the fixed costs of association services are covered: this defines a minimum-size level for associations. This is found to be between one-half and one member of staff per thousand businesses in that sector. This is a fairly low barrier to market entry by an association, which helps to explain the fragmentation of associations. This is further indicated by the existence of declining internal economics of scale and scope for larger association sizes. This suggests that efforts to stimulate association merger and co-operation will continue to meet with limited success.","[Robson, Paul J.

Examination of a pooled sample of traffic stops from five locations reveals no gender bias, but does show significant regional variation in the likelihood of citations. Analysis by location shows that women are more likely to receive citations in three of the five locations. Men are more likely to receive citations in the other two locations.

A two-step methodology is followed employing a migration prediction model followed by the estimation of a Three Stage Least Squares (3SLS) remittances and income equation system. We find that remittances contribute to growth in productive capital and entrepreneurial activity in the longer-established migrant economy, but have yet to impact on business activity in the more recently remittances-oriented economy, despite it having a more developed, market economy. In the latter case, remittances seem more linked to supporting consumption through supplementing low wage income. These findings suggest that the duration and intensity of remittance-driven migration, and the structure of economic activity within a community are important in understanding the influences of migration and remittances on household resource allocation and production decisions.","[Brown, Richard P.

We develop a Ramsey model of economic growth with a rival but non-excludable public good which is financed by taxes which can be evaded via corrupt tax inspectors. We prove that the relationship between the tax rate and tax collection, in a dynamic framework, is not unique, but is different depending on the relevance of the shame effect. We show that in all three cases - low, middle and high shame countries, the growth rate increases as the tax rate increases up to a threshold value, after which the growth rate begins to decrease as the tax rate increases. But, for intermediate tax rates, the rate of growth for low shame countries is lower than that of uniform shame countries which is, in turn, lower than that of high shame countries. This happens because the growth rate is more sensitive to variations of t in an honest country rather than in a corrupt country. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Using Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) futures data, the in-sample and out-of-sample results shows that when VaR is used as the criterion to measure the futures hedging effectiveness, the performance of the dynamic hedging strategy is superior to that of the static hedging strategy, and the performance of the optimal VaR hedging strategy is better than that of the minimum variance and mean-variance hedging strategies. Besides, from the standpoint that the volatility of hedge ratio and hedged portfolio variance decline, no matter what kind of hedging strategy is adopted, the regime switching model is better in in-sample and out-of-sample hedging effectiveness than the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (GARCH) model.","Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Chiayi 60054, Taiwan",National Chiayi University,"Chang, KL (通讯作者)，Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Chiayi 60054, Taiwan.",klchang@mail.ncyu.edu.tw,,,,,,,57,4,4,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Blanchard et al. [2010] proposed that, in the current economic situation central banks increase their inflation targets from 2% to about 4%. This should provide the room for further reductions of interest rates in the case of a possible next financial crisis (or another strong shock). The authors give a critical assessment of that proposal. They recall, first of all, two arguments against the increase of inflationary targets that have been raised hitherto, namely the increase in the costs of debt service in the short run, and the increase in economic and social costs of inflation in the long run. They also add and justify the third argument: the risk of the emergence of dangerous speculative bubbles in asset markets. The authors suggest that, in the light of the experience acquired from the global financial crisis, the research on inflationary processes should employ both purely economic and monetary analysis.","[Cizkowicz, Piotr; Rzonca, Andrzej] Szkola Glowna Handlowa, Kolegium Analiz Porownawczych, Katedra Miedzynarodowych Studiow Porownawczych, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Cizkowicz, P (通讯作者)，Szkola Glowna Handlowa, Kolegium Analiz Porownawczych, Katedra Miedzynarodowych Studiow Porownawczych, Warsaw, Poland.",piotr.cizkowicz@sgh.waw.pl; andrzej.rzonca@nbp.pl,,,,,,,52,0,0,1,7,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2011,,5,,,,,677,690,,,,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865UG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298335800002,0

This article constructs a general equilibrium model in which the effects of reduction in working hours on the main macroeconomic variables are studied. To do so, the model includes two important new features with regard to the production function: a parameter measuring the productivity of working hours and another parameter of adjustment costs measuring the unproductive time in the course of the working day. Results show that the employment level always improves as the length of the working week is reduced but also reveal an inflection point in terms of the productivity of working hours, below which a reduction in the number of working hours improves the results of macroeconomic variables and above which this policy aggravates the economic situation.","[Dominguez, E.; Ullibarri, M.; Zabaleta, I.] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona 31006, Navarre, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Zabaleta, I (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Arrosadia, Pamplona 31006, Navarre, Spain.",idoia@unavarra.es,"Dominguez, Emilio/AAA-7433-2019","Dominguez, Emilio/0000-0002-2232-6883",,,,,8,4,7,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

While much research exists in the fraud management field, majority only deals with partial problems and presupposes the independence of specific fraud management activities. Researches on components of fraud management system are rarely explicitly related to business performance improvements. These results in a common problem, which can be observed on the practitioners' side: only small amount of companies can objectively assess which of the many fraud management system components proposed by researchers and vendors will help to solve their problems in fraud management. The method proposed in this paper can be used as a strategic tool for improvement of fraud management process in motor insurance companies. The method is designed to be used for a selection of fraud management system components, and is based on business performance. The input for the method is a set of key performance indicators that an insurance companies wish to improve. The result is a set of activities, which should be improved, and a set of fraud management system components that should be used to improve these activities. The paper presents and explains the method and its components. The method components have been developed based on the data received from Slovenian motor insurance companies and method is evaluated in three case studies.","[Furlan, Stefan] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Comp & Informat Sci, Lab Data Technol, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Furlan, Stefan] Optilab, Ajdovscina 5270, Slovenia; [Vasilecas, Olegas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Ljubljana; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Furlan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Comp & Informat Sci, Lab Data Technol, Trzaslka Cesta 25, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",stefan.furlan@fri.uni-lj.si; olegas.vasilecas@vgtu.lt; marko.bajec@fri.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,74,7,9,0,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Under some circumstances the old system is more favourable to convergence, while under some others the opposite is true.

To illustrate the impact of the financial crisis on the Czech credit market bonity, the time series are divided into two time periods, pre-crisis and crisis period.

First, a model to explain how changes in regulatory framework (e. g., audit effectiveness) and transboundary spillovers affect both actual and reported emissions is developed. Then the theoretical predictions using data for 39 European countries from 1999 to 2003 are tested and inferences about true emission levels are made. The empirical analysis supports the theoretical predictions with significant implications for the interpretation of pollution data reported to international monitoring agencies. Countries with effective regulation are likely to have relatively high reported emissions of sulphur. But this should not automatically be interpreted as weak environmental performance, because their actual pollution levels are likely to be lower than in nations with less effective regulation.","Ohio State Univ Newark, Dept Polit Sci, Newark, OH 43055 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Ivanova, K (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ Newark, Dept Polit Sci, 1179 Univ Dr, Newark, OH 43055 USA.",ivanova.6@osu.edu,,,,,,,49,32,32,1,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Each seller offers a good to buyers who have homogeneous preferences. Sellers decide on the number of attributes of their good and set prices. The number of attributes bears no cost to the sellers and does not affect the value of the good to the buyers but adds complexity to buyers' evaluation of the goods. The experimental results indicate that the buyers make more suboptimal choices and that prices are higher when the number of attributes of the goods is higher.

The alternatives are described by levels of a set of predefined attributes and are also referred to as profiles. Respondents often find it difficult to trade off prospective goods when every attribute of the offering changes in each comparison. Especially in studies involving many attributes, respondents get overloaded by the complexity of the choice task. To overcome respondent fatigue, it is better to simplify the choice tasks by holding the levels of some of the attributes constant in every choice set. The resulting designs are called partial profile designs. In this paper, we construct D-optimal partial profile designs for estimating main-effects models. We use a Bayesian design algorithm that integrates the D-optimality criterion over a prior distribution of likely parameter values. To determine the constant attributes in each choice set, we generalize the approach that makes use of balanced incomplete block designs. Our algorithm is very flexible because it produces partial profile designs of any choice set size and allows for attributes with any number of levels and any number of constant attributes. We provide an illustration in which we make recommendations that balance the loss of statistical information and the burden imposed on the respondents.","[Kessels, Roselinde; Jones, Bradley; Goos, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Kessels, Roselinde; Jones, Bradley; Goos, Peter] Univ Antwerp, StatUa Ctr Stat, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Jones, Bradley] SAS Inst Inc, Cary, NC 27513 USA; [Goos, Peter] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; SAS Institute Inc; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Kessels, R (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",roselinde.kessels@ua.ac.be; bradley.jones@jmp.com; peter.goos@ua.ac.be,"Kessels, Roselinde/N-8479-2016; Goos, Peter/AAP-7890-2020","Kessels, Roselinde/0000-0002-4534-0047; Goos, Peter/0000-0002-3854-6506",,,,,43,76,79,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

The author defines the individual demand function and the aggregate demand function based on it, depending on the market interest rate, and he discusses the ability of the central bank to influence its level. The analysis is based on the concept of portfolio choice developed by Tobin, supplemented by the modified Keynesian concept of the normal interest rate where the latter is defined as an interval rather than an exact level considered to be normal. The dependence between the interest rate and the individual demand for money is established using a microeconomic analysis of the income and substitution effect of the interest rate. The analysis shows that the aggregate functional dependence between the interest rate and the demand for money can only exist within the normal interval of the interest rate provided that expectations of economic agents as to the normal range of the interest rate are not highly differentiated. It also shows that the market interest rate tends towards its normal interval, which means that an effective control over its level must include an influence on the expectations of economic agents.","Szkola Glowna Handlowa, Katedra Teorii Syst Ekon, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Krawczyk, M (通讯作者)，Szkola Glowna Handlowa, Katedra Teorii Syst Ekon, Warsaw, Poland.",ktse@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,5,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2011,,6,,,,,777,794,,,,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,880HY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299399400001,0

The main problem which was solved in the course of the research was to interconnect accounting methods, used for preparing financial statements as a way to link the quality of reported earnings and financial health of the organization.

The common paradigm would not include China, which has chosen another way of development, marked by a capitalist economic base coupled with communist superstructure and one-party political system. The Chinese model includes similar instruments to those used in the developed countries because western economic knowledge is adapted there without hesitation, but metaphysically it is entirely different since it includes elements of communist ideology. In the Chinese culture such a merger is possible, unlike in the western culture. Therefore, the unification of the western and the Chinese economic models and economic paradigms and the emergence of a uniform economics would require westernization of China or sinoization of the rest of the world, or, alternatively, full liberation of economics from ideology and politics.

Analysis is based on a profit function, where the selected variables representing environmental constraints were incorporated as additional fixed factors. Results revealed that environmental constraints have a significant influence on both profitability and farmers' resource allocation decisions. Output supply and input demands were significantly affected by land suitability and other environmental constraints (i.e. a combination of poor soil fertility, pest and weed infestation and weather variation). The policy implications include development of wheat varieties that are suitable for low lying and/or marginal areas, are resistant to insect and pest attacks and can withstand weather variations. Also, soil fertility improvement through soil conservation and crop rotation, improvement in managerial practices through extension services and strengthening of research-extension link will improve profitability.","[Rahman, Sanzidur] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Hasan, M.

The upper bound refers to the average dynamic for a subset of flats entering the market in a given period. Our hedonic estimates point to an average rent increase of approximately 40%, almost 20 percentage points above the one recorded by the rent component of the Italian consumer price index.

Both observations can be attributed to a reduction in the effectiveness of the traditional demand channel of monetary transmission. Based on this insight, we evaluate the desirability of an alternative monetary policy regime, price-level targeting. We find that the latter is almost immune to equilibrium indeterminacy and remains successful in stabilizing output and inflation. Due to the weak demand channel, the ability of the central bank to manage private sector expectations takes center stage. This is accomplished by price-level targeting through the introduction of history dependence, but not by inflation targeting.","Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-6000 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Schmidt, S (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-6000 Frankfurt, Germany.",s.schmidt@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

This article shows that when the choice of optimal cross-ownership profile is simultaneous, a mixed equilibrium with upward vertical and horizontal participations can be achieved, vertical and horizontal ones being strategic substitutes.

Real estate market takes a significant share in global economics which suggests the important position of the real estate market in global economic processes. Processes of world globalisation strengthen the links between the real estate market and cycles of overall economics. These links are less understandable and less apparent in transition economies trying to successfully integrate into the communities of market economies and catch up with developed countries. Processes in the real estate markets in transition economies have not been fully researched, and they differ from the processes of the real estate markets in developed economies with their peculiarities, possible market participants' reactions to economic shock and outcomes for the country's economy. Common problems with property privatization, formation of legal and financial systems, real estate market cycle are specific and the countries with transition economy face them. Specificity of a narrower real estate market share - housing market - is determined by the need of housing market participators to procure and possess own housing unsatisfied during the period of command economy. The need for housing is constant and reflects the present level of people's wellbeing, however, in the case of countries with transition economy a big share of new players who allow making irrational investment decisions because of the lack of historical experience and information interfere with processes in housing market. Understanding and forethought of the tendencies of real estate price level formation is becoming extremely important in transition economies, where legislative base of the real estate market has not been formed, people are hardly familiar with the processes of the real estate market and not sufficiently understand their impact on the economy of the country. Deeper analysis in this field has been also encouraged by the fact that scientific literature lacks the establishment of the key factors determining the formation of housing price level in transition economies. That is why, considering an increasing demand for housing in transition economies, the authors find it necessary to carry out the research to include the processes of housing market, the tendencies of housing price level formation and the impact of bank policy directions on housing market participants and a housing price level. The scientific literature has not still provided a clear answer to the question What transition economy peculiarities are the most important and have the greatest impact on housing price level variations?. The aim of the work is to determine the most important peculiarities of transition economy country that have the greatest influence on the formation of a housing price level, and with this aim the authors seek to review the conditions and factors determining the formation of a housing price level in transition economies, study theoretical features and peculiarities of the transition economy country which could have an impact on the formation of housing price level, establish the main factors determining the formation of a housing price level in the transition economy country in the case of Lithuania, use the method of expert evaluation in order to verify the impact of the most important factors, typical of transaction economy, on the formation of a housing price level. The analysis of the scientific literature proposes the conclusion that the main peculiarities determining the formation of housing price level in transition economies are targeted formation of housing market participants' behaviour and high money supply. The authors have revealed the connection between the formation of legislative base and tax policy as well as between bureaucratic barriers of land management and change of housing price level. They have also revealed the link between the number of real estate market participants and housing price level increase. The more speculative objectives real estate market participators have, the higher demand is stimulated and housing prices rise. The research has also shown that there is interdependence between change of housing prices and irrational behaviour of consumers. It is worth highlighting the fact that the formation of housing price level in transition economy country is influenced by a complex of different factors.","[Snieska, Vytautas; Venclauskiene, Deimante; Vasiliauskiene, Ligita; Gaidelys, Vaidas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Snieska, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vytautas.snieska@ktu.lt; deimante.venclauskiene@ktu.lt; ligita.vasiliauskiene@ktu.lt; vaidas.gaidelys@ktu.lt,"Snieska, Vytautas/S-2053-2017","Snieska, Vytautas/0000-0001-8777-273X",,,,,32,2,3,1,38,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The WTO is assumed as an arbitrator for the exchange in an oligopolistic industry and sets tariff rules according to the SOT principles: a firm's cost is private information both for the WTO and the foreign rivalries. Subsequent to our analysis of several cases we find that a firm may misreport to the WTO for more production revenue and the government may collude with a firm for higher welfare. It is shown that the misreporting and collusion incentives are related to the WTO tariff rule, the misreported cost and market size. Furthermore, a strategy proof tariff rule has been designed in which firms can never make his revenue better off by misreporting production cost. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It demonstrates a two-way relationship between the economy and gender relations, and emphasises the macro level. It demonstrates that inequality in gender relations can have a negative effect on economic policy and economic outcomes. This integrated understanding of gender in economics, developed in feminist economics, is not possible in neoclassical economics because that treats gender, like any social structure, as exogenous, often as a given constraint on individual choices, or at most as a sex-disaggregated impact variable. Heterodox economics, in particular when applying a contextual view of the economy as embedded in social, cultural and political structures, allows for an endogenous analysis of gender. This chapter shows, with examples from empirical research, how this may be done in a systematic way, by linking feminist economic insights with various key heterodox concepts.","[van Staveren, Irene] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,,,,"van Staveren, Irene/0000-0001-7548-6795",,,,,84,5,5,0,10,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-0-23030-768-1,INT PAP POLIT ECON,,,2011,,,,,,,116,153,,,,,,38,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BWV66,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295079400004,0

By analogy, it might be supposed that; other spatial costs, such as distribution costs for utility services or access costs to schools and hospitals, will have the same characteristic. However, the basic commuting result derives from an urban model in which population density is uniform out to the city boundary and commuters travel individually and radially to the central business district. It is more realistic to suppose that population density declines away from the centre, as in the standard monocentric urban model and that there are likely to be scale economies in both commuting (e.g. from use of buses or metros) and distribution (e.g. larger diameter water mains). The aim of this paper is to explore the implications of such factors for spatial costs, using data on water distribution costs for 35 urban districts in the supply area of one of the water companies in England & Wales. Distribution cost elasticities are quantified for two contrasting urban development scenarios, confirming that in the case of Suburbanization average distribution costs are increasing in city size, as generally assumed; however, in the case of Densification these costs are decreasing in city size. The interaction with water production costs is also considered, showing that, in the case of Densification, scale economies in production are reinforced by density economies in distribution, whereas in the case of Suburbanisation they are offset to a greater or lesser extent by diseconomies in distribution, i.e. higher spatial costs. A final section relates these findings to the literature on commuting costs, urban agglomeration and sprawl. It is concluded that high density settlement has the potential to reduce average costs in distribution (including commuting) as well as production, so that both favour agglomeration. Accordingly, urban modelers should be cautious about assuming that commuting (and other spatial costs) are always increasing in city size.","London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Wenban-Smith, HB (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.",wenban@global-net.co.uk,"Silva, Lígia/M-8035-2013","Silva, Lígia/0000-0002-0199-8664",,,,,12,1,1,0,15,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

J,"West, J",,,,"West, John",,,THE OECD AND ASIA: WORLDS APART IN TODAY'S GLOBALIZATION?,REVISTA DE ECONOMIA MUNDIAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,OECD; Asia; International Organisations; International Relations; International Political Economy,,"When the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was created half a century ago in 1961, its members accounted for the lion's share of the world economy and that remained the case for almost three decades. Major international developments occurred from the late 1980s like the end of the Cold War; and the return of stability, open markets and democracy to Latin America. But the OECD countries' global economic predominance was only really challenged by the rise of East Asia through its export-oriented growth strategies. The OECD responded to all these developments by inviting countries to join the Organisation and participate in outreach activities. But what is striking in this opening of the OECD membership is the lack of a visible presence of Asia and a growing eurocentricity. The OECD's membership has grown by 10 countries (to 34) over the past 17 years, but only one of these new members (Korea) comes from Asia. Based on current trends, the OECD seems condemned to represent an ever declining share of the world economy. As the OECD enters its second half century, it is very much at a crossroads. This paper argues that for the OECD to be a more effective and legitimate player in global governance, it needs to make a major and immediate effort to recruit large Asian countries as members, even if it means adopting a more flexible approach to membership criteria and adapting the organisation. While Asia's leading economies would have much to gain from joining the OECD and accepting and committing to the Organisation's policy standards, the OECD has to recognize that the global financial crisis has brought the Western brand (which the OECD represents) into serious disrepute. This underlines the argument for greater flexibility with respect to membership criteria. As major beneficiaries of globalization, Asia's leading economies arguably have a responsibility to adopt more of the OECD's values-based culture in terms of good governance and transparency. Just as importantly Asia can contribute to this organizational culture which has always evolved and needs to evolve further. This would ultimately be beneficial to them and the global economy, and they would thereby become more responsible stakeholders in the global system.",,,,john-mangwest@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,7,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

The results are consistent with previous findings in the literature. The divorced and the widowed are much less happy than married people and the same thing happens with the unemployed with respect to the employed. Happiness increases with income (at a decreasing rate) and is positively related with good health. Positive expectations tend to make people happier, as well as optimism and economic progress. With respect to social capital, we find that those who say they trust others, in general, are significantly happier than those with less trust. Similar positive effects are shown with respect to the trust in some institutions. In particular, trust in large firms seems to increase individuals' happiness substantially. Personal ethics also show some effects. Specifically, those who reject dishonest behaviour, such as tax evasion or bribery, appear to be happier than others.","[Ahn, Namkee] Univ Cantabria, Cantabria, Spain; [Mochon, Francisco] UNED, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Ahn, N (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Cantabria, Spain.",,,,,,,,33,8,8,0,17,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

I show that using a purchasing power parity adjusted measure yields an economically much larger negative relationship between per capita GDP growth and natural resource dependence than what has been suggested by the nominal measure. Consistent with the rent-seeking literature, I show that the resource curse is a symptom of societies characterized by high levels of corruption and sluggish checks and balances on political decision-making.

The empirical application uses daily polling data from the 2004 presidential primary. We find that Kerry benefited from surprising wins in early states and took votes away from Dean. Owing to these momentum effects, early voters had up to five times the influence of late voters in the selection of candidates, and this helps to explain the distribution of advertising expenditures.

Concomitantly, economic life changed qualitatively and quantitatively. Self-sufficient farming gradually gave way to market relationships and there was substantial economic growth. This analysis of institutional changes in Athens emphasizes the importance of credible commitments from those in power to other groups in society. It is furthermore likely that the increasing reliance on market relationships gradually transformed individual behaviour and individual beliefs, leading to changes in the formal and informal rules in society. Taxation played an important role: it pushed people into market relationships, illustrated the need for credible commitments, and helps to explain why foreigners were so prominent in trade in ancient Athens.","Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Lyttkens, CH (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",carl_hampus.lyttkens@nek.lu.se,,"Lyttkens, Carl Hampus/0000-0002-6286-124X",,,,,79,10,12,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Regression models have been used to investigate the factors that at the level of individuals, are related to variations in the provision of help by immigrants to newcomers. There is an initial period characterized by frequent acts of mutual aid within the network; but the longer immigrants stay in the host society, the less helpful they are to newcomers, even when relations are maintained between the two.

With formal institutions being equalized, a typical explanation is that the partition of Germany created differences in economic values and attitudes that continue to feed differences in economic performance. Empirical work using values surveys to investigate the extent to which values differ between East and West has thus far produced mixed findings. We use individual-level panel data to assess East and West German value preferences by investigating how individuals from each group differentially transform situational factors into happiness. This novel method of assessing value differences shows that preferences indeed vary between East and West Germans. However, this variation is not in line with the differences associated with the gap in economic performance: if anything, Easterners appear to entertain values more conducive to economic growth. This suggests that the belief that economic differences between Eastern and Western Germany are a result of a Communist cultural legacy may be largely a myth. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis clearly states that pronounced differences between the two parts of Germany exist only in terms of the magnitude, but not in the composition of gross job gains and losses. This finding holds independently of the observed sector or size class of plants. Considering interaction effects between all variables, this first econometric analysis on gross job flows for Germany shows that job creation and destruction can be explained to a large part by plant characteristics. The pattern found in descriptive studies for other countries that job reallocation rates diminish with firm size is similarly true for Germany. The creation of jobs attenuates with plant age, while regional characteristics are only important for job destruction.","[Fuchs, Michaela] IAB Reg Saxony Anhalt Thuringia, Inst Employment Res IAB, D-06110 Halle, Germany; [Weyh, Antje] IAB Reg Saxony, Inst Employment Res IAB, D-09114 Chemnitz, Germany",,"Fuchs, M (通讯作者)，IAB Reg Saxony Anhalt Thuringia, Inst Employment Res IAB, Frau von Selmnitz Str 6, D-06110 Halle, Germany.",michaela.fuchs@iab.de; antje.weyh@iab.de,,,,,,,33,9,9,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2010,37.0,4,,,,,425,444,,10.1007/s10663-009-9121-8,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V25OI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208486900004,0

The technique is based on the general Bayesian approach with posterior computations performed by Gibbs sampling. Simulations from the Markov chain, whose stationary distribution converges to the posterior distribution, enable exact finite sample inferences of model parameters. The exact inferences can easily be extended to latent state variables and any nonlinear transformation of state variables and parameters, facilitating practical credit risk applications. In addition, the comparison of alternative models can be based on deviance information criterion (DIC) which is straightforwardly obtained from the MCMC output. The method is implemented on the basic structural credit risk model with pure microstructure noises and some more general specifications using daily equity data from US and emerging markets. We find empirical evidence that microstructure noises are positively correlated with the firm values in emerging markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The findings suggest mixed support for the household approach. The majority of household characteristics are significant, but the significance of household income variables is mixed.

In doing so, we use a logistic smooth transition vector autoregression (VAR), as detailed in Terasvirta and Anderson (1992) and Weise (1999), and make a distinction between two oil price volatility regimes (high and low), using the realized oil price volatility as a switching variable. We isolate the effects of oil price and monetary policy shocks and their asymmetry on output growth and, following Koop et al. (1996) and Weise (1999), we employ simulation methods to calculate Generalized Impulse Response Functions (GIRFs) to trace the effects of independent shocks on the conditional means of the variables. Our results suggest that in addition to the price of oil, oil price volatility has an impact on macroeconomic activity and that monetary policy is not only reinforcing the effects of oil price shocks on output, it is also contributing to the asymmetric response of output to oil price shocks.

They are developed for numerous identification settings, including but not limited to cases where one can bound either the relevant cumulative distribution function or the relevant probability measure. Applications include missing data, interval data, short versus long regressions, contaminated data, and certain forms of sensitivity analysis. The application to missing data is worked out in some detail, including closed-formworst-case bounds on some parameters as well as improved bounds that rely on nonparametric restrictions on selection effects. A brief empirical application to bounds on inequality measures is provided. The bounds are very easy to compute.

Agents have moral work values. Individuals' self-esteem and social consideration of others are endogenously determined comparing behaviors to moral standards. Attitudes toward redistribution depend on self-interest and social preferences. We characterize the politico-economic equilibria in which sentiments, labor supply and redistribution are determined simultaneously. The equilibria feature different degrees of social cohesion and redistribution depending on pre-tax income inequality. In clustered equilibria the poor are held partly responsible for their low income since they work less than the moral standard and hence redistribution is low.

Traders have locally rational expectations, face a cash-in-advance constraint, and continuously adjust their short-run dominant strategy in a monetary strategic market game involving a double-auction with limit-price orders. Money has a positive value except on optimal rest-points where it becomes a veil and trade vanishes. Typically, there is a piecewise globally unique trade-and-price curve both in real and in nominal variables. Money is not neutral, either in the short-run or long-run and a localized version of the quantity theory of money holds in the short-run. An optimal money growth rate is derived, which enables monetary trade curves to converge towards Pareto optimal rest-points. Below this growth rate, the economy enters a (sub- optimal) liquidity trap where monetary policy is ineffective; above this threshold inflation rises. Finally, market liquidity, measured through the speed of real trades, can be linked to gains-to-trade, households' expectations, and the quantity of circulating money.","[Giraud, Gael] Paris Sch Econ, CNRS, CERAS, Paris, France; [Tsomocos, Dimitrios P.] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch Univ, London, England; [Tsomocos, Dimitrios P.] Financial Markets Grp, LSE, London, England",Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Giraud, G (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, CNRS, CERAS, Paris, France.",ggiraud@parisschoolofeconomics.eu; dimitrios.tsomocos@said-business-school.oxford.ac.uk,,,,,,,43,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

This paper develops a model linking population growth to increasing productivity driven by random innovation and diffusion. People are endowed with a set of skills obtained from their parents or neighbours, but those skills are imperfectly applied during their lifetimes. The resulting variation in productivity leads to a distribution of income and to a process of diffusion whereby high-income activities spread at the expense of low-income activities. An analytic formula is derived for the steady-state distribution of income. The model predicts that the rate of growth of population approaches an asymptotic limit, whereupon there are no scale effects. The model also predicts that if the rate of diffusion of knowledge is increased, the growth rate will increase.","Univ Ontario, Inst Technol, Oshawa, ON L1H 7K4, Canada",Ontario Tech University,"Staley, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ontario, Inst Technol, 2000 Simcoe St N, Oshawa, ON L1H 7K4, Canada.",staleymd@gmail.com,"Alves, Luciano/G-3655-2011",,,,,,32,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The authors address this problem by means of an agent-based model and simulator, called Eurace, which is characterized by a complete set of interrelated markets and different types of interacting agents, modeled according to a rigorous balance-sheet approach. The dynamics of credit money is endogenous and depends on the supply of credit from the banking system, which is constrained by its equity base, and the demand of credit from firms in order to finance their production activity. Alternative dynamic paths for credit money have been produced by setting different firms' dividend policies. Results point out the strict dependence of output and prices dynamics on monetary aggregates, and show the emergence of endogenous business cycles which are mainly due to the interplay between the real economic activity and its financing through the credit market. In particular, the amplitude of the business cycles strongly rises when the fraction of earnings paid out by firms as dividends is higher, that is when firms are more constrained to borrow credit money to fund their activity. This interesting evidence can be explained by the fact that the level of firms leverage, defined as the debt-equity ratio, can be considered ad a proxy of the likelihood of bankruptcy, an event which causes mass layoffs and supply decrease.","[Cincotti, Silvano] Univ Genoa, DIBE CINEF, I-16145 Genoa, Italy; [Raberto, Marco] Reykjavik Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Teglio, Andrea] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",University of Genoa; Reykjavik University; Universitat Jaume I,"Cincotti, S (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, DIBE CINEF, Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145 Genoa, Italy.",silvano.cincotti@unige.it; raberto@ru.is; teglio@eco.uji.es,"Teglio, Andrea/AAI-9500-2021; Cincotti, Silvano/A-4680-2016; Raberto, Marco/F-7990-2012",,,,,,35,83,87,1,46,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,SEP 24,2010,4.0,,,,,,,,201026,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2010-26,0.0,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865AZ,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298284300001,0

Our framework relies on easily verified assumptions on the primitives of the game, and relies on the theory of supermodular games. The underlying natural assumptions are satisfied in a number of two-stage models with an investment decision preceding product market competition.

On real data from an anonymous sickness fund it confirms that predictive performance of PCGs models is consistently better than the performance of the demographic model that is currently used.

We use this relationship to examine whether those Asian countries that are more open to trade and enjoy less trade barriers have also higher degree of capital mobility. Cluster analysis is used to classify the countries into different groups according to the share of trade in their gross domestic products and their average tariff rates. The goal is to place the countries that are similar to each other in terms of their trade policy in one group. We apply the Generalized Least Square (GLS) technique to a set of balanced panel error correction models to estimate the short- and long-run relationship between saving and investment. The estimation results indicate that there exist long-run equilibrium relationships between domestic saving and investment in all groups regardless of their degree of trade openness. Moreover, contrary to Amirkhalkhali and Dar (2007) for the case of OECD, we find out that more openness in terms of trade policy is associated with higher degree of capital mobility for the case of Asian countries. One policy implication of this result for the Asian economies is that trade openness can be used as a strategy to attract capital from abroad. Our findings also confirm the prediction of new open economy macroeconomic models regarding the short- and long-run behaviour of current account. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

Market reactions took place quickly and simultaneously - there was no time for slow restructuring, so that liquidity needs were higher than usual.","[Karilaid, Ivo; Talpsepp, Tonn] Tallinn Univ Technol, TSEBA, EE-11712 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Karilaid, I (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, TSEBA, Akad Tee 3, EE-11712 Tallinn, Estonia.",ivo.karilaid@tseba.ttu.ee; tonn.talpsepp@ttu.ee,"Talpsepp, Tonn/I-3819-2018","Talpsepp, Tonn/0000-0002-9287-6186",,,,,21,2,2,0,8,EUROBALTIC CENTRES EXCELLENCE,RIGA,"RAINA BLVD 19, RIGA, LV-1586, LATVIA",1406-099X,,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

By applying non-parametric methods, and thus taking into account non-linear effects of initial income and human capital on economic growth, we explore the FDI effect on growth in much greater detail than previous studies. Our findings not only confirm the non-linear effect of human capital in the presence of FDI inflows but also suggest that FDI inflows are growth enhancing in the middle-income countries while there is a 'two-regime' FDI effect for high-income countries. This new finding appears to be independent of OECD country membership. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To identify the causes and possible types of discrimination behind this low level of female representation is a key issue, because they will have different economic implications. Some signs of discrimination have been found when the proportion of women on the board is estimated with count data models. The proportion of women is higher when there are more available positions representing shareholders. There are clubby companies in which the homogeneity of the board prevails.

In addition, there exists considerable transitorily poor and rich in positional mobility.

Putting its own energy saving into perspective,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy saving; Renewable energy; Post-Kyoto climate negotiations; Clean development mechanism; China; USA,CAP,"China had been the world's second largest carbon emitter for years. However, recent studies show that China had overtaken the U.S. as the world's largest emitter in 2007. This has put China in the spotlight, just at a time when the world community starts negotiating a post-Kyoto climate regime under the Bali roadmap. China seems to have become such a Christmas tree on which everybody could hang his/her complaints. This paper first discusses whether such criticism is fair by examining China's own efforts towards energy saving, the widespread use of renewable energy and participation in a clean development mechanism. Next, the paper puts carbon reductions of China's unilateral actions into perspective by examining whether the estimated greenhouse gas emission reduction from meeting the country's national energy saving goal is achieved from China's unilateral actions or mainly with support from the clean development mechanism projects. Then the paper discusses how far developing country commitments can go in an immediate post-2012 climate regime, thus pointing out the direction and focus of future international climate negotiations. Finally, emphasizing that China needs to act as a large and responsible developing country, take due responsibilities and set a good example for the majority of developing countries, the paper articulates what can be expected from China to illustrate that China can be a good partner in combating global climate change.

Assuming no entry in an original equipment manufacturing (OEM) market, we show that the foreign outsourcer will choose an original design manufacturing (ODM) contract only if the subcontractor is good enough at product design. However, the product quality with the ODM contract is not necessarily higher than that with the OEM contract. When the subcontracting market becomes perfectly competitive, the outsourcer will always choose an OEM contract. In a two-period model with learning and entry effects, the foreign outsourcer chooses between different modes of manufacturing contracts. We demonstrate that a laissez-faire policy on research and development (R&D) activity may be optimal even if the subcontracting firm can only obtain an OEM contract. In the case where the OEM market becomes perfectly competitive in the second period, we predict that a positive R&D subsidy in the first period can help the domestic subcontractor obtain OEM-ODM contracts and, as a result, national welfare rises.","[Chen, Fang-yueh] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Shen, Tsai-chen] Tatung Inst Commerce & Technol, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University,"Chen, FY (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, 168 Univ Rd, Chiayi, Taiwan.",bmafyc@ccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Results suggest that contagion exists, and is equally felt, in most stock markets and that investors anticipated a spreading of the financial crisis to the indices of industrial sectors, long before such dissemination was observable in the real economy.","[Vieira, Isabel] Univ Evora, CEFAGE UE, P-7000803 Evora, Portugal; [Horta, Paulo] Comissao Mercado Valores Mobiliarios, P-1056801 Lisbon, Portugal; [Mendes, Carlos] Univ Nova Lisboa, UNINOVA DEE, P-2825114 Monte De Caparica, Portugal",University of Evora; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Vieira, I (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, CEFAGE UE, Largo Colegiais 2, P-7000803 Evora, Portugal.",impvv@uevora.pt,"Vieira, Isabel Maria Pereira Viegas/C-6534-2009","Vieira, Isabel Maria Pereira Viegas/0000-0002-2983-7555",,,,,36,38,46,0,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

As a company's competency Increases, the company prefers more controllable distribution methods However, the Korean online game industry consistently reports changes to less controllable distribution methods after the initial market entry even without major changes to competency or the target market. Despite this trend, most studies on global distribution strategies have focused on the initial entry mode of global distribution and the choice of foreign target markets. Scholars have placed less attention on the dynamics of global distribution strategies after the initial market entry. This paper investigates the key factors behind changes in decisions about global distribution in the Korean online game industry after initial market entry. It follows the premise that product-level variables like product quality, technology uncertainties in development, and market uncertainties may affect global distribution strategies. To effectively reflect the categorical characteristics of global distribution strategies, we used ordered logit regression, and additionally used multinomial logistic regression. This study is based on 252 cases of foreign market distribution by major Korean publishers from 1997 to 2009. The regression result shows that the quality of products, technology uncertainties, and market uncertainties are significant in global distribution decisions. Products with high uncertainties in technology and markets prefer less controllable distribution methods, whereas high quality products prefer more controllable ones. The reputation of the development team does not directly affect the entry mode decision, but is controlled by market uncertainties Traditional decision factors like firm experience, market size, and IP's level of protection are also supported and controlled in our study.","[Park, Young-Eun; Yoo, Chang-Sok; Rhee, Dong-Kee] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 151, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Rhee, DK (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 151, South Korea.",,"Park, Young-Eun/T-8362-2018","Park, Young-Eun/0000-0002-3057-7930",,,,,82,1,1,0,16,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We show that incorrect social memory is a key ingredient in creating and perpetuating destructive conflicts. We analyze an infinite-horizon model in which two countries face off each period in a game of conflict characterized by the possibility of mutually destructive all out war that yields catastrophic consequences for both sides. Each country is inhabited by a dynastic sequence of individuals. Each individual cares about future individuals in the same country, and can communicate with the next generation of their countrymen using private messages. Social memory is based on these messages, and on physical evidence a sequence of imperfectly informative public signals of past behavior. We find that if the future is sufficiently important for all individuals, then regardless of the precision of physical evidence from the past there is an equilibrium in which the two countries engage in all out war with arbitrarily high frequency, an outcome that cannot arise in the standard repeated game. In our construction, each new generation repeats the mistakes of its predecessors, leading to an endless cycle of destructive behavior. Surprisingly, we find that degrading the quality of information that individuals have about current decisions may improve social memory. This in turn ensures that arbitrarily frequent all out wars cannot occur. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The patterns in the data are consistent with cartel distortions persisting in the post-cartel period, possibly due to the presence of long-term contracts. An implication is that, in addition to terminating involvement in cartel activity, some social benefit may accrue from requiring firms seeking leniency to mitigate the harm caused by cartel actions.

The analysis compares macroeconomic outcomes in a non-cooperative setting, where players may move sequentially or simultaneously, and in a regime of cooperation between the government and wage-setters. The cooperative regime captures a climate of accord among social parties that is finalised at common macroeconomic targets in the tradition of corporatism, as in the recent experience of social pacts in many European countries. The paper makes two main contributions. First, it shows that macroeconomic outcomes are suboptimal in the non-cooperative regime and may deliver extreme (undesirable) results even when all players share common ideal targets for output and inflation. All players would be better off with a less extreme value for output or inflation, yet they fail to reach a more advantageous allocation as long as there is an inherent conflict among their further objectives. Moreover, the result is robust to a change in the degree of central bank's conservatism. Second, I find that cooperation between the government and the monopoly union towards common ideal targets for inflation, output and taxes enhances social welfare even in the absence of explicit coordination with the central bank.","Univ Roma Tre, DIPES, I-00145 Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Cavallari, L (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, DIPES, Via Chiabrera 199, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",cavallar@uniroma3.it,"Cavallari, Lilia/A-6266-2012","Cavallari, Lilia/0000-0003-1351-3561",,,,,26,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,JUL,2010,37.0,3,,,,,291,309,,10.1007/s10663-009-9109-4,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V25OH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208486800004,0

As a result, several problems and research opportunities arose for those studying the natural gas supply chain, particularly the marketing operations. Consequently, various studies have been undertaken about the econometrics of natural gas. Several models have been developed and used for different purposes, from descriptive analysis to practical applications such as price and consumption forecasting. In this work, we address the problem of finding a pooled regression formula relating the monthly figures of price and consumption volumes for each state of the United States during the last twenty years. The model thus obtained is used as the basis for the development of two methods aimed at classifying the states into groups sharing a similar price/consumption relationship: a dendrogram application, and an heuristic algorithm. The details and further applications of these grouping techniques are discussed, along with the ultimate purpose of using this pooled regression model to validate data employed in the stochastic optimization problem studied by the authors.

This paper studies a class of problems of decision under uncertainty in which an efficiency argument for collective choice emerges from the mathematics of aggregating individual payoffs. Consider decision making when each member of a population has the same objective function, which depends on an unknown state of nature. If agents knew the state of nature, they would make the same decision. However, they may have different beliefs or may use different decision criteria to cope with their incomplete knowledge. Hence, they may choose different actions even though they share the same objective. Let the set of feasible actions be convex and the objective function be concave in actions, for all states of nature. Then Jensen's inequality implies that consensus choice of the mean privately chosen action yields a larger mean payoff than does individualistic decision making, in all states of nature. If payoffs are transferable, the mean payoff from consensus choice may be allocated to Pareto dominate individualistic decision making. I develop these ideas. I also use Jensen's inequality to show that a planner with the power to assign actions to the members of the population should not diversify. Finally, I give a version of the collective-choice result that holds with consensus choice of the median rather than mean action.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",cfmanski@northwestern.edu,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0911181] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,31,5,6,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

This piece of research is our modest contribution in the same direction. We explore the possibility of a simultaneous equilibrium of the mentioned three targets of national economic policy. Our empirical analysis show that a triangular equilibrium (what we call 'golden triangle') exists and that the governments can follow a policy of close monitoring the behaviour of the three variables and support the 'optimum' rate through an active intervention. We have looked for the quantitative relations that exist between the key economic variables and economic policy goals. It is our contention that a macroeconomic policy mechanism based on the golden triangle rule can help the governments to promote a long-term equilibrium growth and avoid possible close encounters with business cycles.

Using rich firm-level data and service trade data, our empirical results show that real appreciations of the Canadian dollar reduce firm probability of survival, sales, and profitability while depreciations have the opposite effect. Overall, our findings suggest a significant exchange rate effect on service firms that is qualitatively similar to that found for manufacturing firms. However, the magnitude of the exchange rate effects is quite different for manufacturing and service firms. The impact of the exchange rate on profits is larger for manufacturing firms; the impact on survival is larger among service sector firms; and the impact on sales is of similar magnitude.","[Fung, Loretta] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Baggs, Jen] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Beaulieu, Eugene] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",National Tsing Hua University; University of Victoria; University of Calgary,"Fung, L (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, 101 Sec 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",phfung@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,26,7,7,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Each stage is associated with specific skills. This paper examines whether Schumpeter's assertion was correct, i.e. whether the invention and innovation stages should be undertaken by different agents. In addition, we examine whether there is a rationale for the Schumpeterian entrepreneur to include the inventor in the commercialization process. Combining the abilities of the entrepreneur and the inventor may serve to facilitate customer adaptation, strengthen knowledge transfers and reduce uncertainty, thereby expanding market opportunities. Based on a unique database covering Swedish patents granted to individuals and small firms, the empirical analysis shows that profitability increases by 22 percentage points when inventions are commercialized by the entrepreneur instead of by inventors. However, active involvement of the inventor is shown to have a significantly positive impact on profitability, irrespective of commercialization mode.","[Braunerhjelm, Pontus] Royal Sch Technol, Leif Lundblads Chair Int Business & Entrepreneurs, Dept Transport & Econ, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Svensson, Roger] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Braunerhjelm, P (通讯作者)，Royal Sch Technol, Leif Lundblads Chair Int Business & Entrepreneurs, Dept Transport & Econ, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",pontusb@infra.kth.se; roger.svensson@ifn.se,,"Svensson, Roger/0000-0003-3377-8460; braunerhjelm, pontus/0000-0003-0218-7924",,,,,64,30,34,0,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Much of the evidence presented in support of this view consists of demonstrating that the population share in an arbitrarily chosen middle income class has fallen. However, such evidence can be criticized as being range-specific-depending on the particular cutoffs selected. In this paper we propose a range-free approach to measuring the middle class and polarization, based on partial orderings. The approach yields two polarization curves which, like the Lorenz curve in inequality analysis, signal unambiguous increases in polarization. It also leads to an intuitive new index of polarization that is shown to be closely related to the Gini coefficient. We apply the new methodology to income and earnings data from the U.S. and Canada, and find that polarization is on the rise in the U.S. but is stable or declining in Canada. A cross-country comparison reveals the U.S. to be unambiguously more polarized than Canada.","[Foster, James E.] George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Foster, James E.] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Foster, James E.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Dept Int Dev, Oxford Poverty & Human Dev Initiat, Oxford OX1 3TB, England; [Wolfson, Michael C.] STAT Canada, Anal & Dev, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada",George Washington University; George Washington University; University of Oxford; Statistics Canada,"Foster, JE (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",fosterje@gwu.edu; wolfson@statcan.gc.ca,,,,,,,37,141,164,2,37,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

For this purpose, we calculate for each state an average effective consumption tax rate, which covers both sales and excise taxes. In addition, we pay attention to dynamics by including lagged dependent variables in the tax reaction function. We find overwhelming evidence for strategic interaction among state governments, but only partial support for the effect of spatial characteristics on tax setting. Tax competition seems to have lessened in the 1990s compared to the early 1980s.","[Ligthart, Jenny E.] Tilburg Univ, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Ligthart, Jenny E.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Ligthart, Jenny E.] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Vrijburg, Hendrik] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; University of Groningen; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Ligthart, JE (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, CentER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",j.ligthart@uvt.nl,"Jacobs, Jan/GRX-7316-2022; Ligthart, Jenny E/A-2287-2009","Jacobs, Jan/0000-0002-7994-5175",,,,,38,28,32,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We contrast these two types of policies and discuss policy changes within these policy types by presenting results from simulations, using microsimulation models developed for Australia and Norway. Labor supply effects and distributional effects are discussed for the hypothetical policy changes of replacing the means-tested family payments of Australia by the Norwegian universal child benefit schedule and vice versa, and of reducing the childcare fees in both countries. The analysis highlights that the case for policy changes is restricted by the economic environment and the role of family policy in the two countries. Whereas there is considerable potential for increased labor supply of Australian mothers, it may have detrimental distributional effects and is likely to be costly. In Norway, mothers already have high labor supply and any adverse distributional effects of further labor supply incentives occur in an economy with low initial income dispersion. However, expenditure on family support is already high and the question is whether this should be further extended.","[Kalb, Guyonne] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Thoresen, Thor O.] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway",University of Melbourne; Statistics Norway,"Kalb, G (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",g.kalb@unimelb.edu.au; thor.olav.thoresen@ssb.no,"Kalb, Guyonne/H-7383-2015","Kalb, Guyonne/0000-0001-6582-8608",,,,,67,10,10,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The method improves upon the current practice used in the construction of the Penn World Tables (PWT), and similar tables produced by the World Bank which tend to be anchored on a selected benchmark. The econometric formulation is based on a regression model for the national price levels where the disturbances are assumed to be heteroskedastic and spatially correlated across countries. The regression model along with data on country specific price movements are combined using a state-space formulation and optimum predictions of PPPs are obtained. As a property of the method presented in the paper, we show that the resulting PPP predictions are weighted averages of extrapolations of PPPs from different benchmarks-thus the method provides a formal approach which has a simple intuitive interpretation. The smoothed PPP predictions (and standard errors) obtained through the state-space are produced for both ICP-participating and non-participating countries and non-benchmark years. A complete tableau of PPPs for 141 countries spanning the period 1970 to 2005 is compiled using the method. Results for some selected countries are presented and the new series are compared and contrasted with the currently available PWT series. Extrapolated series for the remaining countries are available from the authors upon request.","[Rao, D. S.

Without prudence, optimal oil extraction is governed by the Hotelling rule and optimal budgetary policies by the tax and consumption smoothing principle. Volatile oil demand brings forward oil extraction and induces a bigger government surplus. With prudence, the government depletes oil reserves even more aggressively and engages in additional precautionary saving financed by postponing spending and bringing taxes forward, especially if it has substantial monopoly power on the oil market, gives high priority to the public spending target, is very prudent, and future oil demand has high variance. Uncertain economic prospects induce even higher precautionary saving and, if non-oil revenue shocks and oil revenue shocks are positively correlated, even more aggressive oil extraction. In contrast, prudent governments deliberately underestimate oil reserves which induce less aggressive oil depletion and less government saving, but less so if uncertainty about reserves and oil demand are positively correlated.

I used macroeconomic and cross-regional data in China to estimate the effect of technology development on job creation and found that technology innovation did have a positive impact on employment in the eastern region of China.

Taking these imperfections seriously, we analyze how credit frictions affect the distributive impact of trade liberalizations. We find that free trade significantly widens income differences among firm owners in LDCs: While wealthy entrepreneurs are better off, relatively poor business people lose. Intuitively, with integrated markets, profit margins shrink which makes access to credit particularly difficult for the least-affluent agents. Richer entrepreneurs, by contrast, win because they can take advantage of new export opportunities. Our findings resonate well with a number of empirical regularities, in particular with the observation that some liberalizing LDCs have observed a surge in top-income shares. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

It suggests that decision makers strictly prefer betting on an event of measure zero over betting on a proper subset of that event. Within the realm of the revealed-preference methodology and limited verifiability, Arrow's difficulty is a red herring: the problem he poses has its origin in the technical aspects of Savage's model and not in its substantive aspect.

The results suggest that conditional demand elasticities for production workers are positively associated with increased exposure to offshoring both in the short-run and in the long-run. This relationship holds both for the unbalanced panel of plants and, for plants which continue their operations throughout the sample period. Controlling for skill biased technical change does not alter the magnitude or the significance of the estimated positive relationship between offshoring and labor demand elasticities.

On the macroeconomic side, the Great Moderation encouraged an overly optimistic assessment of risk. Combined with low interest rates, reflecting both loose monetary policy and relatively high Asian savings rates, that encouraged a build-up of excessive leverage in the banking system. On the microeconomic side, distorted incentives led to a concentration and mispricing of risk. Informational complexities associated with new financial assets and the interconnectedness of financial institutions then resulted in the closure of funding markets and a flight to safety when loan defaults rose unexpectedly. The episode indicates the need to focus on agency and information problems between banks and their funders in addition to those between the banks and their borrowers. It also suggests that the process of financial intermediation should play a more prominent role in macroeconomic models.

We show that this conclusion depends critically on the assumption that the issue being voted on is exogenous, that is, independent of the voting rule used. We depart from the existing literature by endogenizing the proposal that is put to a vote, and establish that under many circumstances unanimity rule makes voters better off. Moreover, in some cases unanimity rule also makes the proposer better off, even when he has diametrically opposing preferences. In this case, unanimity is the Pareto dominant voting rule. Voters prefer unanimity rule because it induces the proposing individual to make a more attractive proposal. The proposing individual prefers unanimity rule because the acceptance probabilities for moderate proposals are higher.

In our framework, a worker's productivity is either assigned by nature at birth, or determined by an unobservable initial action of the worker that has persistent effects over time. We provide a characterization of the optimal dynamic compensation scheme that attracts only high productivity workers: consumption-regardless of time period-is ranked according to likelihood ratios of output histories, and the inverse of the marginal utility of consumption satisfies the martingale property derived in [Rogerson, William P., 1985. Repeated moral hazard. Econometrica 53 (1) 69-76]. However, in the case of i.i.d. output and square root utility we show that, contrary to the features of the optimal contract for a repeated moral hazard problem, the level and the variance of consumption are negatively correlated. due to the influence of early luck into future compensation. Moreover, in this example long-term inequality is lower under persistent private information. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This article studies auction design when information acquisition costs are private information of bidders. We show that this problem can be resolved by sufficient dispersion in these costs. First, we find that a simple second-price auction with no entry fee and a reserve price equal to the seller's valuation is ex ante efficient, while a revenue-maximizing auction involves personalized entry fees, which are determined by the hazard rates of their information acquisition cost distribution. Second, we show that sufficient dispersion in the information acquisition costs (more dispersion than a particular uniform distribution by the Bickel-Lehman dispersive order) can coordinate bidders and implement uniquely the desirable entry. The dispersion in information acquisition costs is also necessary for this unique implementation result.

Conflict between the two nations is best understood in a multivariate framework where variables such as economic performance, integration with rest of the world, bilateral trade, military expenditure, democracy orientation and population are simultaneously considered. Our empirical investigation based on time series econometrics from 1950 to 2005 suggests that reduced bilateral trade, greater military expenditure, less development expenditure, lower levels of democracy, lower growth rates and less general trade openness are all conflict enhancing. Globalization, or a greater openness to international trade with the rest of the world, is the most significant driver of a liberal peace, rather than a common democratic orientation.","[Mamoon, Dawood; Murshed, S.

This has been associated with a period of around two decades from the early 1980s to the early 2000s where the economics of public policy has bent to political windsand has fed arguments for government to get out of the way and leave everything to the markets, to self-interest and to self-regulation. This has manifested itself via the choice of models (those which imply, often directly from assumptions, passive government), patterns of teaching (the marginalisation of public economies in imperfect economics) and compartmentalisation. Examples in climate change where this amnesia has misled include approaches to discounting and the failure to make non-marginal change central to analysis. On the other hand, creative application of modern public economics gives interesting results such as the possibility of making both current and future generations better off and of informed discussion complementing economic instruments. There are strong formal analogies between policy on climate change and on behavioural economics. Indeed, there seems to be great potential in the combination of these two fields.

Per capita income, urbanisation and Internet/broadband penetration, as well as regulation, positively affect diffusion across all generations of mobile technologies. However, there are also several remarkable differences in diffusion patterns over generations. Diffusion of first generation technologies boosts the adoption process of second generation networks, but second generation adoption negatively affects adoption of third generation technologies. Second generation technologies are unaffected by the spread of third generation technologies. Competition between firms has been found to be the key determinant of the diffusion speed across all generations, but there are indications that the effect is dissipating in the transition from second to third generation. Second generation markets show a switch in the influence of standards competition, with a positive effect on diffusion in the early phase and a negative effect later on. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The advances that have been made in terms of conceptualising, measuring and analysing poverty in each of these areas are briefly considered. It is shown that the third and final 'meta-dimension'-time and duration-has been neglected until relatively recently. It is argued that time, and, in particular, duration is an important analytical component for understanding the experience of poverty and the processes that create and reduce poverty. The final part of the paper suggests a way of integrating time into a unified framework for understanding poverty, which can deal with the depth, breadth and duration of poverty.

Surprisingly, there is very little work on the welfare consequences of the loss of monetary policy flexibility for these countries. This paper fills this void by providing a framework to evaluate quantitatively the economic costs of joining the EMU. Using a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model with sticky prices we investigate the economic implications of the loss of monetary policy flexibility associated with the EMU for each country. The main contribution of our general equilibrium approach is that we can evaluate the effects of monetary policy in terms of welfare. Our findings suggest that these economies may experience sizable welfare losses as a result of joining the EMU. Results show that the cost associated with the loss of the monetary policy flexibility is higher in the presence of persistent government consumption shocks and small trade shares with the EMU.

In particular. has the renewed geopolitical role of aid coincided with a reduction of aid to the poorest countries or less weight on need in U.S. aid allocation decisions? We start with an analysis of annual U.S. aid budgets from 1955 to 2006. Controlling for domestic political and economic conditions, we find that the War on Terror's effect on the aid budget is significantly larger than is immediately apparent. To explore how the emphasis on need may have changed over time, we use country-level panel data on aid allocations to 119 countries across the same time period. This shows that U.S. aid flows-for the poorest as well as other developing countries-increased with the War on Terror. However, after rising for 35 years, the emphasis placed on need has been failing steadily for core aid recipients during the War on Terror. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The theory of bidding in the presence of such preferences results in a very counterintuitive prediction which is that, in many cases, bidders having preferences for charitable giving does not lead to a substantial revenue advantage for an auctioneer. We test this theory and this prediction with a series of experiments. In one experiment we induce charitable preferences exactly as specified in the model to see if bidders respond to them as predicted. We find that they do. We then conduct a second experiment in which the revenue from the auctions is donated to actual charities to verify the robustness of the prediction when charitable preferences are generated by a more natural source and find again that the theoretical prediction holds: even strong charitable preferences do not result in substantial revenue increases to the auctioneer.","[Isaac, R.

A natural issue to raise in evaluating the projections is an assessment of their accuracy compared to eventual outcomes. A related issue is the determination of the sources of error in the projections that are due to differences between the actual versus realized values of the associated assumptions. One way to do this would be to run the computer-based model from which the projections are derived at the time the projected values are realized, using actual rather than assumed values for model assumptions; and, compare these results to the original projections. For long term forecasts, this approach would require that the model's software and hardware configuration be archived and available for many years, possibly decades, into the future. Such archival creates many practical problems: and, in general, it is not being done. This paper reports on an alternative approach for evaluating the projections. In the alternative approach, the model is run many times for cases in which important assumptions are changed individually and in combinations. A database is assembled from the solutions and a regression analysis is conducted for each important projected variable with the associated assumptions chosen as exogenous variables. When actual data are eventually available, the regression results are then used to estimate the sources of the differences in the projections of the endogenous variables compared to their eventual outcomes. The results presented here are for residential and commercial sector natural gas and electricity consumption. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Recent wireless broadband networks such as 3G LTE and WiMax provide a general-purpose IP platform with over-the-top services at the application layer, which is similar to the design of wired IP platform networks. This paper examines whether wired and wireless access networks are likely to converge on a common architecture, or if not, whether wireless networks are likely to converge on a common wireless architecture. We conclude that the answer to both questions is No. We identify fundamental and persistent differences between wired and wireless networking that will propel wired and wireless access network architectures on divergent evolutionary paths. Whereas we expect wired broadband access networks to continue to evolve toward a common general-purpose platform architecture, we expect wireless networks to remain heterogeneous. The inherent scarcity of radio frequency spectrum emerges as the key reason for this prediction. We examine the implications of divergent evolutionary paths for market structure and regulatory policy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The reduced form results from a dozen OECD economies give support to the model prediction of a pattern of unemployment behaviour in which unemployment moves between high and low equilibria in response to shocks and the model specification is superior in forecasting performance out of sample to alternative models of generalised hysteresis.","[Naraidoo, Ruthira] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Minford, Patrick] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",University of Pretoria; Cardiff University,"Minford, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",ruthira.naraidoo@up.ac.za,"Naraidoo, Ruthira/AAO-6265-2021","Naraidoo, Ruthira/0000-0001-8915-269X; Minford, Anthony Patrick L./0000-0003-2499-935X",,,,,46,4,5,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

We propose a model that is flexible in its formulation and captures the stylized features of power prices in a parsimonious way. The main feature of the model is that it incorporates two different speeds of mean reversion to capture the differences in price behaviour between normal and spiky periods. We derive semi-closed form solutions for European option prices using transform analysis and then examine the properties of the implied volatilities that the model generates. We find that the presence of jumps generates prominent volatility skews which depend on the sign of the mean jump size. We also show that mean reversion reduces the volatility smile as time to maturity increases. In addition, mean reversion induces volatility skews particularly for ITM options, even in the absence of jumps. Finally, jump size volatility and jump intensity mainly affect the kurtosis and thus the curvature of the smile with the former having a more important role in making the volatility smile more pronounced and thus increasing the kurtosis of the underlying price distribution.

Natural experiments and quasi experiments are not in fact experiments. They are rhetorical devices that are often invoked to avoid having to confront real econometric difficulties. Natural, quasi-, and computational experiments, as well as regression discontinuity design, can all, when well applied, be useful, but none are panaceas. The essay by Angrist and Pischke, in its enthusiasm for some real accomplishments in certain subfields of economics, makes overbroad claims for its favored methodologies. What the essay says about macroeconomics is mainly nonsense. Consequently, I devote the central part of my comment to describing the main developments that have helped take some of the con out of macroeconomics. Recent enthusiasm for single-equation, linear, instrumental variables approaches in applied microeconomics has led many in these fields to avoid undertaking research that would require them to think formally and carefully about the central issues of nonexperimental inference - what I see and many see as the core of econometrics. Providing empirically grounded policy advice necessarily involves confronting these difficult central issues.","Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Sims, CA (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",sims@princeton.edu,,,,,,,15,46,51,0,23,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In India and China, labor intensive firms do not locate in large cities. Proximity to inputs has a positive impact on firm location in China. While availability of inputs has a positive impact on firm location in India, the availability of raw materials has a negative impact on firm location in Brazil.

We fill this gap by using a 1989-2001 panel of FDI flows into Iceland to examine the determinants of fixed costs for multinational firms and how these influence aggregate patterns of investment. Our additions to research in the field include usage of several natural-resource variables, and the analysis of data on initial entry of FDI into a developed country. We use the Heckman two-step procedure, which allows us to account for fixed costs and their impact on estimation.

The analysis is based on the 214 most prominent modern visual artists born 1850-1945 and the art clusters of Paris and New York. Auction records of the past 20 years are used to estimate the value of artworks over an artist's career. The overall cluster premium for paintings produced in Paris and New York is found to be 11% and 43%, respectively; paintings made in Paris during the First World War have a premium of 14% while those produced between 1946 and 1975 have a premium of 27%. New York offers premiums for paintings produced there for all periods after the First World War, peaking at 74% between 1946 and 1975. When decomposing this premium, we find that quality rather than quantity of artists in the location is driving the results. It is argued that artists working in a cluster location reach a peak in the age-price profile of their work significantly earlier than artists working elsewhere. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Manufacturers dealing with (exclusive) competing retailers may prefer to leave contracts silent on retail prices, whenever other aspects of the retailers' activity remain nonverifiable. Two effects are at play when moving from retail price maintenance to quantity forcing. First, restricting screening possibilities may increase retailers' rent.

We characterize the optimal tax policy when society consists of individuals who do not differ only in productivity, but also in time preference. We extend Diamond's analysis on nonlinear taxation of savings into the three-type and four-type models. To gain a better understanding of the lifetime redistribution, the problem is also solved numerically. Our results provide a rationale for distortions ( upward and downward) in savings behavior in a simple two-period model where high-skilled and low-skilled individuals have different nonobservable time preferences beyond their earning capacity. If we interpret our model so that instead of private savings there is public provision of pension in the second period, then in the three-type model, we find a nonmonotonic pattern of the replacement rates. The numerical results suggest that retirement consumption is less dispersed than the first-period consumption in a paternalistic case. Paternalistic government policy also increases second-period consumption compared to the welfarist case.","[Tuomala, Matti] Univ Tampere, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland",,,Matti.Tuomala@uta.fi,,"Tenhunen, Sanna/0000-0002-3767-1751",,,,,31,12,13,0,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Within this framework, the country-specific institutions are strongly and positively related to the regional productivity's growth rate. In addition. the geo-institutional proximity increases the spatial dependence of the regional output per worker and raises the speed of convergence.

We estimate the main determinants of housing wealth (as primary, secondary residences as well as investments in real estate). We study the impact of the exposure to real estate risk on stock demand. We find that, besides information and transaction costs and risk aversion, housing wealth is a key determinant of stockownership: households facing real estate risk tend to moderate their investments in stocks.

Although the impact channels of R&D investment are varied and complex. its benefits in terms of the development of human capital, industrial productivity, and basic research are clear. With the rapid growth of the private sector in the Taiwan economy, it is, however, debatable whether the government should continue to use the public financial budget to invest in R&D. By using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate the impact of public R&D investment on the economy in Taiwan, the empirical evidence of the present paper is that public R&D investment gives rise to different short-term and medium-term impacts on real GDP that are mostly felt in the third or fourth years of their implementation among different industries. These impacts then gradually converge back to equilibrium in the long run. Public R&D investment boosts the technology of high-tech industries and increases exports, but it also crowds out the output of primary industries. Although the public R&D investment has a positive effect on the real wage, its effect on inflation should not be overlooked. Because of the pros and cons surrounding the impact of public R&D investment on industries and the economy, the study provided by the present paper can serve as valuable reference not only to decision-makers in government agencies but also to academic researchers.

In countries where, for a variety of reasons, the determinants of inflation could lead it to follow a nonstationary process, the adoption of a credible disinflationary programme should therefore induce a fundamental change in the stochastic process governing inflation and, in particular, should diminish its persistence. This article studies the time-series properties of both inflation and core inflation during the 1995-2006 period for the Mexican economy, using recently developed techniques to detect a change in the persistence of economic time series. Consistently with the adoption of an inflation-targeting framework, the results suggest that inflation in Mexico seems to have indeed switched from a nonstationary to a stationary process around the end of year 2000 or the beginning of 2001.","[Chiquiar, Daniel; Noriega, Antonio E.; Ramos-Francia, Manuel] Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Noriega, Antonio E.] Univ Guanajuato, Escuela Econ, Banco Mexico, Guanajuato, Mexico",Bank of Mexico; Bank of Mexico; Universidad de Guanajuato,"Chiquiar, D (通讯作者)，Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",dchiquiar@banxico.org.mx,,,,,,,39,25,31,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

These suggest that after devaluation exports become cheaper, relative to other exports, and the growing export market is posited to stimulate the economy. If devaluation has a differential effect across commodities, countries can expect different results depending on their portfolios. Therefore, any accurate analysis of the effects of devaluation must take into account the components of a country's export portfolio. The pooled time series estimation for Latin American countries reveals a negative short-run relationship between real devaluation and export growth for most exports at a disaggregated level.

The dynamic analysis indicates that Neimark-Sacker and flip bifurcations eventually separate stable and unstable manifolds and, as a result, a region of nonlinear motion is generated: cycles of various periodicities and chaotic motion characterize the behavior of the long run time paths of accumulated wealth, output and consumption.","[Gomes, Orlando] Inst Politecn Lisboa, Escola Super Comunicacao Social, P-1549014 Lisbon, Portugal; [Gomes, Orlando] Unidade Invest Desenvolvimento Empresarial Econ R, Lisbon, Portugal",Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon,"Gomes, O (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Lisboa, Escola Super Comunicacao Social, Campus Benfica IPL, P-1549014 Lisbon, Portugal.",ogomes@escs.ipl.pt,"Gomes, Orlando/B-6043-2009; Gomes, Orlando/JAC-2919-2023","Gomes, Orlando/0000-0002-7251-8736",,,,,26,3,3,2,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Moreover, loyalty is a mediator between financial and nonfinancial customer value and two sources of CS, namely, relationships with the front office and the branch, on the one hand, and the products offered, on the other.","[Gritti, Paola] Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento Econ Aziendale, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy; [Gritti, Paola] Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento Sci Econ HP Minsky, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy; [Foss, Nicolai] Copenhagen Sch Econ & Business Adm, Ctr Strateg Management & Globalizat, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Foss, Nicolai] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Strategy & Management, N-5035 Bergen, Norway",University of Bergamo; University of Bergamo; Copenhagen Business School; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Gritti, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento Econ Aziendale, Via Caniana 2, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy.",paola.gritti@unibg.it,,,,,,,9,4,5,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The results based on the impulse response functions indicate that, in general, house price inflation responds negatively to monetary policy shock, but the responses are heterogeneous across the middle-, luxury- and affordable-segments of the housing market. The luxury-, large-middle- and medium-middle-segments are found to respond much more than the small-middle- and the affordable-segments of the housing market. More importantly, we find no evidence of the home price puzzle, observed previously by other studies that analyzed house prices using small-scale models.

This paper aims to show the possibilities of developing a verification and validation process for the particular problem of optimizing the sowing plan when the randomness of harvests and the crop succession requirements are considered.

The sum of time for all routes is to be minimized. For the exact definition see [7]. This problem is NP-hard. There are many various possibilities how to design heuristics (approximation methods) to solve it. One of the ways how to obtain heuristics for the TLVRP is to modify the famous savings method by Clark and Wright for this purpose.

Yet, these taxes have not been given very much attention in the global debate regarding climate policy, compared with other instruments, such as tradable emission permits. This article shows, however, that the immense media coverage during fall 2006 significantly affected people's attitudes towards the CO2 tax on gasoline. We conducted a survey where we asked for people's opinions about the CO2 tax in September and in December 2006, i.e. before and after the release of Al Gore's 'An Inconvenient Truth' and the Stern Review. We found that the attitude towards the level of the CO2 tax was significantly changed after these events; people became much more positive towards the tax. This signals that using the CO2 tax as an important climate policy becomes more politically feasible and legitimate when more attention is drawn to climate change problems.","[Lofgren, Asa; Nordblom, Katarina] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Löfgren, Å (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, POB 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",asa.lofgren@economics.gu.se,,"Nordblom, Katarina/0000-0002-5587-0543",,,,,8,10,11,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We find evidence of nonlinearity in this relationship, which we capture through a smooth transition regression model. With the exception of Mexico, nonlinearity in economic growth is associated with changes in the real exchange rate, with depreciations leading to different relationships compared with appreciations. Regimes for Mexico are associated with the past growth rates, with effectively symmetric effects of real exchange rate changes. Although our results are in accord with other recent literature in that depreciations may have negative effects for growth, the asymmetries we uncover indicate that these effects depend on the conditioning state.","[Mejia-Reyes, Pablo; Osborn, Denise R.; Sensier, Marianne] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Mejia-Reyes, Pablo; Osborn, Denise R.; Sensier, Marianne] Univ Manchester, Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Mejia-Reyes, Pablo] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Fac Econ, Toluca 50110, Mexico",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Mejía-Reyes, P (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.",pmejr@uaemex.mx,"Mejía-Reyes, Pablo/AAC-8575-2020; Osborn, Denise/B-8692-2008","Mejia-Reyes, Pablo/0000-0002-9222-1526; Sensier, Marianne/0000-0001-8966-2403",,,,,32,17,19,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In particular, we try to answer the following research questions: (1) Are there any spillover effects of foreign direct investments (FDI), and if so, are they positive or negative? (2) Are spillover effects more likely to occur within or across sectors? (3) Are the existence, the direction and the magnitude of spillovers conditioned by sector and firm-specific characteristics? Our findings show that FDI spillovers exist both within and across sectors. The former arise when foreign firms operate in labour-intensive sectors, while the latter occur when foreign firms operate in high-tech sectors. Moreover, we find that domestic firm size conditions the exploitation of FDI spillovers even after controlling for absorptive capacity. We also detect a great deal of heterogeneity across countries consistent with the technology gap hypothesis.","[Nicolini, Marcella] FEEM, I-20100 Milan, Italy; [Resmini, Laura] Univ Valle Aosta, Fac Polit Sci & Int Relat, I-11020 St Christophe, Aosta, Italy; [Resmini, Laura] Bocconi Univ, ISLA, Milan, Italy",Fondazione Mattei; Universita Della Valle D'aosta; Bocconi University,"Nicolini, M (通讯作者)，FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20100 Milan, Italy.",marcella.nicolini@feem.it; laura.resmini@unibocconi.it,"Nicolini, Marcella/ABE-2618-2020; Resmini, Laura/AID-6323-2022; Nicolini, Marcella/ABA-7959-2020","Nicolini, Marcella/0000-0001-9034-2562; Resmini, Laura/0000-0003-4542-5873; Nicolini, Marcella/0000-0001-9034-2562",,,,,49,53,54,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Voters anticipate their children's prospects of economic mobility and the future political consequences of today's policies. The skill distribution evolves due to intergenerational skill upgrading and immigration. I consider three regimes: permanent migration with citizenship granted by jus soli, permanent migration with jus sanguinis, and temporary migration. The main finding is that under permanent migration and jus soli there exists equilibria where redistribution is sustained indefinitely, despite constant skill upgrading. This is not the case in the other regimes. The crucial insight is that unskilled voters trade-off the lower wages from larger unskilled immigration with the increased political support for redistribution provided by the children of the current immigrants. These mechanisms are relevant for the ongoing debates over comprehensive immigration reform in the U.S, and elsewhere.","Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,"Ortega, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",francesc.ortega@upf.edu,,"ortega, francesc/0000-0001-5779-5711",,,,,39,25,25,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Together with rapid expansion of the information economy and electronic networks it converges in the concept of e-service. Public administrations like any other organizations or individuals can provide electronic services using modern information and communication technologies. A primary goal for public sector organizations is not only to improve operation efficiency and organizational effectiveness to resolve significant, long-term challenges but they need to use existing resources more efficiently to provide public services, must improve the control of their budgets as such projects are mostly funded by tax payers. E-services are developed by applying new technologies, standards and learning from the best practices. We can define e-services as the result of automation, enhancement and integration of the business processes of the traditional services that are moving towards the e-services on demand. Due to their increasing complexity public services are typically not implemented by a single organization that provides the service. Instead, they are composed of independent services hosted by different data and service providers. The growing users' requirements stimulate the provided e-services to respond more effectively to their needs. E-services should be easily and simply accessed in some standard way using different access media and devices. The developments of e-service models were made for the purpose of contributing to a more qualitative and effective development of e-services. The varying complexity, different maturity and rapid growth of the number of new e-services promote the assessment and their comparison with each other. It is vital to discover procedures which can examine these e-services and their systems. The e-service models make it possible to measure e-services and their systems in different ways and dimensions. The periodic evaluation (or self-evaluation) of e-services is challenged in the need of assessment in what sophistication level the e-service is at the current moment. This paper presents the e-service evaluation model for the assessment and comparison of e-services in public sector and their systems. The e-service evaluation model will assist the authorities and other organizations to assess the maturity and complexity of the e-services provided, and the systems that support these services. It should be helpful in comparing of e-services with other e-services or the same e-services provided by other organizations in the country and/or with other countries. The e-service model is based on the Reference Model for Service Oriented Architecture. The hierarchical structure of evaluation criteria that is the basis of the e-service evaluation model is presented.","[Ostasius, Egidijus; Petraviciute, Zivile] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Ostasius, E (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",egidijusostasius@gama.vtu.lt; zivile.petraviciute@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,13,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The equilibrium payoffs are given implicitly as a solution to a system of linear equations. Then, we endogenize the matching mechanism in a link formation stage that precedes the market game. When agents are sufficiently patient and link costs are low, we provide an algorithm to construct minimally connected networks that are pairwise stable with respect to the expected payoffs in the trading stage. The constructed networks are essentially efficient and consist of components with a constant buyer-seller ratio. The latter ratio increases (decreases) for a buyer (seller) that deletes one of her links in a pairwise stable component.","[Polanski, Arnold] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Winter, Eyal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Queens University Belfast; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Polanski, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.",a.polanski@qub.ac.uk; mseyal@pluto.huji.ac.il,,"Winter, Eyal/0000-0002-4318-1759",,,,,21,4,4,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The implication of this finding is that a measure that better captures the underlying persistent component of earnings may prove very useful in predicting future earnings when used along with current earnings. Our study, based on a large sample of 1939 Spanish Small and medium Enterprises (SMEs), investigates whether an alternative measure of performance ignored in previous research on earnings forecasting-i.e. relative efficiency-has predictive ability over and above current earnings and book value of equity. Relative efficiency captures the inherent ability of a firm-as compared to other similar firms-to make the most productive use of available resources and is measured using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) nonparametric technique. Our findings highlight that our DEA-based efficiency measure has an incremental predictive ability over and above current earnings and book value of equity for predicting future earnings. Moreover, we have further validated the models in a holdout sample and our results evidence the highest forecast accuracy of the model that includes our efficiency measure as an additional predictor to current earnings and book value of equity.","[Reverte, Carmelo; Guzman, Isidoro] Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Accounting & Finance, Cartagena, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Reverte, C (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Accounting & Finance, Cartagena, Spain.",carmelo.reverte@upct.es,,"Guzman-Raja, Isidoro/0000-0001-8208-3433; REVERTE, CARMELO/0000-0002-5947-664X",,,,,19,4,4,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Between 1949 and 1969, the number of compulsory years of schooling in the Federal Republic of Germany was gradually increased across all federal states. These legislative changes provide an opportunity to investigate the causal impact of schooling on political behavior. Years of schooling are found to be positively correlated with several political outcomes. However, there is little evidence of a causal effect. This study conjectures that there is ample historical evidence to support the hypothesis that the fundamentals of democracy were already learned earlier in school, potentially outweighing the political returns of schooling in Germany.","DIW Berlin, DE-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Siedler, T (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, DE-10117 Berlin, Germany.",tsiedler@diw.de,,,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-518-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,40,22,27,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0347-0520,,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

However, only a rather small part of Lithuanian companies sell their products abroad. Export is influenced by a number of factors, all of which can be grouped into three categories: external factors, company-related factors and manager-related factors. These groups of factors were researched by the survey of Lithuanian companies that were engaged in export in 2006. The questionnaire included 70 questions that dealt with possible barriers for development of export activity. The survey identified the most important groups of factors as well as individual factors that limit the willingness of companies to be engaged in export activities. According to the survey, shortage of qualified workers appears to be the most important individual factor. Other important factors included a shortage of qualified employees with specific skills qualified export managers and sales agents, as well as a lack of qualified managers. The following two important factors were low awareness of the company's brands in foreign markets and limited financial resources for advertising its products. The management of the companies admitted that insufficient support from Lithuanian government and ineffective program for export support were also two significant factors which did not help companies to cope with the aforementioned problems. In addition, lack of relevant information was indicated as a serious problem for export development. The survey was performed during a period of stable economic development and growth. However, currently the situation is the opposite the country is in a recession or even in a crisis. Companies lack working capital; they are under the necessity to reduce a number of employees. Wakasugi Ryuhci from the Institute of Economic Research, Kyoto University noticed that the financial crisis has widened from monetary and financial issues to problems in the real economy notably reduced consumer spending and private investment outlays. All this is spilling over into the labour market. A weak employment market tends to induce protectionist actions as government seeks to shield the domestic market from foreign competition. C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, predicted a risk that the world trade would fall sharply and produce a downward spiral of global growth. That could create all types of trade distortions: increased import barriers, higher export subsidies, domestic subsidies that discriminate against foreigners, structures on international lending. According to Dr. Vo Dai Luoc, the former Head of the Economics and Politics Research Institute, in a crisis exporters compete with each other mostly in terms of prices, while brand name, quality, design, and distribution networks become less important at this moment. Therefore, one of the big barriers might be the foreign exchange rate. It is obvious that Lithuanian companies will face all or some of the problems in their attempts to export their products during the nearest period. Though extensive research data from the current time period is not yet available, the findings from the previous research can be put against theoretical and practical evidence of recession, which makes it possible to develop some scientific propositions.","[Urbonavicius, Sigitas; Dikcius, Vytautas] Vilnius Univ, Mkt Fac, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Urbonavicius, S (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Mkt Fac, Vilnius, Lithuania.",,"Urbonavicius, Sigitas/AAJ-5474-2020","Urbonavicius, Sigitas/0000-0003-4176-2573; Dikcius, Vytautas/0000-0001-6403-2704",,,,,58,0,1,0,18,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Despite that many unanswered questions in theory and business practice are still left. Issues of intellectual capital essence, structure, measurement and its impact on business performance are still being researched. Managers constantly look for the new solutions of recognizing, measuring and managing intellectual capital in order to maximise the value of knowledge, develop new forms of competitiveness and increase organization's potential. Intellectual capital measurement has been identified as one of the most important issues for today's business success. Plenty of intellectual capital measurement methods can be found in business literature. New methods appear within the intellectual capital theory continually. Some of them are implemented in business practice, others remain as theoretical suggestions important for further subject research. But despite that, a common view on intellectual capital measurement still does not exist. Results of the comparative analysis of intellectual capital measurement methods are discussed and the main bottlenecks of intellectual capital measurement methodology are revealed in this paper. Based on these results the model of organization's intellectual capital measurement is proposed here. Intellectual capital measurement is specified as a multi-stage process of information accumulation and interpretation within the model proposed. Six stages of intellectual capital measurement process are formalized. The process starts with the situation analysis in which measurement problem reveals and the particular measurement target development. It continues with measurement possibilities assessment, measurement method selection and organization of its implementation. The process results in the decision making stage. Two alternative scenarios of the rational intellectual capital measurement process are briefly discussed in this paper and the particular measurement techniques are proposed for each scenario. The model proposed summarizes knowledge of intellectual capital measurement. It intends to help managers understand intellectual capital measurement process as a whole and implement intellectual capital measurement solutions purposefully and in series.","Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Uziene, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",lina.uziene@ktu.lt,,"Uziene, Lina/0000-0002-5568-4433",,,,,38,13,13,2,27,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This article measures agricultural technical efficiency (TE) and total factor productivity (TFP) in China by including all producers in different groups operating under their own technologies. A metafrontier function approach is applied using a panel data set on 28 provinces during 1991-2005. The provinces are categorised into advanced and low-technology provinces. Based on the metafrontier estimation, TFP growth is decomposed into TE change (TEC), technical change (TC) and scale efficiency change (SEC). Our major findings indicate that TC contributed most to Chinese agricultural TFP growth throughout the period of study. SEC and TEC exhibited negative effects on TFP growth for the advanced and low-technology provinces respectively. Most of the advanced-technology provinces exhibited higher TE than the low-technology provinces. The comparatively low TE scores in the low-technology provinces imply that the low-technology provinces were operating far from the metafrontier. The results also show that labour and fertiliser still make important contributions to output, and thus improving the quality of farmers and applying modern physical inputs is also crucial to TFP growth.","[Rungsuriyawiboon, Supawat] Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Wang, Xiaobing] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaobing] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany",Thammasat University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Rungsuriyawiboon, S (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",supawat@econ.tu.ac.th,", IAMO/G-2328-2012",,,,,,28,12,13,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,2,,,,,207,227,PII 922466059,10.1080/14631371003740704,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,600SB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278006500006,0

On the basis of the framework developed by Plasmans et aL [Plasmans, J., Engwerda. J, van Aarle, B., Di Bartolomeo, G., Michalak, T., 2005.

We simulate macroeconomic adjustments of the four countries according to the different institutional scenarios and economic shocks. The baseline simulation and sensitivity analyses indicate that Taiwan can get benefit by participating in coalitional mechanisms including China. In addition, most of the feasible policy coalitions cannot come into effect without US participation. This implies that at the current stage the US rather than China should be the main economic partner of Taiwan and Japan to prevent them from being economically marginalized. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that the (population-weighted) average tax rate is determined by a (relatively) simple index, which must increase as the population distribution becomes more concentrated. The effects of tax harmonization by some subset of the jurisdictions can then be analyzed. Any tax harmonization by a group of jurisdictions must benefit residents of all jurisdictions not in the group.

Ideally, the survey and the census should be conducted in the same year. In several empirical applications, however, survey and census years can be different, which might make poverty estimates biased. Using data from the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey 2002 and the 1999 Population and Housing Census, the present paper produces a 2002 poverty map for Vietnam and describes the biases when the survey and census years are not coincident.

Achieving this objective requires that policy-makers carry out two different but related tasks. First they must ensure the resilience of the financial system to external shocks. Second they must respond in a timely fashion to future unsustainable expansions of credit and growth of asset prices. These are old policy challenges. What has changed is the emergence of new vulnerabilities in our innovative and relatively lightly controlled financial system, exposed by the recent global financial crisis. Macroprudential policy can be effective in addressing these vulnerabilities but will not remove the major political and institutional obstacles to the effective control of unsustainable credit expansions.","[Milne, Alistair] Bank Finland, Cass Business Sch, Helsinki, Finland; [Milne, Alistair] Bank Finland, Monetary Policy & Res Dept, Helsinki, Finland",Bank of Finland; Bank of Finland,"Milne, A (通讯作者)，Bank Finland, Cass Business Sch, Helsinki, Finland.",amilne@city.ac.uk,"Milne, Alistair/AAO-7707-2021","Milne, Alistair/0000-0002-4135-3983",,,,,51,12,12,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

In spite of the television images of long lines of depositors outside its branch offices, the run on Northern Rock was unlike the textbook retail depositor run caused by coordination failure. Also, contrary to received wisdom, its reliance on securitization was not an immediate factor in its failure. Rather, its problems stemmed from its high leverage coupled with reliance on institutional investors for short-term funding. When the de-leveraging in the credit markets began in August 2007, Northern Rock was uniquely vulnerable to the shrinking of lender balance sheets arising from the tick-up in measured risks. Financial regulation that relies on risk-weighted capital requirements is powerless against such runs. The Northern Rock case also offers lessons concerning the economics of short-term debt.","Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Shin, HS (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",hsshin@princeton.edu,,,,,,,24,235,253,2,44,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

It finds, with some caveats, that haulage seems more appropriate to the Pilbara situation than access.","Curtin Univ Technol, Curtin Business Sch, Ctr Res Appl Econ, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Wills-Johnson, N (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Curtin Business Sch, Ctr Res Appl Econ, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

This valuation technique has recently emerged and is expected to be more widely applied in cultural economics. However, little is known about whether or not WTP estimates that are derived using different functional forms and structures in the same valuation study are stable enough to be within an acceptable range. This paper tries to examine the stability of estimated WTP values when uncertainty remains in the selection of best choice models. A more careful selection of choice models might be needed to improve the valuation reliability.","Gangwon Dev Res Inst, Econ & Ind Policy Div, Chunchon 200041, Gangwon Do, South Korea",,"Choi, AS (通讯作者)，Gangwon Dev Res Inst, Econ & Ind Policy Div, 9 Joongang Ro 1 Ga, Chunchon 200041, Gangwon Do, South Korea.",kecc21@hanmail.net,"Choi, Andy/P-6006-2019","Choi, Andy/0000-0001-6124-8999",,,,,33,11,12,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

In quality gastronomy, the stars can be the restaurant chefs. Building on Rosen's (1981) and Adler's (1985) central theories on star effects, we explore two potential sources of stardom. Following Rosen (1981), we test if quality differences between the chefs' performances have a direct effect on financial rewards (direct superstar effect). Following Adler (1985), we assess the income effect of a media presence of chefs (classical Superstar effect). Through this, we deal with an economic issue of general interest: does it pay more to develop your skills in your core business to perfection, or to maintain the current level of skills and invest in self-marketing? Analyzing a sample of 288 restaurants, for potential star effects by differences in quality, we find that higher quality increases chefs' revenues. Yet, revenues do not increase disproportionately, and achieving higher quality requires substantial investments in exquisite ingredients, excellent staff and prime ambience. This problem, also called the agony of the stars, has manifested itself in the bankruptcies of European three-star restaurants in recent years. As regards potential star effects by differences in media presence, we observe a positive impact of TV appearances on financial rewards. Yet, these income effects are moderate as well, so there is neither a direct, nor a classical superstar effect in quality gastronomy. We argue that although both perfection of skills and self-marketing have similarly positive income effects, self-marketing seems both the less risky and the less stressful way to enhance income.","[Ehrmann, Thomas; Meiseberg, Brinja; Ritz, Christian] Univ Munster, Inst Strateg Management, D-48149 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Ehrmann, T (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Strateg Management, Leonardo Campus 18, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",meiseberg@ism.uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,37,17,18,1,20,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2009,62.0,4,,,,,526,541,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00449.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,509QK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271033000006,0

But, our long-term forecasting techniques predict roughly 5.5 billion U.S. dollars in constant price by 2016. Considering both professional judgment and the degree of current Korean government policies toward heavy investments in the biotechnology industries, however, is crucial to produce an accurate forecast. Thus, after these adjustments, the forecast value of the market size increases front 13 billion to 33 billion nominal U.S. dollars, depending oil the investment strategy choices.

The first finding in this study is that Spanish electricity spots prices, the USD/Euro exchange rate and oil prices are cointegrated; therefore there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between the three variables. Short-run relationships have been detected between oil prices and Spanish electricity prices and USD/Euro exchange rate in the sense that Spanish electricity prices and USD/Euro exchange rate are affected by oil prices in the short run. There is a transmission of volatility between USD/Euro exchange rate and oil prices to Spanish electricity prices; so although Spanish electricity prices are not affected in level by the movements of USD/Euro exchange rate, they are in volatility. In this kind of scenario the conclusions confirm that for countries so dependent on external causes as Spain, one possible solution for guarantying the energy security would be the promotion of the renewable energies. Therefore we cannot ignore the impact in the internal expenses of the cost of installation and generation of green energies so there must be a balance between the increase in renewables and the reasonable market price of the electricity.

Any local government in Mexico intending to access credit and capital markets must count with at least one credit rating from one of the three main agencies: FitchRatings, Moody's and Standard & Poor's. This paper investigates the impact of rating changes to State and Municipal governments on bond returns in Mexico. By employing a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) structure for the mean equation that allows conditional volatility, we find strong support for the Information Content Signaling Hypothesis (ICSH), i.e., rating upgrades (downgrades) are followed by greater (lower) bond returns. We also find some support for the Wealth Redistribution Hypothesis (WRH) indicating that rating upgrades (downgrades) are followed by lower (greater) bond returns. In addition to this, we find high volatility persistence, significant asymmetric responses of volatility to bad and good news, a negative association between market volatility and the level of bond returns and significant effects of volatility in response to rating changes. Finally, the estimations show the market anticipates and responds to rating changes within five-day momentum windows. There is a comparatively stronger reaction of returns on the event day favoring the hypothesis of market inefficiency.","[Mendoza Velazquez, Alfonso] UPAEP, Dept Econ, Puebla 72160, Pue, Mexico; [Mendoza Velazquez, Alfonso] UPAEP, CIIE, Puebla 72160, Pue, Mexico",Universidad Popular Autonoma del Estado de Puebla; Universidad Popular Autonoma del Estado de Puebla,"Velázquez, AM (通讯作者)，UPAEP, Dept Econ, 21 1103 Col, Puebla 72160, Pue, Mexico.",amv101@yahoo.com,"Mendoza Velazquez, Alfonso/AAG-7621-2020","Mendoza-Velazquez, Alfonso/0000-0002-0614-5716",,,,,25,1,1,0,4,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,OCT 7,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200938,,,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20MS,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208144700001,0

We also calculate an optimal mix of wage and bequest taxes with alternative parameter combinations. In all cases, the optimal wage tax rate is clearly higher than the optimal bequest tax rate, but the latter is generally positive when the required government revenue in the economy is sufficiently high. If educational investment is partly unobservable for the government, these results qualitatively hold also when allowing for education subsidies.","[Grossmann, Volker] Univ Fribourg, Dept Econ, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Grossmann, Volker] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Grossmann, Volker] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Poutvaara, Panu] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Fribourg; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Helsinki,"Grossmann, V (通讯作者)，Univ Fribourg, Dept Econ, Bd Perolles 90, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",volker.grossmann@unifr.ch; panu.poutvaara@helsinki.fi,"Poutvaara, Panu/AAW-4491-2020","Grossmann, Volker/0000-0001-8917-3503; Poutvaara, Panu/0000-0003-2070-784X",,,,,21,8,8,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

This market collapse seems particularly acute for markets where traders rely heavily on a specific empirical model such as in derivative markets like the market for mortgage backed securities or credit derivatives. Moreover, the observed behavior of traders and institutions that places a large emphasis on worst-case scenarios through the use of stress testing and Value-at-Risk seems different than Savage expected utility would suggest. In this paper, we capture model-uncertainty using an Epstein and Wang [Epstein, L. G., Wang, T., 1994. Intertemporal asset pricing under Knightian uncertainty. Econometrica 62, 283-322] uncertainty-averse utility function with an ambiguous underlying asset-returns distribution. To explore the connection of uncertainty with liquidity, we specify a simple market where a monopolist financial intermediary makes a market for a propriety derivative security. The market-maker chooses bid and ask prices for the derivative, then, conditional on trade in this market, chooses an optimal portfolio and consumption. We explore how uncertainty can increase the bid-ask spread and, hence, reduces liquidity. Our infinite-horizon example produces short, dramatic decreases in liquidity even though the underlying environment is stationary. We show how these liquidity crises are closely linked to the uncertainty aversion effect on the optimal portfolio. Effectively, the uncertainty aversion can, at times, limit the ability of the market-maker to hedge a position and thus reduces the desirability of trade, and hence, liquidity.

The general perception is that formalization lags behind appreciative work. Notwithstanding, this general reading has yet to be supported by real data analysis. This work presents a survey on evolutionary economics, aimed at exploring the main research paths and contributions using bibliometric methods. The documentation is based on an extensive review of the abstracts from articles published in all economic journals over the past 50 years gathered from the Econlit database. Evolutionary contributions have apparently not converged to an integrated approach. Two rather extreme main research strands emerged: 'History of Economic Thought and Methodology' and 'Games'. Whereas formal approaches have a reasonable and increasing share of published papers, purely empirical-related works are relatively scarce, representing a meagre and stagnant percentage of published works. This highlights the need to redirect the evolutionary research agenda.","[Silva, Sandra Tavares; Teixeira, Aurora A.

First, growth depends negatively on volatility of unanticipated output growth independent of initial income, investment, human capital, trade openness, natural resource dependence, and population growth. Second, the direct positive effect of resources on growth is swamped by the indirect negative effect through volatility. Third, with well developed financial sectors, the resource curse is less pronounced. Fourth, landlocked countries with ethnic tensions have higher volatility and lower growth. Fifth, restrictions on the current account raise volatility and depress growth whereas capital account restrictions lower volatility and boost growth.

The main idea is that utility prices should be largely indexed to changes in the company's cost of capital. The rationale is that companies have little influence over the cost of capital and, because of the uncertainty about future capital costs, regulators use crude upward adjustments to the cost of capital, often termed headroom, to mitigate any under-investment problems. Indexation would largely or even completely avoid the need for headroom and, we believe, lead to lower prices. Indexation would also result in more efficient investment and consumption decisions since headroom can only be a crude and inefficient method of dealing with the uncertainty around the cost of capital.","[Brealey, Richard; Franks, Julian] London Business Sch, London, England",University of London; London Business School,"Brealey, R (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, London, England.",rbrealey@london.edu; jfranks@london.edu,"franks, julian/ABC-6749-2021",,,,,,11,3,4,4,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

When wage negotiations are sequential the productivity of labour is greater (lower) in the follower (leader) firm than when negotiations are simultaneous.

A firm with a larger installed base offers a more attractive product which induces more consumers to buy its product which produces a yet bigger installed base advantage. Such a setting is investigated here but with the main difference that firms have the option of making their products compatible. When firms have similar installed bases, they make their products compatible in order to expand the market. Nevertheless, random forces could result in one firm having a bigger installed base, in which case the larger firm may make its product incompatible. We find that strategic pricing tends to prevent the installed base differential from expanding to the point that incompatibility occurs.

The impact of pragmatic arbitrators-that enforce concessions that precede their appointment-is compared with that of arbitrators that act on principle-ignoring prior concessions. We show that while the impact of arbitration always depends on how costly that intervention is relative to direct negotiation, the range of scenarios for which it has an impact, and the precise effect of such impact, does change depending on the behavior-pragmatic or on principle-of the arbitrator. Moreover the requirement of mutual consent to appoint the arbitrator matters only when he is pragmatic. Efficiency and equilibrium are not aligned since agents sometimes reach negotiated agreements when an arbitrated settlement is more efficient and vice versa. What system of arbitration has the best performance depends on the arbitration and negotiation costs, and each can be optimal for plausible environments.","[de las Mercedes Adamuz, Maria] Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Dept Adm, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ponsati, Clara] Inst Anal Econ CSIC, Barcelona, Spain",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Adamuz, MD (通讯作者)，Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Dept Adm, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",adamuz@itam.mx; clara.ponsati@uab.es,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

Such prices have a notoriously high volatility, owing to the difficulty of storing electrical energy and the delays needed to adjust generation levels.

This paper proposes a parsimonious parametric model, based on the price series of all n-month forward contracts (n = 1,2,3 ...), encompassing multiple zones.

Due to increases in market uncertainty, crisis periods exhibit abnormally high levels of volatility. By studying short-term changes in volatility dynamics, it is possible to identify the start and end dates of crisis periods with a high degree of precision. We use the iterative cumulative sum of squares algorithm to detect multiple shifts in the volatility of rand returns between January 1994 and March 2009. Dummy variables controlling for the detected shifts in variance are incorporated in a generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity modelling framework. The analysis indicates that previously identified crisis periods in the rand coincide with significant structural changes in market volatility.","[Duncan, Andrew Stuart] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Liu, Guangling Dave] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Johannesburg; Stellenbosch University,"Duncan, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",andrewd@uj.ac.za; daveliu@sun.ac.za,,,,,,,31,2,7,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

This issue is relevant for crisis-hit economies trying to prevent a boom-bust cycle as well as in the formulation of macroeconomic policy objectives in emerging market economies. Korea has recently experienced large capital inflows, in particular a surge in portfolio inflows. Furthermore, asset prices, including stock prices, land prices and nominal and real exchange rates, have also appreciated. The empirical results, obtained using a vector autoregression model, suggest that capital inflow shocks have caused stock prices but not land prices to increase. The effects on the nominal and real exchange rates have been limited, which relates to the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves.","[Kim, Soyoung] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151746, South Korea; [Yang, Doo Yong] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1006008, Japan",Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, S (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, San 56-1, Seoul 151746, South Korea.",soyoungkim@korea.ac.kr; dyyang@adbi.org,,"Kim, Soyoung/0000-0003-3612-1691",,,,,32,29,30,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Local capital is efficient when most trading is local, but only market capital can support trading between strangers that allows extensive division of labor and industrialization. We show that economies with a low cost of accumulating local capital (say, because people live close together) are richer than economies with a high cost of accumulation when long distance trade is difficult, but are slower to transition to impersonal market exchange (industrialize) when long distance trade becomes feasible. The model provides one way to understand why the wealthiest economies in 1600 AD, China, India, and the Islamic Middle East, industrialized more slowly than the West. We report an array of historical evidence documenting the pre-industrial importance of family and kinship networks in China, India, and the Islamic world compared to Europe, and the modernization problems linked to local capital.

In this paper we measure voluntary and involuntary departures from efficiency for rice producing households in the Bicol region of the Philippines. We take advantage of a panel of observations on households from 1978, 1983 and 1994. Available monthly weather data and survey information on planting times allows us to create household specific measures of weather shocks, which we use in our analysis. We find evidence that diversification and input choices do affect efficiency outcomes among farmers, although these effects are not dominant; accumulated wealth, past decisions to invest, favorable market conditions, and propitious weather are also important determinants of efficiency outcomes among Bicol rice farmers. Our findings suggest that the costs of incomplete formal and informal insurance markets are higher for poorer farmers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This change flows in part from a rise in the use of tax haven services by the wealthy and by corporations, as well as in innovation in the types of services tax havens provide. Available evidence shows that tax havens hold at least $10 trillion in assets, are used by a majority of large corporations, and account for lost tax revenue of hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Economic data are likely distorted by transfer pricing of activities related to tax havens, including exports and imports, value added, productivity, profit, current account balances, and the nature and size of investment flows across borders.

This study examines how restriction on the number of working hours affects individuals' exercise decision. A structural model is constructed to describe the simultaneous decisions of employment and physical activity in the presence of working hour restriction. Using data from the 1992 Health and Retirement Study, this study finds that the working hour restriction is partly responsible for the physical inactivity among older American workers. When the working hour restriction is binding from below, an increase in the number of hours required on the job considerably reduces the probability of engaging in frequent exercise. The results imply that partial relaxation of working hour restrictions may be considered to promote frequent exercise.","Univ N Florida, Dept Econ & Geog, Coggin Coll Business, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA",State University System of Florida; University of North Florida,"Loh, CPA (通讯作者)，Univ N Florida, Dept Econ & Geog, Coggin Coll Business, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",cloh@unf.edu,,,,,,,28,10,10,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

For example, the merit of the appeals process depends on the agent's aversion to unfairness, and appeals may be optimally denied even if the appeals process is more accurate than the initial evaluation and is costless. An increase in the accuracy of the initial evaluation may reduce the principal's welfare. Furthermore, the principal's welfare can increase as the cost of the appeals process increases.

Subjects in our experiment decide whether to leave their money deposited in a bank or withdraw it early; a bank run occurs when there are too many early withdrawals. We explore the effects of adding uncertainty about fundamental withdrawal demand and of changing the number of opportunities subjects have to withdraw. Our results show that (i) bank runs are rare when fundamental withdrawal demand is known but occur frequently when it is stochastic, and (ii) subjects are more likely to withdraw when given multiple opportunities to do so than when presented with a single decision. For the multiple-opportunity case, we evaluate individual withdrawal decisions according to a set of simple cutoff rules. We find that the cutoff rule corresponding to the payoff-dominant equilibrium of the game, which involves Bayesian updating of probabilities, explains subject behavior better than other rules.

The validity and influence of these studies rests heavily on empirical modeling, which, since the theories are obviously closely related, might actually capture the same primary mechanism. It is therefore unclear whether the empirical relationships found are the same or if they are different. Therefore, this paper takes the empirical models seriously in order to discriminate among the existing models and to identify the model and variables that best explain the variation in institutional quality. The aim of this paper is thus to provide answers to the following questions: (i) Is there one model which explains more of the variation in institutional quality than the other models? (ii) Do these models capture the same information?

The model incorporates real wage rigidity and consumption habits, as the particular market failures justifying policy intervention. We subject the model to productivity shocks and allow policy instruments to react to the output gap and the debt-to-output ratio. A welfare analysis reveals that the most effective instrument-target combination is to use public consumption to stabilize the Output gap. Moreover, welfare gains from counter-cyclical fiscal policy are much stronger in the presence of wage rigidities compared with consumption habits. Finally, since active policy and automatic stabilizers are substitutes, it is possible that relatively undistorted economies may be in need of countercyclical fiscal action due to inadequate automatic stabilizers.

If growth is driven by industrialization of production, where machines replace labor in a growing number of tasks, then operating these machines requires workers who are educated, namely literate and know arithmetic, whose human capital is less specific and more general. As a result, technology adoption depends negatively on wages of educated workers. Hence, economic growth depends negatively on the cost of education or on the barriers to acquire education. The model shows that if the cost of education is high, economic growth might be slow and even stop completely, creating a development trap.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Zeira, J (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",mszeira@mscc.huji.ac.il,"Zeira, Joseph/Q-3723-2019","Zeira, Joseph/0000-0002-9171-4599",,,,,29,13,16,6,32,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Specifically, this paper formulates a precise evolutionary dynamic model of an industry where there is continuous entry of firms that randomly select their output levels on entry and fix their output levels thereafter. Firms exit the industry if they fail to pass the survival test of making nonnegative wealth. This paper shows that the industry converges in probability to the monopolistically competitive equilibrium as the size of each firm becomes infinitesimally small relative to the market, as the entry cost becomes sufficiently small, and as time gets sufficiently large. Consequently, in the limit, the only surviving firms are those producing at the tangency of the demand curve to the average cost curve and no potential entrant can make a positive profit by entry.

The authors argue that border measures-both import restrictive measures and export subsidies-contemplated in US climate bills and the climate policies of other countries stand a fair chance of being challenged in the WTO. Given the prospect of foreseeable conflicts with WTO rules, the authors suggest that key WTO members should attempt to negotiate a new code that delineates a large green space for measures that are designed to limit GHG emissions both within the member country and globally. By green space,the authors mean policy space for climate measures that are imposed in a manner broadly consistent with core WTO principles even if a technical violation of WTO law could occur. To encourage WTO negotiating efforts along these lines, the authors recommend a time-limited peace clause to be adopted into climate legislation of major emitting countries. The peace clause would suspend the application of border measures or other extraterritorial controls for a defined period while WTO negotiations are under way.","[Hufbauer, Gary Clyde; Kim, Jisun] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Peterson Institute for International Economics,"Hufbauer, GC (通讯作者)，Peterson Inst Int Econ, 1750 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",ghufbauer@petersoninstitute.org; jkim@petersoninstitute.org,,,,,,,7,2,2,0,9,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 18,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200929,,,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20MK,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208143900002,0
