The results show that dispersion in body weight across time and space in the U.S. is not clearly excessive, and that much of this variation can be attributed to observable individual and regional characteristics. Models exploiting variants of methods proposed by Glaeser et al. (2003), fixed effects, instrumental variable and split-sample instrumental variable methods to address endogeneity suggest that there are not large social multipliers on body weight outcomes. The evidence suggests there may be small multipliers on BMI, obesity, and morbid obesity. There is no evidence that underweight is subject to a social multiplier. The results are sensitive to specification. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: PMV was defined as more than 21 days of mechanical ventilation. A total of 633 patients fulfilled this definition and were followed for 9 years (1998-2007) to obtain their survival status. Quality of life of 142 patients was measured with the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire during the period 2008 to 2009. The survival probabilities for each time point were adjusted with a utility measurement of quality of life and then extrapolated to 300 months to obtain the QALE. We compared the age-, gender-matched reference populations to calculate the expected lifetime utility loss. Results: The average age of subjects was 76 years old. The life expectancy and loss of life expectancy were 1.95 years and 8.48 years, respectively. The QALE of 55 patients with partial cognitive ability and the ability to respond was 0.58 quality-adjusted life years (QALY), whereas the QALEs of 87 patients with poor consciousness were 0.28 and 0.29 QALY for the EQ-5D measured by family caregivers and nurses, respectively. The loss of QALE for PMV patients was 9.87 to 10.17 QALY, corresponding to a health gap of 94% to 97%. Conclusions: Theses results of poor prognosis would provide stakeholders evidence for communication to facilitate clinical decisions.

One is the domain consisting of (dichotomous) preferences that have at most two indifference classes, and the other is the domain where any set of three alternatives is partitioned into two non-empty subsets and alternatives in one set are strictly preferred to alternatives in the other set. On these two domains, we investigate whether majority voting is the unique way of generating transitive, quasi-transitive, or acyclic social preferences. First of all, we rule out non-standard voting rules by imposing monotonicity, anonymity, and neutrality. Our main results show that majority rule is the unique voting rule satisfying transitivity, yet all other voting rules satisfy acyclicity (also quasitransitivity on the second domain). Thus we find a very thin border dividing majority and other voting rules, namely, the gap between transitivity and acyclicity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was performed to assess clinical parameters (unified PD rating scale, Beck Depression Inventory) and HRQoL data (EuroQol, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire [PDQ]-39) at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. A total of 145 patients with PD were consecutively recruited in the county of Northern Hessia, Germany, between January and June 2000. A latent growth mixture model was applied to analyse the heterogeneity in HRQoL trajectories. Results: We successfully applied latent mixture growth modeling in order to identify different classes of HRQoL trajectories in PD. Three growth models were developed and each resulted in a four-class model of distinct patterns using the generic EuroQol instruments' outcomes (EuroQol-5 Dimensions and visual analogue scale) and the disease-specific PDQ-39. The four classes were defined by individual trajectory characteristics. Classes one and two represented trajectories with moderate declines over 36 months, but with different initial intercepts. Class three consisted mainly of patients who passed away during the observation period and therefore had a large HRQoL decline. Class four was characterized by a low level of HRQoL at baseline and a significant subsequent decline. Conclusions: The findings provide a more elaborate understanding of the variability in HRQoL reduction in PD over time. The classification of different HRQoL subgroups may help to explain the response of PD patients to the natural history of the disease. Future research will enable the identification of HRQoL responder subgroups on different treatment regimens.

Recently, work by Pesaran (2006) has suggested a method which makes use of cross-sectional averages to provide valid inference in the case of stationary panel regressions with a multifactor error structure. This paper extends this work and examines the important case where the unobservable common factors follow unit root processes. The extension to I(1) processes is remarkable on two counts. First, it is of great interest to note that while intermediate results needed for deriving the asymptotic distribution of the panel estimators differ between the I(1) and I(0) cases, the final results are surprisingly similar. This is in direct contrast to the standard distributional results for I(1) processes that radically differ from those for I(0) processes. Second, it is worth noting the significant extra technical demands required to prove the new results. The theoretical findings are further supported for small samples via an extensive Monte Carlo study. In particular, the results of the Monte Carlo study suggest that the cross-sectional-average-based method is robust to a wide variety of data generation processes and has lower biases than the alternative estimation methods considered in the paper.

The method is intuitive and simple to implement, relying on the sample moments of the recently popularized model-free realized and option-implied volatility measures. A small-scale Monte Carlo experiment confirms that the procedure works well in practice. Implementing the procedure with actual S&P500 option-implied volatilities and high-frequency five-minute-based realized volatilities indicates significant temporal dependencies in the estimated stochastic volatility risk premium, which we in turn relate to a set of macro-finance state variables. We also find that the extracted volatility risk premium helps predict future stock market returns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Within an economy with Lucas-type human capital formation, money is super-neutral: however, within an economy where human capital accumulation formation is more generalized, and in which both physical and human capital are used as inputs, the growth rate in money will have a negative effect on the long-run growth rate of the economy.

QD's unique optical properties make them an excellent in vivo and in vitro fluorescent labeles in a variety of biological investigations. Traditional molecular dyes are generally large, have broad absorption and emission profiles, low photobleaching thresholds and short lifetime. Therefore, use of traditional labeles in long term experiments can be limited. In contrast to this, QDs with the dimensions in the range of 2-10 nm have a broad absorption with narrow photoluminescence spectra, high resistance to photobleaching and high resistance to photo-and chemical degradation. Originally, QDs were synthesized by organometallic way and coated with trioctylphosphine oxide TOPO to make them biocompatible. But due to hydrophobic properties of TOPO, these QDs can not be directly applied in bioaplications. The most common method for synthesizing water-soluble QDs is by aquaeous synthesis route. QDs can be then coated with thiol containing molecules, such as mercaptopropionic acid, dihydrolipoic acid or glutathione. In this study, we synthesized water soluble CdTe QDs coated with N-terminal biotin-glutathione. This type of coating represents a unique combination of water soluble, biocompatible QDs with biotin, which serves as specific linker able to react with avidin or streptavidin. Biotin-glutathione-QDs were prepared by one pot synthesis using sodium tellurite and cadmium chloride.","[Janu, L.; Ryvolova, M.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Chomoucka, J.; Drbohlavova, J.; Hubalek, J.] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn & Commun, Dept Microelectron, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Brno University of Technology,"Janu, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",libor.janu@seznam.cz,"Pekarkova, Jana/AAC-4938-2019; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Drbohlavova, Jana/D-8082-2012; Hubalek, Jaromir/D-7753-2012; Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Vaculovicova, Marketa/E-5583-2016","Pekarkova, Jana/0000-0001-9705-1565; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Drbohlavova, Jana/0000-0001-6591-2340; Hubalek, Jaromir/0000-0002-7496-2558; Vaculovicova, Marketa/0000-0002-6771-1304",IGA FA MENDELU [13/ 2011],IGA FA MENDELU,The work has been supported by IGA FA MENDELU 13/ 2011.,,10,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,1011,1018,,,,,,8,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400124,0

The highest LAI values were achieved by the Radegast variety (in DC 55, 69, as well as 75), the highest average RSS was found in the Aksamit variety (6.76 nF in DC 55), the highest grain yield was provided by the Sebastian variety (8.1 t ha(-1)). LAI measured in stages DC 55- 75 correlated positively with the height of the plants (cm) before the harvest (r = 0.290** to 0.379***). To achieve a high grain yield, it was found that LAI in the DC 69 stage (r = 0,289**) was decisive; the effect of RSS on the yield was not proven (r up to 0.132). A relationship between LAI and RSS was found at the beginning of stem elongation (r = 0.401***).

It was analysed 53 week's samples on private farm in Ricany (3.6.2010-2.6.2011). Milk originates from approx. 700 Czech Fleckvieh cows with average 7.500 kg/lactation. One day before taking samples average barn airspace temperature and relative humidity were recorded. The bulk tank samples were analysed for average values of fat content (%), protein content (%), lactose (%), SNF-solids non fat (%), casein content (%), TA - titratable acidity (Soxhlet Henkel), RCT - rennet coagulation time (s) and CQC - curd quality class (class 1-5). It was found that the minimal and maximal daily temperature resp. relative humidity changed in range -7.4-26.2 degrees C resp. 48.2-99.9%. It means that in particular periods dairy cows were exposed to heat stress. In mentioned periods (when temperature was close to 26 C) lower protein and fat content of milk was found and worse curd quality was frequently experienced although RCT was longer in colder period. Close correlation was confirmed between barn airspace temperature and protein, fat resp. SNF content (r=-0.83, -0.81, resp. -0.83; P<0.01). Correlation coefficients of stable relative humidity with other parameters were contrary to those of barn airspace temperature.

Prior analyses have examined the policy's cost-effectiveness but have not evaluated its impact on government budgets. Methods: We used a simulation model of HIV screening, disease, and treatment to determine the budget impact of expanded HIV screening to US government discretionary, entitlement, and testing programs. We estimated total and incremental testing and treatment costs over a 5-year time horizon under current and expanded screening scenarios. We used CDC estimates of HIV prevalence and annual incidence, and considered variations in screening frequency, test return rates, linkage to care, test characteristics, and eligibility for government screening and treatment programs. Results: Under current practice, 177,000 new HIV cases will be identified over 5 years. Expanded screening will identify an additional 46,000 cases at an incremental 5-year cost of $2.7 billion. The financial burden of expanded HIV screening will fall disproportionately on discretionary programs that fund care for newly identified patients and will not be offset by entitlement program savings. Testing will represent a small proportion (18%) of the total budget increase. Costs are sensitive to the frequency of screening and the proportion linked to care. Conclusions: The expanded HIV screening program will have a large downstream impact on government programs that fund HIV care. Expanded HIV screening will not meet early treatment goals unless government programs have sufficient budgets to expand testing and provide care for newly identified cases.","[Martin, Erika G.] SUNY Albany, Rockefeller Coll Publ Affairs & Policy, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Paltiel, A.

Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this model of care delivery. Methods: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis, with a 12-year time horizon, from the perspective of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care, comparing a standard care cohort, consisting of all patients admitted to hospital with HF in 2005, to a hypothetical cohort treated in HF clinics. Survival curves describing the natural history of HF were constructed using mortality estimates from the Enhanced Feedback for Effective Cardiac Treatment (EFFECT) study. Survival benefits and resource uptake associated with HF clinics were estimated from a meta-analysis of published trials. HF clinics costs were obtained by costing a representative clinic in Ontario. Health-related costs were determined through linkage to administrative databases. Outcome measures included life expectancy (years), costs (in 2008 Canadian dollars) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results: HF clinics were associated with a 29% reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.91) but a 12% increase in hospitalizations (RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.92-1.135). The cost of care in HF clinics was $52 per 30 patient-days. Projected life-expectancy of HF clinic patients was 3.91 years, compared to 3.21 years for standard care. The 12-year cumulative cost per patient in the HF clinic group was $66,532 versus $53,638 in the standard care group. The ICER was $18,259/life-year gained. Conclusions: HF clinics appear to be a cost effective way of delivering ambulatory care to HF patients.","[Wijeysundera, Harindra C.; Tu, Jack V.] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Cardiol, Schulich Heart Ctr, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada; [Wijeysundera, Harindra C.; Machado, Marcio; van der Velde, Gabrielle; Witteman, William; Krahn, Murray] Toronto Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment THETA Coll, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wijeysundera, Harindra C.; Tu, Jack V.; Lee, Douglas S.; Goodman, Shaun G.; Krahn, Murray] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wang, Xuesong; Tu, Jack V.; Lee, Douglas S.] Inst Clin Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [van der Velde, Gabrielle] Inst Work & Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Sikich, Nancy] Minist Hlth & Long Term Care Ontario, Med Advisory Secretariat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Lee, Douglas S.] Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Gen Hosp, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Goodman, Shaun G.; Krahn, Murray] Canadian Heart Res Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Goodman, Shaun G.] St Michaels Hosp, Div Cardiol, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada; [Petrella, Robert] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Family Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Krahn, Murray] Univ Toronto, Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON, Canada; [O'Flaherty, Martin; Capewell, Simon] Univ Liverpool, Div Publ Hlth, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; Sunnybrook Research Institute; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Institute for Work & Health; University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; Toronto General Hospital; Canadian Heart Research Centre; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Saint Michaels Hospital Toronto; Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Toronto; University of Liverpool,"Wijeysundera, HC (通讯作者)，2075 Bayview Ave,Suite A209D, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada.",wijeysundera@gmail.com,"Lee, Dong Hun/AAS-6021-2021; Wijeysundera, Harindra/AAA-6058-2020; Petrella, Robert J/G-6557-2018; O'Flaherty, Martin/JXM-0484-2024","Lee, Dong Hun/0000-0002-2925-3074; O'Flaherty, Martin/0000-0001-8944-4131; Krahn, Murray/0000-0001-5836-397X; Witteman, William/0009-0000-6116-1543; Wijeysundera, Harindra/0000-0001-8464-1080; Lee, Douglas/0000-0001-7078-745X; Tu, Jack/0000-0003-0111-722X",Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP 82747]; Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Health Services Research; Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario; Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada; Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care of Ontario,"Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Health Services Research; Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario(Heart & Stroke Foundation of Ontario); Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada(Heart & Stroke Foundation of Canada); Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care of Ontario(Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Ontario)","Dr. Wijeysundera is supported by a research fellowship award from the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR).

The dynamics in such models are governed by a differential inclusion (x) over dot is an element of H(x), where H is a set-valued function. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a chaotic set and explore its implications for Devaney chaos, Li-Yorke chaos and distributional chaos (adapted to dynamical systems generated by a differential inclusion). We show that a chaotic set will imply Devaney and Li-Yorke chaos and that a chaotic set with Euler equation branching will imply distributional chaos. We show that the existence of a steady state for a differential inclusion on the plane will generate a chaotic set and hence Devaney and Li-Yorke chaos. As an application, we show how these results can be applied to a one-sector growth model with a production externality - extending the results of Christiano and Harrison (1999). We show that chaotic (Devaney, Li-Yorke and distributional) and cyclic equilibria are possible and that this behavior is not dependent on the steady state being locally a saddle, sink or source.

Empirical estimates yield daily and occasional participation elasticities from -0.10 to -0 14, which is consistent with findings from recent U.S -based research A key contribution of this research is in the analysis of lower taxes on a panel of 591 youths from the Waterloo Smoking Prevention Program, who did not smoke in 1993, but 43% of whom confirm smoking participation following the tax reduction Employing these data reveals elasticities from -0.2 to -0 5, which suggest that even significant and discrete chances in taxes might have limited impacts on the initiation and persistence of youth smoking.

Then, based on his/her own private information, each agent maximizes interim expected utility subject to his/her own estimated budget set. From the imprecision due to the price estimation it follows that the resulting equilibrium allocation may not clear the markets for every state of nature, i.e., exact feasibility of allocations may not occur. This paper shows that if the economy is repeated from period to period and agents refine their private information by observing the past BWE, then in the limit all agents will obtain the same information and market clearing will be reached. The converse is also true. The analysis provides a new way of looking at the asymmetric equilibrium which has a statistical foundation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

I find that rich patients are more likely than other patients to bribe in public health care: doubling household expenditure increases the bribery probability by 1.2 percentage points compared to a bribery rate of 17%. The income elasticity of the bribe amount is about 0.37. Bribes in the Ugandan public sector appear to be fees-for-service extorted from the richer patients amongst those exempted by government policy from paying the official fees. Bribes in the private sector appear to be flat-rate fees paid by patients who do not pay official fees. I do not find evidence that the public health care sector is able to price discriminate less effectively than public institutions with less competition from the private sector. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The standard cointegration analysis only considers the assumption that deviations from equilibrium can be integrated of order zero, which is very restrictive in many cases and may imply an important loss of power in the fractional case. We consider the alternative hypotheses with equilibrium deviations that can be mean reverting with order of integration possibly greater than zero. Moreover, the degree of fractional cointegration is not assumed to be known, and the asymptotic null distribution of both tests is found when considering an interval of possible values. The power of the proposed tests under fractional alternatives and size accuracy provided by the asymptotic distribution in finite samples are investigated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Substitution is determined by observable variables, such as prices of output and inputs and shares of inputs in the value of output. Our principal innovation is to represent the rate and biases of technical change by unobservable or latent variables. This representation is considerably more flexible than the constant time trends employed in the previous literature. An added advantage of the new representation is that the latent variables can be projected into the future, so that the rate and bias of technical change can be incorporated into econometric projections.

However, to our knowledge, no such HRQoL instrument has been validated or used in chronic prostatitis. We therefore aimed to assess and compare the psychometric properties of EuroQol (EQ-5D) and Short Form 6D (SF-6D) among chronic prostatitis patients in China. Methods: Consenting patients were interviewed using EQ-5D and SF-6D. Convergent and discriminative construct validities were examined with five and two a priori hypotheses, respectively. Sensitivity was compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and relative efficiency (RE) statistics. Agreement between instruments was assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plot, while factors affecting utility difference were explored with multiple liner regression models. Results: In 268 subjects, mean (SD) EQ-5D and SF-6D utility scores were comparable at 0.73 (0.15) and 0.75 (0.10), respectively. Five of the seven hypotheses for construct validity were fulfilled in both instruments. The areas under ROC of them all exceeded 0.5 (P < 0.001). SF-6D had 9.7-19.9% higher efficiency than EQ-5D at detecting the difference in chronic prostatitis symptom severity. Despite no significant difference in utility scores between two instruments, lack of agreement was observed with low intraclass correlation coefficient (0.218-0.630) and Bland-Altman plot analysis. Chronic prostatitis symptom severity significantly (P < 0.05) influenced differences in utility scores between EQ-5D and SF-6D. Conclusions: Both EQ-5D and SF-6D are demonstrated to be valid and sensitive HRQoL measures in Chinese chronic prostatitis patients, with SF-6D showing better HRQoL dimension coverage, greater sensitivity, lower ceiling effect, and more rational distribution.

Aims: To discuss the method from an epistemologically viewpoint. Materials and Methods: Examination of the underlying assumptions. Results: The method, like other methods to define input distributions, is Bayesian in character and the implied prior distribution is not very appealing. Discussion: Bootstrapping offers possibilities to be non-Bayesian, but at the price of giving only non-Bayesian answers. The method presented by Barendregt, however, can not be seen as a bootstrapping approach. Conclusion: Defining the distribution of a RR or any other model parameter without being a Bayesian is epistemologically impossible. This means that being explicit on prior distributions used for deriving those distributions, and justifying them, is a necessary part of suggesting new ways to define distributions.","Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Dept Stat & Math Modelling, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands",Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment,"Boshuizen, HC (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Dept Stat & Math Modelling, POB 1, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands.",hendriek.boshuizen@rivm.nl,"Boshuizen, Hendriek/M-3415-2014; Boshuizen, Hendriek C/B-3718-2014","Boshuizen, Hendriek/0000-0002-3916-9095;","National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands","National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands(Netherlands Government)","National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands.",,6,0,0,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN-JUL,2010,13.0,4,,,,,392,393,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00712.x,0.0,,,2,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,625DD,20345545.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279872300009,0

This differential occurs despite the fact that, conditional on race, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to search. While the racial wage gap is small, the unemployment rate for black teenagers is substantially higher than that of white teenagers. We develop a two-sided search model where firms are partially able to search on demographics. Model estimates reveal that firms are more able to target their search on race than on age. Employment and wage outcome differences explain half of the racial gap in labor force participation rates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the sensitivity of the respective estimates to random departures from monotonicity. Approximations to the respective bias terms are derived. In an empirical application the bias is calculated and bias corrected estimates are obtained. The accuracy of the approximation is investigated in a Monte Carlo study. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Quantile regression reveals higher point estimates (both in absolute and relative terms) at higher quantiles, meaning that the reform predominantly reduced long durations of absence.

For estimates of the main effects to be obtained, a pseudo data set is created by weighting each subject by IPTW and analyzed with conventional regression models. Currently, variance estimation requires additional work depending on type of outcomes. Our goal is to demonstrate a statistical approach to directly obtain appropriate estimates of variance of the main effects in regression models. Methods: We carried out theoretical and simulation studies to show that the variance of the main effects estimated directly from regressions using IPTW is underestimated and that the type I error rate is higher because of the inflated sample size in the pseudo data. The robust variance estimator using IPTW often slightly overestimates the variance of the main effects. We propose to use the stabilized weights to directly estimate both the main effect and its variance from conventional regression models. Results: We applied the approach to a study examining the effectiveness of serum potassium monitoring in reducing hyperkalemia-associated adverse events among 27,355 diabetic patients newly prescribed with a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor. The incidence rate ratio (with monitoring vs. without monitoring) and confidence intervals were 0.46 (0.34, 0.61) using the stabilized weights compared with 0.46 (0.38, 0.55) using typical IPTW. Conclusions: Our theoretical, simulation results and real data example demonstrate that the use of the stabilized weights in the pseudo data preserves the sample size of the original data, produces appropriate estimation of the variance of main effect, and maintains an appropriate type I error rate.","[Xu, Stanley; Ross, Colleen; Raebel, Marsha A.; Shetterly, Susan] Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Inst Hlth Res, Denver, CO 80111 USA; [Blanchette, Christopher] Lovelace Resp Res Inst, Div Clin & Outcomes Res, Kannapolis, NC USA; [Smith, David] Kaiser Permanente Ctr Hlth Res, Portland, OR USA",Kaiser Permanente; Kaiser Permanente,"Xu, S (通讯作者)，Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Inst Hlth Res, 10065 E Harvard Ave, Denver, CO 80111 USA.",stan.xu@kp.org,,,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [R21DK075076],National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)),Source of financial support: Diabetes and Drug-Associated Hyperkalemia: Effect of Laboratory Monitoring is supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) under the following grant number: R21DK075076.,,21,446,480,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2010,13.0,2,,,,,273,277,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00671.x,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,557KP,19912596.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274668300015,0

The model consists of structural equations for pretreatment (remembered) and posttreatment (decision) utilities and explicitly represents their correlations, and measurement equations expressing the choice and the pretreatment and posttreatment happiness measures as a function of the corresponding utilities.

The knowledge of degradation rate of starch particles in the rumen is needed to enhance micro-bacterial protein synthesis and energy supply for dairy cows. The washout of very small particles of starch (M-fraction) in the rumen prevents determination of its degradation rate in situ. However, it is possible to measure in vitro degradation rate of both a non-washable, potentially degradable fraction (D) and the M fraction. Centrifugation appeared to be a faster, easier and more reliable method to collect the M fraction of various cereal grains compared to filtration. Medium test bags of 50 cm by 33.3 cm were found to be the most effective for collection of M and D fractions in maize, peas and barley. Results obtained with in vitro incubation with amyloglucosidase did not present satisfactory starch degradation curves. Further research will be conducted to improve this technique, or to replace it with an alternative method, such as in vitro incubation in rumen fluid.","[Cermakova, J.; Dolezal, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Cermakova, J.; Kudrna, V.] Inst Anim Sci, Bangkok 10400, Thailand",Mendel University in Brno,"Cermákova, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",jana.cermakova@mendelu.cz,"Doležal, Petr/K-9914-2018",,Institutional research plan [MSM 6215648905],Institutional research plan,This study was supported by the Institutional research plan MSM 6215648905 - Biological and technological aspects of sustainability of controlled ecosystems and their adaptability to climate change.,,18,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,211,221,,,,,,11,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800025,0

We contribute to this debate by investigating the impact of social capital on self-reported health for eight Countries from the Commonwealth of Independent States. We rely on three indicators or social capital at the individual level (trust, participation in local organisations, social isolation) and employ alternative procedures to estimate consistently the impact of social capital on health. The three social capital indicators are choice variables and are hence, by definition, endogenously determined. We attempt to circumvent the endogeneity problems by using instrumental variable estimates. Our results show that the individual degree Of trust is positively and significantly correlated with health, this being true with least squares estimators as well as when relying oil instrumental variable estimators with (and without) community fixed effects. Similarly, social isolation is negatively and significantly associated with health, irrespective of the procedure of estimation. Oil the other hand, the effect of being a member of a Putnamesque organisation is more ambiguous and usually not significantly related to health.

However, the conceptualization of intangible cultural heritage (ICH) especially through a paradigm of safeguarding and archive, that embodies a preservationist ethos, has in itself potential limitations that urge us to challenge. In this paper, I defend a re-conceptualization of the ICH that reformulates the interaction between the traditional and the contemporary. Then, the implications of that are analysed in terms of Museum activities, offering some strategies so that the museum institution is no longer the Mausoleum referred by Theodor Adorn [1967], celebrating only the survival of the past. On the contrary, the Museum must also be able to contribute towards the flourishing and renovation of contemporary cultural contexts, thus becoming an effective local development agent.","[Duarte, A.] Fdn Univ Porto, Fac Arts, Oporto, Portugal",,,,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,10,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,855,864,,,,,,10,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291664400094,0

We estimate a number of duration of life models that control for unobserved family heterogeneity. Our results confirm that childhood conditions such as household income and the quality of the home environment are significant predictors of longevity. Importantly, however, the role of socioeconomic status appears to differ across cause of death, with household income being a significant predictor of death from smoking-related cancer. Moreover, we find that (I) poor housing conditions in childhood is associated with reduced longevity, that (2) early doctor-assessed childhood health conditions significantly predict a reduced length of life, that (3) children born in a location with relatively high infant mortality rates live significantly fewer years, and that (4) there is a high correlation in longevity across children from the same family across all causes of death. We estimate that the difference in life expectancy between those with the 'best' and 'worst' observable characteristics is about 9 years, which increases to 20 years when we take into account the 'best' and 'worst' observable and unobservable household characteristics.

The cracking of the coating was verified on both sides of the samples that indicates the unreliability of the hot dip galvanized steel in the locations loaded by the tensile or compressive stress. The way of cracks transmission under the surface is in both cases (tension and pressure) a bit different, but all the cracks has its origin in the transition of phases gamma and delta. The existence of eta phase plays the major role in transmittance of the cracks to the surface of coating and that is why the growing of the intermetallic phases caused by the increased temperature was observed.","[Horak, K.; Cerny, M.; Votava, J.; Fajman, M.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Engn & Automobile Transport, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Horák, K (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Engn & Automobile Transport, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",karel.horak@mendelu.cz; michalc@mendelu.cz; jiri.votava@mendelu.cz; martin.fajman@mendelu.cz,"Votava, Jiri/A-7755-2018; Černý, Michal/A-5510-2018; Fajman, Martin/A-7398-2018","Votava, Jiri/0000-0003-3304-9516; Černý, Michal/0000-0001-8666-4219;",,,,,5,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,517,523,,,,,,7,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800065,0

These WTP values can be used to calculate the costs of travel time variability. We apply the theoretical results to the scheduling model and design the choice experiment using measures of efficiency (S-efficiency and WTP-efficiency). In the simulation exercise, we show that the designs based on these efficiency criteria perform on average better than the designs used in the literature in terms of the WTP for travel time, schedule delay early, and schedule delay late variables. However, the gains in efficiency decrease in the number of respondents. Surprisingly, the orthogonal design performs rather well in the example we demonstrated.","[Koster, Paul; Tseng, Yin-Yen] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Koster, P (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,"Koster, Paul/ISV-5319-2023","Koster, Paul/0000-0002-7775-5044",,,,,25,3,4,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,217,235,,,,,,19,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000366173200010,0

DCMs attributes are based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), Expression Descriptive Units (EDUs) and outputs of AAM. Some behavioural data have been collected using an Internet survey, where respondents are asked to label facial images from the Cohn-Kanade database with expressions. Different models were estimated by likelihood maximization using the obtained data. In a second step, the proposed static discrete choice framework is extended to the dynamic case, which considers facial video instead of images. The model theory is described and another Internet survey is currently conducted in order to obtain expressions labels on videos.

Using a unique data set provided by a large Dutch private insurance company, we assess the determinants of sick leave durations. Our study suggests that several risk factors affect the sick leave durations of self-employed in a similar way as they influence the absence spells of employees according to the literature. For example, the recovery rate decreases with age and claimants suffering from psychological diseases have a lower recovery rate relative to claimants with other disorders. Furthermore, the sick leave durations of self-employed last longer when the economy is booming. In contrast to what the literature generally documents for employees, we do not find any evidence for moral hazard effects with respect to the benefit compensation level. Moreover, the absence spells of self-employed last longer in periods of high unemployment, whereas the opposite effect is usually documented for employees. We do not establish any significant gender differences in the sick leave durations of self-employed. Contract-specific factors Such as insurance brand and deferment period are typical characteristics of insurance contracts for self-employed and play an important role in explaining their sick leave durations. Finally, the introduction of insurer-based case management significantly increased the recovery rate of self-employed with an ongoing spell up to 1 year. By contrast, case management did not succeed in improving the recovery rate of claimants trapped in long-term sickness absence. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A survey involving 1000 respondents (age 2: 15 years) was conducted in the central region of Thailand. A 42-item pre-tested questionnaire to assess general and specific knowledge of diabetes (e.g., risk factors, symptoms, treatment, etc.) was administered. Scores of <50%, >= 50% to <80%, and >= 80% were classified as poor, fair, and good, respectively, according to expert consensus. Results: Mean age of respondents was 33.8 years (SD 13.4), with 57.5% being female. Mean diabetes knowledge score was fair: 25.02 of 42 (59.6%), SD 8.35 (19.9%). Respondents performed best in the risk factor section: mean (%) score was 2.88 of 4 (72%), SD 1.11 (27.8%); and worst in the section on diabetes in women: mean (%) score was 0.82 of 3 (27.3%), SD 0.96 (32.0%). In multiple linear regression analyses, education level, older age, own self having diabetes, and having a family member/relative/friend with diabetes were significantly associated with knowledge of diabetes. Conclusions: Knowledge of diabetes among the Thai respondents was fair. Areas of deficiency and factors associated with knowledge of diabetes were identified. Our findings would be useful in informing targeted health education programs.","[Pongmesa, Tipaporn; Li, Shu-Chuen; Wee, Hwee-Lin] Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Sci, Dept Pharm, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Li, Shu-Chuen] Univ Newcastle, Discipline Pharm & Expt Pharmacol, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia; [Wee, Hwee-Lin] Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, Singapore 0316, Singapore",National University of Singapore; University of Newcastle; Singapore General Hospital,"Wee, HL (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Sci, Dept Pharm, 18 Sci Dr 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore.",phawhl@nus.edu.sg,"LI, SHU CHUEN/G-7911-2013; Wee, Hwee Lin/D-4126-2012; Wee, H/JXY-0919-2024","Wee, Hwee Lin/0000-0002-7150-1801;",,,,,19,9,11,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,,,3,2,,S110,S113,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00641.x,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,524KG,20586971.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272141600024,0

J,"Madden, D",,,,"Madden, David",,,"MENTAL STRESS IN IRELAND, 1994-2000: A STOCHASTIC DOMINANCE APPROACH",HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,GHQ; mental stress; dominance; decomposition,DETAILED WAGE DECOMPOSITIONS; GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE; IDENTIFICATION; UNEMPLOYMENT; HAPPINESS; VALIDITY; POVERTY; GHQ,The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) is frequently used as a measure of mental well-being with those people with values below a certain threshold regarded as suffering from mental stress. Comparison of mental stress levels across populations may then be sensitive to the chosen threshold. This paper uses stochastic dominance techniques to show that mental stress fell in Ireland over the 1994-2000 period regardless of the threshold chosen. Decomposition techniques suggest that changes in the proportion unemployed and in the protective effect of income education and marital Status upon mental health were the principal factors underlying this fall.

These approaches have been rewarded with well-developed and validated tools. However, it is now commonly noted that there has been limited uptake of economic analysis into actual priority setting and resource allocation decisions made by health-care systems. There seem to be substantial organizational and political barriers. The authors argue in this paper that understanding and addressing these barriers will depend upon the application of qualitative research methodologies. Some efforts in this direction have been attempted; however these are theoretically under-developed and seldom rooted in any of the established qualitative research traditions. Two such approaches - narrative inquiry and discourse analysis - are highlighted here. These are illustrated with examples drawn from a real-world priority setting study. The examples demonstrate how such conceptually powerful qualitative traditions produce distinctive findings that offer unique insight into organizational contexts and decision-maker behavior. We argue that such investigations offer untapped bcilefits for the study of organizational priority setting and thus should be pursued more frequently by the health economics research community.

In the paper we seek to assess some of the strengths and weaknesses of the program using a panel of national-representative, household Survey data that were collected in 2005 and early 2008. According to our data, we confirm the recent reports by the Ministry of Health that there have been substantial improvements to the NCMS program in terms of coverage and participation. We also show that rural individuals also perceive an improvement in service by 2007. While the progress of the NCMS program is clear, there are still weaknesses. Most importantly, the program clearly does not meet one of its key goals of providing insurance against catastrophic illnesses. On average, individuals that required inpatient treatment in 2007 were reimbursed for 15% of their expenditures. Although this is higher than in 2004, on average, as the severity of the illness (in terms of expenditures oil health care) rose, the real reimbursement rate (reimbursement amount/total expenditure oil medical care) fell. The real reimbursement rate for illnesses that required expenditures between 4000 and 10000 yuan (over 10000 yuan) was only 11% (8%). Our analysis shows that one of the limiting factors is constrained funding.

This assumption is challenged by preference reversals. Previous studies have observed preference reversals between choice and matching tasks and between choice and ranking tasks. We present a preference reversal that is entirely derived from choices, the basic primitive of economics and utility theory. The preference reversal was observed in two studies regarding health states after stroke. Both Studies involved large representative samples from the Spanish population, interviewed professionally, and face-to-face. Possible explanations for the preference reversal are the anticipation of disappointment and elation in risky choice and the impact of ethical considerations about the value of life.

In 2006, preliminary pharmacoeconomic guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary research team. Their feasibility was tested and discussed with all stakeholders. The guidelines were adapted and finalized in 2008. The literature review should be transparent and reproducible. PE should be performed from the perspective of the health-care payer, including the governmental payer and the patient. The target population should reflect the population identified for routine use. The comparator to be considered in the evaluation is the treatment most likely to be replaced. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses are accepted as reference case techniques, under specific conditions. A final end point-as opposed to a surrogate end point-should be used in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). For the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), a generic quality-of-life measure should be used. PE should in principle apply a lifetime horizon. Application of shorter time horizons requires appropriate justification. Uncertainty around the ICER should always be assessed. Costs and outcomes should be discounted at 3% and 1.5%, respectively. The current guidelines are the result of a constructive collaboration between the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre, the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance and the pharmaceutical industry. A point of special attention is the accessibility of existing Belgian resource use data for PE. As PE should serve Belgian health-care policy, they should preferably be based on the best available data.","[Cleemput, Irina] Belgian Hlth Care Knowledge Ctr KCE, Adm Ctr Kruidtuin, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",,"Cleemput, I (通讯作者)，Belgian Hlth Care Knowledge Ctr KCE, Adm Ctr Kruidtuin, Door Bldg,10th Floor,Kruidtuinlaan 55, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",irina.cleemput@kce.fgov.be,,"Cleemput, Irina/0000-0003-4479-8950; Vrijens, France/0000-0002-8744-6499",,,,,26,26,26,1,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4,,,,,441,449,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00469.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,19900251.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266467800009,0

Our aim was to examine the psychometric properties of the Japanese version of the SF-8 instrument using methodology based on nominal categories model. Using data from an adjusted random sample from a nationally representative panel, the nominal categories modeling was applied to SF-8 items to characterize coverage of the latent trait (theta). Probabilities for response choices were described as functions on the latent trait. Information functions were generated based on the estimated item parameters. A total of 3344 participants (53%, women; median age, 35 years) provided responses. One factor was retained (eigenvalue, 4.65; variance proportion of 0.58) and used as theta. All item response category characteristic curves satisfied the monotonicity assumption in accurate order with corresponding ordinal responses. Four items (general health, bodily pain, vitality, and mental health) cover most of the spectrum of theta, while the other four items (physical function, role physical [role limitations because of physical health], social functioning, and role emotional [role limitations because of emotional problems] ) cover most of the negative range of theta. Information function for all items combined peaked at -0.7 of theta (information = 18.5) and decreased with increasing theta. The SF-8 instrument performs well among those with poor QOL across the continuum of the latent trait and thus can recognize more effectively persons with relatively poorer QOL than those with relatively better QOL.","[Tokuda, Yasuharu] St Lukes Int Hosp, St Lukes Life Sci Inst, Ctr Clin Epidemiol, Chuo City, Tokyo 1048560, Japan",St. Luke's International Hospital,"Tokuda, Y (通讯作者)，St Lukes Int Hosp, St Lukes Life Sci Inst, Ctr Clin Epidemiol, 9-1 Akashi Cho, Chuo City, Tokyo 1048560, Japan.",tokuyasu@orange.ocn.ne.jp,"Jacobs, Joshua/AAI-3787-2020; Ohde, Sachiko/AAC-6496-2019","Jacobs, Joshua/0000-0003-4567-1927; Ohde, Sachiko/0000-0001-9137-0047; Takahashi, Osamu/0000-0002-6454-3990",St. Luke's Life Science Institute,St. Luke's Life Science Institute(St. Luke's Life Science Institute (SLLSI)),"We wish to thank Kenji Sakurai, MD, FACS, for his support of our research.

Double-difference estimates show the program led to large increases in vaccination coverage, and these resulted in vaccination levels greater than 95% tot some vaccines.

Our work offers three important innovations. First, we use the exact addresses of mothers to select those closest to air monitors to improve the accuracy of air quality exposure. Second, we include maternal fixed effects to control for unobserved characteristics of mothers. Third, we examine interactions of air pollution with smoking and other risk factors for poor infant health outcomes. We find consistently negative effects of exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), both during and after birth, with effects considerably larger for smokers and older mothers. Since automobiles are the main source of carbon monoxide emissions, our results have important implications for regulation of automobile emissions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

First, we show that if some asset always pays a nonnegative dividend, then its price changes sign across states if and only if the Perron root of every agent's matrix of intertemporal rates of substitution exceeds one. Second, we provide sufficient conditions in terms of dividends and asset prices such that, keeping asset prices fixed, a conditionally Pareto improving allocation is induced by a stationary reassignment of a single asset. When taken together the results show that when for some agent the Perron root exceeds one, the existence of an asset that pays a strictly positive dividend in every state is sufficient to induce an improvement.

The Role of Third-Party Technology Assessment to Inform Health Systems' Decision-Making about the Funding of Health Technologies,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,cost-effectiveness analysis; decision models; health economics methods; priority setting; UK NHS,COST-EFFECTIVENESS; CLINICAL-EXCELLENCE; FRAMEWORK,"There is an increasing number of health-care systems using economic evaluations to inform decisions about the reimbursement of health technologies. There are usually two separate elements of this process: assembling relevant evidence and undertaking analyses (technology assessment), and decision-making. In most systems, technology assessment is undertaken by the manufacturer of the technology. In a few, third-party assessment is used. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence used a combination of third-party and manufacturer assessments between 1999 and 2005. After this point, a Single Technology Appraisal program (using manufacturer-based assessment) was instituted for some technologies. Here the role of third-party assessment is considered in this from of decision-making. The article reviews the requirements of economic evaluation to support decision-making, and considers the extent to which each type of assessment is likely to meet these requirements. It also attempts to address whether the two forms of assessment differ in their impact on decision-making using a comparison of the decisions made by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (under its multiple-technology appraisal system) and the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), which relies on manufacturer assessment. The comparison is limited by the small number of technologies considered by both bodies. Nevertheless, it suggests that there are potentially important differences between the two bodies, with NICE generally placing more restrictions of the use of technologies. The article concludes that there are potential advantages to third-party assessment, but its cost and timing may preclude its use for all new technologies. A hybrid arrangement is suggested where third-party assessment is used in particular circumstances.","[Hawkins, Neil; Sculpher, Mark] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Barbieri, Marco] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",University of York - UK; Pompeu Fabra University,"Sculpher, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",mjs23@york.ac.uk,,"Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913; Hawkins, Neil/0000-0003-3199-221X",UK NHS Health Technology Assessment Program; UK's Medical Research Council; MRC [MC_U145079308] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_U145079308] Funding Source: researchfish,UK NHS Health Technology Assessment Program; UK's Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),Source of financial support: The Centre for Health Economics is a Technology Assessment Review Group and an Evidence Review Group for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence funded by the UK NHS Health Technology Assessment Program.

In contrast, the employment provision of the 1996 Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) in Britain has received little attention. Exploiting both pooled and longitudinal data, this paper provides robust evidence that, similar to the ADA in the USA, the DDA has had no impact on the employment rate of disabled people or possibly worsened it. Possible reasons for this are higher uncertainty around litigation costs, low levels of general awareness about the Act among disabled people and employers, and a lack of financial support.

Strategic interaction determines an allocation of objects, so that evaluation with individual utilities constitute the pay-offs in the derived games. These allocations of objects are obtained through individual demand in a specific market for objects. For the first support result, games in strategic form are derived that exhibit a unique Nash equilibrium and equilibrium payoffs equal the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution of the underlying bargaining problem.

The new versions were validated using patients' daily responses to the questionnaires in a famciclovir study. The HOIQ and HSC were readily adapted into Australian English and were acceptable to patients. Psychometric sample: N = 151; 81 (54%) male; mean age 39.9 +/- 11.6 years; mean outbreaks 5.1 +/- 3.0 per year. Internal consistency was good (alphas at outbreak 1 ranged 0.84-0.90 HOIQ and 0.73-0.87 HSC). Rasch analysis showed item stability over time. Correlations between HOIQ and HSC ranged from 0.46 to 0.60. Both scales distinguished outbreak healing presence or absence at day 6 (P = 0.001), and the HOIQ scale distinguished between symptom severity groups (P < 0.001). Scale scores declined significantly over study duration, exhibiting large effect sizes. The paper-and-pencil HOIQ and HSC were reliable, valid, and responsive in a clinical trial setting.

J,"Wagstaff, A",,,,"Wagstaff, Adam",,,Correcting the concentration index: A comment,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,Health inequality; Concentration index,HEALTH; INEQUALITIES,"In a recent article in this journal, Erreygers [Erreygers, G., 2008. Correcting the concentration index, Journal of Health Economics] has proposed a new measure of income-related inequality to overcome three shortcomings of the concentration index (CI). I think Erreygers is absolutely right to probe on these issues, and si welcome his generalization of my normalization which was specific to the case of a binary health indicator. However, in have misgivings about his paper. His goal of correcting to CI so to make it usable with interval-scale variables seems misguided. The CI reflects a commitment on the part of the analyst to measuring relative inequality. Armed only with an interval-scale variable, one simply has to accept that one can meaningfully measure only differences and therefore settle for measuring absolute inequality. Erreygers, index inevitably ends up as a measure of absolute inequality. His objection to my approach to getting round the bound problem is that my normalization of the CI does not produce a measure of absolute inequality. But that was never my intention! In this comment i also show that - somewhat paradoxically at first glance - my index is also not a pure index of relative inequality. This seems to be an inevitable consequence of tackling the bounds issue. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

First, we show that the presence of such effects is a necessary and sufficient condition for simultaneous exits. This allows us to set up a nonparametric test for the presence of such influences, which is robust to multiple equilibria.

NEW EVIDENCE USING PANEL DATA AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF HEALTH,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,job satisfaction; well-being; health; panel data analysis,NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY; NEUROTICISM; ANXIETY,"This paper evaluates the relationship between job satisfaction and measures of health of workers using the German Socio-Economic Panel. Methodologically, it addresses two important design problems encountered frequently in the literature: (a) cross-sectional causality problems and (b) the absence of objective measures of physical health that complement self-reported measures of health status. Not only does using the panel structure with individual fixed effects mitigate the bias from omitting unobservable personal psycho-social characteristics, but employing more objective health measures Such as health-system contacts and disability addresses such measurement problems relating to self-report assessments of health status. We find a positive link between job satisfaction (and changes over time therein) and subjective health measures (and changes therein); that is, employees with higher or improved job satisfaction levels feel healthier and are more satisfied with their health. This observation also holds true for more Objective Measures of health. Particularly, improvements in job satisfaction over time appear to prevent workers from (further) health deterioration.

For cardiovascular rehospitalizations 0, 1, 2 and >= 3, the associated utilities were 0.88, 0.85, 0.84, and 0.82 (P-value < 0.001 for trend). NYHA class and number of cardiovascular rehospitalizations are established proxies for CHF progression and can be linked to utilities when used as health states in a Markov model.

All of them imply lower material payoffs and lower overall utility for a large majority of members compared to equilibria that also represent equilibria without reciprocity. We discuss mechanisms such as incentive contracts that may eliminate the negative effects of reciprocity. In a dynamic framework we show that psychological logrolling equilibria may exist, where some agents perceive others as kind and therefore accept projects that are detrimental to themselves but beneficial to others.

A joint estimation procedure provides us with an asymptotically most efficient estimator, but it is not always feasible, due to the 'curse of dimensionality' in the matrix of transition probabilities. A two-step estimation procedure, which ignores potential correlation between the latent state variables, suffers less from the 'curse of dimensionality', and it provides a reasonable alternative to the joint estimation procedure. In addition, our Monte Carlo experiments show that the two-step estimation procedure can be more efficient than the joint estimation procedure in finite samples, when there is zero or low correlation between the latent state variables.

The frequently used ratio for dialysis has, however, not been updated to reflect more recently available data on dialysis. We developed a computer simulation model for the end-stage renal disease population and compared cost, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy of current dialysis practice relative to three less costly alternatives and to no dialysis. We estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for these alternatives relative to the next least costly alternative and no dialysis and analyzed the population distribution of the ratios. Model parameters and costs were estimated using data from the Medicare population and a large integrated health-care delivery system between 1996 and 2003. The sensitivity of results to model assumptions was tested using 38 scenarios of one-way sensitivity analysis, where parameters informing the cost, utility, mortality and morbidity, etc. components of the model were by perturbed +/-50%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dialysis of current practice relative to the next least costly alternative is on average $129,090 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) ($61,294 per year), but its distribution within the population is wide; the interquartile range is $71,890 per QALY, while the 1st and 99th percentiles are $65,496 and $488,360 per QALY, respectively. Higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were associated with older age and more comorbid conditions. Sensitivity to model parameters was comparatively small, with most of the scenarios leading to a change of less than 10% in the ratio. The value of a statistical year of life implied by dialysis practice currently averages $129,090 per QALY ($61,294 per year), but is distributed widely within the dialysis population. The spread suggests that coverage decisions using dialysis as the benchmark may need to incorporate percentile values (which are higher than the average) to be consistent with the Rawlsian principles of justice of preserving the rights and interests of society's most vulnerable patient groups.","[Lee, Chris P.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chertow, Glenn M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Div Nephrol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zenios, Stefanos A.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Lee, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3730 Walnut St,Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",cpclee@wharton.upenn.edu,,"Chertow, Glenn/0000-0002-7599-0534",NIH-NIDDK [RO1 DK58411],NIH-NIDDK(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)),Source of financial support: This study was supported in part by NIH-NIDDK RO1 DK58411 from the National Institute of Health.,,27,143,157,1,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,80,87,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00401.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,19911442.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262696800012,0

In Klaipeda city the forest area increased to 2 % during period 1986-2005: from 18.4 % in 1986 to 20.4 % in 2005. The results correspond with the official statistics about forest area growth in all Lithuania and in Klaipeda region. The main identified factors of forest cover changes are political, economical, and social. Forest recovering programs and decrease of agricultural activities in the past decade have a very important role on increase of forested areas.","[Lekaviciute, Jurgita] Lithuanian Univ Agr, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Gadal, Sebastien] Univ Versailles St Quentin Yvelines UVSQ, Versailles, France",Vytautas Magnus University; Universite Paris Saclay,"Lekaviciute, J (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Univ Agr, Kaunas, Lithuania.",jlekaviciute@gmail.com; sebastien.gadal@uvsq.fr,"GADAL, Sébastien/L-2835-2016","GADAL, Sébastien/0000-0002-6472-9955",,,,,20,0,0,0,2,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,241,246,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Engineering, Environmental; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Engineering; Public Administration,BNL17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274845700043,0

Climate change may add to that stress by affecting an array of biological processes, although the range of some subtropical and tropical species may expand northward in the state. It is expected to trigger sea level rise and changes in hurricanes and precipitation levels in Florida and elsewhere. Perhaps the most significant impacts of climate change on fishery species will also associated with changes in seagrasses and mangroves that function as Essential Nursery Habitats. Seagrasses in estuarine and coastal areas are limited by water depth and light penetration. Increases in sea level and in precipitation-induced turbidity may restrict the extent of seagrass habitats and their role in fishery production. Expanded efforts to reduce nutrient and sediment loading into seagrass habitats may help minimize the potential loss of a valuable fish nursery habitat. Mangroves have also been affected by human activities, and are the subject of restoration efforts in many areas. Potential sea level rise may cause an expansion of mangrove habitats in the Everglades, at the expense of freshwater habitats. This potential tradeoff of habitats should be considered by the water flow and habitat restoration programs in the Everglades.","[Shenker, Jonathan M.] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",Florida Institute of Technology,,Shenker@fit.edu,"Shenker, Jonathan/HGT-9927-2022","Shenker, Jonathan/0000-0002-7013-0877",,,,,37,5,5,2,40,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-0694-0,AIP CONF PROC,,,2009,1157.0,,,,,,39,47,,,,,,9,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BLH26,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270167600006,0

The main feature of this model is that the outcome variable is only partially observed. We first present a Gibbs sampling algorithm for a model in which the selection and outcome errors are normally distributed. The algorithm is then extended to analyze models that are characterized by nonnormality. Specifically, we use a Dirichlet process prior and model the distribution of the unobservables as a mixture of normal distributions with a random number of components. The posterior distribution in this model can simultaneously detect the presence of selection effects and departures from normality. Our methods are illustrated using some simulated data and an abstract from the RAND health insurance experiment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

If the preferences of the society are taken into account in such a decision-making process, it is generally recommended that these values should be elicited by using a generic health-related quality-of-life instrument, such as the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Objectives: To estimate a set of social values for EQ-5D questionnaire based on the time trade-off valuation technique for use in Chile. Methods: A valuation questionnaire was applied to a probabilistic sample of 2000 individuals, aged 20 years or older, living in the Metropolitan region. The fieldwork took place during October to November 2008. Utility weights for 42 health states were calculated directly by the application of time trade-off. Several random effect and ordinary least-squares regression models were fitted to these valuations to predict the full set of 243 health states generated by the EQ-5D system. The best model was chosen by applying criteria of parsimony, goodness of fit, and prediction capacity. Results: The selected regression model was robust and showed better predictive characteristics than others reported in similar studies conducted elsewhere. The chosen regression model showed a R(2) of 0.34, mean absolute error of 0.017, and high predictive capacity. Conclusions: This study provides an EQ-5D social value set for domestic use in Chile. Our results differ from those reported in other countries, justifying the need to perform local studies that adequately reflect societal health preferences.","[Zarate, Victor; Kind, Paul] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Valenzuela, Paulina; Vignau, Alberto] DATAVOZ STATCOM, Santiago, Chile; [Olivares-Tirado, Pedro; Munoz, Alberto] Superintendencia Salud Chile, Dept Estudios & Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile",University of York - UK,"Zarate, V (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",victor.zarate@york.ac.uk,"Kind, Paul/E-9715-2015; Zarate, Victor/N-8094-2017","Kind, Paul/0000-0003-2377-1652; Zarate, Victor/0000-0001-9145-3694; Olivares-Tirado, Pedro/0000-0001-5783-2244",Chilean Superintendency of Health,Chilean Superintendency of Health,"Source of financial support: Funding for this project was provided by the Chilean Superintendency of Health, a governmental institution responsible for the oversight of health insurances.",,10,50,59,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2011,14.0,8,,,,,1135,1141,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.09.002,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BM,22152184.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081900021,0

NFP hospitals serve as a benchmark, being very similar to public hospitals, but without political influence on their hiring. Public-hospital employment is positively correlated with the local unemployment rate, whereas no such relationship is found in other hospitals. This is consistent with public hospitals providing employment in depressed areas. We appeal to the Political Science literature and calculate local political allegiance, using expert evaluations on various parties' political positions and local election results. The relationship between public-hospital employment and local unemployment is stronger the more left-wing the local municipality. This latter result holds especially when electoral races are tight, consistent with a concern for re-election. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This transformation has no theoretical justification and motivates this re-examination. Using the publically available dataset, we compared three alternative random utility models: instant (IRUM), angular (ARUM), and episodic (ERUM) models. Each leads to a distinct econometric estimator: mean ratio, ratio of means, and coefficient, respectively. IRUM suggests that 203 of the 243 EQ-5D states are worse-than-dead, which has little face validity compared to ARUM and ERUM (42 and 3 WTD states). ARUM and ERUM estimates are proportionally related such that losses in QALYs are approximately 37% larger under ARUM than ERUM. Compared to ERUM, economic evaluations using ARUM estimates emphasize quality of life, and this difference may influence policy decisions. Either ERUM or ARUM values sets are recommended over the original, transformed set. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Evidence of the efficacy of treatments was identified from two previous systematic reviews. We used Bayesian evidence synthesis to estimate relative treatment effects based on direct evidence, indirect evidence, and both pooled together. We checked for inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence and explored the role of one specific trial using cross-validation. A subsequent review identified further studies not available at the time of the original analysis. We repeated the analyses on the enlarged evidence base. Results: We found substantial inconsistency in the original evidence base. The median odds ratio of FN for primary pegfilgrastim versus no primary G-CSF was 0.06 (95% credible interval: 0.02-0.19) based on direct evidence, but 0.27 (95% credible interval: 0.13-0.53) based on indirect evidence (P value for consistency hypothesis 0.027). The additional trials were consistent with the earlier indirect, rather than the direct, evidence, and there was no inconsistency between direct and indirect estimates in the updated evidence. The earlier inconsistency was due to one trial comparing primary pegfilgrastim with no primary G-CSF. Predictive cross-validation showed that this study was inconsistent with the evidence as a whole and with other trials making this comparison. Conclusions: Both the Cochrane Handbook and the NICE Methods Guide express a preference for direct evidence.

Esophageal Doppler monitoring measures blood flow by ultrasound waves. This work investigates the cost-effectiveness of this procedure during colorectal resection. Methods: Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of esophageal Doppler monitoring used in colorectal resection were conducted to help determine its cost-effectiveness. An analytical decision model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of strategies involving conventional clinical assessment with or without the measurement of central venous pressure, with or without esophageal Doppler monitoring. Avoided mortality and avoided major complications were used as measures of clinical effectiveness. Results: In the meta-analyses comparing conventional clinical assessment plus central venous pressure monitoring with or without esophageal Doppler monitoring, statistically significant differences in total and major complications favoring the use of Doppler were found. No differences were seen in mortality. The use of esophageal Doppler monitoring was associated with lower costs, mainly due to fewer complications, shorter hospital stays and shorter surgery times. Conclusions: Although the information regarding the clinical effectiveness of esophageal Doppler monitoring in colorectal resection is limited, strategies including this form of blood flow monitoring may be cost-effective. Further comparisons of Doppler monitoring against other hemodynamic monitoring systems should be undertaken.","[Maeso, Sergio; Callejo, Daniel; Blasco, Juan A.; Andradas, Elena] Agencia Lain Entralgo, Unidad Evaluac Tecnol Sanitarias, Madrid 28013, Spain; [Hernandez, Rodolfo] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Aberdeen, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Maeso, S (通讯作者)，Agencia Lain Entralgo, Unidad Evaluac Tecnol Sanitarias, C Gran Via 27, Madrid 28013, Spain.",smaemar@hotmail.com,,"Blasco Amaro, Juan Antonio/0000-0002-5500-8187; Maeso Martinez, Sergio/0000-0001-6303-8207; Hernandez, Rodolfo/0000-0003-2619-8230","Chief Scientist Office [HERU1, HERU2] Funding Source: Medline; Chief Scientist Office [HERU2, HERU1] Funding Source: researchfish",Chief Scientist Office; Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland),,,32,2,2,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2011,14.0,6,,,,,818,826,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.02.1176,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BJ,21914501.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081600004,0

To account for serial correlation in the residuals of the multi-period direct forecasting models we propose a new SURE-based estimation method and modified Akaike information criteria for model selection. Empirical analysis of the 170 variables studied by Marcellino, Stock and Watson (2006) shows that information in factors helps improve forecasting performance for most types of economic variables although it can also lead to larger biases.

We take departure in medical guidelines prescribing acceptable waiting times for different medical descriptions. Allocating ICD10 codes to the medical descriptions, we are able to compare actual waiting times to the recommended maximum waiting times. This way we use the medical guidelines as a tool for monitoring prioritisation in the health sector. In an application, using data from the Norwegian Patient Register, we test statistically for compliance with the guidelines. The results indicate that patients suffering from the most severe conditions are receiving too low priority in the Norwegian health-care sector relative to patients of lower priority.

Economic models are often hindered by the lack of trials directly comparing outcomes between relevant alternative therapies. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ustekinumab versus etanercept among adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis based on a Phase 3 head-to-head trial. Methods: The Markov model incorporates trial data from the Active Comparator (CNTO 1275/Enbrel) Psoriasis Trial study (ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 0 and 4; etanercept 50 mg biweekly) to follow patient response to initial treatment using the modeling approach developed by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, and often cited by others conducting economic analyses of psoriasis. Beyond the initial trial period, the Canadian model extrapolates results up to 10 years. Results: Over the 10-year time horizon of the model, the mean annual costs were $16,807 for ustekinumab (45 mg) and $19,525 for etanercept (50 mg). The incremental difference in costs and utilities remained in favour of ustekinumab across a range of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: This model highlights the advantage of having head-to-head comparative trial data relevant to the at-risk population. Our model shows that ustekinumab is more cost-effective than etanercept for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.","[Pan, Feng; Brown, Ruth] United BioSource Corp, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Brazier, Nicole C.; Jivraj, Farah] Janssen Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Shear, Neil H.] Univ Toronto, Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Schenkel, Brad] Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Serv LLC, Horsham, PA USA",United Biosource Corporation; Johnson & Johnson; University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Research Institute; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA,"Pan, F (通讯作者)，United BioSource Corp, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",feng.pan@unitedbiosource.com,,,Janssen Inc.,Janssen Inc.(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc),Source of financial support: Provided by Janssen Inc.,,13,23,23,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,,,,652,656,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.01.006,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BG,21839402.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081300005,0

Dyspepsia represents up to 8.3% of all primary care physician visits and causes huge economic costs to patients and to the economy as a whole. The aim of this study was to measure the influence of dyspepsia on work productivity of people within the Brazilian workforce. Methods: Adult patients were enrolled if they met the Roma III criteria for uninvestigated dyspepsia. All patients answered a demographic questionnaire. Productivity impairment was measured by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire. Subjects underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and were classified as having functional or organic dyspepsia. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital de Cl nicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil. Results: Eight hundred fifty patients with dyspepsia were evaluated: 628 were women (73.9%); mean age was 46.4 +/- 12.9 years; 387 (45.5%) were active workers. Among active workers, 32.2% mentioned that dyspepsia had caused absenteeism from work during the preceding week and 78% reported a reduction of the work productivity (presenteeism). The lost work productivity score was 35.7% among all employed patients. The affect on work productivity was similar between patients with functional or organic dyspepsia. Conclusions: Our study showed an important influence of dyspepsia on work productivity. We did not find any statistically significant difference on the influence on work between patients with organic dyspepsia and functional dyspepsia. The social impact of these findings is underscored by taking into account the prevalence (up to 40%) of this condition in Brazil.","[Sander, Guilherme Becker] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Sch Med, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Mazzoleni, Luiz Edmundo; de Magalhaes Francesconi, Carlos Ferrnando] Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Dept Gastroenterol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Balbinotto, Giacomo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Fac Econ, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Mazzoleni, Felipe] Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Dept Internal Med, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Wortmann, Andre Castagna] Univ Caxias Sul, Sch Med, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Klamt, Alexandre Luis] Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Dept Gastroenterol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Milbradt, Tobias Cancian] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Sch Med, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Med, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade de Caxias do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Sander, GB (通讯作者)，Av Bage 919-202, BR-90460080 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",gbsander@gmail.com,"Klamt, Andreas/GRO-3684-2022; Milbradt, Tobias/AAE-7179-2019; Mazzoleni, Luiz/AAA-7128-2019","Milbradt, Tobias/0000-0002-1730-9376; Klamt, Andreas/0000-0002-5320-6219",Ache Laboratorios Farmaceuticos,Ache Laboratorios Farmaceuticos,A gastroscope was obtained through an unrestricted donation from Ache Laboratorios Farmaceuticos.,,20,51,53,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,S,,,S126,S129,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.021,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BE,21839884.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081000028,0

We performed an economic evaluation to compare resource use and effectiveness of reamed and unreamed intramedullary nailing using a cost-utility analysis. Methods: We calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each patient from a self-administered health utility index 3 questionnaire for the first 12 months following the intramedullary nailing. A convenience sample of 235 SPRINT patients provided data on costs associated with health care resource utilization. All costs are reported in Canadian dollars for the 2008 financial year. Results: We found incremental effects of -0.017 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.021-0.058) and -0.002 (95% CI -0.060-0.062) QALYs for patients treated with reamed compared with unreamed intramedullary nails in closed and open fractures, respectively. The incremental costs for reamed compared with unreamed intramedullary nailing were $51 Canadian dollars (95% CI -$2298-$2400) in closed tibial fractures and $2546 Canadian dollars (95% CI -$1773-$6864) in open tibial fractures. Unreamed nailing dominated reamed nailing for both closed and open tibial fractures; however, the cost and the utility results had high variability.

We supply a generalized definition of marginal utility of wealth based on the Frechet differential of the value operator that maps time t wealth into maximum conditional remaining utility. We show that in this general case all state-price densities/stochastic discount factors are fully characterized by the marginal utility of wealth of optimizing agents even if their preferences for intermediate consumption are highly irregular. Our result requires only the strict monotonicity of preferences for terminal wealth and the existence of a portfolio with positive and bounded gross returns. We also relate our generalized notion of marginal utility of wealth to the equivalent martingale measures/risk-neutral probabilities commonly employed in derivative asset pricing theory.

Larger RCTs have been relatively short in duration, and have reported mixed results regarding symptom control and effect on quality of life (QOL). Economic evaluations have reported conflicting results. Objectives: To determine the incremental cost-utility of LNF versus PPI for treating patients with chronic and controlled GERD over 3 years from the societal perspective. Methods: Economic evaluation was conducted alongside a RCT that enrolled 104 patients from October 2000 to September 2004. Primary study outcome was GERD symptoms (secondary outcomes included QOL and cost-utility). Resource utilization and QOL data collected at regular follow-up intervals determined incremental cost/QALY gained. Stochastic uncertainty was assessed using bootstrapping and methodologic assumptions were assessed using sensitivity analysis. Results: No statistically significant differences in GERD symptom scores, but LNF did result in fewer heartburn days and improved QOL. Costs were higher for LNF patients by $3205/patient over 3 years but QOL was also higher as measured by either QOL instrument. Based on total costs, incremental cost-utility of LNF was $29,404/QALY gained using the Health Utility Index 3. Cost-utility results were sensitive to the utility instrument used ($29,404/QALY for Health Utility Index 3, $31,117/QALY for the Short Form 6D, and $76,310/QALY for EuroQol 5D) and if current lower prices for PPIs were used in the analysis. Conclusions: Results varied depending on resource use/costs included in the analysis, the QOL instrument used, and the cost of PPIs; however, LNF was generally found to be a cost-effective treatment for patients with symptomatic controlled GERD requiring long-term management.

The role of cognition in health determination has received only limited empirical attention, and even less is known about how race may affect this relationship. Using data from the NLSY, I find that while Whites with higher cognitive achievement scores tend to report substantially better general health, this relationship is far weaker or wholly absent among Blacks. Further tests suggest that about 35% of this racial difference can be explained by behavioral decisions during adulthood, and that another portion of the disparity may trace back to prenatal and early childhood experiences. The paper closes by noting that its results are broadly consistent with explanations of the racial health gap that emphasize entrenched forms of racial discrimination. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Based on an approximate foundation due to Myerson (1991) for any two-person bargaining game (S, d) an extensive form game G(s,d) is defined that has an infinity of weakly subgame perfect equilibria whose payoff vectors coincide with that of the sequential Raiffa solution of (S, d). Moreover all those equilibria share the same equilibrium path consisting of proposing the Raiffa solution and accepting it in the first stage of the game. By a modification of G(s,d) the analogous result is provided for subgame perfect equilibria. These results immediately extend to implementation of a sequential Raiffa (solution based) social choice rule in subgame perfect equilibrium. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper evaluates whether National Breast Cancer Awareness Month (NBCAM) has led to increased diagnosis of breast cancer. The analysis examines the number of diagnoses made in November (1 month after NBCAM) during years before and after NBCAM was initiated. We find that from 1993 to 1995, the period when breast cancer advocacy was expanding rapidly into a nationwide movement, NBCAM led to an increase in the number of November diagnoses. During earlier periods (from the mid-1980s to the early-1990s), when breast cancer advocacy was still a nascent grassroots movement, and in later periods, when breast cancer advocacy had become a well-established nationwide cause, there is little evidence that October NBCAM events had an effect on November diagnoses.

Estimated duration of each task is known only with certain probability. Even this method is not quite perfect. It has some pitfalls, which can largely affect results of this method. Uncertainty of a task does not exactly determine whether a task is really critical, or whether it even provides a slack. Activities' propensity to criticalness depends not only on estimates of activity durations, but also on the distance of activity from project beginning, activity's duration, structure of a network diagram, project manager's experiences etc. Each activity is a part of one or more project network paths. Such activity - in case it is not the final one - can be quite long, FS dependent and still not critical because many alternative paths with various duration estimates can influence its criticality.","[Jakubik, Marek] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst Engn, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,,jakubik@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,312,316,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600052,0

In the decision-making process the framing effect arises as a set of opinions and expectations of involved subjects. Each decision-maker has his own preferences and expectations that create his own view (frame). These frames may negatively influence the information sharing in the decision-maker processes and therefore it is important to analyse the framing effect. This paper compares two methods serving to the determination and quantification of the framing effect namely the Analytic Network Process and the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The result of this approach will be the set of weights of all viewpoints included into the frames. Because of the different nature of the inside structure of both methods different results are expected. Values of these weights can serve to analysis of the framing effect, because all subjects in the decision-making process will receive the information about the importance of different viewpoints and then they can rearrange their opinions and expectations. It will have positive impact on the overall outcome of the decision-making process too.","[Rydval, Jan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Syst Engn, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,,rydval@pef.czu.cz,"Rydval, Jan/C-7491-2017","Rydval, Jan/0000-0002-3463-5042",,,,,11,0,0,0,1,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,605,610,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600100,0

It finds that most GBR valuation studies have concentrated on a narrow range of ES (e.g., tourism and fishing) and that little is known about other ES or about the social, temporal, and spatial distribution of those services. Just as the reef provides ES to humans and to other ecosystems, so too does the reef receive a variety of ES from adjoining systems (e.g., mangroves). Yet, despite the evidence that the reef's ability to provide ES has been eroded because of recent changes to adjoining ecosystems, little is known about the value of the ES provided by adjoining systems or about the value of recent changes.

Research was followed by liming of exposed shores, an installation of the aerations towers and by chemical treatment in the river bed. Monitoring of the physico - chemical parameters of the water and regular determination and quantification of the phytoplankton community are necessary parts of all water treatment and measures against cyanobacteria. As shown in this study realized measures have been partly effective. Compare to other summer seasons the quantity of cyanobacteria Microcystis in the water dramatically decreased and did not exceed the limit of World health Organization (WHO) for whole vegetation season. It is positive that these realized measures are meaningful and problem of abnormal cyanobacteria development is solvable, but it is still necessary to improve water quality of whole river basin and reduce the supply of biogenic elements into the Brno reservoir.","[Strakova, L.; Kopp, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Zool Fisheries Hydrobiol & Apiculture, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Straková, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Zool Fisheries Hydrobiol & Apiculture, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",luciestraka@gmail.com,"Kopp, Radovan/I-8459-2012; Kopp, Radovan/AAE-1905-2022","Kopp, Radovan/0000-0001-7010-2342",,,,,5,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,454,458,,,,,,5,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400054,0

We also determined increased level of metallothionein on RNA and protein level in tumorous tissue, which is in agreement with previous studies focused on determination of metallothionein in serum (where increased levels were observed). Moreover, we determined significantly up-regulated RNA level of zinc(II) transporters ZIP-1 and ZnT-1. Regarding ZnT-1, such changes of expression have not been described yet.

Assuming that members of the parliament representing the same party are voting together, it has sense to require that distribution of the influence of the parties in parliamentary decision making is proportional to the distribution of seats. There exist measures (so called voting power indices) reflecting an ability of each party to influence outcome of voting. Power indices are functions of distribution of seats and voting quota (where voting quota means a minimal number of votes required to pass a proposal). By a fair voting rule we call such a quota that leads to proportionality of influence to relative representation. Usually simple majority is not a fair voting rule. That is the reason why so called qualified or constitutional majority is being used in voting about important issues requiring higher level of consensus. Qualified majority is usually fixed (60% or 66.67%) independently on the structure of political representation. In the paper we use game-theoretical model of voting to find a quota that defines the fair voting rule as a function of the structure of political representation. Such a quota we call a fair majority. Fair majorities can differ for different structures of the parliament. Concept of a fair majority is illustrated on the data for the Lower House of the Czech Parliament elected in 2010.","[Turnovec, Frantisek] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,,turnovec@fsv.cuni.cz,"Turnovec, Frantisek/H-4482-2018","Turnovec, Frantisek/0000-0003-2867-427X",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,727,732,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600121,0

Methods: When placed on the waiting list, 438 patients were randomized into a short waiting time (SWT < 3 months) or a nonfixed waiting time (NFWT > 3 months) group. HRQoL was measured by the 15D, and pain and physical function by modified Knee Society Clinical Rating System at baseline, admission, and 3 and 12 months postoperatively. The costs of medication due to osteoarthritis were calculated at the same measurement points. All analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat principle. Results: The mean WT was 94 and 239 days in the SWT and NFWT groups, respectively. Apart from higher weekly cost of medication in the SWT group at admission and better HRQoL in the NFWT group 1 year postoperatively, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in other outcomes during the follow-up. Conclusion: Those in the SWT group had higher weekly costs of medication at admission, and reached better HRQoL 3 months earlier than those in the NFWT group, but the latter had better HRQoL after operation. Otherwise, the length of WT was not associated with different health and HRQoL outcomes in the groups.","[Tuominen, Ulla] Natl Social Insurance Inst Finland, Helsinki, Finland; [Tuominen, Ulla; Sintonen, Harri] Univ Helsinki, Dept Publ Hlth, Helsinki, Finland; [Hirvonen, Johanna] Mikkeli Univ Appl Sci, Mikkeli, Finland; [Seitsalo, Seppo; Paavolainen, Pekka] Orton Orthopaed Hosp, Helsinki, Finland; [Lehto, Matti] Hosp Dist Pirkanmaa, Tampere, Finland; [Hietaniemi, Kalevi] Hosp Dist Helsinki & Uusimaa, Helsinki, Finland; [Blom, Marja] Univ Helsinki, Fac Pharm, Div Social Pharm, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences; Pirkanmaa Hospital District; University of Helsinki; Helsinki University Central Hospital; University of Helsinki,"Tuominen, U (通讯作者)，Social Insurance Inst, Res Dept, Nordenskioldinkatu 12, FI-00250 Helsinki, Finland.",ulla.tuominen@thl.fi,,,Academy of Finland [51871]; HUS HUCH Jorvi Hospital; Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement; Medical Research of Tampere University Hospital; HUS HUCH Surgical Hospital; Orton Orthopaedic Hospital; Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); HUS HUCH Jorvi Hospital; Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement; Medical Research of Tampere University Hospital; HUS HUCH Surgical Hospital; Orton Orthopaedic Hospital; Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation,"This study was financially supported by the Academy of Finland (no. 51871), HUS HUCH Jorvi Hospital, Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement, Medical Research of Tampere University Hospital, HUS HUCH Surgical Hospital, Orton Orthopaedic Hospital, and Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation.",,29,15,16,1,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,998,1004,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00779.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20825622.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285066200019,0

The idea is that under majority rule x cannot be dislodged by any other point y if x is given an advantage of epsilon. This paper provides a finite algorithm, given V. x, and epsilon, to determine whether x is in the epsilon core. By bisection search, this yields a convergent algorithm, given V and x, to compute the least epsilon for which x is in the epsilon core. We prove by example that the epsilon core is in general not connected because the least epsilon function has multiple local minima. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We first characterize any finite length permutation as a composition of a fixed step permutation and an almost fixed step permutation. We then show that if a binary relation satisfies finite length anonymity, then it violates all the distributional axioms that are based on a segment-wise comparison. Examples of those axioms include the weak Pareto principle and the weak Pigou-Dalton principle. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Given the cointegration rank and the factor order, chi(2) asymptotic inference is obtained for the cointegration vectors, the short-run parameters, and the direction of each column of both the factor loading matrix and the matrix of long-run impacts of the large shocks.

We explore the hypothesis of an intergenerational transmission of health inequalities using the French part of SHARE. As the impact of both social background and parents' health on health status in adulthood represents circumstances independent of individual responsibility, this study allows us testing the existence in France of inequalities of opportunity in health related to family and social background. Empirically, our study relies on tests of stochastic dominance at first order and multivariate regressions, supplemented by a counterfactual analysis to evaluate the long-lasting impact of childhood conditions on inequality in health. Allocating the best circumstances in both parents' socioeconomic status and parents' health reduces inequality in health by an impressive 57% using the Gini coefficient. The mother's social status has a direct effect on the health of her offspring. By contrast, the effect on descendant's health from their father's social status is indirect only, which goes through the descendant's social status as an adult. There is also a strong effect of the father vital status on health in adulthood, revealing a selection effect.

The objective is to produce eight new language versions of the U-FIS: Canadian-English, Canadian-French, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, and US-English. Methods: The U-FIS was translated via two translation panels. Cognitive debriefing interviews conducted with patients in each country assessed face and content validity. Scaling and psychometric properties were assessed via survey data with patients in each country completing the U-FIS, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and demographic questions. Results: Cognitive debriefing interviews demonstrated U-FIS acceptability. Analysis of postal survey data showed all new language versions to be unidimensional. Reliability was high, with test-retest correlations and internal-consistency coefficients exceeding 0.85. Initial evidence of validity was provided by moderate to high correlations with NHP scales. The U-FIS was able to discriminate between groups based on employment status, perceived MS severity, and general health. Conclusion: The U-FIS is a practical new measure of the impact of fatigue. It was successfully adapted into eight new languages to broaden availability for researchers. Psychometric analyses indicated that the new language versions were unidimensional and reproducible with promising construct validity.","[Doward, Lynda C.] Galen Res Ltd, Enterprise House, Manchester M15 6SE, Lancs, England; [Fisk, John; Bhan, Virender] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Hagell, Peter] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Oprandi, Nadia C.] Univ Verona, I-37100 Verona, Italy; [Grand'Maison, Francois] Univ Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Arbizu, Txomin] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Kohlmann, Thomas] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany; [Brassat, David] Univ Toulouse 3, Dept Neurol, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Brassat, David] Univ Toulouse 3, INSERM, U536, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Eckert, Benjamin J.] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Doward, Lynda C.; Meads, David M.; Twiss, James; McKenna, Stephen P.] Galen Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",Dalhousie University; Lund University; University of Verona; University of Sherbrooke; University of Barcelona; Universitat Greifswald; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Novartis,"Doward, LC (通讯作者)，Galen Res Ltd, Enterprise House, Manchester Sci Pk,Lloyd St N, Manchester M15 6SE, Lancs, England.",ldoward@galen-research.com,"Hagell, Peter/F-5915-2010; Brassat, David/L-2173-2014; Doward, Lynda/IXD-2462-2023; Hagell, Peter/G-9559-2014; Fisk, John/N-7796-2015","Hagell, Peter/0000-0003-2174-372X; Doward, Lynda/0000-0002-6236-469X; Hagell, Peter/0000-0003-2174-372X; Fisk, John/0000-0003-3512-8015",Novartis Pharmaceuticals,Novartis Pharmaceuticals(Novartis),The study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.,,31,14,15,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN-JUL,2010,13.0,4,,,,,463,468,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00706.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,625DD,20230543.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279872300019,0

The main contribution of Hansen's paper is a demonstration that the Mallows criterion is asymptotically equivalent to the squared error, so the model average estimator that minimizes the Mallows criterion also minimizes the squared error in large samples. We are concerned with two assumptions that accompany Hansen's approach. The first is the assumption that the approximating models are strictly nested in a way that depends on the ordering of regressors. Often there is no clear basis for the ordering and the approach does not permit non-nested models which are more realistic from a practical viewpoint. Second, for the optimality result to hold the model weights are required to lie within a special discrete set. In fact, Hansen noted both difficulties and called for extensions of the proof techniques. We provide an alternative proof which shows that the result on the optimality of the Mallows criterion in fact holds for continuous model weights and under a non-nested set-up that allows any linear combination of regressors in the approximating models that make up the model average estimator. These results provide a stronger theoretical basis for the use of the Mallows criterion in model averaging by strengthening existing findings. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In response to this, many authors have proposed the use of methods based on the value of information as an alternative. Previous attempts have assumed perfect implementation, i.e. if current evidence favors the new intervention and no new information is sought or expected, all future patients will receive it. A framework is proposed to allow for this assumption to be relaxed. The profound effect that this can have on the optimal sample size and expected net gain is illustrated on two recent examples. In addition, a model for assessing the value of implementation strategies is proposed and illustrated.

Should the efficiency of prevention be the same within the population, we show that the gravity of the disease, the presence of comorbidities and the existence of uncertainty on health status can alternatively be considered so as to prioritize among preventive care resources.

A once-daily, extended-release (ER) formulation of the quaternary amine trospium chloride has recently been developed for the treatment of OAB. The pooled health-related QoL (HRQoL) data from two multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind Phase III studies with trospium chloride ER 60 mg were analyzed. Methods: Subjects aged >= 18 years with urinary urgency, frequency, and an average of >= 1 urge urinary incontinence episode per day on a 3-day bladder diary were randomized (1:1) to receive once-daily trospium 60 mg ER or placebo for 12 weeks. HRQoL was assessed at baseline and at Week 12 using the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and the OAB questionnaire (OAB-q). Results: Overall, 1165 subjects were randomized (trospium ER, n = 578; placebo, n = 587). Trospium ER produced significantly greater improvements from baseline than placebo in seven of the nine KHQ domains. At Week 12, the improvement in mean OAB-q HRQoL total score (from approximately 52 at baseline) was significantly greater with trospium ER than with placebo (+25.8 vs. +20.7; P = 0.0003). Improvements from baseline were seen with trospium ER on all eight of the OAB-q symptom bother scales. Conclusions: Once-daily trospium 60 mg ER improved the QoL of subjects with OAB, as assessed using the KHQ and the OAB-q, in two large Phase III clinical trials.","[Dmochowski, Roger R.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Urol, Med Ctr N, Sch Med, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Rosenberg, Matt T.] Mid Michigan Hlth Ctr, Jackson, MI USA; [Zinner, Norm R.] Western Clin Res, Torrance, CA USA; [Staskin, David R.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Caritas St Elizabeths Med Ctr, Div Urol, Boston, MA USA; [Sand, Peter K.] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Med, NorthShore Univ HealthSyst, Div Urogynecol & Reconstruct Surg, Evanston, IL USA",Vanderbilt University; Tufts University; St. Elizabeth's Medical Center; University of Chicago; NorthShore University Health System,"Dmochowski, RR (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Urol, Med Ctr N, Sch Med, Room A1302,1211 Med Ctr Dr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",roger.dmochowski@vanderbilt.edu,,,"Allergan, Inc.; Endo Pharmaceuticals (formerly Indevus Pharmaceuticals Inc)","Allergan, Inc.(AbbVieAllergan); Endo Pharmaceuticals (formerly Indevus Pharmaceuticals Inc)","Source of financial support: This work was supported by Allergan, Inc. and Endo Pharmaceuticals (formerly Indevus Pharmaceuticals Inc).",,44,12,13,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2010,13.0,2,,,,,251,257,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00652.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,557KP,19818062.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274668300012,0

Methods: Data on the efficacy of 12 + 12 weeks varenicline therapy in aiding smoking cessation were analyzed in conjunction with the efficacy data for 12 weeks of varenicline, bupropion, and placebo previously included in the BENESCO model, by using a mixed treatment comparison. This analysis provided updated efficacy estimates for all the interventions, and these were used to update the model to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of all smoking cessation interventions considered, now including 12 + 12 weeks of varenicline. Results: The updated 1-year abstinence estimates derived from the mixed treatment comparison were, for 12 + 12 weeks of varenicline, 12 weeks of varenicline, 12 weeks of bupropion, and 12 weeks of placebo, respectively: 27.7%, 22.9%, 15.9%, and 9.3%. The average cost of the course of 12 + 12 weeks of varenicline was estimated at $603.89, based on a 12-week course followed by a further 12 weeks for successful quitters. Over all subjects' lifetimes, 12 + 12 weeks of varenicline is less costly and more effective than (dominates) all other strategies compared in the updated BENESCO model, with the exception of 12 weeks of varenicline. In this comparison, 12 + 12 weeks of varenicline is a very cost-effective alternative to the 12-week course, with an incremental cost of less than $1000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Conclusions: A total of 12 weeks of varenicline followed by a further 12-week course for successful quitters is a highly cost-effective alternative compared with currently available smoking cessation options.","[Knight, Chris; Howard, Paul] Heron Evidence Dev Ltd, Luton LU2 8DL, Beds, England; [Baker, Christine L.; Marton, Jeno P.] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA",Pfizer,"Knight, C (通讯作者)，Heron Evidence Dev Ltd, Bldg 210A,Butterfield Technol & Business Pk, Luton LU2 8DL, Beds, England.",chris.knight@heronhealth.com,,,"Pfizer, Inc","Pfizer, Inc(Pfizer)","Source of financial support: Financial support from Pfizer, Inc is gratefully acknowledged.",,27,41,47,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2010,13.0,2,,,,,209,214,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00672.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,557KP,19912599.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274668300007,0

The aim of this study is to undertake a preliminary assessment of this proposal to identify the key factors determining its cost-effectiveness and to determine whether there is sufficient uncertainty that requires more thorough analyses. Methods: An economic model was constructed. For simplicity, the health impact of screening was estimated by calculating the lives saved through shifts in prognostic group. A plausible bounds approach was used to derive distributions for model parameters for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. UK data were used to populate the model. Results: The cost-effectiveness of the extension is estimated to be 27,400 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with a 29% probability of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of 20,000 pound per QALY. The deterministic estimate of benefit becomes negative if the anxiety due to a false-positive result is set at 0.028 QALYs. Including a small positive benefit from a negative screen has a dramatic impact on the cost-effectiveness of screening. The impact of other factors appears less marked. Conclusions: Because the vast majority of women aged 47 to 49 years will test negative when screened for breast cancer and most of those who test positive will actually be free of the disease, the psychological impacts of screening are likely to drive cost-effectiveness for this age group. Therefore, a research priority should be to better understand and quantify these effects.","[Madan, Jason] Univ Bristol, Acad Unit Primary Hlth Care, Bristol BS6 6JL, Avon, England; [Rawdin, Andrew; Stevenson, Matt; Tappenden, Paul] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Bristol; University of Sheffield,"Madan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Acad Unit Primary Hlth Care, Cotham House,Cotham Hill, Bristol BS6 6JL, Avon, England.",jason.madan@bris.ac.uk,,"Madan, Jason/0000-0003-4316-1480; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",UK Department of Health NHS; UK Department of Health National Institute of Health,UK Department of Health NHS; UK Department of Health National Institute of Health,Source of financial support: The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the UK Department of Health NHS cancer screening unit for this work.

Methods: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of sorafenib. The clinical effectiveness of sorafenib versus BSC was taken from a recent randomized phase III trial. Utility values were taken from a phase II trial of sunitimb, using EQ-5D tariffs. Cost data were obtained from published literature and were based oil current UK practice. The effect of parameter uncertainty oil cost-effectiveness was explored through extensive one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Compared to BSC, sorafemb treatment resulted in an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of 75,398 pound, based oil an estimated mean gain of 0.27 QALYs per patient, at a mean additional cost of 20,063 pound (inflated to 2007/2008). The probability that sorafenib is cost-effective compared to BSC at a willingness to pay threshold of 30,000 pound per QALY is 0.0%. In sensitivity analysis, estimates of cost per QALY were sensitive to changes in the clinical effectiveness parameters, and to health state utilities and drug costs. Conclusions: Sorafenib has been shown to be clinically effective compared to BSC, offering additional health benefits; however, with a cost per QALY in excess of 70,000 pound, it may not be regarded as a cost-effective use of resources in some health-care settings.","[Welch, Karen] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [Green, Colin; Thompson-Coon, Jo; Liu, Zulian; Moxham, Tiffany; Stein, Ken] Univ Plymouth, Peninsula Med Sch, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Green, Colin; Thompson-Coon, Jo; Liu, Zulian; Moxham, Tiffany; Stein, Ken] Univ Exeter, Peninsula Med Sch, Plymouth, Devon, England",University of Southampton; University of Plymouth; University of Exeter; University of Plymouth,,martin.hoyle@pms.ac.uk,"Coon, Jo Thompson/C-7923-2017","Hoyle, Martin/0000-0001-5593-9777",UK NHS Research and Devclopment Health Technology Assessment programme [07/72/01],UK NHS Research and Devclopment Health Technology Assessment programme,"The research was carried out under contract to the UK NHS Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme.

The measurement took place on three localities from spring to autumn 2010; this paper presents results from one locality. We measured wind speed in front of windbreak and behind windbreak (formed by hardwood species) in certain distances in spring (slight foliage), sommer (full foliage) and at the beginning of autumn (falling leaves). The effectivity of windbreak in the distance 50 m from windbreak varied between 52% in April and 72% in May. In the distance 100 m from windbreak the effectivity varied between 49% (April) and 69% (May). Optical porosity was evaluated on digital photos. The pictures chart the permeability changes observed during the period. Changes of permeability were evaluated at different heights of windbreaks. The highest values of porosity were observed in spring, lowest in summer. Optical porosity values in autumn show an increasing trend. Our evaluation method can discover places in windbreaks, that are interrupted or in which are the gaps throughout the year. The results can be used for planning of windbreak permeability and for management of windbreaks.","[Muzikova, B.; Jares, V.] Mendel Univ Brno, Inst Appl & Landscape Ecol, Fac Agron, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Muzíková, B (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Inst Appl & Landscape Ecol, Fac Agron, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",bronislava.muzikova@uake.cz,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,412,426,,,,,,15,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800055,0

After a certain period of time a relative balance of the radionuclide was seen in the aquatic environment, but all the same the content of radiocesium in the organisms differed considerably. The model environment in an aquarium (tank) with definable conditions can provide new information about the Cs-137 fate in the aquatic environment. This paper describes the uptake and elimination of Cs-137 in the fish species Poecilia reticulate after 96-hour experimental contamination with (CsCl)-Cs-137 (1.0 kBq l(-1)) in standard water condition of small laboratory tanks. The Cs-137 radioactivity concentration was observed in vivo during 96-hour radiocaesium retention and 33-day decontamination (cultivation of the contaminated fish in radiocaesium free water) periods. Measurements of Cs-137 activity were carried out using gamma-spectrometric system with HPGe detector and standard geometry of 500ml-Marinelli bakers. Rapid uptake of radiocaesium dissolved in water and also rapid loss of the radionuclide from contaminated fish kept in the radiocesium free conditions were found out. The Cs-137 concentration in fish kept in contaminated water reached the same concentration as in the water during 90-hour contamination period, and then the retention of Cs-137 proceeded further with the similar tendency. In the decontamination period, the initial biological half-life of Cs-137 in fish was ca 14 days. More than 65 % of the starting value of the radiocaesium in fish body was excreted after 33-day-keeping of the contaminated fish in uncontaminated water.","Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Mol Biol & Radiobiol, Fac Agron, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Ruzicková, E (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Mol Biol & Radiobiol, Fac Agron, Zemedeska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xruzic13@mendelu.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,933,939,,,,,,7,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800122,0

Using 12 years of data from the German Socio-Economic Panel we study the nature of the relationship between poor health and non-employment on a sample of German men aged 30-59. We propose a joint model of health and labor market risks which identifies the mechanism through which poor health contributes to the probability of being jobless and vice versa. We find an important role of unobserved heterogeneity and evidence for correlation in the unobservable characteristics determining the two processes. The results also show strong persistence in the dynamics of health and labor market risks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike data obtained through randomized controlled trials, researchers face greater challenges with causal inference with observational studies. Recognizing these challenges, a task force was formed to develop a guidance document on methodological approaches to addresses these biases. Methods: The task force was commissioned and a Chair was selected by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Board of Directors in October 2007. This report, the second of three reported in this issue of the Journal, discusses the inherent biases when using secondary data sources for comparative effectiveness analysis and provides methodological recommendations to help mitigate these biases. Results: The task force report provides recommendations and tools for researchers to mitigate threats to validity from bias and confounding in measurement of exposure and outcome. Recommendations on design of study included: the need for data analysis plan with causal diagrams; detailed attention to classification bias in definition of exposure and clinical outcome; careful and appropriate use of restriction; extreme care to identify and control for confounding factors, including time-dependent confounding. Conclusions: Design of nonrandomized studies of comparative effectiveness face several daunting issues, including measurement of exposure and outcome challenged by misclassification and confounding. Use of causal diagrams and restriction are two techniques that can improve the theoretical basis for analyzing treatment effects in study populations of more homogeneity, with reduced loss of generalizability.","[Johnson, Michael L.] Univ Houston, Coll Pharm, Dept Clin Sci & Adm, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Cox, Emily] Express Scripts, St Louis, MO USA; [Martin, Bradley C.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Div Pharmaceut Evaluat & Policy, Coll Pharm, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Van Staa, Tjeerd] Gen Practice Res Database, London, England; [Garbe, Edeltraut] Bremen Inst Prevent Res & Social Med, Dept Clin Epidemiol, Bremen, Germany; [Siebert, Uwe] Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Dept Publ Hlth Med Decis Making & Hlth Technol As, Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Johnson, Michael L.] Michael E DeBakey VA Med Ctr, Houston Ctr Qual Care & Utilizat Studies, Dept Vet Affairs, Houston, TX USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; Express Scripts Holding Company; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences; Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research & Epidemiology (BIPS); Harvard University; Baylor College of Medicine,"Johnson, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Coll Pharm, Dept Clin Sci & Adm, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",mikejohnson@uh.edu,"Siebert, Uwe/M-5057-2019; Siebert, Uwe/HTO-0915-2023","Siebert, Uwe/0000-0001-6425-7671; Siebert, Uwe/0000-0001-6425-7671; van Staa, Tjeerd/0000-0001-9363-742X",Department of Veteran Affairs [HFP020-90],Department of Veteran Affairs(US Department of Veterans Affairs),This work was supported in part by the Department of Veteran Affairs Health Services Research and Development grant HFP020-90.

Methods: The 2005 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was used to get EQ-5D scores for 27 major chronic diseases. The independent detrimental effect of each chronic disease was estimated using a censored least absolute deviations regression. Results: The respondents (60.5%) rated their health as perfect or 11111 on the EQ-5D scale showing ceiling effect. Stroke (0.5067-0.5756) was the condition of the lowest EQ-5D utility weight and was followed by renal failure (0.6637-0.7739), angina pectoris (0.7325 similar to 0.8364), and arthritis (0.7621 similar to 0.8644). The marginal impact of each chronic disease after adjusting for age, sex, education, income, marital status, and the number of comorbid conditions was largest in stroke, arthritis, cancer, renal failure, and herniated disc.

The Council's primary recommendation for this Task Force was that it should report on the quality of cost-effectiveness research and make recommendations to facilitate the improvement of pharmacoeconomics and health outcomes research and its use in stimulating better health care and policy. Task force members were knowledgeable and experienced in medicine, pharmacy, biostatistics, health policy and health-care decision-making, biomedical knowledge transfer, health economics, and pharmacoeconomics. They were drawn from industry, academia, consulting organizations, and advisors to governments and came from Japan, the Netherlands, Canada and the United States. Methods: Face-to-face meetings of the Task Force were held at ISPOR North American and European meetings and teleconferences occurred every few months. Literature reviews and surveys were conducted and the first preliminary findings presented at an open forum at the May 2008 ISPOR meeting in Toronto. The final draft report was circulated to the expert reviewer group and then to the entire membership for comment. The draft report was posted on the ISPOR Web site in April 2009. All formal comments received were posted to the association Web site and presented for discussion at the Task Force forum during the ISPOR 14th Annual International Meeting in May 2009. Comments and feedback from the forums, reviewers and membership were considered in the final report. Once Task Force consensus was reached, the article was submitted to Value in Health. Conclusions: The QICER Task Force recommends that ISPOR implement the following: With respect to CER guidelines, that ISPOR promote harmonization of guidelines, allowing for differences in application, regional needs and politics; evaluate available instruments or promote development of a new one that will allow standardized quantification of the impact of CER guidelines on the quality of CER studies; report periodically on those countries or regions that have developed guidelines; periodically evaluate the quality of published studies (those journals with CER guidances) or those submitted to decision-making bodies (as public transparency increases). With respect to methodologies, that ISPOR promote publication of methodological guidelines in more applied journals in more easily understandable format to transfer knowledge to researchers who need to apply more rigorous methods; promote full availability of models in electronic format to combat space restrictions in hardcopy publications; promote consistency of methodological review for all CER studies; promote adoption of explicit best practices guidelines among regulatory and reimbursement authorities; periodically update all ISPOR Task Force reports; periodically review use of ISPOR Task Force guidelines; periodically report on statistical and methodological challenges in HE; evaluate periodically whether ISPOR's methodological guidelines lead to improved quality; and support training and knowledge transfer of rigorous CER methodologies to researchers and health care decision-makers. With respect to publications, that ISPOR develop standard CER guidances to which journals will be able to refer their authors and their reviewers; lobby to establish these guidances within the International Committee for Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Requirements to which most journals refer in their Author Instructions; provide support in terms of additional reviewer expertise to those journals lacking appropriate reviewers; periodically report on journals publishing CER research; periodically report on the quality of CER publications; and support training and knowledge transfer of the use of these guidelines to researchers and reviewers. With respect to evidence-based health-care decision-making, that ISPOR recognize at its annual meetings those countries/agencies/private companies/researchers using CER well, and those practitioners and researchers supporting good patient use of CER in decision-making; and promote public presentation of case studies of applied use of CER concepts or guidelines.","[McGhan, William F.] Univ Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Al, Maiwenn] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Doshi, Jalpa A.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kamae, Isao] Keio Univ, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan; [Marx, Steven E.] Abbott Labs, Chicago, IL USA; [Rindress, Donna] BioMedCom Consultants Inc, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Pennsylvania; Keio University; Abbott Laboratories,"McGhan, WF (通讯作者)，Univ Sci, 600 S 43rd St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",w.mcghan@usp.edu,"Al, Maiwenn J/E-3272-2014","Al, Maiwenn J/0000-0001-9763-0436",,,,,145,57,60,0,23,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,8,,,,,1086,1099,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00605.x,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,515TH,19744291.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271495300009,0

This article presents the results of an ISPOR task force convened to address good clinical research practices for the use of existing or modified PRO instruments to support medical product labeling claims. The focus of the article is on content validity, with specific reference to existing or modified PRO instruments, because of the importance of content validity in selecting or modifying an existing PRO instrument and the lack of consensus in the research community regarding best practices for establishing and documenting this measurement property. Methods: Topics addressed in the article include: definition and general description of content validity; PRO concept identification as the important first step in establishing content validity; instrument identification and the initial review process; key issues in qualitative methodology; and potential threats to content validity, with three case examples used to illustrate types of threats and how they might be resolved. A table of steps used to identify and evaluate an existing PRO instrument is provided, and figures are used to illustrate the meaning of content validity in relationship to instrument development and evaluation. Results & Recommendations: Four important threats to content validity are identified: unclear conceptual match between the PRO instrument and the intended claim, lack of direct patient input into PRO item content from the target population in which the claim is desired, no evidence that the most relevant and important item content is contained in the instrument, and lack of documentation to support modifications to the PRO instrument. In some cases, careful review of the threats to content validity in a specific application may be reduced through additional well documented qualitative studies that specifically address the issue of concern. Conclusion: Published evidence of the content validity of a PRO instrument for an intended application is often limited.

The paper presents a test of the hypothesis that g belongs to a finite-dimensional parametric family against a nonparametric alternative. The test is not subject to the ill-posed inverse problem of nonparametric instrumental variable estimation. Under mild conditions, the test is consistent against any alternative model. In large samples, its power is arbitrarily close to 1 uniformly over a class of alternatives whose distance from the null hypothesis is proportional to n(-1/2), where it is the sample size. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the finite-sample performance of the test. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The study described the frequency and types of tests requested after a diagnosis of high serum prolactin concentration, and assessed whether the diagnosis of macroprolactinemia resulted in lower downstream utilization and costs compared with hyperprolactinemic patients. Methods: A cost analysis was conducted using a decision tree to model the health-care utilization of the two groups. The database of the Fleury Medicina e SaUde provided the tests and medication of patients with a prolactin value >= 30 mu g/L for a period of 6 months. Results: Six hundred fifty-four of 1793 patients (36.5%) had hyperprolactinemia because of macroprolactin. The average number of tests per individual was higher (P = 0.001) in the patients with true hyperprolactinemia (3.07) than in patients with macroprolactinemia (2.51).The average cost in the hyperprolactinemic group (R$425 or 162) was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than the macroprolactinemic group (R$340 or 130), an incremental cost 25% higher. Conclusion: The macroprolactin screening did not completely avoid inappropriate clinical investigation or associated health-care costs. Our results demonstrate the importance of proper medical education and knowledge diffusion of the meaning of macroprolactinemia.","[de Soarez, Patricia Coelho; Ferraz, Marcos Bosi] GRIDES UNIFESP, Sao Paulo Ctr Hlth Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Area Leao Souza, Silvia Corral; Henriques Vieira, Jose Gilberto; Ferraz, Marcos Bosi] Fleury Med & Saude, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP),"de Soárez, PC (通讯作者)，Rua Botucatu 685,Vila Clementino, BR-04023062 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",patricia.soarez@cpes.org.br,"SOAREZ, PATRICIA/D-9710-2012; Vieira, José GH/N-6365-2013; Iats, Inct/K-2300-2013","SOAREZ, PATRICIA/0000-0001-8383-0728; Vieira, José GH/0000-0002-7121-4458;",,,,,19,13,14,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2009,12.0,6,,,,,930,934,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00563.x,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,474SP,19824182.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268304600010,0

Methods and Results: We developed a Markov model based on clinical outcome data from a meta-analysis including 17 randomized controlled trials comparing drug-eluting versus BMS with a minimum follow-up of 1 (n = 8221) and a maximum follow-up of 3 years (n = 4105) in patients with chronic coronary artery disease. Costs were obtained as reimbursement rates for diagnosis related groups from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. All costs and effects were discounted at 3% annually. All costs are reported in US dollars of the financial year 2007. The incremental effects are 0.002 (95% confidence interval -0.039 to 0.041) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the sirolimus- and -0.001 (-0.040 to 0.038) QALYs for the paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES). The incremental costs are $2790 for the sirolimus- and $3838 for the PES. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is >$1,000,000 per QALY for the sirolimus-eluting stent. PES are dominated by BMS (i.e., less effective and more costly). Among various sensitivity analyses performed, the model proved to be robust. Conclusions: Our analysis from a US Medicare perspective suggests that drug-eluting stents are not cost-effective compared with BMS when implanted in unselected patients with symptomatic ischemic coronary artery disease.","[Bischof, Matthias; Briel, Matthias; Bucher, Heiner C.; Nordmann, Alain] Univ Basel Hosp, Basel Inst Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland; [Bischof, Matthias] Swiss Trop Inst, Dept Publ Hlth & Epidemiol, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Briel, Matthias] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada",University of Basel; University of Basel; Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute; McMaster University,"Nordmann, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basel Hosp, Basel Inst Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.",nordmanna@uhbs.ch,"Briel, Matthias/AAT-9284-2021","Briel, Matthias/0000-0002-2070-5230",,,,,46,23,24,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,649,656,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00513.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19490551.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267130200005,0

If expanded Medicaid eligibility makes it easier for a person to have health coverage between jobs, we expect it to reduce job lock that occurs for workers with employer-provided health insurance. Expanded eligibility could also decrease mobility among those in jobs without health insurance, since they experience less pressure to move to an insured job (job push). We find strong evidence that expanded eligibility reduces job lock among unmarried women but not men or married women, and only weak evidence of reduced job push among men. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We use these results to explain the counterintuitive result in the literature that, under ail ignorability assumption that justifies GMM with weighted moment conditions, weighting using estimated probabilities of selection is better than weighting using the true probabilities. We also consider estimation under ail exogeneity of selection assumption such that both the unweighted and the weighted moment conditions are valid, and we show that when weighting is not needed for consistency, it is also not useful for efficiency.

Two major policies adopted by RMHC included insurance coverage Of Outpatient services (demand-side policy) and drug Policy (Supply-side policy). This paper focuses on the effects of these two policies on outpatient service utilization in Chinese village clinics. The data used in this Study are from 3-year household follow-up surveys. A generalized negative binomial regression model and a Heckman selection model were constructed using panel data from 2005 to 2007. The results indicate that the price elasticities of demand for Outpatient visits and per-visit outpatient expenses were -1.5 and -0.553. respectively. After implementing the supply-side policy, outpatient Visits and per-visit outpatient expenses decreased by 94.7 and 55.9%, respectively, controlling for insurance coverage. These findings can be used to make recommendations to the Chinese government oil improving the health care system.

The generic instrument 15D was translated and culturally adapted into the Greek language and setting. It was then administered during October 2005 to May 2006 to 420 coronary artery disease patients. The three-stage valuation procedure was employed and, with the use of elicited preference weights, a single health-related quality of life index score for the patients was derived. Scores were also calculated using the original Finnish valuation system and compared with the previously derived utilities. Sensitivity, reliability, and validity were assessed by examining response distributions, floor and ceiling effects, item-scale correlations, Cronbach's alpha coefficients, and hypothesized relationships between sociodemographic variables and health-related quality of life. The Greek valuation systematically generated higher 15D utilities than the Finnish one. Nevertheless, the utilities derived with the original Finnish valuation algorithm differed significantly with respect to sex, age, and education, just as they did using the Greek valuation system. In most cases, the full range of possible responses has been used satisfactorily and floor and ceiling effects were generally moderate. In general, internal consistency reliability was also satisfactory. The valuation system generated results demonstrating satisfactory psychometric properties. Further research should validate the 15D in the general Greek population.","[Aletras, Vassilis H.] Univ Macedonia, Dept Business Adm, Thessaloniki 54006, Macedonia, Greece; [Aletras, Vassilis H.; Kontodimopoulos, Nick; Niakas, Dimitris A.; Vagia, Maria G.; Pelteki, Helen J.; Karatzoglou, Grammatiki I.; Yfantopoulos, John N.] Hellen Open Univ, Patras, Greece; [Vagia, Maria G.] Evangelismos Gen Hosp, Hematol & Lymphomas Dept, Athens, Greece; [Karatzoglou, Grammatiki I.] Gen Hosp Lamia, Lamia, Greece; [Sintonen, Harri] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Yfantopoulos, John N.] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Athens 11528, Greece; [Yfantopoulos, John N.] Natl Ctr Social Res, Athens, Greece",University of Macedonia; Hellenic Open University; Evangelismos Hospital; University of Helsinki; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Aletras, VH (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Business Adm, 156 Egnatia St,POB 1591, Thessaloniki 54006, Macedonia, Greece.",valetras@uom.gr,"Yfantopoulos, John/ABA-7730-2020; ALETRAS, VASSILIS/HTM-1273-2023","ALETRAS, VASSILIS/0000-0002-3367-7777; Niakas, Dimitris/0000-0003-0528-755X; Kontodimopoulos, Nick/0000-0003-4590-6634; Yfantopoulos, John/0000-0003-0424-6887",,,,,38,9,9,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4,,,,,574,579,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00462.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,18980637.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266467800025,0

In a web-based discrete choice questionnaire, four attributes were included: 1) number of changes in antidepressants before symptom relief; 2) time with dosage adjustments due to adverse side effects and/or lack of effects; 3) cost of pharmacogenetic testing; 4) probability of benefits from pharmacogenetic testing. Respondents were asked to choose between two scenarios; 1) pharmacogenetic testing; and 2) an opt-out option reflecting a scenario without pharmacogenetic testing. The indirect utility model was assumed to be multiplicative in probability of benefits and reduced time with dosage adjustments as well as reduced number of antidepressant changes. Most coefficients had the expected signs and were statistically significant. WTP for avoidance of one change in antidepressant medication is 1571 Danish Krone (DKK), whereas WTP for reducing the period with dosage-adjustments by 1 month is DKK604. Both were statistically significantly different from zero. If diagnosed with depression, peoples' WTP for pharmacogenetic testing appears to exceed its price as long as there is a reasonable probability for improvements in treatment (in the present case 10%). Utility is associated with outcomes only. Hence, other modes of provision of similar improvements in treatment may be valued equally highly. WTP estimates and the associated policy implications appear to be robust because they were unaffected by estimation model.","[Herbild, Louise; Bech, Mickael; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Univ So Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth, Odense, Denmark; [Bech, Mickael; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Odense Univ Hosp, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Herbild, Louise] Danish Inst Hlth Serv Res, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; Odense University Hospital,"Herbild, L (通讯作者)，Danish Inst Hlth Serv Res, POB 2595,Dampfaergevej 27-29, DK-2100 Koebenhavn Oe, Denmark.",loh@dsi.dk,"Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/A-3161-2011; Bech, Mickael/G-2588-2011","Bech, Mickael/0000-0003-3084-2068",,,,,63,28,28,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4,,,,,560,567,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00465.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,18980634.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266467800023,0

We investigate the structure of stable assignments under both non-transferable utility (NTU) and transferable utility (TU). If the surplus function is sufficiently convex, the TU-stable assignments are a subset of the NTU-stable assignments. Furthermore, if trade is restricted to uni-directional flows the unique TU-stable assignment coincides with the unique NTU-stable assignment for every convex surplus function. We also examine the graph-theoretic representation of stable assignments and show that the graph structure can be exploited to compute surplus shares in TU-stable assignments. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This raises the issue of how the services should be organized and funded. We describe the effect of one way of organizing the services, which is by relying on competition. In Norway, sonic oral specialists face real competition with general dental practitioners for the same patients (prosthetists, periodontists and endodontists), while other specialists do not (orthodontists and oral surgeons). The latter specialists have skills that give them exclusive possibilities to practice their profession. We find that competition can be effective for the specialists who experience real competition with general dental practitioners for patients. In situations where real competition does not exist, specialists call obtain market power and raise their fees. Our results are based on an analysis of a representative set or data from general dental practitioners and specialists in Norway. The specialities in which practitioners can exercise market power raise challenges related to the type Of public policy that can reduce this market power in an appropriate way, and without involving too large costs for the authorities.

We argue that increases in life expectancy between 1960 and 2000, which were largely independent of income, represented gains in welfare comparable to the ones derived from income growth. For countries in the region, estimates of welfare improvements accounting for health increase the numbers obtained from income alone by 40% on average. The available evidence suggests that improvements in public health infrastructure - such as provision of treated water and sewerage services - and large-scale immunization programs may have been the key factors behind the mortality reductions observed in the period.

In this paper, the prospect of pecuniary compensation is tested as a method of increasing the participation rate. We propose a model explaining the individual's probability of participating ill screening for colorectal cancer when he is offered pecuniary compensation, given that lie did not participate when first invited. The participant's decision is based oil both known and uncertain factors. The estimation is conducted in two steps, where a binary probit model is used in each. We find that pecuniary compensation increases the probability of participation, and that an individual's participation probability systematically varies with variables such as travel expenses, income, age, education level, expected benefit from the screening, use of health-care services, genetic predisposition and subjective health status. Using the results from the estimation, we predict changes in the participation rate For different levels of compensation and estimate the cost per additional individual screened. The cost per additional individual screened is 808, including 25 in compensation; this cost increases with the level of compensation.

The objective of this study was to conduct a methodological exploration of the effect of attribute framing on marginal rates of substitution (MRS), including willingness to pay (WTP) from a discrete choice experiment (DCE), within the context of colorectal cancer screening preferences. The survey, a fractional factorial design of a two-alternative, unlabeled experiment, was mailed to a sample of 1920 subjects in NSW, Australia. Participants were randomized to one of four alternative frames of information. Attributes included: accuracy of the test for finding cancers, accuracy of the test for finding large polyps, how good the test is at saying you don't have cancer, cost, dietary and medication restrictions and sample collection. A mixed logit model was used to estimate preferences; MRS between attributes, including WTP, was calculated. A total of 1157 surveys from 1920 (60.2%) were returned. Accuracy of the test for finding cancer was most likely to influence choice of test, followed by accuracy of the test for finding large polyps. Under some circumstances, framing of the attributes (e.g., cancers found vs. cancers missed) influenced the relative importance of attributes. Attribute framing significantly influenced estimates of WTP, and benefit: harm trade-offs that were calculated from MRS.

We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of G-CSF pegfilgrastim primary (starting in cycle 1 and continuing in subsequent cycles of chemotherapy) versus secondary (only after an FN event) prophylaxis in women with early-stage breast cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy with a >= 20% FN risk. A decision-analytic model was constructed from a health insurer's perspective with a lifetime study horizon. The model considers direct medical costs and outcomes related to reduced FN and potential survival benefits because of reduced FN-related mortality. Inputs for the model were obtained from the medical literature. Sensitivity analyses were conducted across plausible ranges in parameter values. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pegfilgrastim as primary versus secondary prophylaxis was $48,000/FN episode avoided. Adding survival benefit from avoiding FN mortality yielded an ICER of $110,000/life-year gained (LYG) or $116,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The most influential factors included FN case-fatality, FN relative risk reduction from primary prophylaxis, and age at diagnosis. Compared with secondary prophylaxis, the cost-effectiveness of pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis may be equivalent or superior to other commonly used supportive care interventions for women with breast cancer. Further assessment of the direct impact of G-CSF on short- and long-term survival is needed to substantiate these findings.","[Ramsey, Scott D.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Publ Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Ramsey, Scott D.] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Boer, Rob] Consultant Amgen, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Sullivan, Sean D.] Univ Washington, Sch Pharm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Malin, Jennifer] JAmgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA USA; [Lyman, Gary H.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Duke Comprehens Canc Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Liu, Zhimei] Cerner LifeSci, Beverly Hills, CA USA",Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Duke University,"Ramsey, SD (通讯作者)，Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Publ Hlth Sci, 1100 Fairview Ave N,POB 19024, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",sramsey@fhcrc.org,"Boer, Robert/AFM-0525-2022; Boer, Robert/AAH-2901-2022; Lyman, Gary/K-5227-2019","Boer, Robert/0000-0003-0680-001X; Boer, Robert/0000-0003-0680-001X; Lyman, Gary/0000-0002-0823-8086","Amgen Inc.; Thousand Oaks, CA, USA","Amgen Inc.(Amgen); Thousand Oaks, CA, USA","Source of financial support: This study was supported by Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.",,81,40,44,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,217,225,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00434.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,18673353.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467500006,0

In the production of inpatient care services, Hospitalist services can be viewed as complementary to sophisticated and expensive medical equipment in the provision of inpatient medical care. We investigate the causal relationship between a hospital's access to three types of sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic medical equipment - intensity-modulated radiation therapy, gamma knife, and multi-slice computed tomography - and its likelihood of using hospitalists. To rule out omitted variables bias and reverse causality, we use technology-specific Certificate of Need regulation to predict technology use. We find a strong positive association. yet no causal link between access to medical technology and hospitalist use. We also study the Choice of employment modality among hospitals that use hospitalists. and find that access to expensive medical technology reduces the hospital's propensity to employ hospitalists directly.

It has been established that in locations with intensive flow of holidaymakers a net of trodden paths is formed where the vegetation is disappearing very fast as there are suitable conditions for the springtime and autumn winds to erode the protective dune of the seaside. The trodden paths in a couple of years turn into 2 - 2,5 m wide sand drifting corridors, but the lies of the people become there 3 - 4 m wide pits and hollows. After these formations have interconnected they shape deflations of different size. The drifting sand carried by the prevailing winds swamp the beyond dune plain and the outskirts of the forests.

Moreover, this existing handling circle is wasting resources and polluting environment greatly. So the design of reverse logistics network for E-waste is concerned with economy and society. This paper addresses the design of a multi-echelon reverse logistics network for collecting and processing E-waste which involves locating collection spots and disposal stations, and determining the best strategy for allocating the waste sources to collection spots and deliver the wastes from collection spots to disposal stations. A multi-objective integer programming model is constructed. The goal is to select the optimum numbers, locations and capacities of collection spots and disposal stations to open so that all waste sources are satisfied at minimum total operator costs of the reverse logistics network and at minimum disutility to people.

To investigate the costs of hospitalization of low-risk CAP patients and how hospitalization costs can be reduced through proper usage of hospital resources. Two hundred thirty-six patients with low-risk CAP who were hospitalized between January 2000 and December 2005 in a 1161-bed tertiary care teaching hospital were included in a retrospective cohort study. Their hospitalization costs and antibiotic therapy were analyzed. General linear model was utilized to determine correlative variables associated with total hospital costs. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days and the median duration of intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy was 10 days, they were correlated significantly (P = 0.000, r = 0.81). The median total hospital cost was $556.50 (mean $705.60), of which 48.9% was for drugs, 21.9% for laboratory tests, 8.6% for radiology, 6.5% for medical staff, 6.3% for hospital beds, and 5.3% for examination. General linear model analysis determined that duration of IV antibiotic therapy, Pneumonia Severity Index class, age, and initial empirical antibiotic therapy failure were correlative factors of total hospital costs. Pathogens were identified in 106 patients (44.9%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (19.9%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.5%), and Haemophilus influenza (5.5%). The majority of patients accepted initial empirical beta-lactam (37.3%) or fluoroquinolone (30.9%) monotherapy, the empirical treatment failure rates were 20.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Efforts to reduce duration of IV antibiotic therapy will have the most profound effect on reducing total hospital costs of low-risk CAP. The atypical pathogens should be considered for initial empirical antibiotics in low-risk CAP therapy in China.","[He, Bei] Peking Univ, Hosp 3, Dept Resp Med, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Peking University,"He, B (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Hosp 3, Dept Resp Med, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",puh3_hb@bjmu.edu.cn,,,,,,,27,18,19,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,40,46,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00410.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,18637052.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262696800007,0

Problems with preferences of this kind have led to calls for the use of more direct measures of the utility associated with experiencing a health state. The fact remains, however, that individuals are often willing to make large sacrifices in life expectancy to alleviate conditions for which there appears to be a considerable degree of hedonic adaptation. The purpose of this study is to investigate this important discrepancy in more detail. Data from 1173 internet and telephone surveys in the United States suggest that time trade-off responses are related to the frequency and intensity of negative thoughts about health in ways that may not be very well captured by any of the proposed valuation methods.

It is known from the social choice literature that under the standard topological conditions-with no rationality assumptions on preferences-there is an element such that the upper section of strict preference at that element is minimal in terms of set inclusion, i.e., the uncovered set is nonempty. Assuming the finite subordination property, a condition that weakens known acyclicity and convexity assumptions, each such uncovered alternative is in fact maximal. Implications are a generalization of a result of Yannelis and Prabhakar (1983) on semi-convexity, an extension of Fan's (1961) lemma on KKM correspondences, and the existence of fixed points for subordinate convex correspondences generalizing the work of Browder (1968).

The NICE recommended time frame for completion of an STA is 34 weeks. The purpose of this study was to map the first 95 STAs to collect information on a range of issues including timelines and appraisal decisions. Methods: A mapping tool was devised to collect information from the NICE Web site. Data were analyzed by calculating frequencies. Simple descriptive statistics were applied where appropriate. Results: Ninety-five STAs were included in the analysis. Almost one-third (30/95) initially identified topics did not go on to be appraised often due to licensing issues. Timelines were measured for 29 completed STAs. Eight (28%) of these were completed by 37 weeks and 20 (69%) by 42 weeks. When STAs with appeals were excluded, 31% (8/26) were completed by 37 weeks and 85% (22/26) by 42 weeks. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios reported by manufacturers were consistently lower than those estimated by the evidence review groups. In all, 76% (38/50) of the completed STAs resulted in an approval. Conclusions: The NICE Web site enabled access to almost all necessary information, although electronic documents were sometimes difficult to locate. One-third of the referred topics were suspended or terminated. The NICE STA process is slower than initially anticipated and this is primarily due to events outside of NICE's direct control.","[Kaltenthaler, Eva; Papaioannou, Diana] Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Boland, Angela; Dickson, Rumona] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",University of Sheffield; University of Liverpool,"Kaltenthaler, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, 30 Regent Court,Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",e.kaltenthaler@sheffield.ac.uk,,,"NIHR Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre (NETSCC); NIHR [08/228/01]","NIHR Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre (NETSCC); NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR))","Source of financial support to the Universities of Sheffield and Liverpool: This work was funded by NIHR Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre (NETSCC).

We used claims' data gathered by a major Swiss health insurer, over a period of 6 years and involving 160 000 insured adults. In Switzerland, health insurance is mandatory, but everyone has the option of choosing between a managed care plan and a fee-for-service plan. This paper focuses on a conventional fee-for-service plan including a mandatory access to a telemedicine service; the insured are obliged to phone this medical call centre before visiting a physician. This type of plan generates much lower average health expenditures than a conventional insurance plan. Reasons for this may include selection, incentive effects or efficiency. In our sample, about 90% of the difference in health expenditure can be explained by selection and incentive effects. The remaining 10% of savings due to the efficiency of the telemedicine service amount to about SFr 150 per year per insured, of which approximately 60% is saved by the insurer and 40% by the insured. Although the efficiency effect is greater than the cost of the plan, the big winners are the insured who not only save monetary and non-monetary costs but also benefit from reduced premiums.

From a theoretical model we derive that inferior physician quality as perceived by patients, implies patient shortage for the physician and more patients switching physicians. By means of a unique panel data set covering the entire population of Norwegian general practitioners (GPs) and estimation methods that adjust for potential endogeneities, we find that the occurrence of patient shortage increases the proportion of patients switching physicians by 50%. A competing hypothesis that GPs with a shortage of patients experience less switching because of superior access is rejected by data. To assist patients in making informed decisions, we suggest that the number of switches a physician experiences should be made public. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

First, we demonstrate that the notion of rationalizability by K rationales, introduced by Kalai et al. (2002), is NP-complete for K greater than or equal to two. Then, we show that the question of sequential rationalizability by K rationales, introduced by Manzini and Mariotti (2007), is NP-complete for K greater than or equal to three. Finally, we focus on the computational complexity of two models that refine this model of sequential choice behavior. We establish that the model of choice by game trees, from Xu and Zhou (2007), is NP-complete while the status-quo bias model, from Masatlioglu and Ok (2005), can be verified in polynomial time.

It provides a complete characterization of the domains of one period utilities, for which it is possible to explicitly describe a weak Paretian social welfare order satisfying the anonymity axiom. For domains containing any set of order type similar to the set of positive and negative integers, every equitable social welfare order satisfying the weak Pareto axiom is non-constructive. The paper resolves a conjecture by Fleurbaey and Michel (2003) that there exists no explicit (that is, avoiding the axiom of choice or similar contrivances) description of an ordering which satisfies weak Pareto and indifference to finite permutations. It also provides an interesting connection between the existence of social welfare function and the constructive nature of social welfare order by showing that the domain restrictions for the two are identical.

We do so in a two-period general equilibrium setting with incomplete markets. Market incompleteness implies that players cannot make all possible binding commitments regarding their actions at different date-events. We unify various treatments of dynamic core concepts existing in the literature. This results in definitions of the Classical Core, the Segregated Core, the Two-stage Core, the Strong Sequential Core, and the Weak Sequential Core. Except for the Classical Core, all these concepts can be defined by requiring the absence of blocking in period 0 and at any date-event in period 1. The concepts only differ with respect to the notion of blocking in period 0. To evaluate these concepts, we study three market structures in detail: strongly complete markets, incomplete markets in finance economies, and incomplete markets in settings with multiple commodities. Even when markets are strongly complete, the Classical Core is argued not to be an appropriate concept. For the general case of incomplete markets, the Weak Sequential Core is the only concept that does not suffer from major defects. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Herings, P.

Methods: The example PRO instrument was administered via paper, Web, interactive voice response system, and interview; a randomized crossover design was used to gather data across the multiple administration types. Participants completed the PRO instrument, demographic and health questions, and a short preference questionnaire. Evaluation included comparisons of the item-level responses and agreement, comparison of mean scale scores, score classifications, and questions designed to collect usability and administration preference. Here the authors provide a four-step evaluation guide to evaluate measurement comparability and illustrate these steps using a case-finding tool. Results: In the example, item-level kappa statistics between the paper and the alternate versions ranged from good to excellent, intraclass correlation coefficient for mean scores were above 0.70, and the rate of disagreement ranged from 2% to 14%. In addition, although participants had an administration preference, they reported few difficulties with the versions they were assigned. Conclusions: The steps described in this article provide a guide for evaluating whether to combine scores across administration versions to simplify analyses and interpretation under a crossover design. The guide recommends the investigation of item-level responses, summary scores, and participant usability/preference when comparing versions, with each step providing unique information to support comprehensive evaluation and informed decisions regarding whether to combine data.","[Nelson, Lauren; Gilligan, Theresa; McLeod, Lori; Lewis, Sandy; DeMuro-Mercon, Carla] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Dalal, Anand A.] GlaxoSmithKline, Durham, NC USA",Research Triangle Institute; GlaxoSmithKline,"Gilligan, T (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",gilligan@rti.org,"Coles, Theresa/ADX-4852-2022","Coles, Theresa/0000-0003-2941-8999; Romano, Carla/0000-0002-5528-5037; McLeod, Lori/0000-0002-7837-8033; Moore, Lauren/0000-0001-7117-6757",GlaxoSmithKline [adc001ho],GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline),Source of financial support: Funding for this study was provided by GlaxoSmithKline (study No. adc001ho).,,15,8,8,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,,,,712,720,,10.1016/j.jval.2010.12.007,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BG,21839410.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081300013,0

Therefore, one of the objectives of these programs is to reach the poorest and reduce their out-of-pocket expenditure. In this paper we propose the distributional poverty impact approach to measure the poverty impact of out-of-pocket health payments of different health financing policies. This approach is comparable to the impoverishment methodology proposed by Wagstaff and van Doorslaer (2003) that compares poverty indices before and after out-of-pocket health payments. In order to escape the specification of a particular poverty index, we use the marginal dominance approach that uses non-intersecting curves and can rank poverty reducing health financing policies. We present an empirical application of the out-of-pocket health payments for an innovative social financing policy implemented in Mexico named Seguro Popular. The paper finds evidence that Seguro Popular program has a better distributional poverty impact when families face illness when compared to other poverty reducing policies. The empirical dominance approach uses data from Mexico in 2006 and considers international poverty standards of $2 per person per day. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We utilize consumers' stated preference weights to obtain hospital-specific estimates of perceptions about unmeasured attributes such as reputation. We report three findings. First, consumers' perceptions of reputation and medical services contribute substantially to utility for a hospital choice. Second, consumers tend to select hospitals with high clinical quality scores even before the scores are publicized. However, the effect of clinical quality on hospital choice is relatively small. Third, satisfaction with a prior hospital admission has a large impact on future hospital choice. Our findings suggest that including measures of consumers' experience in report cards may increase their responsiveness to publicized information, but other strategies are needed to overcome the large effects of consumers' beliefs about other quality attributes.

Agenetic mutation responsible for this reduced effectiveness is detectable by genotyping. Ticagrelor is not dependent on gene-based metabolic activation and demonstrated greater clinical efficacy than clopidogrel in a recent secondary prevention trial. In 2011, clopidogrel will lose its patent protection and likely will be substantially less expensive than ticagrelor. Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor compared with a genotype-driven selection of antiplatelet agents. Methods: A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was used to estimate the 5-year medical costs (in 2009 US$) and outcomes for a cohort of ACS patients enrolled in Medicare receiving either genotype-driven or ticagrelor-only treatment. Outcomes included life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Data comparing the clinical performance of ticagrelor and clopidogrel were derived from the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes trial. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for universal ticagrelor was $10,059 per QALY compared to genotype-driven treatment, and was most sensitive to the price of ticagrelor and the hazard ratio for death for ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. The ICER remained below $50,000 per QALY until a monthly ticagrelor price of $693 or a 0.93 hazard ratio for death for ticagrelor relative to clopidogrel. In probabilistic analyses, universal ticagrelor was below $50,000 per QALY in 97.7% of simulations. Conclusion: Prescribing ticagrelor universally increases quality-adjusted life years for ACS patients at a cost below a typically accepted threshold.","[Crespin, Daniel J.; Federspiel, Jerome J.; Biddle, Andrea K.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Federspiel, Jerome J.; Jonas, Daniel E.; Rossi, Joseph S.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.] Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"Rossi, JS (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina Hosp, Div Cardiol, Burnett Womack Bldg 6036,CB 7075,160 Dent Circle, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",joseph_rossi@med.unc.edu,"Federspiel, Jerome/C-7519-2009","Federspiel, Jerome/0000-0003-0321-6280; Biddle, Andrea/0000-0003-0273-7439",National Institute on Aging [5R01AG025801-03]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [2T32GM008719-11],National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institute of General Medical Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),Funding and research support were provided by the National Institute on Aging (5R01AG025801-03) and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (2T32GM008719-11).,,85,42,48,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2011,14.0,4,,,,,483,491,,10.1016/j.jval.2010.11.012,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BC,21669373.0,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299080800012,0

In the absence of randomized controlled trials involving a direct comparison of all treatments of interest, indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis provide useful evidence for judiciously selecting the best treatment(s). Mixed treatment comparisons, a special case of network meta-analysis, combine direct evidence and indirect evidence for particular pairwise comparisons, thereby synthesizing a greater share of the available evidence than traditional meta-analysis. This report from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Indirect Treatment Comparisons Good Research Practices Task Force provides guidance on technical aspects of conducting network meta-analyses (our use of this term includes most methods that involve meta-analysis in the context of a network of evidence). We start with a discussion of strategies for developing networks of evidence. Next we briefly review assumptions of network meta-analysis. Then we focus on the statistical analysis of the data: objectives, models (fixed-effects and random-effects), frequentist versus Bayesian approaches, and model validation. A checklist highlights key components of network meta-analysis, and substantial examples illustrate indirect treatment comparisons (both frequentist and Bayesian approaches) and network meta-analysis.

This is accomplished by introducing a three-equation system, similar in spirit to the work of Heckman and Vytlacil (1998), describing the joint determination of a scalar outcome, an endogenous treatment variable, and art individual-specific causal return to that treatment. We describe a Bayesian posterior simulator for fitting this model which recovers far more than the average causal effect in the population, the object which has been the focus of most previous work. Parameter identification and generalized methods for flexibly modeling the outcome and return heterogeneity distributions are also discussed. Combining data sets from High School and Beyond (HSB) and the 1980 Census, we illustrate our methods in practice and investigate heterogeneity in returns to education. Our analysis decomposes the impact of key HSB covariates on log wages into three parts: a direct effect and two separate indirect effects through educational attainment and returns to education. Our results strongly suggest that the quantity of schooling attained is determined, at least in part, by the individual's own return to education. Specifically, a one percentage point increase in the return to schooling parameter is associated with the receipt of (approximately) 0.14 more years of schooling. Furthermore, when we control for variation in returns to education across individuals, we find no difference in predicted schooling levels for men and women. However, women are predicted to attain approximately 1/4 of a year more schooling than men on average as a result of higher rates of return to investments in education. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The objective was to assess the fracture risk among patients nonadherent versus adherent to therapy for osteoporosis. Methods: Medline, Embase, and CINAHL were searched for English-language publications of observational studies (January 1998-February 2009). Proceedings from two recent meetings of five relevant conferences were hand searched. Prospective and retrospective observational studies of patients with osteoporosis receiving bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone, or selective estrogen receptor modulators denosumab were included. Studies were required to consider both fracture risk and adherence (compliance and/or persistence); any definition of adherence/fracture was acceptable. Data were analyzed using pooled comparisons of the odds and hazard ratios of fracture in noncompliance versus compliance and nonpersistence versus persistence. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the effect of clinical heterogeneity on the results. Results: Twenty-seven citations were identified, the majority of which were retrospective database analyses considering the effect of adherence to bisphosphonate therapy on fracture at any skeletal site. The absolute frequency of fracture ranged from 6% to 38% with noncompliance and from 5% to 19% with nonpersistence (104-159 weeks). Meta-analysis indicates that fracture risk increases by approximately 30% with noncompliance (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.29 [1.22-1.38]; hazard ratio 1.28 [1.18-1.38]) and by 30% to 40% with nonpersistence (odds ratio 1.40 [1.29-1.52]; hazard ratio 1.32 [1.23-1.42]). Conclusions: Poor medication adherence is associated with a significantly increased risk of fracture versus optimal adherence. Improving medication adherence in patients with osteoporosis may lead to a greater reduction in fracture.","[Ross, Susan] SD Ross Consulting, Cohasset, SD USA; [Samuels, Ebony; Gairy, Kerry] Heron Evidence Dev, London, England; [Iqbal, Sheikh; Badamgarav, Enkhe] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA USA; [Siris, Ethel] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, New York, NY USA",Amgen; Columbia University,"Ross, S (通讯作者)，SD Ross Consulting, Cohasset, SD USA.",sdross720@gmail.com,,,"Amgen Inc., USA","Amgen Inc., USA(Amgen)","This research was funded by Amgen Inc., USA, and conducted in collaboration with Heron Evidence Development Ltd., UK.

This study estimates the long-run economic cost of disability in Ireland in terms of the additional spending needs that arise due to disability. It defines and estimates models of the private costs borne by families with individuals who have a disability in Ireland when compared with the wider population, both in general and by severity of disability. Our modelling framework is based on the standard of living approach to estimating the cost of disability. We extend on previous research by applying panel ordered probit models to living in Ireland survey data 1995-2001 in order to control for the effects of previous disability and income and correlated unobserved heterogeneity. The approach allows us to quantify, for the first time, the additional long-run economic costs of living associated with disability. Our findings suggest that the extra economic cost of disability in Ireland is large and varies by severity of disability, with important implications for measures of poverty.

In infinite markets, a standard assumption is to assume that the individually rational utility set is compact. Its drawback is that one does not know whether this assumption holds except for very few examples as strictly risk averse expected utility maximizers with same priors. The contribution of the paper is to show that existence holds for the class of strictly concave second order stochastic dominance preserving utilities. In our setting, it coincides with the class of strictly concave law-invariant utilities. A key tool of the analysis is the domination result of Lansberger and Meilijson that states that attention may be restricted to comonotone allocations of aggregate risk. Efficient allocations are characterized as the solutions of utility weighted problems with weights expressed in terms of the asymptotic slopes of the restrictions of agents' utilities to constants. The class of utilities which is used is shown to be stable under aggregation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, such a desirability bias should not occur in the absence of prior dispositions toward those outcomes. This assumption is tested in an experiment designed to track the evaluation of information during an emerging evaluation of risk. Results confirm the presence of a substantial desirability bias even when there is no prior disposition toward any outcome. These findings bear implications for the assessment of risk not only in the presence of prior desirability, but also in situations currently considered benign. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Wealth inequality is decreasing overtime, and many households work their way out of poverty and lower wealth over the seven year period. The accounts establish that, mechanically, this is largely due to savings rather than incoming gifts and remittances. In turn, the growth of net worth can be decomposed household by household into the savings rate and how productively that savings is used, the return on assets (ROA). The latter plays the larger role. ROA is, in turn, positively correlated with higher education of household members, younger age of the head, and with a higher debt/asset ratio and lower initial wealth, so it seems from cross-sections that the financial system is imperfectly channeling resources to productive and poor households. Household fixed effects account for the larger part of ROA, and this success is largely persistent, undercutting the story that successful entrepreneurs are those that simply get lucky. Persistence does vary across households, and in at least one province with much change and increasing opportunities, ROA changes as households move over time to higher-return occupations. But for those households with high and persistent ROA, the savings rate is higher, consistent with some micro founded macro models with imperfect credit markets. Indeed, high ROA households save by investing in their own enterprises and adopt consistent financial strategies for smoothing fluctuations. More generally growth of wealth, savings levels and/or rates are correlated with TFP and the household fixed effects that are the larger part of ROA. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A number of agents want to conduct some business or other activities. Agents may act alone or seek a partner for cooperation and need in the latter case to consider with whom to cooperate and how to share the profit in a collaborative and competitive environment. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which an equilibrium exists. In equilibrium, the partnership formation and the payoff distribution are endogenously determined. Every agent realizes his full potential and has no incentive to deviate from either staying independent or from the endogenously determined partner and payoff. The partnership formation problem contains the widely studied assignment market problem as a special case. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We showed that this estimator is consistent and derived its limit distribution under various assumptions on the kernel weights. In this paper we extend our analysis, looking at the class of subsampled realised kernels and we derive the limit theory for this class of estimators. We find that subsampling is highly advantageous for estimators based on discontinuous kernels, such as the truncated kernel. For kinked kernels, such as the Bartlett kernel, we show that subsampling is impotent, in the sense that subsampling has no effect on the asymptotic distribution. Perhaps surprisingly, for the efficient smooth kernels, such as the Parzen kernel, we show that subsampling is harmful as it increases the asymptotic variance. We also study the performance of subsampled realised kernels in simulations and in empirical work. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

By max-min algebra we understand a linear structure on a linearly ordered set with two binary operations maximum and minimum, used similarly as addition and multiplication in the classical linear algebra. The operations max and min are extended to matrices and vectors in a natural way.

Heavy metals are not biodegradable, having ability to accumulate in organisms. Cadmium is one of the most toxic heavy metal ions in the environment due to its high mobility and severe toxicity to the organisms. Zinc is an essential micronutrient for plants but can be highly toxic when present at excessive concentration. We aimed at investigation of detoxification mechanisms of maize plants (Zea mays L.) treated with the following combinations of zinc(II) and cadmium(II) ions 0 mu M Zn2+ + 0 mu M Cd2+; 100 mu M Zn2+ + 0 mu M Cd2+; 0 mu M Zn2+ + 100 mu M Cd2+; 10 mu M Zn2+ + 100 mu M Cd2+; 50 mu M Zn2+ + 100 mu M Cd2+; 75 mu M Zn2+ + 100 mu M Cd2+ and 100 mu M Zn2+ + 100 mu M Cd2+ for 10 days. In addition to growth parameters, we electrochemically determined the metal content in plants. To determine the antioxidant activity, we chose three methods FRAP, DPPH and ABTS, which differ in the spectrum of molecules with possible antioxidant activity. Pearson's correlation coefficient was found by comparison of FRAP and ABTS methods -r(P) = 0.7967 (Bradford) and 0.7957 (Pyrogallol Red). Pearson's correlation coefficients indicates mutual correlation of both DPPH and ABTS methods -r(P) = 0.8292 (Bradford) and 0.8737 (Pyrogallol Red). The highest correlation of Pearson's coefficients was found in comparison between DPPH and FRAP methods (0.9407 - Bradford and 0.9211 Pyrogallol Red), suggesting a very high dependence of the two methods. Thus, our attention was focused on the determination of activities of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). We were also focused on the monitoring of the GST activity. In addition, we monitored its correlation with total content of thiol compounds (-SH) measured spectrometrically using Ellman's method. Content of thiol compounds, such as reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, and phytochelatins (PC2, PC5) was determined by HPLC-ED. The highest values were detected at all used method treated 100 mu M Zn2+ + 100 mu M Cd2+ on the 10th day of cultivation.","[Kleckerova, A.; Sobrova, P.; Krystofova, O.; Sochor, J.; Zitka, O.; Adam, V; Babula, P.; Docekalova, H.; Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kleckerova, A (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",Andrea.klr@seznam.cz,"Sochor, Jiri/E-1135-2012; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Babula, Petr/AAL-6510-2020; Zitka, Ondrej/L-5588-2019; Krystofova, Olga/E-1127-2012; Sobrova, Pavlina/E-1090-2012; Ridošková, Andrea/AAK-4072-2021","Sochor, Jiri/0000-0001-7823-1544; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Zitka, Ondrej/0000-0001-7607-5058; Ridošková, Andrea/0000-0002-4650-6379",,,,,18,0,0,0,8,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,1019,1028,,,,,,10,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400125,0

We show that 1)the Spengler's double-markup model is equivalent to an extensive game in which the upstream monopoly has all power to set the intermediate price, and the downstream monopsony has no bargaining power. This assumption seems unrealistic. 2)We model this situation using the Rubinstein bargaining. The equilibrium of our model does not yield a double markup. Hence, the joint output, the consumers price, and the total profit is as high as those of a vertically integrated firm. Moreover, the profit is split roughly equally between the two firms. 3)Our model has different implications for the competition policy.","[Kvasnicka, Michal; Stanek, Rostislav; Krcal, Ondrej] Masaryk Univ, Econ Fac, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,michal.kvasnicka@econ.muni.cz; rostanek@mail.muni.cz; krcalo@mail.muni.cz,"Staněk, Rostislav/AAL-7813-2021; Kvasnička, Michal/B-4233-2014","Staněk, Rostislav/0000-0002-6310-4777;",,,,,10,1,1,0,4,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,431,436,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600071,0

The test is consistent against all departures from the null of affiliation, and its null distribution is standard normal. Like most nonparametric tests, a sample-size dependent input parameter is needed. We provide an informal procedure for choosing the input parameter and evaluate the test's performance using a simulation study. Our test can be used to test the fundamental assumptions of the auctions literature. We implement our test empirically using the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) auction data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

They are also significantly more likely to have used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. For 12-13 year old girls, the likelihood of self-reported abstinence and condom use is also significantly higher in treated schools, while the likelihood of having multiple partners is significantly lower.

We show that ASC entry only appears to influence a hospital's outpatient surgical volume if the facilities are within a few miles of each. other. Even then, the average reduction in hospital volume is only 2-4%, which is not nearly large enough to offset the new procedures performed by an entering ASC. The effect is, however, stronger for large ASCs and the first ASCs to enter a market. Additionally, we find no evidence that entering ASCs reduce a hospital's inpatient surgical volume.

Iranian fertility was on the rise. In a reversal of its population policy, in 1989, the government launched an ambitious and innovative family planning program aimed at rural families. By 2005, the program had covered more than 90% of the rural population and the average number of births per rural woman had declined to replacement level from about 8 births in the mid 1980s. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of a particular feature of the program - health houses on rural fertility, taking advantage of the variation in the timing of their construction across the country. We use three different methods to obtain a range of estimates for the impact of health houses on village-level fertility: difference-in-differences (DID), matching DID, and length of exposure. We find estimates of impact ranging from 4 to 20% of the decline in fertility during 1986-1996.

They thus force all time-invariant individual heterogeneity into the estimated inefficiency. Greene (2005) proposes a true fixed-effect stochastic frontier model which, in theory, may be biased by the incidental parameters problem. The problem usually cannot be dealt with by model transformations owing to the nonlinearity of the stochastic frontier model. In this paper, we propose a class of panel stochastic frontier models which create an exception. We show that first-difference and within-transformation can be analytically performed on this model to remove the fixed individual effects, and thus the estimator is immune to the incidental parameters problem. Consistency of the estimator is obtained by either N -> infinity or T -> infinity, which is an attractive property for empirical researchers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike previous studies, we control for toxic pollution from both mobile sources and non-TRI reporting facilities. We find significant adverse effects of toxic air pollution concentrations on infant mortality rates. Within toxic air pollutants we find that releases of carcinogens are particularly problematic for infant health outcomes. We estimate that the average county-level decreases in various categories of TRI concentrations saved in excess of 13,800 infant lives from 1989 to 2002. Using the low end of the range for the value of a statistical life that is typically used by the EPA of $1.8M, the savings in lives would be valued at approximately $25B. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We analyzed data from a Uruguayan household survey conducted in 2006 using propensity score matching methods and controlling fir a number of socio-demographic. family, regional, behavioral health, and labor market characteristics. As expected, we found a positive association between heavy drinking and absenteeism, particularly for female employees. Counter to the findings for developed countries, our results revealed a positive relationship between heavy drinking and labor force participation or employment. This result was mostly driven by men and weakened when considering more severe measures of abusive drinking. Possible explanations for these findings are that employment leads to greater alcohol use through an income effect, that the Uruguayan labor market rewards heavy drinking, or that labor market characteristics typical of less developed countries, such as elevated safety risks or job instability, lead to problem drinking. Future research with panel data should explore these possible mechanisms. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons.

Such 'spill over effects' in significant others may be distinguished in two distinct effects: (i) the caregiving effect and (ii) the family effect. The first refers to the welfare effects of providing informal care, i.e., the effects of caring for someone who is ill. The second refers to a direct influence of the health of a patient on others' well-being, i.e., the effects of caring about other people. Using a sample of Dutch informal caregivers we found that both effects exist and may be comparable in size. Our results, while explorative, indicate that economic evaluations adopting a societal perspective should include both the family and the caregiving effects measured in the relevant individuals.

There currently exists a variety of inferential methods for use in this setting. However, the question of choosing optimally among contending procedures is unresolved. In this paper, I first consider a canonical large deviations criterion for optimality and show that inference based on the empirical likelihood ratio statistic is optimal. Second, I introduce a new empirical likelihood bootstrap that provides a valid resampling method for moment inequality models and overcomes the implementation challenges that arise as a result of non-pivotal limit distributions. Lastly, I analyze the finite sample properties of the proposed framework using Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation results are encouraging. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that these additional mechanisms, instead of strengthening, actually weaken the restrictions that collateral places on borrowing. In fact, when collateral requirements are not large enough in relation to the effectiveness of the additional mechanisms, lenders anticipate payments exceeding the value of the collateral requirements. Thus, by non-arbitrage, they lend more than the value of these guarantees. In turn, in the absence of other market frictions such as borrowing constraints, agents may indefinitely postpone the payment of their debts, implying the collapse of the agent's maximization problem and of such credit markets.

In this paper, we estimate the relationship between childhood asthma and several outcomes as a young adult. To overcome many of the methodological issues plaguing earlier research on this topic, we estimate sibling fixed effect models that correct for measurement error using parental reports of asthma status. In our preferred specification, we find substantial long term impacts of childhood asthma on general health status, obesity, and missed work and school days as a young adult. Broadly, our findings contribute to the growing literature in social sciences on the impacts of early life health conditions on later life health and social outcomes and suggest early treatment of asthma may have long-run benefits on young adult health and socioeconomic outcomes.

Body mass index is positively associated with survey responses indicative of impatience and hyperbolic discounting, and negatively associated with those indicative of the sign effect. A one-unit increase in the degree of procrastination is associated with a 2.81 percentage-point increase in the probability of being obese. Subjects exhibiting the sign effect show a 3.69 percentage-point lower probability of being obese and a 4.02 percentage-point higher probability of being underweight than those without the sign effect. These effects are substantial compared with the prevalence rates of the corresponding body mass status. Obesity and underweight thus result in part from the temporal decision biases.

Geographically speaking, Matsu is closed to the Chinese Mainland and had been functioned as the military front for Nationalist Government in Taiwan against Chinese Communism since 1949. It was not easily accessible for the ordinary people from Taiwan for the purpose of tourism. The function of military front was lifted on November 7, 1992 and a new role is planned for the visitors. In fact, Matsu had never received any serious attack during the war although it was treated as military front. All the facilities were set up for the purpose of defense and had become a part of people's life. Military slogans, large-scale signs, artilleries, military barracks, underground tunnels and watch-posts have formed a unique type of cultural heritage and listed as a World Heritage potential site in Taiwan by Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA). This paper will examine these military facilities in Matsu especially the underground tunnels and argue that new social meanings will emerge and heritage significance will be appreciated if the concept of cultural landscapes defined by World Heritage Convention could be applied.

Koehler conjectured that the yolk radius of a random sample from a uniform distribution on a square tends to zero. The following sharper and more general results are proved here: Let the population be a random sample from a probability measure mu on R(m). Then the yolk of the sample does not necessarily converge to the yolk of mu. However, if mu is strictly centered, i.e. the yolk radius of mu is zero, then the radius of the sample yolk will converge to zero almost surely, and the center of the sample yolk will converge almost surely to the center of the yolk of It. Moreover, if the yolk radius of It is nonzero, the sample yolk radius will not converge to zero if mu contains three non-collinear mass points or if somewhere it has density bounded away from zero in some ball of positive volume. All results hold for both odd and even population sizes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, real financial markets are not frictionless. We introduce an axiomatic approach of Time Consistent Pricing Procedure (TCPP), in a model free setting, to assign to every financial position a dynamic ask (resp. bid) price process. Taking into account both transaction costs and liquidity risk this leads to the convexity (resp. concavity) of the ask (resp. bid) price. We prove that the No Free Lunch condition for a TCPP is equivalent to the existence of an equivalent probability measure R that transforms a process between the bid price process and the ask price process of every financial instrument into a martingale. Furthermore we prove that the ask (resp. bid) price process associated with every financial instrument is then a R super-martingale (resp. R sub-martingale) which has a cadlag version. The axiomatic of TCPP allows for the construction of pricing procedures extending the dynamics of reference assets and calibrated on option prices for a reference family of options. We characterize such TCPP in terms of their dual representation. Such TCPP provide new bounds compatible with the observed bid and ask prices for the reference options and reducing the bid ask spreads for the other financial instruments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In one model the type of an agent is fixed and evolution works on strategies of types. In the other model every agent adopts with fixed probabilities both types, and type-contingent strategies are exposed to evolution. It is shown that the dynamic stability properties of equilibria may differ even when there are only two types and two strategies. However, in this case the dynamic stability properties are generically the same when the payoff of a player does not depend directly on the type of the opponent.

However, the underlying causes for this increase are unclear. This paper examines the effect of family income changes on body mass index (BMI) and obesity using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort. It does so by using exogenous variation in family income in a sample of low-income women and men. This exogenous variation is obtained from the correlation of their family income with the generosity of state and federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program benefits. Income is found to significantly raise the BMI and probability of being obese for women with EITC-eligible earnings, and have no appreciable effect for men with EITC-eligible earnings. The results imply that the increase in real family income from 1990 to 2002 explains between 10 and 21% of the increase in sample women's BMI and between 23 and 29% of their increased obesity prevalence.

A Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies with an endogenous sharing rule is proven to exist. It is also shown that, in environments with fixed costs and constant marginal costs, all (symmetric and asymmetric) equilibria exhibit price dispersion across stores. Furthermore, the paper identifies scenarios in which prices will necessarily be random. In these markets, stores keep each other guessing because, given the fixed costs, they would incur a loss if their price strategies were anticipated and beaten by competitors. This is interpreted as an important economic feature that is possibly behind random price promotions such as weekly specials.

More recently, concern about such a value has arisen in UK health policy. This paper reports on an attempt to 'model' a willingness-to-pay-based value of a QALY from the existing value of preventing a statistical fatality (VPF) currently used in UK public sector decision making. Two methods of deriving the value of a QALY from the existing UK VPF are outlined: one conventional and one new. The advantages and disadvantages of each of the approaches are discussed Lis well as the implications of the results for policy and health economic evaluation methodology.

The main difficulty in these analyses is that cost data usually exhibit highly skew and heavy-tailed distributions so that it call be extremely difficult to produce realistic probabilistic models for the underlying population distribution, and in particular to model accurately the tail of the distribution, which is highly influential in estimating the population mean. Here. in order to integrate the uncertainty about the model into the analysis of cost data and into cost-effectiveness analyses, we consider all approach based oil Bayesian model averaging: instead of choosing a single parametric model, we specify a set of plausible models for costs and estimate the mean cost with a weighted mean of its posterior expectations under each model, with weights given by the posterior model probabilities. The results are compared with those obtained with a semi-parametric approach that does not require an), assumption about the distribution of costs.

Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole versus FLU or ITRA for prevention of IFIs among neutropenic patients. Methods: We used modeling techniques to assess the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole versus FLU or ITRA in the prevention of IFIs among patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The probabilities of experiencing an IFI, IFI-related death, and death from other causes over 100 days of follow-up were estimated from clinical trial data. Long-term mortality, drug costs, and IFI treatment costs were obtained from secondary sources. Results: Posaconazole is associated with fewer IFIs per patient (0.05 vs. 0.11) relative to FLU or ITRA over 100 days of follow-up, and lower discounted costs ($3900 vs. $4500) and increased life-years (2.50 vs. 2.43 discounted) over a lifetime horizon. Results from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicate that there is a 73% probability that posaconazole is cost saving versus FLU or ITRA and a 96% probability that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for posaconazole is at or below $50,000 per life-year saved. Conclusions: We conclude that posaconazole is very likely to be a cost-effective alternative to FLU or ITRA in the prevention of IFIs among neutropenic patients with AML and MDS, and may result in cost savings.","[O'Sullivan, Amy K.; Pandya, Ankur; Thompson, David] i3 Innovus, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Papadopoulos, George] Schering Plough Corp, Kenilworth, NJ 07033 USA; [Langston, Amelia] Emory Univ, Winship Canc Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Perfect, John] Duke Med Ctr, Durham, NC USA; [Weinstein, Milton C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA",i3 Innovus; Merck & Company; Schering Plough Corporation; Emory University; Duke University; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Several risk-sharing models exist including those based on sales volume, achievement of clinical thresholds, and achievement of cost-effectiveness thresholds. The objective of this article is to compare two risk-sharing arrangements and to investigate conditions under which each is preferable from the perspective of the payer and the manufacturer. Methods: We develop two two-period models to compare two risk-sharing arrangements between a payer and a drug manufacturer in which there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of the new drug. In the first risk-sharing agreement, the drug is listed on a formulary in the first period but delisted in the second period if the net monetary benefit in the first period is negative. In the second risk-sharing agreement, the manufacturer pays a rebate in each period if the net monetary benefit in that period is negative. Results: We show that the relative performance of the two arrangements depends on several factors and that neither arrangement is always preferred. Additionally, we are able to identify situations in which a payer and a manufacturer would prefer the same plan and other situations in which the two parties would disagree on which plan was most desirable. Conclusions: Because neither risk-sharing arrangement is always preferred, payers and manufacturers must carefully consider the characteristics of their individual situation when entering into such contracts.","[Zaric, Gregory S.] Univ Western Ontario, Richard Ivey Sch Business, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Xie, Bin] Univ Western Ontario, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Xie, Bin] Univ Western Ontario, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Zaric, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Richard Ivey Sch Business, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",gzaric@ivey.uwo.ca,"Zaric, Gregory/B-7665-2013",,Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation,"Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation(Ministry of Research and Innovation, Ontario)",Source of financial support: This research was supported by a Premier's Research Excellence Award from the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation.,,21,24,28,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,838,845,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00510.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19490563.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267130200026,0

A model was constructed to compare costs and outcomes under three adherence scenarios: no treatment, ideal adherence, and real-world adherence. Simulated patients' characteristics matched those of participants in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid-Lowering Arm and event probabilities were calculated with Framingham Heart Study risk equations. The real-world adherence scenario employed adherence data from an observational study of a US population; risk reductions at each level of adherence were based on linear extrapolations from clinical trials. Outputs included life expectancy, frequencies of primary and secondary coronary heart disease and stroke, and direct medical costs in 2006 US$. The incremental cost per life-year gained and incremental cost per event avoided were calculated comparing the three adherence scenarios. Mean life expectancy was 14.73 years (no-treatment scenario), 15.07 (real-world adherence), and 15.49 (ideal adherence). The average number of cardiovascular events per patients was 0.738 (no treatment), 0.610 (real-world adherence), and 0.441 (ideal adherence). The incremental cost of real-world adherence versus no treatment is $30,585 per life-year gained, and ideal adherence versus real-world adherence is $22,121 per life-year gained. Hypertensive patients taking antihypertensive and statin therapy at real-world adherence levels can be expected to receive approximately 50% of the potential benefit seen in clinical trials. Depending on its cost, the incremental benefits of an effective adherence intervention program could make it an attractive value.","[Cherry, Spencer B.; Benner, Joshua S.; Hussein, Mohamed A.] IMS Hlth, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Falls Church, VA USA; [Benner, Joshua S.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Ctr Clin Biostat & Epidemiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Tang, Simon S.

The study was a cross-sectional nonrandomized design. Participants were recruited from a tertiary multidisciplinary pain center in Canada. A computer-administered discrete-choice experiment was used to explore participants' WTP for various levels of improvement to PRM. Participants chose between two varying combination of treatments that differed in terms of their level of improvement in pain intensity, level of improvement in pain-related disability, and out-of-pocket monthly cost. The WTP to completely minimize PRM was $1428 per month. Reduction in pain intensity was valued more highly than functional improvement. For every dollar, an individual was WTP to improve his/her disability to the lowest severity (mild), he/she was WTP approximately $2 to reduce pain intensity to moderate and $3 to reduce pain intensity to mild. The potential return on investment in terms of health improvement gained was $3318 per patient visit per year. The morbidity associated with chronic pain is worth approximately $1428 for every month in the chronic pain health state. From the patient's perspective, treatment and management strategies that focus on reducing pain intensity would have the greatest impact on improving health-related quality of life. Valuing health improvement in monetary terms allows for direct monetary comparisons between the costs of chronic pain interventions and their associated health returns.","[Chuck, Anderson; Jacobs, Philip; Ohinmaa, Arto] Inst Hlth Econ, Edmonton, AB T5J 3N4, Canada; [Chuck, Anderson; Jacobs, Philip] Univ Alberta, Dept Med, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Adamowicz, Wiktor] Univ Alberta, Dept Rural Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Ohinmaa, Arto] Univ Alberta, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Dick, Bruce; Rashiq, Saifudin] Univ Alberta, Dept Anesthesiol & Pain Med, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta; University of Alberta; University of Alberta,"Chuck, A (通讯作者)，Inst Hlth Econ, 1200 10405 Jasper Ave, Edmonton, AB T5J 3N4, Canada.",achuck@ihe.ca,,"Adamowicz, Wiktor/0000-0002-7634-2985",,,,,24,20,20,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4,,,,,498,506,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00457.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,18798809.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266467800016,0

As a consequence of this development, methods for diagnosing the fit of these models are being proposed and implemented. In this article we illustrate how the concept of statistical identification, that was introduced and used by Spanos [Spanos, Aris, 1990. The simultaneous-equations model revisited: Statistical adequacy and identification. journal of Econometrics 44, 87-105] to criticize traditional evaluation methods of Cowles Commission models, could be relevant for DSGE models. We conclude that the recently proposed model evaluation method, based on the DSGE-VAR(lambda), might not satisfy the condition for statistical identification. However, Our application also shows that the adoption of a FAVAR as a statistically identified benchmark leaves unaltered the Support of the data for the DSGE model and that a DSGE-FAVAR can be ail optimal forecasting model.

Using the China Health and Nutrition Survey data for 1991, 1993, 1997, and 2000 on 4400 households in nine provinces, we examine the height-for-age of Chinese children aged 2-13, with particular emphasis on the growth of children living in poor households. We use mean regression and quantile regression models to isolate the dynamic impact of poverty status and food Coupon use oil child height-for-age. Our principal findings are: (i) controlling for standard variables (e.g. parents' weight, height, and education) poverty is correlated with slower growth in height-for-age between 1997 and 2000 but not earlier; (ii) in 2000, poverty is negatively correlated With strong growth in height-for-age; and (iii) food coupon use in earlier periods correlates positively with growth in height-for-age. The general moral is the crucial social protection role that Subsidized food programmes can potentially play in maintaining the health of poor children.

However, relatively little is known about the finite-sample behaviour of parameter estimators. We address this issue, by investigating ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators given a data generating process that is a purely nonstationary first-order VAR. Specifically, we use Monte Carlo simulation and numerical optimisation to derive response surfaces for OLS bias and variance, in terms of VAR dimensions, given correct specification and several types of over-parameterisation of the model: we include a constant, and a constant and trend, and introduce excess lags. We then examine the correction factors that are required for the least squares estimator to attain the minimum mean squared error (MSE). Our results improve and extend one of the main finite-sample multivariate analytical bias results of Abadir, Hadri and Tzavalis [Abadir, K.M., Hadri, K., Tzavalis, E., 1999. The influence of VAR dimensions on estimator biases. Econometrica 67, 163-181], generalise the univariate variance and MSE findings of Abadir [Abadir, K.M., 1995.

This paper proposes countermeasures against risks of financial services outsourcing. To prevent the legal risks, operational risks of service outsourcing provider, business risks of financial institutions that provide services outsourcing, dependence risks of services outsourcing providers, which exist in financial services outsourcing, two measures are proposed that financial institutions should strengthen management of service outsourcing and external monitoring system of financial services outsourcing should be improved.","[Cui, Mingxin; Zhou, Kai] Daqing Petr Inst, Sch Econ & Management, Daqing 163318, Peoples R China",Northeast Petroleum University,,dqcmx@126.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,ALFRED UNIV,ALFRED,"ONE SAXON DR, ALFRED, NY 14802 USA",,,978-0-9800510-2-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1236,1239,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJZ06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267479300193,0

Then it determines the object peer where the search object locates, makes a search hyper-cone which takes the line connecting the origin point and the search object as the axis, and determines those peers which intersect the hyper-cone.

A network of digital business ecosystems, which results from the structurally coupled and co-evolving digital ecosystem and business ecosystem, will offer opportunities of participation in the global economy to enterprises and to less developed or remote areas([1]). However, digital business ecosystem is a relatively new concept in the field of e-business research, and there is still a lot of work to be done to establish its theoretical framework. Therefore, this paper reviews the theoretical relevance and discusses the co-evolution of digital business ecosystem in theoretical and modeling perspectives. First, the concept is brought out by discussing views of main contributors. Second, a two-layer co-evolutionary framework is established in the digital business ecosystem. Finally, a Logistic model is used to analysis the value creation produced in this ecosystem when individual organization co-evolved with other organizations.","[Zhao, Jin; Liu, Yanping] Beijing Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,,zhaojinbham@hotmail.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,22,ALFRED UNIV,ALFRED,"ONE SAXON DR, ALFRED, NY 14802 USA",,,978-0-9800510-2-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,746,750,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJZ06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267479300115,0

Methods: We reviewed all articles related to diagnostic laboratory testing in the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry (www.cearegistry.org), which contains detailed information on over 2000 published CUAs through 2008. We analyzed the extent to which the studies adhered to recommended practices for conducting and reporting cost-effectiveness analyses. We also recorded whether the studies contained information on diagnostic test accuracy and costs, and whether any account was taken of potential benefits or harms of testing that are unrelated to subsequent treatment, such as the reassurance value of testing. Results: We identified 141 published CUAs pertaining to diagnostic laboratory testing published through 2008 which contained 433 separate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Prior to 2000, there were only 20 CUAs published, but the number averaged 13.4 annually thereafter. Most studies focused on hematology/oncology (n = 42, 30%) and obstetrics/gynecology (n = 36, 26%) applications. Approximately 63% (n = 89) of studies clearly reported information about the accuracy of the test, but only 10% (n = 14) mentioned test safety or possible risks. A small number (n = 10, 7%) mentioned or considered the potential value or harm of testing unrelated to treatment consequences. Over 55% of the reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were either dominant (more quality-adjusted life years for less cost), or below $50,000 per quality-adjusted life years gained (in 2008 US dollars). Conclusion: The number of CUAs investigating laboratory diagnostic testing has increased substantially with applications to diverse clinical areas. The literature reveals many areas in which testing represents good value for money. The vast majority of studies have not considered preferences for test information unrelated to treatment consequences.","[Fang, ChiHui; Greenberg, Dan; Neumann, Peter J.] Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Tufts Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Otero, Hansel J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA USA; [Greenberg, Dan] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Hlth Syst Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Tufts Medical Center; Tufts Medical Center; Ben Gurion University,"Neumann, PJ (通讯作者)，Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Tufts Med Ctr, 800 Washington St, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",pneumann@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,"Otero, Hansel/AAF-9084-2020; Otero, Hansel/AAP-1200-2020","Otero, Hansel/0000-0003-4626-0732; Greenberg, Dan/0000-0002-6759-3985",Institute for Health Technology Studies (In-Health),Institute for Health Technology Studies (In-Health),Source of financial support: This study was funded by a foundation grant from the Institute for Health Technology Studies (In-Health).,,64,31,31,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2011,14.0,8,,,,,1010,1018,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.044,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BM,22152169.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081900006,0

While family-fixed effects allow controls for all shared family factors, these estimators are sensitive to compensating or reinforcing behaviors by parents. These biases may be particularly important for estimating the effects of parental investment such as breast feeding, where sibling discordance may be difficult to treat as a random outcome and may result in persistence in differential investments between siblings. This paper uses a unique question asked to adolescent siblings about parental favoritism to adjust for potential reinforcing behavior by parents. Standard fixed effects estimates suggest important long-term educational effects of breastfeeding; however, these effects are uniformly eliminated after focusing on families who treat siblings equally. These findings shed light on the mechanisms linking associations between breastfeeding and longer term outcomes.
