Consumers have non-homothetic preferences over differentiated products of formal-sector goods and thus inequality affects the composition of aggregate demand via the price-setting behavior of firms. We find that high inequality divides the formal sector into mass producers and exclusive producers (which serve only the rich); high inequality generates an equilibrium where many workers are crowded into the informal economy; and an increase in subsistence productivity raises the unskilled workers' wages and boosts employment due to the higher purchasing power of poorer households.

The results suggest that financial crises have a significant and permanent effect, lowering long-term output by about 12-17 percent. The effect is larger in smaller countries in which the banking sector presented more important financial disequilibria. We also found that fiscal policy has been the most efficient tool in dealing with the crises, whereas the effect of monetary policy has been rather modest. Flexible exchange rates are found to attenuate the impact of the crises in the short and medium term, but to amplify the effect in the long run. International Monetary Fund support is found to moderate the effect in the long run. Finally, the effect in the CEECs is considerably larger than in the EU advanced economies.","[Furceri, Davide] OECD, Paris, France; [Zdzienicka, Aleksandra] Univ Lyon, GATE CNRS, Lyon, France; [Furceri, Davide] Univ Palermo, I-90133 Palermo, Italy",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; University of Palermo,"Furceri, D (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",davide.furceri@oecd.org; azdzieni@ens-lsh.fr,,,,,,,43,34,37,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Using the conjectural opponent's reaction, this article investigates whether the economic norm in Japanese gasoline market is strategic complements or strategic substitutes. It is found that the economic norm in the Japanese gasoline market over the period 1992 to 2003 is strategic complements, that is, 'Do it, since everyone else is doing it'. It is suggested that some of the fall in gasoline prices said to result from successful deregulation should really be attributed to the production expansion derived from this strategic complementarity.","[Goto, Ujo] Univ Kitakyushu, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Fukuoka 8028577, Japan; [McKenzie, Colin R.] Keio Univ, Dept Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",University of Kitakyushu; Keio University,"Goto, U (通讯作者)，Univ Kitakyushu, Dept Econ & Business Adm, 4-2-1 Kitagata, Fukuoka 8028577, Japan.",ugoto@kitakyu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper argues that the effective reduction of poverty resulted from rapid agricultural growth. This in turn was the result of a strategy of development involving significant agricultural investment. It will be argued that the ruling elite chose this path because it was dependent on agriculture for its political survival and a backlog of agricultural technology was readily available. Without the latter, Indonesia would likely have followed an extractive strategy with respect to agriculture (similar to Africa).","So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Grabowski, R (通讯作者)，So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",ricardo@siu.edu,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

As a result the estimated inefficiencies are subject to a combination of true managerial inefficiencies and the impact of environmental factors which most of the time are not appropriately controlled in the analysis. This study by examining 282 multinational banks from 43 different countries calculates the influence of their national culture on their estimated efficiency levels. By using conditional and unconditional robust efficiency estimators this paper provides empirical evidence of how different cultural values influence banks' global practices and thus their performances. The results indicate that there is a cultural pattern that has a positive effect on banks' performance. That is lower masculine, uncertainty avoidance and power distance values and moderate individualistic values. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Under a model that assumes a direct influence of tax differentials on the flow of FDI, each country's decisions are naturally 'coupled' to those of others, leading to a non-cooperative game in which countries-players compete for FDI inflows by sequentially altering their tax rates. Their decisions are made via a differential equation-based model used to predict the effect of tax rate changes on a player's share of FDI inflows. Our model, calibrated using empirical data from 12 OECD countries for the period 1982-2005, combines FDI inflow and tax-rate differentials to arrive at a steady-state FDI inflow share for each player, given its competitors' corporate tax rates. We explore the game's equilibrium, including the question of whether equilibrium necessarily implies a 'race to bottom', with low corporate tax rates for all players. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Since a customer has an impact on the quality of the creation of the service experience, it naturally has an effect on the image of the company. The loyalty to a store or a brand is affected by the customer's experience as well. This effect on customer attraction to a company is an important variable in business. The literature therefore identified four main loyalty forms in the area of consumer behavior: brand loyalty, vendor loyalty, store loyalty and service loyalty. Before installation and during the usage of self-service automated systems, it is useful for vendors to know if it would not discourage some customers. Yet, the affect of self-service option deployment on customer loyalty is not known. The purpose of the research was to investigate and relate certain consumers' traits to the usage/preference of self-service technology. It was discovered that, on average, more than 50% are active users and prefer ASS to personal service. The discovery of enhanced attitude towards a company, which offers self-service option, suggests opportunities of new type of loyalty development. The structure of the paper is determined by the scope of the research purpose. In the first two parts of the paper, the theoretical framework behind the proposed approach was evaluated. The methodological and analysis chapter discusses consumer behavior from a service and store loyalty perspective. The hypothesis of this paper is that the choice of self-service technology leads to a trait in that technology, resulting in a positive attitude towards the company. The empirical research is based on a sample of 547 respondents and addresses the potential existence of technology-driven loyalty. Usage patterns and opinions are assessed. Comparison of means and binomial regression were used to test for significant linkages between traits and usage/preference for self-service technologies. Research objectives were: a) review the literature about consumer interaction with self-service technologies and identify missing gaps/contradictions in existing knowledge b) describe consumer traits, that are influential for certain attitudes towards self-service technologies c) evaluate the importance of different consumer traits for preference and usage, using a statistical analysis and data from the survey; classify the traits on demographical parameters and d) provide recommendations for further exploration and implications for practical application. The findings indicate that consumers with a positive attitude towards self-service machines express an increased attraction to service providers. However, the frequency of usage has not a significant impact on the perception off self-service technology attributes. Furthermore, the findings show that the perceived advantages of self-service technology are homogenous among various users groups. The enhanced attitude towards a company, which offers a self-service option, suggests opportunities of a new type of loyalty development. Moreover, customers were grouped by demographic variables, indicating that younger and higher income customers are more loyal to technology-related service attributes.","[Huettinger, Maik; Cubrinskas, Vytenis] ISM Univ Management & Econ, LT-01129 Vilnius, Lithuania",ISM University of Management & Economics,"Huettinger, M (通讯作者)，ISM Univ Management & Econ, Arkliu St 18, LT-01129 Vilnius, Lithuania.",huettinger@v4ce.net; vytenis.cubrinskas@yahoo.com,,"Huettinger, Maik/0000-0003-2283-7226",,,,,39,1,1,0,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We uncover a puzzle related to such models: evaluated with a social welfare function, the steady-state outcome of a socially optimal policy, and thus the tail of the corresponding payoff sequence, may yield a smaller social payoff than a market outcome. The main questions we address are under what conditions this phenomenon arises and how general it is. We show that there are always Pareto-optimal policies which lead to the puzzle when the discount rate is fixed. In addition to discounting, the driving force of our results is that the periodic pollution and profits are linked to production capital. We demonstrate the puzzle with a model for controlling phosphorus losses from crop production. We argue that the puzzle should be taken into account in the policy analysis of dynamic problems, including negative externalities.","[Kitti, Mitri] Aalto Univ, Sch Econ, Alto, Finland",Aalto University,,antti.iho@mtt.fi; mitri.kitti@gmail.com,"Kitti, Mitri/AAP-8132-2020; Iho, Antti/JJD-2141-2023",,,,,,29,1,1,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The first permits the revealed preference paradigm to include a wide variety of so-called anomalous behavioral criteria. Sufficient statistics permit aggregation under heterogeneous behavioral criteria, not only heterogeneous characteristics, to facilitate meaningful economic welfare analysis. Atheoretic reduced form econometrics and traditional treatment-effect econometrics do not support welfare analysis, but marginal treatment-effect econometrics is useful for a certain type of policy problems. More generally, estimation of sufficient statistics requires theory-based reduced form econometrics. Sufficient statistics are further suggested for general equilibrium welfare measurement. Under certain assumptions about endogenous government behavior, robust concepts of economic welfare measurement emerge that rationalize the terminology and concepts of traditional welfare economics, although with a much broader conceptual basis.","Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Just, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",rjust@umd.edu,,,,,,,129,3,4,1,29,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4703-1,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

In short, the recent food price shocks make gainers and losers. The complexity of the concerns is examined in a political economy analysis of the phenomenon. More specifically, countries have been differentiated according to their degrees of vulnerability to the rising food prices. The second step examined the heterogeneities in the macroeconomic effects of the rising food prices on malnutrition, public spending, current account balances and food production in developing countries, emphasising the specificities of African countries, the position of the countries as food importers or exporters, as oil exporters or not and finally on the political climate-conflict or post-conflict-that prevailed right before 1995-2006. The findings are that food inflation increases malnutrition, pushes up public spending and dampens the current account balances in vulnerable countries, whereas it constitutes a financial opportunity for less vulnerable countries and/or for vulnerable but net food-exporting countries. While oil exports absorb the negative effects of food price shocks, African specificities tend to magnify those effects. Actual responses of countries remain limited in number, despite the great number of policy options that have been designed by international organisations. While severe budget constraints are binding on the use of safety nets, administrative policies often constrain the considered economy. An alternative compensatory mechanism is to sustain agricultural supply response by converting the food price shocks into real price incentives in the developing countries, upon undertaking the appropriate and viable investment in the sector.","NPTCI, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso",,"Kamgnia, BD (通讯作者)，NPTCI, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.",dkamgnia@yahoo.com,,,,,,,44,4,5,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We find strikingly favourable results for trend-stationarity for most of the 19 Asian-Pacific currencies studied.

Our paper demonstrates that this claim may fail to account for the anchoring effect of explicit targets on expectations and wages-found in the data by a number of empirical studies. We do so in a novel, dynamic game theoretic framework with asynchronous moves that endogenizes the frequency of the private sector's actions. We derive the conditions under which an explicit long-term inflation target makes the behaviour of private agents rationally inattentive and anchored. This is through enhancing monetary policy credibility, which leads private agents to reconsider expectations and wages less frequently to minimize the cost of processing information and/or wage negotiations. Such anchoring makes the policymaker's interest rate instrument more effective in stabilization, giving it greater leverage over the real rate. This implies that an explicit inflation target may improve the variability tradeoff, i.e. shift the policy frontier inwards. It can therefore make both inflation and output less variable in equilibrium, unlike what inflation targeting sceptics argue. We show that our results are consistent with existing empirical evidence, and discuss them in light of the global financial crisis. The policy implication is that the Federal Reserve, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank should be more explicitly committed to a long-run inflation target.","La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"Libich, J (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",j.libich@latrobe.edu.au,"Libich, Jan/JWO-5802-2024; Libich, Jan/ABD-4410-2020","Libich, Jan/0000-0002-2991-2228",,,,,82,8,8,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The conception of clusters is associated with the last (7-8(th)) decades of the 20(th) century, when competitive sectoral networks started to form and develop in the USA and Europe. These networks embraced traditional sectors (for example, chair cluster in Italy) and high-tech sectors (for example, Silicon Valley in the USA). It is quite obvious that economic value of these networks and interorganizational relations are enormous for clusters tend to improve productivity, innovative potential, entrepreneurial abilities and competitiveness of companies. In general, the widespread conception of competitiveness is associated with comparative (relative) social, economic, political, technological and other positions of companies, sectors and countries with regard to other companies, sectors and countries. Competitiveness is also a complex phenomenon of economy which has at least three dimensions: 1) macro, 2) mezzo, 3) micro. Macro level is associated with national economy, mezzo level - with regional or sectoral economy, micro level - with companies or business units. Each level has its own specifics and unique indicators that are used in the process of competitiveness evaluation. Competitiveness evaluation is economically important for various reasons: first of all, it enables to identify the strong and weak points of economy in order to ensure sustainable and harmonious growth; secondly, it determines the preconditions to create efficient stimulation instruments for market participants, as it reveals the competitive advantages of products, services, resources, business processes, management strategies, etc. and enables to forecast the ability of companies to survive under competitive pressure. Evaluation of competitiveness is also a complex multi-stage process which must take into account different quantitative and qualitative factors which determine the ability of certain companies, sectors, regions and countries to compete and gain competitive advantage with regard to analogical units. As various partnerships or networks (including clusters) gradually become a requisite, concurrent and integrative part of competitive knowledge-based economy, their contribution to competitiveness must not be ignored. Thus, this scientific research study aims at developing a principal model of competitiveness evaluation that shall integrate the contribution of clusters.","[Malakauskaite, Asta; Navickas, Valentinas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Malakauskaite, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",asta.malakauskaite@stud.ktu.lt; valentinas.navickas@ktu.lt,"Navickas, Valentinas/GPX-0310-2022; Navickas, Valentinas/I-9119-2018; Navickas, Valentinas/AAC-9651-2019","Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410; Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410",,,,,27,12,14,1,21,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We analyze how different compensation measures affect the alliance timing and option values. Generally, when profit structures of the two firms before and after an alliance are different, their individually optimal alliance timings do not coincide. Therefore, achieving an agreement on a common alliance timing becomes an important issue. To promote alliance formation, we examine two feasible compensation measures provided by one firm to the other: share adjustment (flow compensation) and subsidy (lump-sum compensation). We find that subsidy induces an earlier alliance, although share adjustment is Pareto optimal in terms of the joint option value. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, there is an ongoing debate about harmonization of alcohol taxes among countries. Sweden, with a tradition of high alcohol taxes due to public health arguments, has the highest excise duties on spirits in the EU. But, because of this, the occurrence and possible problems caused by cross-border shopping are also extensive. Using a questionnaire survey I analyse the Swedes' attitudes to alcohol taxation and find that these two sides of the coin are important determinants. Many respondents want to decrease the alcohol tax, while some even want to increase it. Those most positive to alcohol taxation are those who regard increased alcohol consumption as a worrying problem and those living in areas where many adults are treated for alcohol-related diseases. However, the ordered-probit analysis also shows that those who support the EU membership are more supportive of reduced taxation to harmonize the Swedish tax with those in other EU countries. Those who live in regions where privately imported alcohol is substantial are also more reluctant to alcohol taxation.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Nordblom, K (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",katarina.nordblom@economics.gu.se,,"Nordblom, Katarina/0000-0002-5587-0543",,,,,28,0,0,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The argument of the essay is straightforward: the contemporary governance projects at the global, national, and corporate scales are for capital for the purpose of universalising the disciplines central to capitalist reproduction. The essay is organised in 5 inter-related sections. First, it situates corporations against the background of globalising capitalism founded on the ideology of two-liberalism. Second, it attempts to unpack the nature of global governance' of contemporary political economy of development with particular attention to the governance mechanisms of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This section also lays the analytical foundation of 'meta-governance' as an intellectual filter through which the governance project of the Bank and the Fund is framed. Third, it sees these multilateral institutions acting like a 'global panopticon' in the institutionalisation of capitalist discipline from state to state within the system through a set of operating principles embodied in their good governance projects, and as shown in their poverty reduction strategies and surveillance mechanisms. Fourth, it tries to reveal the exploitative nature of corporate governance within the broader capitalist structure as an ideological assault to the working class. Finally, the concluding section sums up the essay and advances 5 theses on the logic of governance under conditions of global capitalism, and likewise hints at spaces in which alternative future beyond the constraints of the market forces could be advanced.","Univ Malaya, Dept Business Policy & Strategy, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Ponnu, CH (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Dept Business Policy & Strategy, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",,,,,,,,49,0,0,1,8,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

These countries are trying to modernize their power systems from a centralized environment (with normally, a public vertically integrated electric company) to a liberalized framework (unbundling electricity companies and, eventually, starting a privatization process). Two issues arise as crucial to achieving a successful transition: i) ensuring cost recovery for all future unbundled activities (generation, transmission, distribution and retailing), and ii) sending the right price signals to electricity customers, avoiding cross-subsidies between customer categories. The design of electricity tariffs plays a pivotal role in achieving both objectives. This paper proposes a new tariff design methodology that, complying with these two aforementioned criteria, requires a low amount of information regarding system data and customer load profiles. This is important since, typically, volume and quality of data are poor in those countries. The presented methodology is applied to computing tariffs for the Libyan power system in 2006, using real data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In both the Rochet-Tirole (2003) and Armstrong (2006) models, however, skewed pricing may simply reflect substantial differences between side-specific demand functions; non-concavity is not necessary. In the Rochet-Tirole (2003) model, ubiquitous high pass-through rates, which seem implausible, are required for non-concavity to be prevalent. In the Armstrong (2006) model, non-concavity is not sufficient for skewed pricing. In both models, non-concavity is associated with strong indirect network effects; in the Armstrong (2006) model, such effects are also associated with dynamic instability.","MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Schmalensee, R (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,15,8,9,1,28,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Increasingly sophisticated research examines the benefits of cleanup of contaminated sites, yet controversy remains about whether the benefits of cleanup in the U.S. exceed its costs.

The increase comes from a permanent rise in productivity following an efficient reallocation of resources in a frictionless economy. This article presents Norway as a counterexample using three-variable Structural Vector Moving Average (SVMA) with long-run restrictions. The results show that permanent shocks to terms of trade improve the current account and have almost no effect on the output per capita growth. An over-identification test that restricts the permanent shocks to terms of trade to have only temporary effects on output per capita growth cannot be rejected as well. Overall, those shocks that have permanent effects on terms of trade or output per capita growth do not have permanent effects on each other.

Changes in the regulatory environment, and in the competitive environment of a product, are taken into account. To follow the hierarchical structure, a four-level random intercept model was constructed. Price changes were allowed to vary randomly between drug classes, between different substances within a drug class, and between different manufacturers of a substance. This study provides evidence that two policy measures - reference pricing and temporary price freezes - succeeded in reducing prices in Germany between January 2004 and June 2006. For off-patent substances - depending on the competition faced by a drug - the effect of competition can be greater than the effect of regulation. The study, therefore, not only demonstrates the importance of competition between and within drug classes, it also provides evidence that generic entry has substantial effects on the prices of branded products.","[Stargardt, Tom] Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Neuherberg, Germany; [Stargardt, Tom] Univ Munich, Dept Hlth Serv Management, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Munich,"Stargardt, T (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Neuherberg, Germany.",Tom.Stargardt@helmholtz-muenchen.de,,,,,,,38,12,13,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Risk management, regulatory compliance, and especially financing are the key elements in achieving success in the international marketplace. The need of export financing results from the higher financial requirements of the foreign trade, in comparison to the domestic trade. The reasons of the higher costs of exports include the geographical distance from the point of production to the point of consumption, the chronological mismatch between the physical transfer of goods and/or services and the payment for them, and finally the higher risk of export operations. From the point of view of the global international trade, the Czech Republic is a small opened economy, with its foreign trade dependent mostly on the countries of the European Union. Worldwide, and in the Czech Republic as well, the governments support export activities of local producers, and they oiler loan programs specifically designed to help the producers to develop or expand their export activities. The support of export credit financing is generally based on the Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits (commonly known as the Arrangement). The aim of this article is to analyze the current status of export financing in the Czech Republic, the possibilities of official financial support, and to detect potentials for the Czech companies involved in the foreign trade. The article analyses the performance and structure of Czech exports, describes the current status of the state export financing support, and traces the prospects of export financing in the Czech Republic.

However, gaps still exist in the human resource management (HRM) literature on human resource (HR) aspects of environmental management - Green HRM.

This paper proposes a development of a new model of strategic green HRM by reviewing the literature on HR aspects of environmental management, synthesizing the thinking arising from the review of these literatures, and proposes research model. From the perspectives of strategic HRM and green management, this study argues that the new model should include among others the relationship of assessment-based HR interventions, environmental management system (EMS), green intellectual capital (GIC) and corporate environmental citizenship (CEC).","[Sudin, Suhaimi] Univ Tenaga Nas, Coll Business Management & Accounting, Bandar Muadzam Shah 26700, Pahang, Malaysia",Universiti Tenaga Nasional,,ssuhaimi@uniten.edu.my,,,,,,,27,24,32,0,18,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9083-4,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,10.0,,,,,,79,83,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZY02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303284800016,0

The final outcome of the project depends upon both the agent's investments and the first-stage outcome. The principal wishes to stop the project when the first stage is a failure; however, she may not know the first-stage outcome, so that she has to pay the agent a rent to extract that information. Furthermore, the first-stage agent can transmit his know-how to the second-stage agent. Although there is a transmission cost under separate agency while there is no cost under single agency, single agency is not always optimal.

While many studies provide descriptions of a firm 's CRS motivations both within and across sectors, there is a need to bring this literature together in a way that addresses, in a systematic way, the interaction of these influences at the level of the firm (Lynes, Andracuk, 2008). Though during decades numerous aspects of CRS have been the subject of the investigation in both academic and business studies. Apparently, this implicates a shift from the pure shareholder perspective of maximizing profits and corporate value towards a broader concept that encompasses multiple stakeholder concerns and values and, thus, involves various conflicting goals and objectives (Hediger, 2010). Neither the motives tools of an enterprise to operate in the manner are clear despite the fact that it is essential that business leaders assume responsibility in order to ensure the continuance of economic order and its sane evolution (Spector, 2008). Conceptually substantiated interaction between the corporate social responsibility and enterprise, high lightening motives through which the stakeholders are able makes it wealthy. Firms engage in CSR activities as a way to enhance their reputation, pre-empt legal sanction, respond to NGO action, and manage their risk and to generate customer loyalty. CSR can potentially decrease production inefficiencies, reduce cost and risk and at the same time allow companies to increase sales, increase access to capital, new markets, and brand recognition (Cruz & Wakolbinger, 2008). The analysis of scientific research has shown that academics are not scare in proposing insights helping describe the motivations for corporate social responsibility at the level of the enterprise, however, a generalizing view is still scare. This standpoint has a logical position: the construction of model helping to understand the construction of public relation and explain the potential influence in the process of CRS implementation and the role of stakeholders in it is needed. The constructed methodological framework could be useful continuing academic discussion on the topic. The findings of the article seek to influence public attitudes stressing the effect of corporate social responsibility. Basing on the article, public and industry as well as a social leader might determine essential strategic elements allowing achieving the mentioned objectives in the most efficient way. The logical structure of the article was determined by the aim and the objectives of the scientific research solution sequence which is reflected in three parts. In the Introduction the topic relevance, scientific problem and level of its analysis, object, the aim, and tasks of the scientific research were presented. The methods of the research, results analysis, scientific novelty and significance of the work are introduced there as well. The second part of the article is dedicated to the analysis of corporate social responsibility (CRS) in the market of virtue. The third part deals with - to the recognition of stakeholder values and pressure as well as the presentation of stakeholders ' role in pursuit of CRS. This standpoint has a logical position: it can be constructed as a model helping to understand the construction of public relation and explains the potential influence in the process of CRS implementation and the role of stakeholders in it. The possible extension of the model and its application issues are presented in the last chapter of the paper.","[Valackiene, Asta; Miceviciene, Diana] Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Valackiene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Nemuno St 33, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania.",asta.valackiene@ktu.lt; diana.miceviciene@ktu.lt,"Boolaky, Mehraz/A-9449-2012","Boolaky, Mehraz/0000-0002-2559-5843",,,,,30,14,14,0,49,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Within a stylized model of social interaction, it is shown that the development of cooperative social norms is greatly facilitated if the agents possess a preference for identity-consistent behaviour. As compliance with cooperative norms (in the long run) has a positive effect on the agents' pay-offs, it is argued that such a preference is evolutionarily advantageous. Notably, the argument, which assumes that agents always act in accordance with their preferences, also accounts for the cost of those features that are crucial for the selection process.","Univ Bonn, DE-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Wichardt, PC (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, DE-53113 Bonn, Germany.",philipp.wichardt@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,31,5,5,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

The analysis is based on statistical data from the Eurostat data bank on the working population aged above 15 years. Data processing and calculations were made using Microsoft Office Excel software and statistics-econometrics package Gretl. Economic theory indicates that there is quite a strong link between labour markets and the effective functioning of monetary union. A special role is played i.a. by the sectoral structure of working population, which affects the mobility of labour and the elasticity of labour markets, thereby influencing the ability to absorb asymmetric shocks appearing in the common monetary area. In addition, the sectoral structure of employment affects unemployment patterns in individual regions, which distorts in turn the adjustment process of prices and wages within the monetary union, disturbing the implementation of the common monetary policy. The empirical analysis shows that in the period 1999-2008 the differences observed in the sectoral structure of working population between the NUTS 2 regions of the euro area have been reduced. In particular, there was a decrease in the average distance between the structure observed in individual regions and the base structure, which may be viewed as the initial symptom of the integration of product and labour markets. Nevertheless, the existing regional differences between the member countries are still considerable, hampering economic integration within the euro zone. These differences are reflected by the less competitive type of employment structure in some countries, notably in Greece, Slovenia, Slovakia, Portugal and Spain, as compared with the remaining countries, such as the Netherlands, Germany, Malta, and Cyprus.","Uniwersytet Ekon Krakowie, Katedra Teorii Ekon, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Wlodarczyk, RW (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekon Krakowie, Katedra Teorii Ekon, Krakow, Poland.",ror20@wp.pl,"Włodarczyk, Robert/AAE-7167-2020",,,,,,50,0,0,0,3,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2011,,4,,,,,527,550,,,,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,829GB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295565500003,0

Although we observe adverse selection when workers have different exogenous probabilities for being absent from work, this does not lead to a market breakdown.

The most vivid examples are the 2008 failures of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Dealer banks are often parts of large complex financial organizations whose failures can damage the economy significantly. As a result, they are sometimes considered too big to fail. The mechanics by which dealer banks can fail and the policies available to treat the systemic risk of their failures differ markedly from the case of conventional commercial bank runs. These failure mechanics are the focus of this article. This is not a review of the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Systemic risk is considered only in passing. Both the financial crisis and the systemic importance of large dealer banks are nevertheless obvious and important motivations.","Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Duffie, D (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",duffie@stanford.edu,,,,,,,55,86,103,0,16,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

J,"Edgerton, J",,,,"Edgerton, Jesse",,,Investment incentives and corporate tax asymmetries,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Taxes; Investment; Bonus depreciation; Tax asymmetries; Cash flows,CONSTRAINTS; BEHAVIOR,Recent facts on the importance of corporate losses motivate more careful study of the impact of tax incentives for investment on firms that lose money. I model firm investment decisions in a setting featuring financing constraints and carrybacks and carryforwards of operating losses. I estimate investment responses to tax incentives allowing effects to vary with cash flows and taxable status. Results suggest that asymmetries in the corporate tax code could have made recent bonus depreciation tax incentives at most 4% less effective than they would have been if all firms were fully taxable. Cash flows have more important effects on the impact of tax incentives. Recent declines in cash flows would predict a 24% decrease in the effectiveness of bonus depreciation. Results thus suggest that tax incentives have the smallest impact on investment exactly when they are most likely to be put in place - during downturns in economic activity when cash flows are low.

In a survey of cliometric studies of social welfare programs in the USA, we examine the variation in the safety net in the USA across states in the 20th century, the determinants of the variation and its impact on socioeconomic outcomes. The USA has always displayed substantial variation in the extent of the safety net because the features of most public social welfare programs have been and currently are determined by local and state governments, even after the federal government became involved in the 1930s. Differences across states persist strongly for typically a decade, although the persistence weakens with time, and there are some periods when federal intervention led to a re-ordering. The rankings of state benefits differ from program to program, and economic and political factors have different weights in determining benefit levels in panel data estimation of their effects. Variation in benefits across programs during the early 1900s had significant impact on labour markets, economic activity, family formation, death rates and crime.","[Fishback, Price; Livingston, Brendan] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Allen, Samuel] Virginia Mil Inst, Lexington, VA USA",University of Arizona,"Fishback, P (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",,,,,,,,90,9,12,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

This paper examines whether the initial randomness in wages may have a persistent effect on post wages. We set up a human capital accumulation in which an individual may respond to the positive error in initial wage by adjusting hours worked thereafter in her career, and consequently may receive higher future wages than those who draw a negative error in initial wages but otherwise are equivalent. The model predicts that the initial wage, in particular, its random component, is a persistently important factor having positive effect on future wages. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79, we find empirical evidence that this effect is indeed positive and persists even after 20 years since the initial entry to labor market. The decomposition of initial wages by both parametric and nonparametric IV methods further shows that this effect is derived by the random component, not the observable component, of the initial wage. It implies that the observed cross-sectional wage variation within group can be accounted for the initial randomness in wages.","[Shin, Jaeun] KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, Seoul 130868, South Korea; [Gan, Li; Li, Qi] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",KDI School of Public Policy & Management; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Shin, J (通讯作者)，KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, Seoul 130868, South Korea.",gan@econmail.tamu.edu; jshin@kdischool.ac.kr; qi@econmail.tamu.edu,,,,,,,12,0,2,0,12,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

The process and conditions under which positive class compromise is acquired are identified in terms of the Polanyi-Gramsci nexus. This perspective suggests that the restoration of state-led developmentalism would be unfeasible under a democratic regime, while the implementation of a purely neoliberal blueprint may lead to unproductive class conflict.

This model describes the evolution of different HR variables in the light of external (macro) and internal (firm specific) factors. Based on components of this model, an interview-based survey of top level HR executives at 42 subsidiaries of large multinational companies in Hungary was completed. Results suggest that local subsidiary HR executives still maintain significant authority over their functional processes vis-a-vis the corporate office and expatriates are used less now than in earlier stages of development. Critical issues facing these executives varied by stage of competitive development between 1988 and 2005, HR staff continue to have significant in-country head counts, consulting is largely limited to training and development activities and most privately owned subsidiaries perceive unions as a marginal institution in Hungary today.

The paper discusses three periods, namely, (i) the high-growth period (1950 to 1985), (ii) the asset bubble period (1986 to 1990), and (iii) the period of economic downturn after the bubble (post 1990). During the high-growth period, government investment had a strong positive output effect and it increased the tax revenue in the medium and long run. The high rate of private capital formation boosted growth and tax revenue even further During the asset bubble period of the late 1980s, Japanese tax revenue increased due to high asset and property prices, and growth stayed high because of strong aggregate demand. The Japanese economy experienced slower growth after the asset bubble burst The LDP continued its high-spending policy by issuing Japanese government bonds (JGB) to finance the deficits but has not been able to revive growth to previous levels. Accumulated government debt now amounts to 180 percent of GDP and it will be difficult to issue any more JGB.

In order overcome these issues this paper analyzes the causal links between energy consumption and economic growth for G-7 countries using bootstrap Granger non-causality tests with fixed size rolling subsamples. The data used includes annual total energy consumption and real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) series from 1960 to 2006 for G-7 countries, excluding Germany, for which the sample period starts from 1971. Using the full sample bootstrap Granger causality test, we find that there is predictive power from energy consumption to economic growth only for Canada. However, parameter instability tests show that none of the estimated models have constant parameters and hence the full sample results are not reliable. Analogous to the full sample results, the results obtained from the bootstrap rolling window estimation indicate no consistent causal links between energy consumption and economic growth. We, however, find that causal links are present between the series in various subsamples. Furthermore, these subsample periods correspond to significant economic events, indicating that the findings are not statistical artefacts, but correspond to real economic changes. Our results encompass previous findings and offer an explanation to varying findings.

We document a relatively small, but statistically significant, positive association between CEO pay and insider boards that include the CEO and other employees as members. Additional tests confirm that this result is not driven by endogenous board structure and that excess pay is greater in the absence of competition from for-profit hospitals. We then examine whether management board representation is associated with larger underlying agency concerns that lead to reduced donations. Our tests do not support this hypothesis but do, however, reveal a negative correlation between donations and physician representation on the board - suggesting a potential conflict between the interests of donors and non-employee physicians.

Firms use school grades as a signal of workers' effective skills, taking into account that these evaluations are effected by stochastic shocks. We show that more precise evaluation systems, being associated with a higher reactivity of wages to school grades, induce students to provide more effort. Low ability students tend to react less than high ability students. Moreover, individuals with low abilities may prefer less accurate evaluation systems. Nevertheless, when productivity increases, these systems become less convenient and the number of individuals preferring them diminishes. Our analysis highlights an important trade-off between centralised and decentralised evaluation systems. On the one hand, frequent evaluations, typical of decentralised systems, weaken the impact on grades of those errors which influence student performance and, so, reduce signal noise, while, on the other hand, different teachers generally adopt different performance assessment standards, leading to noisier evaluations.","[De Paola, Maria; Scoppa, Vincenzo] Univ Calabria, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy",University of Calabria,"De Paola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy.",m.depaola@unical.it; v.scoppa@unical.it,,"Scoppa, Vincenzo/0000-0002-2774-0258; DE PAOLA, Maria/0000-0002-1704-4136",,,,,30,1,2,0,13,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

We estimate a fixed-effects model that controls for workers' unobservable attributes. The second major objective is to extend the existing industry-based literature by estimating a specification allowing for a comparison between the degree of wage responsiveness of within-firm stayers and between-firm movers. The findings indicate that average wages by industry tend to respond positively to low frequency changes in employment, and that there is some degree of wage flexibility within firm-worker matches.Le premier objectif de ce memoire est d'examiner la relation empirique entre des chocs peu frequents dans la demande de travail et les salaires moyens au niveau de l'industrie a l'aide d'une base de donnees longitudinales pour le Canada.

Le second objectif est d'enrichir la litterature au niveau de l'industrie en calibrant une specification du modele qui permet une comparaison entre le degre de reaction des salaires pour ceux qui restent dans leur entreprise et ceux qui se deplacent entre entreprises.

There is a discrete one-dimensional policy space and the preferences of the median voter are uncertain. I show that there is a range of moderate policies with no gaps that are optimal for the advantaged candidate. There is also a range of liberal policies with no gaps and a corresponding range of conservative policies with no gaps that are optimal actions for the disadvantaged candidate. The upper and lower bounds on these ranges of policies vary in predictable ways with the size of the advantaged candidate's advantage. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, I re-examine this hypothesis using a semiparametric partial linear regression that does not require the prespecification of a functional form prior to estimation. Rather, the semiparametric approach allows the data to determine the exact form of the size-price profile.

However, this producer is required to supply the energy associated with all its signed forward contracts even if some of its units are forced out due to unexpected failures. In this case, the producer must purchase some of the energy needed to meet its futures market commitments in the pool, which may result in high losses if the pool prices happen to be higher than the forward contract prices. To mitigate these losses, the producer can take out insurance against the forced outages of its units.

Qualitative evidence suggests a non-linear relationship. As income and military expenditure grow, the propensity to import first rises and then falls as a domestic arms industry develops. We face the difficulty that there is virtually no data on domestic arms procurement or production capability. We respond to this difficulty by adopting a random coefficient approach in order to identify any systematic influences on import propensity, through the impact of military expenditure, size of the armed forces or income on unobserved domestic production capability. While a clear non-linear pattern is apparent in the cross-section relationship, once one allows for parameter heterogeneity such a pattern is not apparent in the time-series. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the classic Traveler's Dilemma, non-binding precise messages about intent of play are pure cheap talk. We conjecture that a form of imprecise pre-play communication whereby subjects can submit ill-defined messages may help foster cooperation because of their vagueness. Comparing behavior both across modes of communication and to a baseline case without communication, we find that cooperation is highest when players can communicate using precise numerical messages. When communication with ill-defined messages is allowed, then conditional on receiving a message, subjects act more cooperatively than when no message is received. However, overall, the ability to exchange ill-defined messages does not substantially improve cooperation.","[Dechenaux, Emmanuel] Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Chakravarty, Sujoy] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Econ Studies & Planning, New Delhi 110067, India; [Roy, Jaideep] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; University of Birmingham","Dechenaux, E (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",sujoy@mail.jnu.ac.in; edechena@kent.edu; j.roy.1@bham.ac.uk,"Roy, Jaideep/HZJ-7846-2023","Dechenaux, Emmanuel/0000-0003-4734-0793; Chakravarty, Sujoy/0000-0002-1321-4222",,,,,28,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

First, using the reduced form of the matching model, we show that job finding rate fluctuations generate intrinsically a non-linear effect on unemployment: positive shocks reduce unemployment less than negative shocks increase it. For the observed process of the job finding rate in the US economy, this intrinsic asymmetry increases average unemployment, which leads to substantial business cycles costs. Moreover, the structural matching model embeds other non-linearities, which alter the average job finding rate and consequently the welfare cost of business cycles. Our theory suggests to subsidizing employment in order to dampen the impact of the job finding rate fluctuations on welfare. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We analyse this dual role at the macro and the micro levels. At the aggregate level, we construct a new measure of currency mismatch in the banking sector that controls for bank lending to unhedged borrowers - that is, those with no foreign currency income. Using our measure, we find that across emerging European economies, increases in currency mismatch are associated with higher growth in tranquil times, but also with more severe crises. On net, after taking into account the crisis period, we find a positive link between currency mismatch and growth. These results are also confirmed for a broader sample of emerging economies. In our firm-level analysis, we find that in emerging Europe, currency mismatch relaxes borrowing constraints, reduces interest rates and enhances growth across sets of firms that arguably are the most credit constrained - that is, small firms in non-tradables sectors - but not across large firms. An advantage of our approach is that it considers both listed and non-listed firms, and so we are able to effectively capture the effects of currency mismatch across the entire economy, not just the financially privileged stock market listed firms. - Romain Ranciere, Aaron Tornell and Athanasios Vamvakidis.","[Ranciere, Romain] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",Paris School of Economics; International Monetary Fund; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Ranciere, R (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,31,35,39,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

This is followed by a review of the existing economy-wide energy efficiency accounting systems with a focus on the analytical framework. The merit of having a precise and meaningful relationship between two basic energy indicators, the energy efficiency index and the energy savings due to efficiency improvement, is elaborated. An accounting framework based on the LMDI decomposition technique which possesses a number of desirable properties is proposed.

This study analyzes the dynamic economic impacts of building a hydrogen economy in Korea employing a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. As a frontier technology, hydrogen is featured as having a slow diffusion rate due to option value, positive externality, resistance of old technology, and complementary vintages. Without government intervention, hydrogen-derived energy will supply up to 6.5% of final energy demand by 2040. Simulation outcomes show that as price subsidy rates increase by 10%, 20%, and 30%, hydrogen demand will increase by 9.2%, 15.2%, and 37.7%, respectively, of final energy demand by 2040. The output of the transportation sector will increase significantly, while demands for oil and electricity will decline. Demands for coal and LNG will experience little change. Household consumption will decline because of the increase of income taxes. Overall GDP will increase because of the increase in exports and investments. CO(2) emission will decline for medium and high subsidy rate cases, but increase for low subsidy cases. Ultimately, subsidy policy on hydrogen will not be an effective measure for mitigating CO(2) emission in Korea when considering dynamic general equilibrium effects. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Each region's production involves the emission of pollutants, on which a regulator might impose restrictions. The restrictions can be related to pollution standards that the regulator perceives as binding the whole country (e.g., imposed by international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol). We observe that the pollution standards define a common constraint upon the joint strategy space of the regions. We propose a game theoretic model with a coupled constraints equilibrium as a solution to the regulator's problem of avoiding excessive pollution. The regulator can direct the regions to implement the solution by using political pressure, or compel them to employ it by using the coupled constraints' Lagrange multipliers as taxation coefficients. We specify a stylised model of the Belgian regions of Flanders and Wallonia that face a joint constraint, for which the regulator wants to develop a sharing rule. We analytically and numerically analyse the equilibrium regional production levels as a function of the pollution standards and of the sharing rules. We thus provide the regulator with an array of equilibria that he (or she) can select for implementation.

To be honest, this inability to predict does not concern me much. It is almost tautological that severe crises are essentially unpredictable, for otherwise they would not cause such a high degree of distress. What does concern me about my discipline is that its current coreby which I mainly mean the so-called dynamic stochastic general equilibrium approachhas become so mesmerized with its own internal logic that it has begun to confuse the precision it has achieved about its own world with the precision that it has about the real one. This is dangerous for both methodological and policy reasons. To be fair to our field, an enormous amount of work at the intersection of macroeconomics and corporate finance has been chasing many of the issues that played a central role during the current crisis, including liquidity evaporation, collateral shortages, bubbles, crises, panics, fire sales, risk-shifting, contagion, and the like. However, much of this literature belongs to the periphery of macroeconomics rather than to its core. I will discuss the distinction between the core and the periphery of macroeconomics as well as the futile nature of the integrationist movement-that is, the process of gradually bringing the insights of the periphery into the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium structure. I argue that the complexity of macroeconomic interactions limits the knowledge we can ever attain, and that we need to place this fact at the center of our analysis. We should consider what this complexity does to the actions and reactions of the economic agent, and seek analytical tools and macroeconomic policies that are robust to the enormous uncertainty to which we are confined.","[Caballero, Ricardo J.] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Caballero, Ricardo J.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Caballero, RJ (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",caball@mit.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1024619] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,56,182,205,0,35,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Ironically, the primary motivations for the main bank regulatory reforms in the 1930s (Regulation Q, the separation of investment banking from commercial banking, and the creation of federal deposit insurance) were to preserve and enhance two of the most disastrous policies that contributed to the severity and depth of the Great Depression-unit banking and the real bills doctrine. Other regulatory changes, affecting the allocation of power between the Federal Reserve System (Fed) and the Treasury, were intended to reduce the independence of the Fed, while giving the opposite impression. Banking reforms in the 1930s had significant negative consequences for the future of US banking, and took a long time to disappear. The overarching lesson is that the aftermath of crises are moments of high risk in public policy.","Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA",Columbia University,"Calomiris, CW (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA.",cc374@columbia.edu,,,,,,,57,25,30,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

According to the adopted framework of innovative capital, the BC will reduce human capital in LDC. In addition, BC will also have a negative impact on knowledge capital. These findings suggest that the BC is not coherent with the EU's development policy. Without appropriate policy responses, BC fade the developing country growth prospects away.

Two different approaches are compared. The first approach uses dynamic panel data estimation techniques taking into account oil consumption of the whole economy in an aggregate manner. The second approach employs the ADL equilibrium correction framework to model oil demand in each economic sector separately. The dynamic panel data approach estimates appear consistent with economic theory. The coefficients have the correct signs and the magnitudes of long-run responses are larger than the short-run responses. The single sector model approach yields similar but richer results. Relaxing the identical slope assumption reveals interesting sector specific characteristics. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines how the use of budget deficits as an instrument of stabilization leads to the accumulation of external debt with the attending effects on growth in Nigeria between 1970 and 2003. By synthesizing a relationship between budget deficits and external debt the study shows the implications on economic growth of conducting a fiscal policy within the contexts of debt stabilization and debt sustainability. The results of the econometric analysis confirm the existence of the debt Laffer curve and the nonlinear effects of external debt on growth in Nigeria. The study concludes that if debt-financed budget deficits are operated in order to stabilize the debt ratio at the optimum sustainable level debt overhang problems would be avoided and the benefits of external borrowing would be maximized.,"[Osinubi, Tokunbo Simbowale; Dauda, Risikat Oladoyin S.; Olaleru, Oladele Emmanuel] Univ Lagos, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ, Lagos, Nigeria",University of Lagos,"Osinubi, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Lagos, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ, Lagos, Nigeria.",tokunbosinubi@yahoo.co.uk; rissydauda@yahoo.com; delexyz@yahoo.co.uk,,"Dauda, Risikat/0000-0003-1446-3658",,,,,42,5,7,1,28,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

A natural experiment that took place in a high school offers an unusual opportunity to test this effect in a real-effort setting. For one year only, students received information that allowed them to know whether they were performing above (below) the class average as well as the distance from this average. We exploit a rich panel dataset and find that the provision of this information led to an increase of 5% in students' grades. Moreover, the effect was significant for the whole distribution. However, once the information was removed, the effect disappeared. To rule out the concern that the effect may be artificially driven by teachers within the school, we verify our results using national level exams (externally graded) for the same students, and the effect remains.

Researchers conclude that the amount of this disutility demonstrates the involuntariness of unemployment. This paper applies the happiness research approach to German panel data in order to revive the underlying economic question of whether unemployment is voluntary or involuntary. Accordingly, the decline in life satisfaction associated with unemployment is related to the willingness to work. The results of the econometric investigation indicate a very strong connection between unemployment-induced disutility and willingness to work, so that it is possible to divide unemployed individuals into certain categories, according to the potential voluntariness of unemployment. While there is a minority which can truly be regarded as voluntarily unemployed, most unemployed people actively search for work and suffer far more from unemployment than indicated by previous happiness research studies. A subsequent discussion includes a critical juxtaposition of the findings with policies such as the recent German labour market reforms.","Univ Munster, Fac Econ, D-48143 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Chadi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Fac Econ, Univ Str 14-16, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",Adrian.Chadi@wiwi.uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,14,21,23,3,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2010,63.0,3,,,,,317,329,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00476.x,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,626AV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279939000001,0

Fluctuations in demand disrupt the status quo and call for firms to adjust their capacities on an ongoing basis. We construct a fully dynamic model of an oligopolistic industry with lumpy capacity and lumpy investment/disinvestment decisions. In addition to uncertainty about the evolution of demand, a firm faces strategic uncertainty concerning the decisions of its rivals. We numerically solve the model for its Markov-perfect equilibria. For one set of parameter values, three equilibria exist, and while all of them have simple, intuitive structures, they exhibit widely varying patterns of response to demand shocks.

Our contribution is threefold. First, we employ a statistical model that takes into account the pervasive conditional heteroskedasticity found in financial data and includes a wide range of macroeconomic variables as regressors. Second, we test whether the wave of central bank reform that swept the region has had any effect on the existence or strength of the electoral cycle in exchange rates. Third, we test an additional hypothesis, namely, that financial liberalization may also be an important variable explaining changes in electoral effects on the real exchange rate. In a panel of 9 Latin American countries with available macroeconomic data and a history of exogenous election dates, we confirm the previous findings that real depreciation intensifies after elections even when modeling the significant conditional heteroskedasticity in these data. We also show, for the first time in the literature, that post-election exchange rates are significantly less predictable. We go on to test whether central bank reform has influenced the way in which elections affect the RER in Latin America. If reform has been effective at reducing political manipulation of the exchange rate, then any relationship we see between elections and the RER before central bank reform should be mitigated in the post-reform era. We find that the relationship disappears after reform and that post-reform real exchange rates are also significantly less volatile. Finally, we show that financial liberalization seems to have a stronger effect on the conditional variance of the RER than does central bank reform, but reform has a stronger impact on the conditional mean.

This is especially true for developing countries such as China and India, which face greater risks because of their lack of strategic petroleum reserves (SPRs). China and India both embarked on SPR planning during the past few years, with the expectation of eliminating the effects of future oil-supply disruptions. In the world oil market, there are probably interactions between the SPR policies, including acquisition and release strategies, of the two biggest developing countries. Understanding how their SPR policies interact and vary with important factors would help decision-makers develop more effective policies. In this paper, a stochastic dynamic Nash game model has been developed, in which the players compete with each other and make individual decisions to minimize their expected total SPR cost. Using the model, it was possible to obtain, for a few cases, illustrative results for each player's strategies for building up and drawing down strategic oil reserves These results indicate that the buildup and drawdown policies of the players are related to many factors, including oil-market elasticity, unit stockpile holding costs, disruption and disruption-continuation probabilities, maximum reserve capacities, and other factors.

Significant effects are often reported with p-values that do not account for preliminary screening from a large candidate pool of possible effects. This paper develops tools for analyzing data from experiments as they are actually implemented. We apply these tools to analyze the influential HighScope Perry Preschool Program. The Perry program was a social experiment that provided preschool education and home visits to disadvantaged children during their preschool years. It was evaluated by the method of random assignment. Both treatments and controls have been followed from age 3 through age 40. Previous analyses of the Perry data assume that the planned randomization protocol was implemented. In fact, as in many social experiments, the intended randomization protocol was compromised. Accounting for compromised randomization, multiple-hypothesis testing, and small sample sizes, we find statistically significant and economically important program effects for both males and females.

Using de facto and de jure regime classifications, we test the empirical relevance of these approaches separately and jointly. We find overall empirical support for all of them, although the incidence of financial and political aspects varies substantially between industrial and non-industrial economies. Furthermore, we find that the link between de facto regimes and their underlying fundamentals has been surprisingly stable over the years, suggesting that the global trends often highlighted in the literature can be traced back to the evolution of their natural determinants, and that actual policies have been less influenced by the frequent twist and turns in the exchange rate regime debate.

This economic study focuses specifically on an often-raised scenario: the emergence of a cooperative approach designed with the sole aim of logistic rationalization, and which would not have any effect on LNG prices. We first assess the annual gains that may result from this market-power-free cooperative approach using a simple static transportation model. The numerical results obtained suggest that, in the absence of a gain redistribution policy, this cooperative strategy will probably not be adopted because cooperation would not be a rational move for some exporters. The problem of gain sharing is then formulated using cooperative game theory concepts. Several gain-sharing methods have been studied, including the Shapley value and various nucleolus-inspired concepts. Our results suggest that the choice of a redistribution policy appears relatively restricted. Out of the methods studied, only one - per capita nucleolus - satisfies two key requirements: core belonging and monotonicity (in the aggregate). Lastly, we look at how cooperation may give rise to a coordination cost and try to determine the maximum amount of this cost. In view of the low level of this amount and the relative complexity of the sharing method implemented, we consider that the credibility of a logistic cooperation scenario exempt from market power should be reappraised.

Prior to these problems emerging, the price levels in these countries rose faster than the average Eurozone price level and their rates of economic growth were higher. It is conjectured in this paper that the two sets of events are connected. Using a formal theory of inflation in the Eurozone based on a stylised version of the New Keynesian model, it is shown that, due to a one-size-fits-all monetary policy, inflation rates in individual Eurozone countries are unlikely to converge, and their price levels are likely to diverge, causing large differences in levels of competitiveness over time. The reason for this is different real effects in these economies such as productivity differences or different fiscal policies. In other words the Eurozone is not an optimal currency area. Despite the outstanding record of the ECB in achieving its inflation goals, it is powerless to affect the underlying problem.","[Wickens, Michael] Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Wickens, Michael] CEPR, London, England; [Wickens, Michael] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",University of York - UK; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Cardiff University,"Wickens, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",mike.wickens@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,7,6,6,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

NON-EXPERIMENTAL MEASURES OF THE INCOME GAINS FROM MIGRATION,JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PROPENSITY SCORE; SELF-SELECTION; TRAINING-PROGRAMS; NETWORKS,"How much do migrants stand to gain in income from moving across borders? Answering this question is complicated by non-random selection of migrants from the general population, which makes it hard to obtain an appropriate comparison group of non-migrants. New Zealand allows a quota of Tongans to immigrate each year with a random ballot used to choose among the excess number of applicants. A unique survey conducted by the authors allows experimental estimates of the income gains from migration to be obtained by comparing the incomes of migrants to those who applied to migrate, but whose names were not drawn in the ballot, after allowing for the effect of non-compliance among some of those whose names were drawn. We also conducted a survey of individuals who did not apply for the ballot. Comparing this non-applicant group to the migrants enables assessment of the degree to which non-experimental methods can provide an unbiased estimate of the income gains from migration. We find evidence of migrants being positively selected in terms of both observed and unobserved skills. As a result, non-experimental methods other than instrumental variables are found to overstate the gains from migration by 20-82%, with difference-in-differences and bias-adjusted matching estimators performing best among the alternatives to instrumental variables.

Monetary aggregates are constructed to ensure that money is a national concept by excluding deposits owned by non-residents and including external deposits owned by residents. Initial estimates of a standard money demand function yield income elasticities which are high in comparison with what is typically found in the literature. We next expand the money demand function with four wealth and uncertainty variables, of which housing prices is the most significant one. The inclusion of housing prices in the panel regression reduces the income elasticity to around one. Country-specific developments in housing prices are also able to explain part of the monetary overhang in the euro area since 2005. We conclude that housing price developments within the euro area are relevant to an understanding of the demand for euros, and thus warrant close attention by policymakers at the ECB.

This paper examines the contribution of IPR to the recent surge in China's inward FDI. We consider two alternative measures of IPR and explore the possibility that the effect of IPR protection on FDI may vary by the level of economic development. Using a panel data for 38 countries, the empirical results indicate that the strengthening of IPR protection in China has a positive and significant effect on FDI. The results also show that FM from Hong Kong and Taiwan behaves differently from the FDI originating from other high-income countries. Journal of Comparative Economics 38 (2) (2010) 217-224.

Evidence from changes in electoral rules,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Affirmative actions; Gender quotas; Discrimination; Stereotypes; Politicians; Natural experiment,INDIA; WOMEN; RESERVATIONS,"In this paper, we analyze the effect of gender quotas on women's involvement in political activity by using a rich data set providing information on all Italian local administrators who were elected from 1985 to 2007. Gender quotas were introduced by law in Italy in 1993 and were in force until 1995. Because of the short period covered by the reform, some municipalities never voted under the gender quota regime. This allows us to identify a treatment and a control group and to estimate the effects of gender quotas by using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy. Our estimates show that women's representation in politics after the reform increased significantly more in municipalities that were affected by the reform than in municipalities that were not affected. This result also holds true if we exclude from our analysis elections which took place during the period in which the reform was in force. Moreover, the higher women's representation in gender quota municipalities is not related to the advantages that women who were elected during the reform have obtained from incumbency and does not seem to be driven by differences in temporal trends between Southern and Northern regions. These findings suggest that affirmative actions can be of use in breaking down stereotypes against women. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In practice, setting that price can be extremely difficult as uncertainties abound. There is often uncertainty not just about individual parameters but about the structure of the problem and how to model it. A further complication is the second-best nature of real environmental policy-making. In this paper, we propose some practical steps for setting prices in the face of these difficulties, drawing on the example of climate change. We consider how to determine the overall target for environmental protection, how to set shadow prices to deliver that target, and how we can learn from the performance of policies to revise targets and prices. Perhaps most significantly, we suggest that estimates of the marginal cost of environmental protection, rather than the marginal benefit, will often provide the more consistent and robust prices for achieving targets.","[Dietz, Simon; Fankhauser, Samuel] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Dietz, Simon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Dietz, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.",s.dietz@lse.ac.uk; s.fankhauser@lse.ac.uk,"Dietz, Simon/AAX-9362-2020","Dietz, Simon/0000-0001-5002-018X; Fankhauser, Samuel/0000-0003-2100-7888",ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,58,18,20,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The example is an opinion on the likelihood that investors would be held personally liable for debts arising in the conduct of businesses carried on through a business income trust. Since there is no direct economic analysis of this question in the existing literature, the paper uses the economic analysis of the limited liability of corporations. It uses this analysis because it focuses on the same policy question of whether investors should be made personally liable for debts incurred in the carrying on of a business. The paper reviews the economic analysis of the limited liability of corporations.

Despite the reversal of the regime and the fact that South Africa is a middle-income country, there are a significant number of people who are water-poor and poor in governance and institutional capacity to manage water. The recurring themes in integrated water resource management, reticulation pipes, weirs and pumps, stream flow regulations, and ecological requirements are dominant in water sector discourse and are alienating for those who do not master the language. There are constraints determined by racial, economic, or social structures that retain and reproduce dominant power relations. The paper considers the relationship between knowledge, agency, and shame and posits that unequal relations of power and knowledge restrict agency, jeopardize the building of trust, and may perpetuate feelings of shame. The role of the state in opening up water policy networks and redressing issues of knowledge, power, and agency is critical.","Univ Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"Goldin, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa.",jagoldin@sybaweb.co.za,,,,,,,43,47,51,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Moreover, impact of the harmonisation of VAT rates connected with the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU on the income distribution is examined. The burden table serves to show the distribution of the VAT burden among households by income categories; the generalised entropy measures and the Gini coefficient are used for measurement of inequality of income. Results show that the Czech VAT is regressive when annual income is analysed while the lifetime income analysis indicated that VAT is progressive. Furthermore, the results suggest that the distribution of income (annual as well as lifetime) after taxation was more equal before the harmonisation, and that impact of the changes in VAT rates in 2004 was likely larger on the lower-income households.","[Slintakova, Barbora; Klazar, Stanislav] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Klazar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",barbora@vse.cz; klazar@vse.cz,"Klazar, Stanislav/C-4619-2008","Slintakova, Barbora/0000-0002-7412-479X",,,,,22,12,12,1,17,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The principal result is that no evidence can be found that the user cost of R&D is an important determinant of firm R&D investment decisions. A corollary is that there is no evidence that tax incentives are an effective policy tool. Growth in sales is found to be the primary determinant of R&D investment, which is interpreted as evidence of the central role of demand conditions.","[Thomson, Russell] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Thomson, R (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Level 7,Alan Gilbert Bldg,161 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia.",russell.thomson@unimelb.edu.au,,"Thomson, Russell/0000-0002-1359-7542",,,,,75,14,16,3,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

The consensus on the role that asset prices should play in monetary policy appears to be shifting. The pre-crisis consensus that monetary policy should only take asset prices into account, insofar as they affect inflation, is being challenged. In particular, it has recently been suggested that the monetary pillar of European Central Bank (ECB) policy provides an institutional framework to incorporate financial indicators, such as asset prices, in interest rate policy. This paper empirically examines the influence of stock price developments on the monetary policy of the ECB before the crisis. For this purpose, augmented forward-looking Taylor rules are estimated for the ECB using monthly data between 1999 and 2005. Of special interest is the effect of adding stock prices as arguments to the standard Taylor rule of the ECB. The GMM estimations suggest that the stock price developments already had an influence on ECB interest rates before the crisis. We offer an institutional explanation based on the monetary pillar of ECB policy and argue that this pillar has already served as a de facto conduit for stock prices to affect monetary policy before the outbreak of the financial crisis. We discuss the policy implications of our findings. (C) 2010 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Botzen, W. J.

We gauge economic enlightenment based on responses to eight economic questions. A number of controversial interpretive issues attend our measure, including: (1) our designation of enlightened answers; (2) an asymmetry in sometimes challenging leftist mentalities without ever specifically challenging conservative and libertarian mentalities; (3) our simple 8-question test is merely a baseline and does not gauge the heights of economic enlightenment; and (4) a concern about response bias-namely, that less intelligent people would be less likely to participate in the survey. Even with the caveats in mind, however, the results are important. They indicate that, for people inclined to take such a survey, basic economic enlightenment is not correlated with going to college. We also show economic enlightenment by ideological groups-the conservatives and libertarians do significantly better than the liberals, progressives, and moderates-and we show that the finding about education holds up when we look within each ideological group (with perhaps the exception of the conservative group). We discuss possible explanations for the finding that economic enlightenment is not correlated with going to college. We also report simple findings for the relation between economic enlightenment and each of the following variables: 2008 presidential vote, party affiliation, voting participation, race or ethnic group, urban vs. rural, religious affiliation, religious participation, union membership, marital status, membership in armed forces, NASCAR fandom, membership in the investor class, patronage at Wal-Mart, household income, and gender.

We compare the uniform price and the discriminatory auction in a setting of supply uncertainty, where uncertainty is caused by the interplay of two factors: the seller's private information about marginal cost and the seller's incentive to sell the profit-maximizing quantity, given the received bids. In every symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium, bidders submit higher bids in the uniform price auction than in the discriminatory auction. In the two-bidder case, this result extends to the set of rationalizable strategies. As a consequence, we find that the uniform price auction generates a higher expected revenue for the seller and a higher trade volume.

Since both the suicide rate and income inequality (Gini coefficient) in Japan are integrated of order one for the sample period 1951-2007, the existence of cointegration is a prerequisite for the successful modeling of their relationship. The Durbin-Hausman test shows that the suicide rate is cointegrated with income inequality and the unemployment rate. The dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) methods demonstrate that income inequality and the unemployment rate are positively and significantly related to the suicide rate in Japan, and there is evidence supporting the parameter stability of our suicide model. Furthermore, the lag-augmented vector autoregression (LA-VAR) approach shows that there exists unidirectional Granger-causality from income inequality to the suicide rate. Hence, the fluctuations in Japan's suicide rate are partially explained by income inequality.","Onomichi Univ, Dept Econ Management & Informat Sci, Hiroshima 7228506, Japan",,"Inagaki, K (通讯作者)，Onomichi Univ, Dept Econ Management & Informat Sci, 1600 Hisayamada, Hiroshima 7228506, Japan.",inagaki@onomichi-u.ac.jp,,"Inagaki, Kazuyuki/0000-0002-4669-084X",,,,,35,27,30,0,28,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,,,J APPL ECON,J.

This paper evaluates the impact of strengthening patent rights (PRs) in developing countries on developed countries' exports over the 1962-2000 period. Colonial origin is used to isolate exogenous variation in PRs. The impact is then identified by examining the cross-industry difference in sensitivity to PRs. I find that the increase in PRs made in response to the TRIPs agreement added about $35 billion (2000 US dollars) to the value of developed countries' patent-sensitive exports into 18 developing countries. This amount is equivalent to an 8.6% increase in these developing countries' annual value of patent-sensitive imports. The increase in the value of exports was driven by a quantity, rather than a price, increase. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We employ the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) Granger causality test, the generalized impulse response approach, and variance decompositions in a multivariate setting to uncover the extent and the magnitude of the relationship among variables. Our empirical results find evidence of a unidirectional relationship running from energy consumption to real income in Canada, Italy, and the UK, indicating that energy conservation may hinder economic growth in the three countries. Furthermore, the causality relationship appears to be unidirectional, but reversed, for France and Japan, implying that energy conservation in both countries may still be viable, but without being detrimental to economic growth. As to Germany and the U.S., there is no causality between the variables, which demonstrates the 'neutrality hypothesis', and in such a case economic growth will not affect energy use. We further see that the impact of capital stock is relatively higher compared with that of energy consumption. Transitory initial impacts of innovations in energy consumption on capital stock and real income are observed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As one explanation, I explore the role of home production as a substitute for consumer expenses. Taking a combined look at consumer expenditures and time use pre- and post-retirement, I find a significant drop of about 17% of pre-retirement expenses at retirement which coincides with an increase in time spent on home production of an additional 89 minutes per day, accounting for 21% of average home production.","[Luhrmann, Melanie] Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, London WC1E 7AE, England; [Luhrmann, Melanie] Inst Fiscal Studies, London WC1E 7AE, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lührmann, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, 7 Ridgmount St, London WC1E 7AE, England.",m.luhrmann@ifs.org.uk,,"Luhrmann, Melanie/0000-0002-2257-8407",,,,,22,13,14,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

An outstanding conjecture (e.g., Peters and Severinov 1997) is that the sellers post prices close to their marginal costs when the market becomes large. This conjecture is confirmed in this paper: we show that if all sellers have zero costs, then the equilibrium reserve price converges to 0 in distribution. Under further conditions there is a symmetric pure strategy equilibrium. In this equilibrium, if the ratio of buyers to sellers increases, then the equilibrium reserve price increases, and the reserve price is decreasing in the size of the market. Convergence of reserve prices occurs at the fast rate of 1/n if the ratio of buyers to sellers is held constant.","Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Virág, G (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",gvirag@mail.rochester.edu,,,,,,,9,22,28,0,5,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

In this article we develop a continuous time framework, where ecological interaction is described by a stochastic dynamics, including the cases of predator-prey and competition. We obtain a stochastic differential game and derive Markov feedback Nash-equilibrium strategies in semi-analytic form. Furthermore we compare the results with the case where fisheries regulations restrict each fishery to harvest only one species and study the inefficiencies which arise from this. In addition to that, we also consider the case where fisheries cooperate. Here we observe quite different effects on the ecosystem, depending on whether the system is competitive or predator-prey.

Based on a standard consumption-based asset pricing model, the model incorporates a new feature that investors have to learn about the unobservable alternations between expansions and recessions. The model captures the qualitative property that, real interest rates increase with expected future consumption growth. The simulation technique of the Gibbs Sampling is used to estimate and calibrate the model. It is discovered that the conditional variances of consumption growth are too small to be modeled as a time-vary volatility process. This finding casts doubt on Weitzman (2007). Furthermore, the model largely duplicates the dynamics of real interest rates prior to Year 1980. However, it fails to yield the drastic increase in the real interest rates during the 1981-1982 Recession, which was mainly caused by the quick tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. It is concluded that the consumption-based asset pricing models without a monetary perspective arc difficult to fully capture the dynamics of real interest rates in the US data.","Cent Univ Finance & Econ, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, YL (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ayzhang@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,9,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

Inefficient unemployment fluctuations arise when we introduce real-wage rigidities.

This result contradicts the previous findings of Gall and Perotti. It also appears that fiscal rules differ between large and small countries; large countries follow a procyclical discretionary policy. Furthermore, the paper shows that discretionary fiscal policy exhibits different behaviour when facing supply or demand constraints. A procyclical discretionary policy is followed mainly during upswings, when supply constraints arc prevalent.

This is a fundamental question in much of the contemporary debate on distributive justice. Different fairness ideals, such as strict egalitarianism, and different versions of equal opportunity ethics and libertarianism give different answers to this question. In order to study the prevalence of these fairness ideals in society, we present the results from a dictator game where the distribution phase is preceded by a production phase. Each participant's contribution is a result of working time, productivity and price. We estimate what factors the participants hold each other responsible for and the weight they attach to fairness.

His paper does not, however, account for the fact that many workers remained within the basic-wage range after the change was made in the incentive scheme. In the present paper we explore how the incentive effect might have been different for those workers seeking the basic wage, and those workers seeking the piece-rate component of the wage.

While having to abide by the law of minimum wages, firms must determine who should be assigned which job and at what Salary. In Such situations fair (envy-free) allocations usually fail to exist. To cope with this Situation, this paper proposes a new concept of fairness, called constrained fairness. Among the set of constrainedly fair allocations, the so-called constrainedly fair and minimal allocations are of particular interest. The reason for this is that the salaries are not only compatible with the minimum wages; they are also optimal from the standpoint of cost-minimizing firms and the assignment of jobs is efficient from the viewpoint of workers. A convergent dynamic procedure that identifies constrainedly fair and minimal allocations is proposed. Furthermore, strategic properties of the mechanism are derived, and two notions of efficiency are evaluated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Our approach is inspired by the literature on bivariate inequality (the concentration index) and univariate polarization. Like the concentration index, our social polarization measures can be easily computed thanks to a convenient regression and decomposed into their determinants. Moreover changes in polarization can also be decomposed into their causes. The paper also provides an empirical illustration of our methods for the probability of reporting excellent or very good health, using cross-sectional data on French women. The findings suggest that after 65 years of age, social polarization in this probability decreases whereas social inequality remains stable. Consequently social polarization conveys additional information to that contained in the concentration index.","Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Apouey, BH (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, 4202 E Fowler Ave,BSN 3403, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",benedicte.apouey@gmail.com,"Apouey, Bénédicte/S-8030-2019","Apouey, Bénédicte/0000-0003-1575-8423",,,,,21,12,13,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Cross-section and pooled data suggest that governments are in a position to influence national saving and we set out a simple overlapping generation model to show the effects of national debt, of pay-as-you-benefit systems, and of legacies and movements to land prices as means of effecting transfers between generations. Having shown that governments can influence the distribution of resources between generations we then discuss three notions of fairness between generations: (i) that each cohort should pay its own way; (ii) that a social planner should reallocate resources between generations to achieve an inter-temporal optimum; and (iii) that resources should be reallocated so that generations alive at the same time have similar living standards.

The crisis also came in the context of a rally in asset prices and large domestic imbalances in the United States. This paper uses a small open-economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrum (DSGE) model to design the correct monetary policy response to a protracted supply shock, and examines how that response would change when many become credit constrained-like in a credit crunch-and when spending of those who can still borrow becomes very sensitive to the interest rates because of overleveraging. Using a version of the model with Kalman learning, the paper also evaluates the implications of a loss of target credibility, showing how rules must be adjusted when the authorities' commitment to the inflation target has been eroded. The appropriate response to future evolutions of the price of oil, including to large downward corrections from the current level, is also evaluated.","[Batini, Nicoletta; Tereanu, Eugen] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Batini, N (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",nbatini@imf.org; etereanu@imf.org,,,,,,,55,5,6,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

These policy debates often aim to mitigate the costs of immigration and augment the benefits. Key to this is understanding the characteristics of immigrants, especially those related to economic success and integration. A commonly accepted finding in the economic literature regards the declining economic quality of successive immigrant cohorts as measured by differences in entry wages across cohorts. In this paper, I refine our understanding of immigrant cohort quality. I show that increasing competition in the labor market among immigrants can explain a significant portion of declining quality. This result suggests that labor market interactions are as important to immigrant economic integration as their inherent quality.","Publ Policy Inst Calif, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA",,"Bohn, SE (通讯作者)，Publ Policy Inst Calif, 500 Washington St, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA.",bohn@ppic.org,,,,,,,19,6,6,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

When firms are sufficiently patient, there exists a stable cartel involving the largest firms. A firm with sufficiently small capacity is not a member of any stable cartel. When a cartel is not all-inclusive, colluding firms set a price that serves as an umbrella with non-cartel members pricing below it and producing at capacity. Contrary to previous work, our results suggest that the most severe coordinated effects may come from mergers involving moderate-sized firms, rather than the largest or smallest firms.","[Bos, Iwan] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Harrington, Joseph E., Jr.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Maastricht University; Johns Hopkins University,"Bos, I (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands.",i.bos@maastrichtuniversity.nl; joe.harrington@jhu.edu,,,,,,,22,66,73,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

Light pollution obscures the heavens, interferes with wildlife, and wastes billions of dollars in energy annually. Light pollution can be easily mitigated, but unfortunately, it has gone largely unnoticed as a preventable environmental problem. This paper examines light pollution as well as the value of the night sky. The paper focuses on society's disregard for the loss of a cultural asset that has been a part of art, science, and culture for as long as these things have existed. It argues that the blame lies largely in an inability to articulate adequately the value of natural beauty. It is further argued that such beauty has instrumental value, and the explicit recognition of this value is an important step toward preserving the night sky and other objects of natural beauty.","Missouri State Univ, Springfield, MO USA",Missouri State University,"Gallaway, T (通讯作者)，Missouri State Univ, Springfield, MO USA.",,,,,,,,41,34,35,7,36,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The production decision has to be taken when the price of an input factor is perceived as random. However, a signal is observable in advance, conveying some information about the future factor price. Transparency is linked to the informational content of this signal. The impact of a higher level of transparency is analyzed from an ex ante perspective, i.e. before the information signal is observed. The change of factor use, production amount and cost are determined by comparing the strength of the curvatures of total and marginal product. By contrast, ex ante profit always increases, independently of the shape of the production function. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate that 25% of the sample is employed in ethnic niches in the manufacturing sector, but that niche employment varies markedly by language group. In addition, certain language groups tend to be clustered in advantageous niches where monthly income and skill levels are relatively high, while others occupy disadvantageous niches where monthly income and skill levels are relatively low.

As a case study, this paper assesses the distributional effects of a rise in various petroleum product prices in Mali using a standard computable general equilibrium model. The results suggest that rising diesel prices primarily affect richer households, while the poorest ones tend to suffer more from higher kerosene and gasoline prices. Overall, the impact of fuel prices on household budgets shows a U-shaped relationship with expenditure per capita. Regardless of the oil product considered, high-income households benefit disproportionately from oil price subsidies. This suggests that petroleum price subsidies are ineffective in protecting the income of poor households compared with a targeted subsidy.","[Kpodar, Kangni] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Djiofack, Calvin] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",International Monetary Fund; The World Bank,"Kpodar, K (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",kkpodar@imf.org,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Other things being equal, graduates with better college GPA were more likely to be employed (in particular by high-pay foreign firms) in both colleges. Female advantage in GPA helped to produce a surprising gender employment gap favoring female graduates. Our empirical evidence does not support the three alternative hypotheses of such a gap. Even though the job-market returns to GPA might be higher for women, there is some weak evidence that the job-market preferred male graduates over their female peers with similar qualifications. Pre-college urban hukou status and a proxy of father's education had positive impacts on a graduate's educational and employment outcomes.

J,"Pope, DG; Sydnor, JR",,,,"Pope, Devin G.; Sydnor, Justin R.",,,Geographic Variation in the Gender Differences in Test Scores,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY; WOMEN; MATH,"The causes and consequences of gender disparities in standardized test scores - especially in the high tails of achievement - have been a topic of heated debate. The existing evidence on standardized test scores largely confirms the prevailing stereotypes that more men than women excel in math and science while more women than men excel in tests of language and reading. We provide a new perspective on this gender gap in test scores by analyzing the variation in these disparities across geographic areas. We illustrate that male-female ratios of students scoring in the high ranges of standardized tests vary significantly across the United States. This variation is systematic in several important ways. In particular, states where males are highly overrepresented in the top math and science scores also tend to be states where women are highly overrepresented in the top reading scores. This pattern suggests that states vary in their adherence to stereotypical gender performance, rather than favoring one sex over the other across all subjects. Furthermore, since the genetic distinction and the hormonal differences between sexes that might affect early cognitive development (that is, innate abilities) are likely the same regardless of the state in which a person happens to be born, the variation we find speaks to the nature-versus-nurture debates surrounding test scores and suggests environments significantly impact gender disparities in test scores.","[Pope, Devin G.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Sydnor, Justin R.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Weatherhead Sch Management, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Pope, DG (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",dpope@wharton.upenn.edu; justin.sydnor@case.edu,,"Sydnor, Justin/0000-0003-0532-1949",,,,,14,82,118,0,14,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

This increase was particularly pronounced among college-educated parents. Less educated mothers increased their childcare time by over 4 hours per week, and college-educated mothers increased theirs by over 9 hours per week. Fathers showed the same patterns, but with smaller magnitudes. Why would highly educated parents increase the time they allocate to childcare at the same time that their returns from paid employment have skyrocketed? Finding no empirical support for standard explanations, such as selection or income effects, we argue instead that increased competition for college admissions may be an important factor. We provide empirical support for our explanation with a comparison of trends between the United States and Canada, across ethnic groups in the United States, and across U.S. states.","[Ramey, Garey; Ramey, Valerie A.] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Ramey, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",,,,,,,,49,169,209,0,22,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

In the wake of two decades of financial crises following exercises of orthodox financial reform, the World Bank has not only continued to push privatisation, but now sees foreign banks as the missing component that will deal with the downside risks of financial liberalisation. Concerns that foreign banks might reduce small and medium enterprise (SME) loan access because of information problems are largely dismissed by the Bank. In fact the World Bank argues for the very opposite, the existence of foreign banks is likely to have the effect of pushing local banks into SME markets where they have a greater comparative advantage. The question of access to credit for the private sector, particularly the locally owned small and medium size enterprises, is central to the issue of employment generation and poverty reduction in developing countries where the bulk of new jobs are typically created by these companies. This article traces the development of the World Bank's agenda on foreign ownership. It critically assesses the arguments and empirical work underlying the World Bank analysis and draws on alternative empirical testing and case studies to raise serious questions about the downside risks associated with the internationalisation of banking.","Univ Michigan, Ctr Afroamer & African Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Stein, H (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ctr Afroamer & African Studies, 505 S State St,Haven Hall 4700, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA.",howstein@umich.edu,,,,,,,49,22,28,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

There are several channels by which democracy may affect trade, with differing implications. First, democratization in the exporting country can improve product quality and reduce trade costs, increasing bilateral trade. Second, democratization in the importing country may increase trade barriers and thus reduce imports. In this paper, I analyze the effect of democracy on trade by augmenting the gravity equation with democracy. Using a rich panel data set and controlling for the endogeneity of democracy, I find empirical evidence consistent with the hypothesis that democracy fosters trade. This finding is robust to various econometric methods and to the use of disaggregated specifications. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Although the program did not raise the exposure of blacks to whites like later court orders, districts with larger grants at risk in 1966 were less likely to be under court order through 1970, suggesting that tying federal funds to nondiscrimination reduced the burden of desegregation on federal courts.","[Cascio, Elizabeth] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Cascio, E (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",,,,,,,,48,49,57,1,21,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

In our setting, decision utility is the weight assigned by workers to the expected benefits of different job offers. We used a conjoint analysis method based on experimental data on workers' stated preferences towards hypothetical job offers that were characterised by ten attributes. The intrinsic motivation of nonprofit workers was investigated by specifically analysing the influence of three of these attributes, specifically wages, working time, and loyalty of the employer, on decision utility. The results showed evidence of motivational differences between the for-profit and nonprofit groups. First, nonprofit workers attained their maximum decision utility after a longer working time, showing superior intrinsic motivation for work. Furthermore, they were ready to give up a higher percentage of their wages in order to work for another extra hour than were for-profit workers, as long as the working week was less than 33 hours. Finally, our findings show that for-profit workers placed more value on job offers with a labour contract including an explicit clause stating that higher effort will be exchanged for the employer's loyalty. In contrast, nonprofit workers did not obtain higher utility from such a deal. We interpret this result as evidence for the intrinsic motivation of people employed in the nonprofit sector. As the nature of the implicit goals pursued in the nonprofit sector provides employees with high work morale, nonprofit workers do not obtain any gain in utility from an explicit clause regarding the employer's loyalty.","[Lanfranchi, Joseph] Univ Pantheon Assas LEM, CEE, F-75006 Paris, France; [Lanfranchi, Joseph] Univ Pantheon Assas LEM, LEM, F-75006 Paris, France; [Narcy, Mathieu] CEE, FR 3126, CNRS, TEPP, F-93166 Noisy Le Grand, France; [Larguem, Makram] Univ Pantheon Assas ERMES, CNRS, FRE 2887, ERMES, F-75005 Paris, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Lanfranchi, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pantheon Assas LEM, CEE, 92 Rue Assas, F-75006 Paris, France.",lanfranchi@u-paris2.fr; mathieu.narcy@cee-recherche.fr; maklarguem@yahoo.fr,,"lanfranchi, joseph/0000-0003-1808-0873",,,,,32,23,38,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2010,63.0,1,,,,,75,93,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00461.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,543UR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273604700005,0

The study also indicates that achievement and the company policy have a significant impact on the overall level of employee job satisfaction, suggesting that managers need to focus more on these factors to better motivate employees.","[Alexandru, Adriana AnaMaria] Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Fac Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania; [Alexandru, Adriana AnaMaria] Natl Sci Inst Field Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania; [Casuneanu, Costel] Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Fac Management, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Alexandru, AA (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Fac Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania.",adrianaalexandru@yahoo.com; costelcasuneanu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,8,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-987-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,3,11,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8PE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392590700001,0

We study the distribution of the different wealth components and, using inequality decomposition techniques, we assess the contribution of each element to overall wealth inequality. We find that wealth is more unequally distributed than income, while housing wealth is much more evenly distributed than financial wealth. Moreover, we identify two groups of wealth components: one disequalizing group, which includes financial wealth, whose value and portfolio share increase with household wealth; and a second more equalizing one, including housing wealth, whose value increases with wealth, but their share in the portfolio does not. Finally, we show that differences between age groups do not explain why wealth is much more unequally distributed than income. Instead, business and home ownership are factors that clearly contribute to explain this feature.","[Azpitarte, Francisco] Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain; [Azpitarte, Francisco] London Sch Econ, London, England",Universidade de Vigo; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Azpitarte, F (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, STICERD, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",F.Azpitarte@lse.ac.uk,"Azpitarte, Francisco/F-2170-2016","Azpitarte, Francisco/0000-0002-2688-6933",,,,,40,7,8,0,8,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2010,,194,,,,,65,89,,,,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,791AV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292633100003,0

We employ a data set with rich family information to explore what factors in addition to traditional measures of parents' socio-economic status can explain sibling similarity in long-run income. Measures of family structure and social problems account for very little of sibling similarities beyond that already accounted for by income, education and occupation. However, when we add indicators of parental involvement in schoolwork, parenting practices and maternal attitudes, the explanatory power of our variables increases from about one-quarter (using only traditional measures of parents' socio-economic status) to nearly two-thirds.","[Bjorklund, Anders; Lindahl, Lena; Lindquist, Matthew J.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Björklund, A (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden.",anders.bjorklund@sofi.su.se; lena.lindahl@sofi.su.se; matthew.lindquist@sofi.su.se,"Björklund, Anders/ABA-1326-2020",,,,,,44,44,46,0,27,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

However, the enterprise's activity is directly or indirectly influenced by internal and external factors. An effective strategy of companies might be one of the most important factors. Loss-making enterprises can improve their results following the strategy of profitable enterprises, however the question is, which enterprises could be attached to the domain of profitable ones and what classification criteria should be applied. The analysis of special literature has shown that it is not enough to analyze separate activities of enterprises, but the whole system of variables should be analyzed. Cluster analysis is a statistical method, which allows classifying the selected objects into the classes according to their similarity within the class and significant difference between the classes. This classification is based on the analysis of all parameters of the system, so it could be effectively used for the grouping of enterprises into the classes. The main purpose of this investigation was to determine the classification criteria for enterprises according to their Net Profit. Profit (loss) and balance sheet data of 50 profitable and 50 loss-making enterprises during the year 2002-2006 were taken for the investigation from the Lithuanian Department of Statistics. After the first term analysis the financial data which were not characteristic for the majority of the analyzed enterprises were excluded from the investigation as well as the data with outliers. 30 parameters corresponding to the different profit (loss) and balance sheet lines were selected for the further analysis. Collinearity diagnostics of data applying three different methods was performed in the second step. Not correlated parameters were included into regression model. Three profit describing regression equations were composed, variables of which were used for the classification of the enterprises. Hierarchical clusterization methods were used for the classification of enterprises into profitable, loss-making and mixed (all others). Performing cluster analysis the selection of the linkage distance and the classification method was performed first of all. The best linkage distance and the best classification method is that one, according to which most of the profitable and loss-making enterprises match their classes. The investigation has shown that the Ward's method and Euclidian distance were most suitable for the classification. Due to this reason, the enterprises were classified using different variables, which were included into the regression equations. Only independent variables of the regression analysis equation were used in the first case; the independent variables and net profit (dependent variable) were used in the second case and weighted variables of the regression analysis equation were used in the last case. The best result was achieved using independent variables selected by correlation analysis and included into regression analysis equation composed for the evaluation of net profit. In this case 17 profitable and 21 loss-making enterprises matched the classification criteria. Mahalanobis-Taguchi system was used for the evaluation of the differences between profitable and loss-making enterprises. Present paper discusses the necessity to establish standard set of profitable enterprises and provides a validation of this standard. Performed investigation has shown that the classification of enterprises according to selected variables credibly evaluates performance of the enterprises and makes it possible to classify them into the classes of profitable and loss-making companies.","[Boguslauskas, Vytautas; Adlyte, Ruta] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Boguslauskas, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vytautas.boguslauskas@ktu.lt; ruta.adlyte@studktu.lt,,,,,,,25,12,12,1,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This paper proposes project management as an answer to this transition. Traditional Cost-Benefit analysis does not respond to this purpose. Indeed Cost-Benefit analysis is only interested in one specific project and not in a competition between projects. In addition all goals (objectives) have to be translated into money terms, leading sometimes to immoral consequences. On the contrary Multi-Objective Optimization takes care of different objectives, whereas the objectives keep their own units. However different methods exist for the application of Multi-Objective Optimization. The authors tested them after their robustness resulting in seven necessary conditions. MOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio analysis) and MULTIMOORA (MOORA plus Full Multiplicative Form), assisted by Ameliorated Nominal Group and Delphi Techniques, satisfy the seven conditions, although in a theoretical way. A simulation exercise illustrates the use of these methods, ideals to be strived for as much as possible.","[Brauers, Willem Karel M.] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium; [Brauers, Willem Karel M.] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Antwerp, Belgium; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Brauers, WKM (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium.",willem.brauers@ua.ac.be; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Brauers, Willem/AAS-5072-2021","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X;",,,,,42,466,487,4,88,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We find that these private capital flows have a positive impact on growth with a well-developed financial sector but have a negative effect in the presence of poor financial sector development. Moreover, foreign direct investment promotes economic growth via efficiency effect, while portfolio investment stimulates economic growth via investment effect.

We find that migration behaviour has a significant effect in shaping earnings differentials between education levels and between the seven capital cities.

Often these deficits are believed to be so very strong that the ability of free capital markets to guarantee a more or less correct international allocation of capital is denied. It is argued that speculation dominates capital markets so much that capital allocation is purely random. This is one of the major arguments backing the present trend to re-establish capital controls, which emerged after the capital market distortions observed during the Asian flu. In the present article it is shown that capital markets, while certainly prone to many distortions, are well capable of roughly guiding capital to the proper place. Though allocation is not model-like perfect, this steals the thunder from the idea, that closed or government-guided capital markets were able to perform better.","Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"El-Shagi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",elshagi@rumms.uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,22,6,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our analysis yields two principal findings. We show that the coefficient on a group indicator variable from an OLS regression is an attractive approach for obtaining a single measure of the unexplained gap. We also show that a commonly-used pooling decomposition systematically overstates the contribution of observable characteristics to mean outcome differences when compared to OLS regression, therefore understating unexplained differences.

J,"Elvestad, C; Nilssen, F",,,,"Elvestad, Christel; Nilssen, Frode",,,Restricting imports to the Russian food market: simply an act of protectionism?,POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ACCESSION,"During the past decade Russia has imposed import restrictions on different types of food and plant products from a vast number of countries, claiming to be acting on food safety scandals as the primary reason. However, most observers interpret these measures as acts of protectionism. In this article the Russian import restrictions on Norwegian fish products are presented as the main case in a discussion of the rationale behind the measures. Our main finding is that, although the measures are trade barriers that lack transparency and documentation related to the alleged food safety risks, the traditional protectionist rationale, i.e. restricting imported volumes to prevent competition, does not seem to be the driving force behind the restrictions. Instead, we argue that food trade is regulated in order to regain governmental control over economic transactions and economic actors. Russian authorities have been very careful not to disturb the overall supply of seafood to Russia when implementing new import regulations. Also, import volumes of food to the Russian market in general have been increasing. This is linked to the fact that Russia is highly import-dependent and unable to replace imports. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings with regard to future market access to the Russian food market, including the potential for Russia's adaptation to relevant World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements.","[Elvestad, Christel] Nordland Res Inst, Bodo, Norway; [Nilssen, Frode] Nofima, Tromso, Norway",Nofima,"Elvestad, C (通讯作者)，Nordland Res Inst, Bodo, Norway.",christel.elvestad@nforsk.no,,"Elvestad, Christel/0000-0003-2860-7747",,,,,44,4,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,3,,,,,267,282,PII 925507779,10.1080/14631377.2010.498679,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,636WF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280773700001,0

The flag affects an individual's credit score, and in turn, an individual's access to credit. In this article, we investigate how the bankruptcy flag affects access to credit along three dimensions-loan acceptance, the price of the loan as is determined by the interest rate, and the amount of credit the household receives. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Survey of Consumer Finances, we estimate a series of two-stage models corrected for sample selection and adjusted to account for the household's level of creditworthiness. We find that the bankruptcy flag increases the probability of being denied access to a loan. The flag also increases interest rates for unsecured loans and lowers the credit limits available to households. The findings have important implications with respect to current bankruptcy code and the impact that information, such as the bankruptcy flag, can have on the efficiency of the credit markets.","[Lyons, Angela] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL USA; [Fisher, Jonathan] Litigat Analyt Inc, New York, NY USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Lyons, A (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL USA.",anglyons@uiuc.edu,,,,,,,21,6,9,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The main idea of this work is to consider the ITP as economically efficient when it generates a stable monetary environment. The latter is considered as stable when a long-run equilibrium exists to which the paths of economic variables (inflation rate, interest rate and GDP growth) converge. The convergence of the variables' paths implies that these variables are more predictable and implies a less uncertainty in the economic environment. To measure the degree of convergence between economic variables, we propose, in this paper, a dynamic time-varying variable presented in the frequency approach named cohesion. This variable is estimated from the evolutionary co-spectral theory as defined by Priestley and Tong (1973) and Priestley (1969, 1981, 1988, 1996). We apply this theory to the measure of cohesion presented by Croux et al (2001) to obtain a dynamic time-varying measure. In the last step of the study, we apply the Bai and Perron test (1998, 2003a,b) to determine the change in the cohesion path. The results show that the implementation of the ITP generates a high degree of convergence between economic series that implies less uncertainty into the monetary environment. We conclude that the inflation targeting generates a stable monetary environment. This result allows us to conclude that the ITP is relevant in the case of industrialized countries.

Disposable income and consumption, on the other hand, display only a modest increase in inequality over the same period. These trends occurred against the backdrop of lower trend growth of earnings, incomes and consumption in the 1990s relative to the 1980s.

It presents panel data evidence for 13 transition countries over the 1990-2003 period; it uses a fixed effects panel approach to account for possible bias from correlations among the unobserved effects and the observed country heterogeneity. The results find a strong, robust, negative effect on growth of inflation or its standard deviation, and one that appears to decline in magnitude as the inflation rate increases, as seen for OECD countries. And the results include a role for a normalized money demand in affecting growth, as well as for a convergence variable, a trade variable and a government share variable. Robustness of the baseline single-equation model is examined by expanding this into a three-equation simultaneous system of output growth, inflation and money demand that allows for possible simultaneity bias in the baseline model.","[Gillman, Max] Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Gillman, Max] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Harris, Mark N.] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Cardiff University; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Monash University,"Gillman, M (通讯作者)，Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",gillmanm@cf.ac.uk; mark.harris@buseco.monash.edu.au,"Gillman, Max/H-2935-2014; Harris, Mark/O-5084-2015","Gillman, Max/0000-0002-5536-4608; Harris, Mark/0000-0002-1804-4357",,,,,24,7,8,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0967-0750,,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

In addition, through the application of Granger causality tests to error-correction models, unidirectional causality, running from Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to government-expenditure variables, could be established between the variables and, therefore, only Wagner's law was found to be valid in Mexico's case for the period of study.","Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan",University of Tsukuba,"Iniguez-Montiel, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.",iniguez@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,,,,,28,12,13,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This article assesses the attractiveness of such a flat tax in achieving redistributive objectives with the smallest distortions to employment. We do so by using a detailed applied general equilibrium model for the Netherlands. The model is empirically grounded in the data and encompasses decisions on hours worked, labour force participation, skill formation, wage bargaining between unions and firms and a wide variety of institutional details. The simulations suggest that the replacement of the current tax system in the Netherlands by a flat rate will harm labour market performance if aggregate income inequality is contained. Only flat tax reforms that reduce redistribution will raise employment. This finding bolsters the notions from optimal tax literature regarding the equity-efficiency trade off and the superiority of nonlinear taxes to obtain redistributive goals in an efficient way.","[Jacobs, Bas; de Mooij, Ruud A.] Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst & Netspar, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Jacobs, Bas; de Mooij, Ruud A.] Erasmus Univ, CESifo, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [de Mooij, Ruud A.; Folmer, Kees] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"de Mooij, RA (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst & Netspar, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",radm@cpb.nl,,,,,,,26,7,8,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The nonlinear programming (NLP) model for the cost optimization of the time schedules under the generalized precedence relations between the project activities was developed and applied. The existing NLP optimization models have focused on the cost optimal solution of the project scheduling problems which include simplifying assumptions regarding the precedence relationships among the project activities. In this way, this research work aims to propose the NLP optimization model for making optimal time-cost decisions applicable to actual projects in project management. The generalized reduced-gradient method was used for the NLP optimization. The obtained results include the minimum total cost project schedules and the optimal project time-cost curves. The proposed optimization approach enables the insight into the interdependence between the project duration and the total project cost. The decision-maker can more effectively estimate the effect of the project deadline on a total project cost before the submission of a tender. An application example and an example of the time-cost trade-off analysis are presented in the paper to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.","[Klansek, Uros; Psunder, Mirko] Univ Maribor, Fac Civil Engn, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Klansek, U (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Civil Engn, Smetanova 17, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",uros.klansek@uni-mb.si; mirko.psunder@uni-mb.si,,"Klansek, Uros/0000-0002-7341-8761",,,,,29,8,8,5,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

This practice fails to account for sector heterogeneity and can be hazardous. Although the general identified patterns are largely correct, the calculated magnitudes can be misleading or even wrongly signed. Instead, it is strongly recommended that sector heterogeneity is accounted for by using individual sector price indices for all relevant sectors instead of one general (GDP) deflator. This paper analyzes this advanced decomposition using Chinese data and compares to the usual method of using only one deflator. It is found that while most differences are only of quantitative quality, some show even a qualitative difference. Furthermore, the rising energy intensity in the early 2000s, which has been discussed by previous studies, vanishes completely. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We use simple combination and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) techniques to compare the performance of these forecasting approaches in short-vs. long-run horizons of SP500 monthly excess returns. Simple averaging involves an equally-weighted averaging of the forecasts from alternative combinations of factors used in the predictive regressions, whereas BMA involves computing the predictive probability that each model is the true model and uses these predictive probabilities as weights in combing the forecasts from different models. From a given set of multiple factors, we evaluate all possible pricing models to the extent, which they describe the data as dictated by the posterior model probabilities. We find that, while simple averaging compares quite favorably to forecasts derived from a random walk model with drift (using a 10-year out-of-sample iterative period), BMA outperforms simple averaging in longer compared to shorter forecast horizons. Moreover, we find further evidence of the latter when the predictive Bayesian model includes shorter, rather than longer lags of the predictive factors. An interesting outcome of this study tends to illustrate the power of BMA in suppressing model uncertainty through model as well as parameter shrinkage, especially when applied to longer predictive horizons.","[Masih, A.

This article shows that need not be the case when households obtain credit for investment purposes. In fact, investment loans may not have any effect on the likelihood of schooling for children who work in their family business. Our estimates confirm that this is the case; credit used to finance investments has no effect on the odds of schooling for employed children. This may be because investment loans increase children's labour productivity, which in turn increases the opportunity cost of schooling. The results of this study suggest that improving access to credit may not, by itself, constitute a solution to the problem of child labour in developing countries.","[Menon, Nidhiya] Brandeis Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Menon, Nidhiya] Brandeis Univ, Int Business Sch MS 021, Waltham, MA 02454 USA",Brandeis University; Brandeis University,"Menon, N (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",nmenon@brandeis.edu,,"Menon, Nidhiya/0000-0002-3871-1081",,,,,27,3,4,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Noncooperative games may evolve to equilibrium state after long-term numerous games and society and individuals have to pay enormous cost to this process. This paper focuses on the games and incentive mechanism in critical infrastructure management. The complicated game relation is analyzed and the bilevel game model is put forward. Game analysis helps us to understand the hidden interests and contradictions behind game problems so as to contribute to basic theory for policy making on sustainable critical infrastructure system. Through scientific design of incentive mechanism, the uncertainty of games can be reduced and the theoretical win-win incentive compatibility models are put forward to improve the sustainability of critical infrastructure system.

It has also been singled out as the first correct account of empathy (Goldie 1999, 2000, 2002; Neill 1996). Finally, to make things even more complicated, some of Smith's examples for sympathy or 'fellow feeling' have been used as the earliest expression of emotional contagion (M. Smith 1995, 1998). The aim of the essay is to suggest a new interpretation of Smith's concept of sympathy and point out that on this interpretation some of the contemporary uses of this concept, as a precursor of simulation and empathy, are misleading.

AIDADS generalizes the LES by assuming marginal budget shares vary with utility and hence with expenditure. Like the LES, AIDADS includes subsistence parameters that define minimum consumption levels. Here we present a modified AIDADS (MAIDADS) that replaces the constant subsistence parameters with functions that also vary with utility; these transformed subsistence levels are referred to as minimum consumption quantities. This model is applied to the 1996 International Consumption Project data. As these data span a wide range of expenditure levels, MAIDADS offers a viable alternative for the estimation of a 'global demand system'.

Achievements of activities in industry influence an overall level and the growth of economics and welfare of a country. Therefore it is important and beneficial to analyze the structure of industry and its changes; to be aware of activities that are most significant in the structure of industry of a particular country. The analysis of the structure of industry allows us to determine the most significant branches of industry. Finally, the determination of the most significant branches of industry and changes of their significance allows evaluating the potential of the structure and the importance of that structure of industry in overall view of economics. Nowadays the results, changes and dynamics of industry are important in order to evaluate capabilities of national industry companies and also to compete in open global economy. Lithuanian industry structure was formed as a result of economic transformation in conditions of global market competition and economic integration to the European Union. The market failures and imperfections are revealed in the industry of Lithuania, especially in the areas of progress of science and technique, information technologies and management. The significance of low value-added industries in Lithuania is obvious, and higher technologies are not used in such level as in the developed countries. It is essential that Lithuanian industrial companies identify their comparative advantage in the products of traditional branches of industry. Nowadays industry companies are forced to seek for the means to withstand global competition. Considering the results of restructuring the industry, it is important to evaluate a set of factors, affecting industry's activity and structure. Some of the applied tools to measure the structure of industry were the evaluation of export specialization, as suggested by Balassa (1965), analyzing knowledge intensive in manufacturing industry by using the index of knowledge composition of export (Sheehan, Tikhomirova, 1996), also using the method of export unit values (Brunner, Cali, 2006) and others. This paper presents the analysis of changes of Lithuanian industry structure in 2000-2008 and the evaluation of the potential of the structure of manufacturing industry by using modified Indices of the Long Run Income Potential of Industry Structure. In order to assess the changes in the structure of manufacturing industry five key characteristics of industries - value added, wage per employee, export growth, export intensity and output growth - are outlined and used in this study. The results of Indices of the Long Run Income Potential of an industry structure reveal the possibilities of Lithuanian industry branches to operate and generate increasing incomes in the long term.","Kauno Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Saboniene, A (通讯作者)，Kauno Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",asta.saboniene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,30,8,8,0,17,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this paper, within the framework of two-stage linear stochastic programming, the method for power planning has been developed, with uncertain factors taken into account, through a continuously distributed set of scenarios. The objective is to find the structure of the power plants capacity in the region which minimizes the sum of the investment and the expected operating costs over the long-term planning horizon, taking into account the environmental impact. The structure of the considered task corresponds to a power investment planning problem that often arises in the developing regions. The method is developed for solving the stochastic optimization problem by the sequence of Monte-Carlo sampling estimators. The procedures developed make it possible to solve stochastic problems with an admissible accuracy by means of an acceptable amount of computations. As follows from numerical experiments the approach presented enables us to decrease the total expected costs of power planning versus deterministic planning solution.","[Sakalauskas, Leonidas; Zilinskas, Kestutis] Univ Siauliai, LT-77156 Shiauliai, Lithuania",,"Sakalauskas, L (通讯作者)，Univ Siauliai, Visinskio G 19, LT-77156 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",sakal@ktl.mii.lt; kest.zil@gmail.com,,"Zilinskas, Kestutis/0000-0003-2962-3984",,,,,16,3,3,0,3,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-8619,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Given these findings, the effects of the currency substitution on the government ability to gain from seigniorage revenue are also examined.

Neither has been wholly satisfactory. We consider a different perspective: a cooperative framework in which political and military factors interacted with economic considerations for oil exporters and importers to define a Target Price Zone (TPZ). We analyse several issues in this context: monthly versus annual average prices, beginning and ending dates for TPZs, degree of stability in several price series (West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent, etc.), Free On Board (FOB) and landed prices, real or nominal prices, OPEC behaviour and effect of the Euro exchange rate on dollar denominated oil prices. We conclude that a TPZ system was in operation from 1986 through 2003. The TPZ worked imperfectly but with a substantial degree of predictability for 18 years. In 2004, the TPZ system deteriorated for several reasons and has not been re-established. Perhaps the US government supports the Saudis because it has always believed it had a two-way relation with OPEC generally and the Persian Gulf countries in particular. We give them protection and they supply oil.1 The Bush trip [1986] came as an additional incentive to restore some stability to prices ... What they [the Saudis] heard was the Vice President of the United States of America saying that the price collapse was destabilizing and threatened the security of the United States ... The Saudis looked to the United States for their own security; surely, they thought in the aftermath of the Bush visit, they would have to be attentive to the security needs of the United States.2.","[Chapman, D.; Daouk, H.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Slaibi, A.] RW Beck, Framingham, MA 01701 USA",Cornell University,"Daouk, H (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",hd35@cornell.edu,,,,,,,30,6,7,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We show that if the broker gets a fixed per-transaction fee, he can fully transmit information via cheap talk. This information transmission increases ex ante welfare of the seller and the broker but has an ambiguous impact on the buyer. We show that limits to informative communication may arise if the intermediary observes signals about valuations of both participants or because of competition between intermediaries.

Besides this double multiplicity aspect, decision making mainly in engineering economics (decision problems where potential solutions of a problem must be economically viable along with some technical aspects) generally necessitate to cope with many stakeholders opinion regarding the importance to assign to each attribute and/or each objective as well as uncertainty that can impact any of these components (attributes values, objectives measurement and stakeholders statements). Decision processes in this context go through some steps such as 1) definition of the overall decision goal (find the best sustainable site to build a waste management facility for instance), this goal can further be split into many objectives to satisfy; 2) identification of potential alternatives; 3) elicitation and evaluation of attributes that characterize alternatives; 4) and finally evaluate alternatives to recommend the good enough alternative to implement. The aim of the research undertaken in this paper is to address the question raised in the third and fourth points by exploiting the bipolar nature of attributes with regards to objective to elicit and assess attributes and to build a final recommendation procedure. Indeed, we will highlight the bipolar nature of attributes with regards to pursued objectives (given an objective, there will be attributes that act in the sense of realization of this objective, that we refer to as supporting attributes and those working against the achievement of this objective, referred to as rejecting attributes) to derive a framework for elicitation and assessment of attributes values. Finally, relying on the bipolar nature of obtained attributes, satisficing game approach is used as a tool to support the evaluation and final recommendation process. The approach is applied to a real world problem which aim is to select the best sustainable site to build a waste management facility.","[Tchangani, Ayeley P.] Univ Toulouse, IUT Tarbes, F-65016 Tarbes, France; [Tchangani, Ayeley P.] Univ Toulouse, Lab Genie Prod, F-65016 Tarbes, France",,"Tchangani, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, IUT Tarbes, 1 Rue Lautreamont, F-65016 Tarbes, France.",ayeley.tchangani@iut-tarbes.fr,"Tchangani, Ayeley P./Q-6929-2019",,,,,,34,10,10,0,7,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The demand for gold is ever increasing, not only for jewelry, coins, and bars but also for many industries, such as electronics, space, as well as medical technology Especially gold is still a form of currency in many countries after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971. Many economic analysts suggest that gold prices are determined and influenced by a number of factors, such as mine production, fabrication demand, and the recovery of gold from scrap. Much greater influence is exerted by trends in central bank sales and purchases. Most important of all is trend in investment demand. Investors buy gold for a number of reasons. They buy gold as a hedge against any economic, political, or currency crises. They also buy gold for diversification and financial arbitrage when investment confidence is increasing because they have the common sense that physical assets, unlike financial assets, are the best way to hedge against recession and inflation. The developments of the gold market are followed closely by financial analysts and monetary policy makers and gold price is regarded as a good criterion of the inflationary trend in the future for it moves earlier than official measures of inflation. Fisher (1930), the economist who first pointed out the relationship between expected inflation and interest rate, provides the theoretical basis for this study. Fisher (1930) concludes that expected nominal asset return comprises expected return and expected inflation rate. In other words, when expected inflation rises, asset return will rise. Later, the primary empirical test on inflation hedge of assets including US government bonds and bills, real estate, labor income, and stock returns was done by Fama and Schwert (1977). Ghosh et al. (2004) point out that people buy gold for two purposes. The first is the use demand, where gold is used directly in the production of jewelry, medals, coins, electrical components, and so on. The second is the asset demand for gold, where it is used by governments, fund managers and individuals as an investment. The asset demand for gold is traditionally associated with the view that gold provides an effective hedge against inflation and domestic currency depreciation. When it comes to inflation, the value of gold is considered to be preserved, for its price will increase along with the rise in the general level of prices. In other words, it is believed that a higher inflation rate is what gold prices said should be happening. However, the question is that how well gold hedge really works. Each country has its own economic conditions or characteristics. This issue is worth examining and verifying with non-linear model which might discover the key reasons that the linear model is unable to do. In this article, we attempt to examine whether gold could be an exchange rate hedge in Japan using data from 1986 to 2007. In the literature of this area, most research has focused on a linear relationship-rather than a nonlinear one-between returns on gold and the exchange rate of the Japanese yen. In the present paper, we used the depreciation rate of the yen as a threshold variable to distinguish between a high depreciation regime and a low depreciation (or appreciation) regime. With this setting, we build a threshold vector autoregressive model to investigate the causality between the gold return and the yen depreciation rate. We found that when the yen depreciation rate is greater than 2.62%, investing in gold could avoid the depreciation loss. This finding, that the effectiveness of gold as an exchange rate hedge depends on the depreciation rate of the yen, could be beneficial to Japanese government monetary policy and to investors with Japanese yen in their portfolios.","[Wang, Kuan-Min] Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40721, Taiwan; [Lee, Yuan-Ming] So Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Tainan, Taiwan",Southern Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Wang, KM (通讯作者)，Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, 100 Chiao Kwang Rd, Taichung 40721, Taiwan.",wkminn@ocu.edu.tw,"Wang, Kuan Min/H-5247-2019","Wang, Kuan Min/0000-0002-0237-0596",,,,,47,3,3,1,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Our model departs from the existing two-sided market theories by arguing that the extensive margin of card usage is less important in a mature card market. Instead, we focus on card issuer entry, elastic consumer demand and the role of card transaction value. Our analysis suggests that card networks demand higher interchange fees to maximize member issuers' profits as card payments become more efficient and convenient. At equilibrium, consumer rewards and card transaction values increase with interchange fees, while consumer surplus and merchant profits may not. Based on the theoretical framework, we discuss pros and cons of policy interventions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings show that mean willingness to pay (WTP) bids are highest under positive information, followed by no information, negative information, and unexpectedly lowest with two-sided information. Participants might have put more weight on the negative when faced with both positive and negative information. There is also a minor difference in WTP with respect to the reference price between positive information and no information. Furthermore, the marginal effect on WTP of positive information vis--vis no information is minimal. This suggests that the positive information faced by consumers might not be compelling enough to drastically increase WTP bids for a genetically modified product such as golden rice.","[Depositario, Dinah Pura T.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Dept Agribusiness Management, Coll Econ & Management, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Wu, Ximing] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Laude, Tiffany P.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Dept Agr Econ, Coll Econ & Management, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Depositario, DPT (通讯作者)，Univ Philippines Los Banos, Dept Agribusiness Management, Coll Econ & Management, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines.",dinahpura@yahoo.com; rnayga@uark.edu; xwu@ag.tamu.edu; tlaude@gmail.com,"Depositario, Dinah Pura T./ABG-5379-2021",,,,,,25,29,37,2,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Several decision rules are modelled, including hegemonic and democratic procedures, and also committees headed by a chairman. A ranking of decision rules in terms of the volatility of policy rates is obtained, showing that the presence of a chairman has a cooling effect. However, members of a monetary union are better off under symmetric rules (voting, averaging, bargaining), unless they themselves chair the union.

The main findings are: (i) asset price booms in housing and equity markets, especially in housing, significantly lower the conditional mean of real output growth and raise those of the price-level gap and inflation, and also raise the conditional variance of all three variables; and (ii) expected real output and price-level outcomes that are obtained without conditioning on asset price booms, or are obtained conditionally on asset price booms using the normal distribution, both underestimate the risk of the worst outcomes occurring and lead to less pessimistic but misleading inferences. These findings are not premised on the ability of central bankers to be able to identify correctly asset bubbles ex ante. One possible implication for monetary policy is that central bankers ought to be wary about the occurrence of any large increase in asset prices and consider an approach that is ex ante more compatible with risk management.","Univ Philippines, Sch Econ, Quezon City 1101, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Gochoco-Bautista, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Philippines, Sch Econ, Quezon City 1101, Philippines.",msgb@up.edu.ph,,,,,,,38,3,4,0,4,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Using the framework of a standard neoclassical open economy model with time-varying frictions (wedge), we study the relative contribution of the efficiency, labor, investment and foreign debt wedges to the business cycles of China. The business accounting procedure suggests that productivity best explains the behavior of aggregate economic variables in China throughout the period of 1978-2006. The labor wedge plays a major role in explaining the movement of labor force. The foreign debt wedge and investment wedge primarily affect the composition of output. but their role ill explaining the movement of output is modest.

(ii) There was a suggestion that whether or not the organization uses this hidden entrepreneurship as a firm resource can affect its continuous growth.

Rural China is not a hotbed of dissatisfaction with life. possibly because most people are found to confine their reference groups to the village. Relative income within the village and relative income over time, both in the past and expected in the future, are shown to be important for Current happiness. whereas current income is less so.

Search theory predicts that such changes should raise the proportion of nonclaimant nonemployed, with consequences on search effort and labor market attachment, and lower the reservation wage of the unemployed, with negative effects on post-unemployment wages. I test these ideas on longitudinal data from social security records (LLMDB). Using a difference in differences approach, I find that individuals who start an unemployment spell soon after JSA introduction, as opposed to 6 months earlier, are 2.5-3% more likely to move from unemployment into Incapacity Benefits spells, and 4-5% less likely to have positive earnings in the following year. This latter employment effect only vanishes 4 years after the initial unemployment shock. Also, annual earnings for the treated individuals are lower than for the non-treated. These results suggest that while tighter search requirements were successful in moving individuals off unemployment benefits, they were not successful in moving them onto stable or better jobs, with fairly long-lasting unintended consequences on a number of labor market outcomes.

The NNIE expands the application of economic modeling tools to new areas of inquiry, models institutional outcomes with parsimony and mathematical rigor, and introduces political and economic power, thereby allowing for consideration of institutional change that is not Pareto improving. Using a four-part analytical framework, we find that the explanatory power of NNIE analysis derives not from its formal models, but from a more vague, nuanced, and narrative version of the formal models, which we call 'Quasi-Models'.

The main objective of this paper is to investigate the analytics of a TGC system of the Nordic type when integrated within several countries and to determine what can be expected from the system when applied in a real world setting. Both an analytical and a partial equilibrium version of the model are applied. In particular, we ask whether it is possible to derive analytically clear-cut results with respect to how the system affects generation of electricity from renewable resources, and from carbon emitting resources, in the same way as it is possible for other known policy instruments Such as in emission permit system or a plain carbon emission tax. A key result is that TGCs may be an imprecise instrument for regulating the generation of green electricity and that the combination of TGCs with a system of tradable emission permits may yield outcomes contrary to the intended Purpose.

In: Aruka Y (ed) Evolutionary controversies in economics. Springer, Tokyo, pp 115-132, 2001], selfishness may not be determined even if an agent selfishly adopts the strategy of defection. Individual selfishness can only be realized if the other agent cooperates, therefore gain from defection can never be assured by defection alone. The sanction by defection as a reaction of the rival agent cannot necessarily reduce the selfishness of the rival. In this game, explicit direct reciprocity cannot be guaranteed. Now we introduce different spillovers or payoff matrices, so that each agent may then be faced with a different payoff matrix. A ball in the urn is interpreted as the number of cooperators, and the urn as a payoff matrix. We apply Ewens' sampling formula to our urn process in this game theoretic environment. In this case, there is a similar result as in the classic case, because there is self-averaging for the variances of the number who cooperate. Applying Pitman's sampling formula to the urn process, the invariance of the random partition vectors under the properties of exchangeability and size-biased permutation does not hold in general. Pitman's sampling formula depends on the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution whose special case is just Ewens' formula. In the Ewens setting, only one probability alpha of a new entry matters. On the other hand, there is an additional probability theta of an unknown entry, as will be argued in the Pitman formula. More concretely, we will investigate the effects of different payoff sizes from playing a series of different games for newly emerging agents. As Aoki and Yoshikawa (Non-self-averaging in macroeconomic models: a criticism of modern micro-founded macroeconomics, Economics Discussion Papers 2007-49. http://www.economics-ejournal.org. November 26, 2007) and Aoki (J Econ Interact Coord 3:1-3, 2008) dealt with a product innovation and a process innovation, they criticized Lucas' representative method and the idea that players face micro shocks drawn from the same unchanged probability distribution. In the light of Aoki and Yoshikawa (Non-self-averaging in macroeconomic models: a criticism of modern micro-founded macroeconomics, Economics Discussion Papers 2007-49. http://www.economics-ejournal.org. November 26, 2007), we show the same argument in our Avatamsaka game with different payoffs. In this setting, innovations occurring in urns may be regarded as increases of the number of cooperators in urns whose payoffs are different.","[Aruka, Yuji] Chuo Univ, Fac Commerce, Tokyo 1920393, Japan; [Akiyama, Eizo] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan",Chuo University; University of Tsukuba,"Aruka, Y (通讯作者)，Chuo Univ, Fac Commerce, 742-1 Higashinakano, Tokyo 1920393, Japan.",aruka@tamacc.chuo-u.ac.jp; eizo@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21530175] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,37,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Starting from low levels of political institutional quality, small improvements in polity can have adverse effects. Oil the other hand, social cohesion has a positive effect once a threshold level is reached. The results associated with the influence of political institutions and openness to trade seem to suggest the possibility of a 'catch-22', at least in the short run. If a fragile state tries to improve its political institutions or its openness to trade it may wind up with lower per-capita income.

Following the recent research on the concept of cultural discount and the argument that the Academy Awards are indicators of cinematic qualities and achievement, the research questions focus on whether different types of cinematic qualities and achievement would be discounted by cultural differences to different extents. More specifically, a distinction between drama and non-drama awards is made, and it is argued that the cinematic qualities and achievement indicated by the drama awards are likely to be relatively more culturally specific and hence more likely to be discounted by cultural differences. The empirical analysis examines the box office performance of 585 U.S. movies from 2002 to 2007 in nine East Asian markets. It shows that non-drama awards relate positively to box office receipts, but drama awards relate negatively to box office receipts. Moreover, the negative relationship between drama awards and box office receipts is stronger in countries more culturally distant from the U.S. The findings are therefore highly supportive to the conceptual arguments. Other implications of the findings are also discussed.","Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Lee, F (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",francis_lee@cuhk.edu.hk,,"Lee, Francis L.

The model uses a recursive identification scheme, takes into account the possible interaction between conditional means and variances, isolates the effects of money growth volatility on output growth, and is able to explicitly model heteroskedasticity. We use quarterly data for the United States over the period from 1959:1 to 2005:4, provide a comparison among simple-sum, Divisia, and currency equivalent monetary aggregation procedures at each of the four levels of monetary aggregation-M1, M2, M3, and MZM-and find evidence that money growth volatility has significant negative effects on output growth. Issues of structural stability are addressed and sub-sample analysis is performed. Moreover, the robustness of the results to alternative identification schemes, alternative measures of the level of economic activity, and to the use of monthly observations is also investigated.","[Serletis, Apostolos; Rahman, Sajjadur] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Serletis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",Serletis@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,27,14,15,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Downstream firms fall into two categories: efficient and inefficient, according to their relative costs of transforming a unit of the upstream good into a unit of final product. Under ordinary static conditions, price discrimination favors the inefficient firms, which have more elastic demands. We consider, however, the possibility that discrimination in the opposite direction can alter the downstream market structure toward greater efficiency. Discriminatory pricing, then, involves charging a higher price to the less efficient firms. Such pricing is shown to be both potentially profitable for the upstream firm and welfare improving as average consumer prices fall.","[Beard, T.

The presence of self-enforcement constraints puts a limit on the magnitude of transfers that can be made between countries, and makes it more likely that bilateral agreements are observed on the constrained efficient frontier. The existence of adjustment costs leads to the possibility that payoffs under a two step agreement, in which an initial bilateral agreement is expanded to include the third country, may Pareto dominate the payoffs from immediate formation of an agreement among all three countries. However, the condition that a two step agreement be efficient in the absence of self-enforcing constraints is neither necessary nor sufficient for the gradual approach to have a lower minimum discount factor.","Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Bond, EW (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, VU Stn B 351819,2301 Vanderbilt Pl, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",eric.bond@vanderbilt.edu,,"Bond, Eric/0000-0001-7028-1125",,,,,19,3,4,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

To this end, using micro-data from the Eurobarometer survey, we disaggregate the sample of workers into different groups according not only to their employment contract (i.e. permanent or temporary), but also to their perceived job security, and we evaluate differences in job satisfaction between these groups. After the potential endogeneity of job type has been controlled for, the results show that what matters for job satisfaction is not just the type of contract, but mainly the perceived job security, which may be independent of the type of contract. The combination temporary but secure job seems preferable to the combination permanent but insecure job, indicating that the length of the contract may be less important if the worker perceives that s/he is not at risk of becoming unemployed. Our main conclusions are robust to the use of alternative definitions of workers' types and they generally hold within different welfare regimes and also for different aspects of job satisfaction, mainly those more related to job security.

A comparison is made with the US and across individual member countries. First, we find that the underlying source of the oil price shift is crucial to determine the repercussions on the economy and the appropriate monetary policy reaction. Second, the transmission mechanism is considerably different compared to the US. In particular, inflationary effects in the US are mainly driven by a strong direct pass-through of rising energy prices and indirect effects of higher production costs. In contrast, Euro area inflation reacts sluggishly and is much more driven by second-round effects of increasing wages. The monetary policy reaction of the ECB to oil shocks is also strikingly different compared to the FED. The inflation objective, relative to the output stabilization objective, appears more important for Euro area monetary authorities than for the FED. Third, there are substantial asymmetries across member countries. These differences are due to different labour market dynamics which are further aggravated by a common monetary policy stance which does not fit all. --- Gert Peersman and Ine Van Robays.","[Peersman, Gert; Van Robays, Ine] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Peersman, G (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",,,,,,,,26,101,116,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

These improvements change the results found by previous studies. Openness, regional imitation, persistence, an inverted U-shaped relationship between reserves and income level, and financial deregulation are the factors driving reserve hoardings. In contrast, reserves yield, and both trade and financial volatility are not statistically significant.

In an OLG model, young adults determine their optimal fertility, labor supply and life-cycle consumption with both exogenous child and adult mortality risks. We show that a rise in adult mortality exerts an ambiguous effect on both net and total fertility in a general equilibrium framework, while child mortality shocks unambiguously lead to a rise in total fertility, leaving net fertility unchanged. We complement our theory with an empirical analysis using a sample of 39 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries over the 1980-2004 period, examining the overall effects of the child and adult mortality channels on both total and net fertility. We find child mortality to exert a robust, positive impact on total fertility but no impact on net fertility, whereas a rise in adult mortality is found to negatively influence both total and net fertility. Given the particular demographic profile of the HIV/AIDS epidemic (killing essentially young, active adults), we then conclude in favor of an unambiguous negative effect of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on net fertility in SSA.","[Boucekkine, Raouf] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, IRES, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Boucekkine, Raouf] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Desbordes, Rodolphe] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Glasgow; University of Strathclyde,"Boucekkine, R (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, IRES, Pl Montesquieu 3, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",,,"Desbordes, Rodolphe/0000-0002-9190-7331",,,,,69,35,38,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

The approach adopted by RGGI is a regional cap-and-trade program, which sets a maximal annual amount of regional CO(2) emissions that can be emitted from the electric sector. However, incoherence of the geographic scope of the regional electricity market is expected to produce two undesirable consequences: CO(2) leakage and NO(x) and SO(2) emissions spillover. This paper addresses these two issues using transmission-constrained electricity market models. The results show that although larger CO(2) leakage is associated with higher allowance prices, it is negatively related to CO(2) prices if measured in percentage terms. On the other hand, SO(2) and NO(x) emissions spillover increase in commensurate with CO(2) allowance prices. Demand elasticity attenuates the effect of emissions trading on leakage and emissions spillover. This highlights the difficulties of designing a regional or local climate policy.

Our model suggests that an increase in the progressivity of the tax system induces a smaller response in real output to a change in the price level. This implies that increased income-tax progressivity reduces the equilibrium inflation rate and that the effect of increased income-tax progressivity on inflation is smaller when the central bank places a higher weight on inflation or when there is greater openness.

Also, after one merger, other firms are willing to follow with their own merger, resulting in sequential mergers. This result is consistent with the recent mergers in the video game software industry in Japan.","[Shimizu, Daisuke] Gakushuin Univ, Fac Econ, Toshima Ku, Tokyo 1718588, Japan; [Ebina, Takeshi] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan",Gakushuin University; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Shimizu, D (通讯作者)，Gakushuin Univ, Fac Econ, Toshima Ku, 1-5-1 Mejiro, Tokyo 1718588, Japan.",daisuke.shimizu@gakushuin.ac.jp,"Ebina, Takeshi/E-2239-2014","Ebina, Takeshi/0000-0002-1902-4788",,,,,16,12,12,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

The large rise in earnings inequality between the 1970s and the 1990s could reflect either a rise in disparity of permanent incomes, a rise in earnings instability, or some portion of both. In this paper, we provide longitudinal measures that separate changes in income inequality into changes that permanently change income to new levels and those that only reflect transitory change. We refer to the latter as changes in income instability and discuss how the instability of individual earnings and family income in the United States has evolved - as a whole as well as for different types of individuals and families - over the last quarter century. We consider alternative definitions of instability that have been proposed, and establish that all studies find that instability is considerably higher today than in the mid-1970s. This increase in instability is not a recent phenomenon. Earnings instability rose sharply in the late 1970s and early 1980s, then stabilized at these high levels through the recent period, although it may be increasing once again. We also discuss the factors that may be driving this increase in instability.","[Gottschalk, Peter] Boston Coll, Boston, MA USA; [Moffitt, Robert] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD USA",Boston College; Johns Hopkins University,"Gottschalk, P (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Boston, MA USA.",gottscha@bc.edu; moffitt@jhu.edu,,,,,,,42,156,183,1,25,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

With allowance for other factors holding back GDP growth during those wars, the multiplier linking government purchases to GDP may be in the range of 0.7 to 1.0, a range generally supported by research based on vector autoregressions that control for other determinants, but higher values are not ruled out. New Keynesian macroeconomic models yield multipliers in that range as well. Neoclassical models produce much lower multipliers, because they predict that consumption falls when government purchases rise. Models that deliver higher multipliers feature a decline in the markup ratio of price over cost when output rises, and an elastic response of employment to increased demand. These characteristics are complementary to another Keynesian feature, the linkage of consumption to current income. The GDP multiplier is higher-perhaps around 1.7-when the nominal interest rate is at its lower bound of zero.","Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Hall, RE (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,48,202,248,1,24,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Unlike the desire to attain approbation from external sources, the notion of praiseworthiness seems to have been neglected by contemporary economic literature. Yet the relevance of praiseworthiness as an internal motivational force was stressed by a number of classical economists. We construct an endogenous growth model in which agents derive utility not only from their consumption but also from praiseworthiness of their action. In such a setting, the motivation by praiseworthiness is able to generate positive and accelerating growth of output per labourer in steady state. The main implication of our model is that the existence of increasing returns depends critically on the presence of sufficient approbation attributed to creativity. Furthermore, presence or absence of these rewards may be susceptible of explaining cross-sectional differences in growth rates, growth miracles and growth disasters.","[Levy, David M.] George Mason Univ, Ctr Study Publ Choice, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Rohac, Dalibor] Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Oxford OX2 6JF, England",George Mason University; University of Oxford,"Levy, DM (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Ctr Study Publ Choice, Carow Hall,MSN ID3, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",davidmlevy@gmail.com; dalibor.rohac@economics.ox.ac.uk,"Levy, David/GPS-4945-2022",,,,,,38,1,1,0,4,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Second, the persistence of informal rules and social norms causes legal dualism, which undermines the credibility of modern statutory law.

Reviews of the research literature, on the other hand, have provided mixed messages on the degree to which class size matters for student achievement. Here I will discuss a substantial, but overlooked, body of experimental work on class size that developed prior to World War II. These field experiments did not have the benefit of modern econometrics, and only a few were done on a reasonably large scale. However, they often used careful empirical designs, and the collective magnitude of this body of work is considerable. Moreover, this research produced little evidence to suggest that students learn more in smaller classes, which stands in contrast to some, though not all, of the most recent work by economists. In this essay, I provide an overview of the scope and breadth of the field experiments in class size conducted prior to World War II, the motivations behind them, and how their experimental designs were crafted to deal with perceived sources of bias.

The research reported in this paper involves carrying out a systematic sensitivity analysis, where relative price sensitivity is gradually introduced into the system, focusing specifically on elasticities of substitution in production and trade parameters, in order to determine conditions under which rebound effects become a likely outcome. The main result is that, while there is positive pressure for rebound effects even where (direct and indirect) demands for energy are very price inelastic, this may be partially or wholly offset by negative income, competitiveness and disinvestment effects, which also occur in response to falling energy prices. The occurrence of disinvestment effects is of particular interest. These occur where falling energy prices reduce profitability in domestic energy supply sectors, leading to a contraction in capital stock in these sectors, which may in turn lead to rebound effects that are smaller in the long run than in the short run, a result that runs contrary to the predictions of previous theoretical work in this area.

This study offers an alternative approach which consists in measuring crime by the proportion of alleged offenders in the whole population and treating the characteristics of their home communes as socio-economic causes of criminal behaviour. The conclusion is that those charged with crimes present a high degree of geographic mobility. In the case of economically motivated crimes, the evidence partly supports Becker's propositions. Lastly, we show that the number of people charged with crimes tends to be greater in communes that have low incomes, a larger police presence, a predominance of urban areas with higher levels of education and a geographical location in the north of the country, which to some degree bears out the findings of other studies on Chile.","[Gutierrez, Mauro; Nunez, Javier; Rivera, Jorge] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Gutiérrez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",gutierrez_mauro@hotmail.com; jnunez@econ.uchile.cl; jrivera@econ.uchile.cl,"Rivera, Jorge/AHC-5777-2022",,,,,,28,2,2,1,13,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, CHILE",0251-2920,,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2009,,98,,,,,159,174,,,,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,532ZD,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272789400009,0

One common problem is hypothetical bias, which in recent years has been addressed in various ways, particularly through the inclusion of a certainty question in the questionnaire. We analyse the impact of applying differing corrections based on the certainty question for double-bounded dichotomous economic valuation exercises. The empirical application is based on data gathered from four surveys conducted with various groups to obtain the value allocated to a modern art museum: the Museo Patio Herreriano de Arte Contemporaneo Espaol, in the city of Valladolid (Spain). Findings indicate that estimates of Willingness to Pay are significantly reduced when a higher certainty threshold is required, in other words when individuals are more certain of their choices. Furthermore, correction through recoding proved more severe than correction through exclusion.","[Maria Bedate, Ana] Univ Valladolid, Escuela Univ Estudios Empresari, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, E-47005 Valladolid, Spain; [Cesar Herrero, Luis] Univ Valladolid, Dept Appl Econ, E-47005 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid,"Bedate, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Escuela Univ Estudios Empresari, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, Paseo Prado Magdalena S-N, E-47005 Valladolid, Spain.",ana@emp.uva.es; herrero@emp.uva.es; angel@emp.uva.es,"Herrero-Prieto, Luis César/K-9465-2014; Bedate Centeno, Ana Maria/K-9892-2014; Sanz Lara, Jose Angel/L-1260-2014","Herrero-Prieto, Luis César/0000-0002-2915-5706; Bedate Centeno, Ana Maria/0000-0002-7554-7639; Sanz Lara, Jose Angel/0000-0001-7243-8325",,,,,59,27,30,1,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Utilising annual data from developing and industrialised countries and dynamic panel estimation techniques, we provide evidence which suggests that both types of openness are statistically significant determinants of banking sector development. Our findings reveal that the marginal effects of trade (financial) openness are negatively related to the degree of financial (trade) openness, indicating that relatively closed economies stand to benefit most from opening up their trade and/or capital accounts. Although these economies may be able to accomplish more by taking steps to open both their trade and capital accounts, opening up one without the other could still generate gains in terms of banking sector development.

But it allows the merged firm to deviate only in a subset of markets, which hinders reputation building by making it more difficult for consumers to monitor its quality.

First, I find that Indian High Court amendments complicating procedures to treat a case are related to higher trial duration. Second, I find that temporally exogenous conflicting judicial decisions taken in India due to the Code of Civil Procedure's ambiguity lead to higher expected trial duration as judges are required to spend considerable time in choosing between several conflicting views. By using spatial and temporal variations in the occurrence of enactment of amendments and conflicting decisions as instrumental variables, I am able to measure the impact of judicial speed on credit markets, agricultural development, and manufacturing performance.

However, some areas are confronted with a decline in input use. We have recourse to a two-stage Cournot game to account for the issue. In a context of credit rationing and imperfect contract enforceability, competition has the effect of tightening the input availability constraint while increasing the shadow value of credit. First, contrary to expectations, the impact of an extension of access to farm credit on aggregate input use, efficiency and peasants' income is shown to be ambiguous. Intuitively, relaxing the liquidity constraint entails a higher price elasticity of supply that results in a reduction of traders' profit margin. As a consequence, traders' incentives to contribute to input availability are weakened. The effects of subsidising inputs are also analysed. Second, normative insights are drawn regarding second best combinations of imperfect credit and output markets.

(RAND Journal of Economics, 29(1): 1-37, 1998a; 38-56, 1998b) treats termination fees as an instrument to increase market power in a one-shot game of horizontal product differentiation. A prediction (Gans and King, Economics Letters, 71: 413-420, 2001) within this framework is that, with non-linear tariffs, firms should be interested in low termination fees. This seems to be at odds with regulatory experience in many countries. We offer an alternative approach, using an infinitely repeated Bertrand competition. We focus on symmetrical calling patterns and investigate simple two-part tariffs for two customer types, as well as general non-linear tariffs for two types and for a continuum of types. In this framework, when looking also at collusion in retail prices, termination fees make deviations from the collusive outcome less attractive. The optimum deviation strategy is usually to try to attract the high valuation customers since they exhibit the highest profits. Thus, a deviator will have a pool of heavy users which will have more outgoing than incoming calls, implying net termination payments. A cooperatively chosen termination rate can increase the deviator's cost and thereby always stabilizes collusion.","[Hoeffler, Felix] WHU, Otto Beisheim Sch Management, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany; [Hoeffler, Felix] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; Max Planck Society,"Höffler, F (通讯作者)，WHU, Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany.",felix.hoeffler@whu.edu,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Thus, some firms will voluntarily engage in environmental investment. In addition, it is also found that when consumers become more environmentally conscious, in the steady state a high level of environmental investment may be associated with higher output. This result potentially provides an explanation as to why environmental quality may increase with output.","[Wu, Chi-Hsin] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 116, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Wu, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, 11605,64-2 Jhihnan Rd, Taipei 116, Taiwan.",osmond@mail2000.com.tw,,,,,,,23,11,11,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

This is because they may limit the provision of public goods. In this paper, we review the literature on clientelism and vote buying and propose the use of field experiments to evaluate empirically the consequences of these phenomena. We provide an overview, discuss implementation, and interpret the main results of recent field experiments conducted by the authors in West African countries. Clientelism and vote buying seem to be effective and to enjoy widespread electoral support. The results suggest that increased access to information and political participation by women may limit clientelism. In addition, voter education campaigns may undermine the effects of vote buying on voting behaviour. We argue that our findings may inform the design of development aid interventions, as a way effectively to increase public-good political accountability. We also discuss directions for fruitful future research.","[Vicente, Pedro C.] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Vicente, Pedro C.] Univ Oxford, CSAE, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Wantchekon, Leonard] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Trinity College Dublin; University of Oxford; New York University,"Vicente, PC (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland.",vicentep@tcd.ie; leonard.wantchekon@nyu.edu,,"Vicente, Pedro/0000-0002-9864-5012",,,,,45,100,141,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We show that decentralized in-kind transfers can, in this setting, be an even more important instrument for relaxing self-selection constraints, thus, helping redistribution, than in single-government models.

We investigate the aid allocation mechanism design that attempts to increase the governance quality of potential recipient countries: the potential recipients spend costly resources improving governance, while the donor country allocates the fund based on their governance quality. The paper compares two mechanisms: one uses a simple winner-takes-all tournament to award the entire available purse to the country with the best governance: while under the other aid is distributed among countries in proportion to their governance qualities. The paper shows the second mechanism outperforms the first only if competing countries are sufficiently asymmetric. Moreover, the recipient who is most effective in governance - and stands to benefit the most from development assistance - has interests opposite to those of the donor. In addition, the paper shows that if the donor country allocates the fund based on both governance and the levels of poverty, it may result in a poverty trap: the leaders of potential recipient countries deliberately allocate funds away from the poorest so as not to better their position in order to receive more aid.

Several analysts have found that some key government transfers actually go mostly to middle and high income families and thus contribute to greater inequality. We argue in this paper that the impact of these programs on inequality should be evaluated considering the benefits received net of the taxes paid by households to finance the programs, since higher income households receive higher benefits but they also pay higher taxes.

The dynamics of Open Science,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Open Science; Pasteur's Quadrant; Overlapping generations,ECONOMICS; PATENTS,"Open Science is a dynamic system of knowledge production that depends on the disclosure of knowledge by researchers as an input into knowledge production by future researchers. To analyze the conditions supporting Open Science, we develop an overlapping generations model that focuses on the trade-off between disclosure and secrecy. While secrecy yields private returns that are independent of the actions of future generations, the benefits of disclosure depend in part on the use of disclosed knowledge by the subsequent researchers. We show that Open Science and Secrecy are both potential equilibria, and that the feasibility of Open Science depends on factors such as the costs of accessing knowledge from prior generations and the relative benefits to private exploitation under secrecy versus disclosure. In parameter regions where both Open Science and Secrecy can be supported, Open Science is associated with a higher level of social welfare. The analysis has policy implications for a number of areas, including public support for research training, appropriate design of formal intellectual property, and the role of scientific norms and institutions (such as an effective peer review process) in maintaining Open Science over the long run.

This stands in stark contrast to long held views, in philosophy and psychology, that maintain that human reason is motivated in part by emotions and, in particular, by social comparison. The social psychologist Festinger found that, much judgment and decision making are the results of social comparison which may or may not; reflect the actual reality of individuals. We tested Festinger's notion in Chinese cultural contexts by investigating public discussions of educational fairness. We found that, while educational spending has, been increasing steadily, sentiments about, educational fairness have been deteriorating. Time series analysis shows that these phenomena. were not clue to price inflation, availability of opinion outlets, or regional difference, but to the psychological process of social comparison.

The results show no significant effects from outsourcing manufacturing on plant operating performance. The paper further shows that investments in technological and organizational capabilities explain the improvements of performance to a significantly higher extent than does outsourcing.

To do that, we build a model where firms hire workers in a unionised labour market and sell their products in a market ruled by monopolistic competition. The parties bargain over real wages according to a Right to Manage rule. The solution of the bargaining problem allows us to determine the real wages and through them we can obtain the equilibrium level of employment and the consequent utilities for the union and the firms. We use this model to examine the effects of (de)regulation policies and we search for the existence of policies that increase the utilities of both parties.

Although a strong effect of having a high proportion of treated co-workers is found for the non-treated workers, no significant effects are found for the treated workers.

Although monetary policy in the early part of this decade may have helped to inflate the property bubble, it is far from having been the decisive factor. This article also argues that the function of controlling excessive asset price rises is one for regulatory policy rather than interest rates. What is proposed, accordingly, is the creation of institutional arrangements that facilitate the implementation of countercyclical financial policies during periods of strong economic growth. After considering the characteristics that economic policies in developed countries should adopt, the article then analyses the effects of the international crisis on the current accounts of the region's countries and the difficulty of applying countercyclical policies in the absence of a global lender.","[Luis Machinea, Jose] Univ Alcala de Henares, Prebisch Chair, Alcala De Henares 99775, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,"Machinea, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala de Henares, Prebisch Chair, Alcala De Henares 99775, Spain.",jl.machinea@uah.es,,,,,,,51,1,1,0,7,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,APR,2009,,97,,,,,33,56,,,,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,485UI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269149900003,0

We use school assessment measures and house transaction data from a single school district that is coterminous with a unified city-county local government to examine the effects of two school assignment policy changes. The unusual school district-city-county government structure minimizes property tax rate and public service variation across observations, reducing the source of one problem that plagues many capitalization studies. The school reassignment events reveal direct ties between school quality capitalization and households' expectations-the latter reflected in private school enrollment and tax referendum voting. Different school performance measures convey different information to home owners. In particular, student test scores do not affect house prices when broader school performance measures are published. Prices respond to measured school improvement, but improvements in a given school are more highly valued than being reassigned to a better school.","[Zahirovic-Herbert, Velma] Univ Georgia, Dept Consumer Econ & Housing, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Turnbull, Geoffrey K.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Zahirovic-Herbert, V (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Consumer Econ & Housing, 213 Dawson Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",vherbert@uga.edu; gturnbull@gsu.edu,,"zahirovic-herbert, velma/0000-0003-3552-3912",,,,,24,20,27,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Our main finding is that disaggregated prices appear sticky in response to macroeconomic and monetary disturbances, but flexible in response to sector-specific shocks. The observed flexibility of disaggregated prices reflects the fact that sector-specific shocks account on average for 85 percent of their monthly fluctuations.

In the unique equilibrium of this Bayesian game, each agent's optimal action depends on a properly defined knowledge index that measures how the aggregation of information helps him to infer higher-order beliefs about other's information after communication.

Theoretically, the findings are interesting because of the possible causes for the structural changes, and the fact that three-quarters of the relationships are stable when maybe they shouldn't be.

Empirical analysis focusing on automobile use (ordinary passenger vehicle, small passenger vehicle, and light passenger vehicle) in Japan revealed that if all of the additional income gain from product lifetime extension flows into the investment sector, a one-year lifetime extension during the ten years of the study period (1990-2000) would have led to an increase in income in 2000 amounting to +7 billion yen, as well as contributing to savings in energy amounting to -4x10(6) GJ. That is, longer-term passenger vehicle use increases income and decreases energy consumption under special cases. We also found that in the general case when less than 93% of additional income resulting from vehicle lifetime extension is directed to the investment sector, a+1 year automobile lifetime extension increases income at the expense of energy consumption.

First, employing a time varying composite institutional quality index in a fixed-effects framework, the paper shows that institutional improvements are followed by significant increases in international finance. Second, cross-sectional models also show a strong effect of initial levels of institutional quality on future bank lending. Third, instrumental variable estimates further show that the historically predetermined component of institutional development is also a significant correlate of international bank inflows. The results thus suggest that institutional underdeveloped can explain a significant part of Lucas [Lucas, Robert E. 1990. Why Doesn't Capital Flow from Rich to Poor Countries?

After the credit crisis, securitisation was blamed for allowing the 'hot potato' of bad loans to be passed to unsuspecting investors. Both views miss the endogeneity of credit supply. Securitisation enables credit expansion through higher leverage of the financial system as a whole. Securitisation by itself may not enhance financial stability if the imperative to expand assets drives down lending standards. The 'hot potato' of bad loans sits in the financial system on the balance sheets of large banks rather than being sold on to final investors, since the aim of financial intermediaries is to expand lending in order to utilise slack in balance sheet capacity.","Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Shin, HS (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,30,129,146,1,51,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

Development accounting research has shown that much of the variation in income across countries can be attributed to differences in TFP. The dual economy model suggests that aggregate productivity is depressed by having too many factors allocated to low productivity work in agriculture. Data show large differences in marginal products of similar factors within many developing countries, offering prima facie evidence of this misallocation. Using a simple two-sector decomposition of the economy, this article estimates the role of these misallocations In accounting for the cross-country income distribution. A key contribution is the ability to bring sector-specific data on human and physical capital stocks to the analysis. Variation across countries in the degree of misallocation is shown to account for 30-40% of the variation in income per capita, and up to 80% of the variation in aggregate TFP. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This study serves as an initial investigation of these hybrid mechanisms, exploring theoretically and experimentally how the opportunity to obtain a homogeneous good in a subsequent lottery affects Nash equilibrium bids in discriminative and uniform price auctions. The lottery imposes an opportunity cost to winning the auction, systematically reducing equilibrium auction bids. In contrast to the uniform price auction, equilibrium bids in the uniform price hybrid mechanism vary with bidder risk preferences. Experimental evidence suggests that the presence of the lottery and risk attitudes (elicited through a preceding experiment) impact auction bids in the directions predicted by theory. Finally, we find that theoretically and experimentally, the subsequent lottery does not compromise the efficiency of the auction component of the hybrid mechanisms. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence of economic recessions, Mexico lost 16.1 per cent of its GDP and more than 1.2 million workers were fired.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Div Estudios Posgrad, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Fernández, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Div Estudios Posgrad, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",acevedo@economia.unam.mx,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,3,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

In addition, an attempt was made to determine the impact of past wilderness experience and current residential setting on recreational demand. Since experience is a latent construct, a number of indicators, measuring the visitor's experience use history, were used to measure it. The results based on a truncated count data model show that trip cost and other visitor characteristics such as age, income, residential setting, and past wilderness experience were significant determinants for the visitation frequency. Moreover, the rural to urban migrants, who were expected to be more sensitive to nostalgic feelings, were making seven more trips than others.","[Paudel, Krishna P.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Acharya, Ram N.] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness & Resource Management, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Hatch, L.

It is remarkable that even though the four papers were independently written, three common themes run through them. The first is that post-conflict countries, in order to transit from recovery to sustainable development, need a planning framework with a fairly long-time horizon and an overarching objective of poverty reduction. The second is that economic and social policy-making in such countries is expected to be distinct from that usually undertaken in non-conflict countries, thus signalling the need for each country, given its circumstances, to articulate policy benchmarks that may, or may not, overlap with those proposed by International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and donors. The third major is the need for high volumes of aid flows to these countries; a controversial issue in the specialised literature on the effectiveness of aid. All of these major themes open up a vast area of research especially research based on country case studies.","[Ajakaiye, Olu] African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ali, Ali Abdel Gadir] Arab Planning Inst, Kuwait, Kuwait",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"Ajakaiye, O (通讯作者)，African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya.",olu.ajakaiye@aercafrica.org,,,,,,,4,15,19,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Causes behind these changes can be attributed to the severe economic recession that occurred just after the Asian crisis and the changing competitiveness of suppliers in cost and quality.

The aim of this paper is to investigate how oil price shocks affect the growth rate Of Output Of a subset of developed countries by comparing alternative regime switching models. Different Markov-Switching (MS) regime autoregressive models are therefore, specified and estimated. In a successive step, univariate MS models are extended in order to verify if the inclusion of asymmetric oil shocks as an exogenous variable improves the ability of each specification to identify the different phases of the business cycle for each country under scrutiny. Following the wide literature on this topic, seven different definitions of oil shocks which are able to describe oil price changes, asymmetric transformations of oil price changes, oil price volatility, and oil supply conditions are considered. Our findings can be summarized as follows. While the introduction of different oil shock specifications is never rejected, positive oil price changes, net oil price increases and oil price volatility are the oil shock definitions which contribute to a better description of the impact of oil Oil output growth. In addition, models with exogenous oil variables generally outperform the corresponding univariate specifications which exclude oil from the analysis. However, a stability analysis of the coefficients across different subsamples shows that the role of oil shocks in explaining recessionary episodes has changed over time. Improvements in energy efficiency, together with a better systematic approach to external supply and demand shocks by monetary and fiscal authorities are argued to be responsible for the changing macroeconomic effects of oil shocks. Finally, the impact of G-7 countries aggregate growth oil oil market conditions is considered and assessed empirically. The null hypothesis of the absence of a reverse relationship from real GDP growth to oil prices is rejected by the data. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The 'gradual effect' involves media contributing to marginal changes in existing institutions. The 'punctuation effect' involves media catalyzing rapid institutional overhaul. The 'reinforcement effect' involves media contributing to the durability and sustainability of punctuated institutional equilibria. Our analysis identifies a paradoxical relationship between mass media and institutions wherein media both changes and reinforces existing institutions. This finding resolves a tension in the institutional literature that defines institutions by their durability but recognizes we observe (sometimes rapid and radical) institutional change.

In this paper we consider multiplicative decompositions and show that the method proposed by D&L of taking the geometric mean of all elementary decompositions is 'ideal'. However, it requires the computation of an ever-increasing number of decompositions when the number of factors increases. As an alternative, we propose using the Sato-Vartia decomposition, which is also 'ideal', but requires the computation of only one decomposition.

In the model, financial contracts are subject to agency problems and firms can possibly default on borrowed funds. Financial frictions have two separate effects on the model. First, they introduce an indirect cost channel to the monetary transmission mechanism. Second, they exacerbate the welfare costs of output gap fluctuations. The indirect cost channel implies that a given reduction in inflation can be achieved with a smaller output loss. This effect encourages the policy maker to emphasize inflation stabilization. At the same time, agency costs also make output gap fluctuations more costly in terms of economic welfare. This second effect encourages the policy maker to place more emphasis on output gap stabilization. Whether the optimal policy requires greater inflation stabilization or output gap stabilization depends on the balance of these two effects. Under a reasonable parametrization, the first effect dominates the second and the optimizing policy maker adopts a stricter anti-inflationary stance.","Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Demirel, UD (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",demirel@colorado.edu,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,2,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Our households differ in their place of birth, in their age, in their education and, endogenously, in their employment status, in their wealth, and in their pension entitlements. They receive a stochastic endowment of efficiency labor units each period. And they face a disability risk and a survival risk. They understand the link between the payroll taxes that they pay and the public pensions that they receive. And they decide how much to consume and to work, and when to retire from the labor force. We calibrate this economy to Spanish data, and we use it to study the consequences of delaying three years the Statutory retirement ages in 2010. We find this reform is sufficient to solve the sustainability problems that plague the current Spanish public pension system. Our model economy predicts that under the current rules, the pension system fund will run out in 2028 and in the reformed economy it will last until 2050. We also find that it is moderately expansionary, and that it improves social welfare from the year 2015 onwards. We conclude that policymakers should seriously consider delaying the statutory retirement ages in Spain sometime in the near future. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Two curvilinear relationships in particular have been documented in the literature: one between inequality and income and the other between inequality and environmental factors. More recently, inequality and its link to trade liberalisation has received a good deal of attention, not least because it is among the major controversies provoked by the globalisation process. The outcomes for developing countries of greater openness do not fit neatly with the predictions of standard trade theory. Given this, it is natural to ask whether the relationship between trade openness and inequality may be better understood in terms of the Kuznets hypothesis. To this end, the study tests the Kuznets hypothesis in the context of trade liberalisation using data for Latin America. The evidence is new and is consistent with the Kuznets hypothesis: inequality increases with trade openness until a critical level of openness is reached after which inequality begins to fall. The curvilinear relationship between openness and inequality suggests that Latin American countries should continue with trade liberalisation measures but also introduce redistribution policies to ease the (initial) adverse consequences of liberalisation.","[Dobson, Stephen; Ramlogan, Carlyn] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England",University of Nottingham; Nottingham Trent University,"Dobson, S (通讯作者)，Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Burton St, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England.",stephen.dobson2@ntu.ac.uk; carlyn.dobson@ntu.ac.uk,,,,,,,25,19,23,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,,2009,62.0,2,,,,,226,238,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00433.x,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,433FA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265188500006,0

The main contribution lies in considering spillovers from geographic smoking restrictions. Results show that price affects cigarette demand, but not smoking prevalence. Cigarette demand turns out be unit elastic and similar in magnitude to the border-price elasticity. Home-based smoking restrictions lower both cigarette demand and participation, while work restrictions only lower participation. Border home restrictions seem inconsequential, whereas border work restrictions have a marginally positive effect, especially on cigarette demand.

Our findings indicate that individual wages are positively related to firm-specific quasi-rents in the non-union sector and under firm-specific contracts.

Using GHG accounting based on input-output models from Australia and the United States, this work presents specific case study examples and general results for broad industry sectors in both economies to address the development of a complete upstream carbon footprint for screening purposes. This is followed by an analysis of the issues surrounding application of cut-off thresholds and the relationship with system capture rate and efforts in carbon footprint analysis. This knowledge can inform decision makers about where to expend effort in gaining progressively greater accuracy for informed purchasing, investing, claiming carbon credits, and policy-making. The results from this work elucidate several findings: while it is probably true that some companies will know what sources contribute most significantly in the supply chain, this is not likely to be true for all. Contrary to common perception, scope 1&2 emissions are not always more significant than scope-3 sources, and, for some sectors, the largest sources of emissions may be buried further upstream than many companies may have previously perceived. Compiling a list of core elements of significance across all sectors may be problematic because these elements are not necessarily significant for most sectors. Lastly, the application of cut-off thresholds results in highly variable performance in footprint capture rate and is not a reliable criterion for including emission sources in GHG footprints. Input-output analysis is a powerful tool in informing supply-chain GHG accounting, and there is a need for plain language education, training, support materials and information to be made easily accessible to a global business community.","[Lenzen, Manfred; Murray, Joy] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, ISA, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Weber, Christopher L.; Matthews, H.

We find that, while less schooling in mathematics historically may be related to the relative scarcity of women in economics and the natural sciences, today women's and men's mathematical skills are rapidly approaching each other. Experimental economics have found gender differences in preferences in risk taking, competitiveness, and social preferences which may deter women from entering academic fields with an overwhelming majority of men. In addition, the internal academic culture may have developed to adjust to a traditional male lifestyle.

Under a specific informational framework, we derive the asymmetric combinatorial equilibrium bidding strategies and show that they exhibit a free-riding effect. We show that this effect is increasing with the level of uncertainty and decreasing with risk aversion. When all the firms are risk neutral or equally risk averse, the magnitude of the free-riding effect is unaffected by the division of the contract chosen by the public buyer. Nevertheless, when each firm exhibits its own risk aversion parameter, we find that the free-riding effect is reduced (resp. increased) as the more risk averse small firm competes for a larger (resp. smaller) part of the contract.","[Marechal, Francois; Morand, Pierre-Henri] Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, F-25030 Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte,"Maréchal, F (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, F-25030 Besancon, France.",francois.marechal@univ-fcomte.fr; pierre-henri.morand@univ-fcomte.fr,,"Morand, Pierre-Henri/0000-0002-3033-2327; MARECHAL, FRANCOIS/0000-0001-9905-1753",,,,,21,1,1,0,5,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Allowing for multiple unknown structural breaks we find two in four EMU countries, and in the UK as well, and a single one in five other countries. The pattern of dates fits national banking systems adjusting slowly to the new monetary regime and suggests Caution in associating structural changes to the introduction of the euro. The estimated equilibrium pass-through in the last break-free period is on average more incomplete, hinting at a reduced effectiveness of the single monetary policy. These results run against the economic intuition that a reduced volatility in money market rates is bound to mitigate uncertainty and to ease therefore the transfer of policy rate changes to retail rates: the run-up to Basel 2 and a deterioration of competition in loan markets could be the motivations. Caution in extrapolating these findings to recent periods is suggested by the differences between the Unharmonized and the new harmonized retail rates. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Although the current, provisional guidelines for calculating product carbon footprints specify that only the bottom-up approach is to be used for this purpose, this paper presents useful applications of input-output analysis that can improve the reliability of the method considerably, by taking full advantage of the strengths of input-output analysis. To this end, we first estimated the global carbon footprint (GCF) of food and consumables in Japan, using a global link input-output (GLIO) model comprising 804 economic sectors in Japan and 230 foreign countries and regions. By visualizing the GCF on a world map, the global distribution (including Middle East and African countries) of the induced CO2 emissions of each of the Japanese sectors were identified. To investigate the scope for reducing the data collection burden for CF practitioners, GCFs were compared with CFs obtained using a single-region input-output model. This showed that there are certain commodity groups with a CF equating to 70% to over 90% of the corresponding GCF, even if the imported goods used for producing a Japanese domestic product are considered environmentally equivalent to their domestically produced counterparts. Furthermore, it was identified which data should preferably be collected by the bottom-up approach to secure CO2 emissions coverage greater than a certain predefined level and keep data and labour costs at a minimum.","[Nansai, Keisuke; Inaba, Rokuta; Nakajima, Kenichi] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Res Ctr Mat Cycles & Waste Management, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kagawa, Shigemi] Kyushu Univ, Fac Econ, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 812, Japan; [Kondo, Yasushi] Waseda Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Econ, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Suh, Sangwon] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, Coll Food Agr & Nat Resources Sci, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Suh, Sangwon] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Kyushu University; Waseda University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Nansai, K (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Environm Studies, Res Ctr Mat Cycles & Waste Management, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",nansai.keisuke@nies.go.jp,"Nansai, Keisuke/C-2516-2008; Nakajima, Kenichi/AAQ-3768-2021; Kondo, Yasushi/B-9219-2013; Suh, Sangwon/E-2019-2011","Nansai, Keisuke/0000-0002-2449-1874; Nakajima, Kenichi/0000-0002-7241-7695; Kondo, Yasushi/0000-0002-6855-2691; Suh, Sangwon/0000-0001-8290-6276; Kagawa, Shigemi/0000-0003-3936-4103",,,,,33,52,52,3,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

In an open economy, firms' economic and technological performances depend on the position of these firms in their national and international technological environments. The main focus of this article is identifying the different channels through, which spillover occurs, specially the international technology spillovers (i.e. RD activities of foreign firms; foreign technology payments; international intermediate inputs; and international RD cooperation) and the mobility of engineers and scientists between firms. Our statistical and econometric analysis determines that spillovers drive the production of individual firms together and link it to the incidence of innovations. Thus, using a pooling method based on segmentation of bunched (or grouped) individuals rather than those of usual individuals panel models and proposing an efficient new full information method (3SLS),1 this empirical study shows that international spillovers are rather large compared to national spillovers. They account for a substantial fraction of the variation in firm production and innovation output in the French economy. The mobility of engineers and scientists help a firm to acquire knowledge externally so as to innovate and increase its production. The effects of technological policy tools used by the French government on the innovation and production are rather very high and incite firms to increase their RD efforts. This study also demonstrates the existence of a potential simultaneity in the decision to impliment RD and the spillover pools. The estimated coefficients obtained for the classical variables (capital and employment) are comparable to those obtained in the literature.","Univ Paris 01, Dept Management Sci, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Negassi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Dept Management Sci, 17 Rue Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",syoum.negassi@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,43,5,6,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The paper presents a generalized model of expanded reproduction and concentrates on the attempt to develop Marx's schemes along Keynesian lines. Trigg tries to develop a Keynesian interpretation of the schemes without significant changes to Marx's original approach; the paper argues that the abandonment of some of Marx's hypotheses, in particular that of free competition, is necessary to allows us to provide a Marxian determination of underemployment equilibria and to use a Marxian version of the Keynesian concept of multiplier. In considering Marx's and Keynes's analyses of capitalist economies, the paper also emphasizes their similarities with respect to the importance of money and the capitalists' liquidity preference in the process of reproduction and growth.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Sardoni, C (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via Cesalpino 12, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",claudio.sardoni@fastwebnet.it,,,,,,,14,8,8,1,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Data from 12 Asian economies over the period of 1987 to 1997 are employed. Strong evidence shows that FDI in manufacturing sector has a significant and positive effect on economic growth in the host economies. FDI inflows in nonmanufacturing sectors do not play a significant role in enhancing economic growth. Furthermore, without the decomposition of total FDI inflows, the effect of manufacturing FDI on host country's economic growth is understated by at least 48%.","Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA",Marquette University,"Wang, M (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, 606 N 13th St, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA.",grace.wang@mu.edu,,,,,,,37,87,101,2,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Both economies are export-oriented and actively court foreign direct investment (FDI) to advance their economic objectives of industrialization and economic development. This paper examines the causal linkages between inward FDI and the country's engagement in services trade in bi-variate and tri-variate VAR frameworks. The empirical findings for Singapore show evidence of bidirectional causality between inward FDI and the total trade volume in services (i.e. the absolute sum of payments and receipts) as well as between FDI and services imports (in the tri-variate specification). This may reflect her relative open foreign investment policy and free trade regime in services. For Malaysia, the evidence of causality is weaker and uni-directional, from inward FDI to services imports. These findings are consistent with the different stages of economic development and openness attained by the two sample countries, and they provide useful background for trade and foreign investment policies and development strategies.","[Wong, Koi Nyen; Tang, Tuck Cheong] Monash Univ, Sch Business, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Fausten, Dietrich K.] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Monash University; Monash University Sunway; Monash University,"Tang, TC (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Sch Business, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",tang.tuck.cheong@buseco.monash.edu.my,"Tang, Tuck Cheong/H-6636-2014; Wong, Koi Nyen/C-5711-2014","Tang, Tuck Cheong/0000-0001-7978-0684; Wong, Koi Nyen/0000-0001-9767-712X",,,,,22,15,16,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

For this purpose; firstly theoretical foundations of the input-output model are examined. After that, 59 activities of the 2002 Input-Output Table of the Turkish Economy are aggregated at 52 sectors and classified into three categories as Ricardo Sectors, High-Technology Sectors and Heckscher-Ohlin Sectors like Dasgupta and Chakraborty did for the Indian Economy in 2005. Then, the leading, key or strong activities of the economy that are more interrelated with other activities are calculated and found by the Static Leontief Model which is used by the Traditional Methods as the techniques to calculate the linkage effects like Chenery-Watanabe and Rasmussen methods to determine the sectors having the highest priority at investment policies according to the Hirschmanian Unbalanced Growth Model.

Since exchange rate volatility contributes to inflation volatility, we conjecture that it could have a direct effect on domestic consumption. We demonstrate our conjecture by specifying a consumption function that includes a measure of exchange rate volatility, in addition to its usual determinants. The model is estimated for each of the 17 countries in the sample using the bounds-testing approach to cointegration and error-correction modeling. The results reveal that in 12 of the countries, exchange rate volatility has short-run effects on consumption.

The paper's theoretical and empirical analysis is unusually complete in that it considers the entire process of collective action, including participation in initial organization, voting, and ultimate impact on property values. BID benefits are shown to be highly uneven, and BID formation is not a Pareto improvement Furthermore, large anchor participants benefit disproportionately, and are crucial for the viability of the institution, consistent with Olson (1965). These results, while demonstrated in a particular setting, apply to collective action more generally. Whenever a market failure leaves room for a collective response, the presence of anchor participants encourages collective action, and the action - even though in a sense voluntary - has uneven benefits.

The 1999 capital gains tax (CGT) changes reduced the UCH for investors. Also beneficial to investors are the tax treatment of negative gearing and the CGT discount of 50 per cent.

We also investigate the case of multiplicative poverty games for which indices are non additively decomposable in order to capture contributions of sub-indices, which are multiplicatively connected with, as in the Sen-Shorrocks-Thon poverty index.

This is the case where the possible actions are only two for every node (0 and 1), and the best response for a node is 1 if and only if all her neighbors play 0. A natural application of the model is one in which the action 1 is the purchase of a good, which is locally a public good, in the sense that it will be available also to neighbors. This game typically exhibits a great multiplicity of equilibria. Imagine a social planner whose scope is to find an optimal equilibrium, i.e., one in which the number of nodes playing 1 is minimal. Finding such an equilibrium is a very hard task for any nontrivial network architecture. We propose an implementable mechanism that, in the limit of infinite time, reaches an optimal equilibrium, even if this equilibrium and even the network structure are unknown to the social planner.","[Dall'Asta, Luca; Ramezanpour, Abolfazl] Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Fis, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Dall'Asta, Luca] Coll Carlo Alberto, I-10024 Turin, Italy; [Pin, Paolo] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit & Stat, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Dall'Asta, Luca] Politecn Torino, Ctr Computat Sci, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Siena; Polytechnic University of Turin,"Dall'Asta, L (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Fis, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",paolo.pin@unisi.it,,"Pin, Paolo/0000-0001-9907-4947; Ramezanpour, Abolfazl/0000-0002-3650-7722",,,,,17,15,16,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

It is found that conforming with the conventional wisdom, the incumbents prefer to form RJV to deter entry when the entrant is very inefficient. However, if the entrant is moderately inefficient, it is a better choice for the incumbent to accommodate entry by forming a RJV with it. In contrast, if the entrant is very efficient, then the equilibrium RJV structure depends on the magnitude of spillover effect: it is better to deter entry in the case of high spillover effect.","[Dong, Baomin] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Dong, Baomin; Guo, Guixia] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; University of International Business & Economics,"Dong, BM (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",baomindong@vip.163.com,"Dong, Baomin/AAV-7741-2021","Dong, Baomin/0000-0002-4787-021X",,,,,19,0,0,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Transitions in the US Household Income Distribution,REVIEW OF RADICAL POLITICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,household income distribution; longitudinal data,INEQUALITY HARMFUL; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; UNITED-STATES; COUNTRIES; DYNAMICS; MOBILITY; POVERTY,"In the five decades since Kuznets (1955) published his hypothesis on income inequality, a large and significant portion of the work on income distribution and inequality has involved using cross-sectional data for developmental comparisons at the intra-and international levels. Using cross-sectional data, these studies have tracked inequality trends that were deemed the consequence of growth and technical progress due to fiscal manipulations, such as levying taxes and granting subsidies to satisfy some welfare target. While this prior work provided valuable insight at the macroeconomic level on the interrelationship of development, economic growth, and income inequality, only over the last few decades has the research emphasis shifted from an understanding of the implications of income inequality at the aggregate level to that at the individual level. Using cross-sectional data it is possible to track income groups over time, but not the composition nor the characteristics of these groups, which are likely to change over time and affect their position in the income distribution. On the other hand, with the availability of longitudinal, micro-level data it has become possible to investigate in more detail underlying facets of income distribution, such as income mobility, and the lack of it, among households. Using three panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) (1993, 1996, and 2001) and building upon the methodological suggestions of Jarvis and Jenkins (1998) and Jenkins (2000), this paper looks at a household's economic and demographic characteristics relative to their position in the income distribution. For example, results indicate that between 1996-1999, 13 million households experienced changes in their annual income that resulted in their moving up or down two or more quintiles in the income distribution. On the other hand, 39 percent of households (38.5 million) remained in the same quintile between 1996-1999 with the majority of these households experiencing intra-quintile movements. Of notable interest is that of those households remaining in the fourth and top quintiles between 1996-1999; 70 percent and 65 percent, respectively, experienced positive intra-quintile gains in income ranging, on average, from $3,550 to $10,812 annually.","[Hisnanick, John J.] US Bur Census, Housing & Household Econ Stat Div, Washington, DC 20233 USA",,"Hisnanick, JJ (通讯作者)，2118 Edgewater Pkwy, Silver Spring, MD 20903 USA.",john.j.hisnanick@census.gov,,,,,,,33,0,0,2,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Is this consistent with nondecreasing human welfare? Our welfare or utility index emphasizes education, knowledge, and the environment. We construct and calibrate a multigenerational model with intertemporal links provided by education, physical capital. knowledge and the environment. We reject discounted utilitarianism and adopt, first, the Pure Sustainability Optimization (or Intergenerational Maximin) criterion, and, second, the Sustainable Growth Optimization criterion, that maximizes the utility of the first generation subject to a given future rate of growth. We apply these criteria to our calibrated model via a novel algorithm inspired by the turnpike property. The computed paths yield levels of utility higher than the level at reference year 2000 for all generations. They require the doubling of the fraction of labor resources devoted to the creation of knowledge relative to the reference level, whereas the fractions of labor allocated to consumption and leisure are similar to the reference ones. On the other hand, higher growth rates require substantial increases in the fraction of labor devoted to education. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses a similar type of approach to examine the performance of a new candidate for the activity variable, which is marginal cost measured following the theoretical methodology of Bits (1987), which we find to be simple yet powerful when implemented empirically. We then use the Phillips Curve to conduct pseudo out-of-sample inflation forecasts for the US using: output, unemployment, hours, the labor share, the capacity utilization rate, and the new measure of marginal cost. For almost all cases, forecast errors are lowest in the regressions with the new marginal cost variable, indicating that this new measure is an improvement over previous attempts to proxy for marginal cost.

This research focuses on the recent financial crises of 2007 and 2008 where the transmission flowed from the developed world towards emerging markets, such as Chile. Our analysis incorporates the transmission effects in mean, variance and covariance. For the mean equation, we implemented a non-restricted VAR model. For the variance component, we modeled a specification with asymmetric effects. The covariance and correlation effects are estimated using a conditional dynamic asymmetric model based on the dynamic conditional correlation model of Engle, testing for the possibility of long run structural breaks in correlations between financial markets. We found strong evidence of structural breaks increasing correlations during the recent financial crisis.

All this underlies the importance of carrying out formal impact assessments in order to determine benefits that are associated with a particular program. However, financial issues are also very important too and it is necessary to take them in account when making a fair statement about the cost-effectiveness of the program.

The results confirm that the Combinations of Post Keynesian policies have a large capacity to lead the economy toward the desired levels of output and inflation, while orthodox policies are generally incompatible with the Post Keynesian environment. A novel finding is that convergence for the output and inflation targets also means that maximum credibility is obtained and that appropriate policies avoid systematic forecasting errors, which cause a crisis of confidence.","Univ Fed Bahia, Dept Econ Theory, BR-41170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Bahia,"dos Santos, ALM (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Bahia, Dept Econ Theory, BR-41170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil.",,,,,,,,18,8,8,0,8,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Muslim and Other religion immigrants have less education compared to the immigrants who are not affiliated with any religion. However, affiliation with the Jewish religion is associated with higher educational attainment for males. With regard to religiosity, our results show that high religiosity is associated with lower educational attainment, especially for females.

Carbon pricing impacts households both by raising the cost of carbon intensive products and by changing factor prices. A complete analysis requires taking both effects into account. The impact of carbon pricing is determined by heterogeneity in household spending patterns across income groups as well as heterogeneity in factor income patterns across income groups. It is also affected by precise formulation of the policy (how is the revenue from carbon pricing distributed) as well as the treatment of other government policies (e.g. the treatment of transfer payments). What is often neglected in analyses of policy is the heterogeneity of impacts across households even within income or regional groups. In this paper, we incorporate 15,588 households from the U.S. Consumer and Expenditure Survey data as individual agents in a comparative-static general equilibrium framework. These households are represented within the MIT USREP model, a detailed general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy. In particular, we categorize households by full household income (factor income as well as transfer income) and apply various measures of lifetime income to distinguish households that are temporarily low-income (e.g., retired households drawing down their financial assets) from permanently low-income households. We also provide detailed within-group distributional measures of burden impacts from various policy scenarios. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

By using the panel data of Japanese FDI flows to nine dynamic Asian economies during 1987-2008, the paper finds that (i) FDI declined with a depreciation of the yen against host country currencies; (ii) it increased with exchange rate volatility: and (iii) it was little affected by the Asian financial crisis, especially when disguised financial flows were removed from the data. A novel result concerns the negative response of FDI to the third moment of monthly exchange rate changes: the volume of FDI was smaller when the distribution was positively skewed (i.e., when the yen was biased towards relatively large depreciation shocks). If skewness proxies for expected mean-reverting changes, this supports the idea that source country investors care about the future stream of revenues and returns denominated in their own currency. These results are robust, with other standard control variables having statistically significant coefficients with expected signs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper tests their existence in the corporate loan market in which they are likely to play a central role because of the complexity of contracts and the relevance of informational problems. Using very detailed data at bank-firm level on four Italian local credit markets we empirically show that firms tend to iterate their choice of the main bank over time. This inertia is not related to unobserved and time invariant firms' preferences across banks and can be attributed to the existence of switching costs. Moreover these costs are higher for single-bank firms. We also offer evidence that banks price discriminate between new and old borrowers by charging lower interest rates to the former in order to cover part of the switching costs. The discount amounts to about 44 basis points and is equal to 7% of the average interest rate. These results prove robust to a number of other potential identification drawbacks.

The empirical results indicate that there exist two threshold values of 32.88% and 55.89%. The latter is lower than the Maastricht criterion and Stability and Growth Pact of a total external Debt per GDP ratio at 60% in the OECD countries. Both thresholds divide our panel into three regimes. In the middle (stimulus) regime, the Debt per GDP ratio has a positive impact on real GDP per capita, which is consistent with the stimulus view (Eisner, 1984). However, the impact becomes negative and consistent with the crowding-out view (Friedman, 1977, 1985) in the left and right (crowding-out) regimes.

To address the concern that political reservation is endogenous, we take advantage of the state-time variation in reservation in state legislative assemblies in India generated by national policies that cause reservations to be revised and the time lags with which revised reservations are implemented. Using data on sixteen major Indian states for the period 1960-2000, we find that increasing the share of seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes significantly reduces poverty while increasing the share of seats reserved for Scheduled Castes has no impact on poverty. Political reservation for Scheduled Tribes has a greater effect on rural poverty than urban poverty, and appears to benefit people near the poverty line as well as those far below it.

Investors place more aggressive orders when the same side of the order book is thicker, and less aggressive orders when it is thinner. We conjecture and demonstrate that this behavior is related to long memories of trading volume, volatility, and order signs in stock markets. We investigate our conjecture in two types of artificial stock markets: a transparent market, in which agents observe all limit orders on both sides of the book and order volumes at those prices before they trade; and a less transparent market, in which agents observe only the best five bid and ask quotes with the depth available at these limit prices. The first market structure resembles certain actual stock exchanges in the level of pre-trade transparency, such as the Australian Stock Exchange, NYSE OpenBook, and the London Stock Exchange, whereas the second market structure is consistent with stock exchanges such as Euronext Paris, the Toronto Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing. We demonstrate that our long memory results are robust with different levels of pre-trade transparency, implying that the strategy constructed by the state of the order book is key for explaining long memories in many actual stock exchanges.

We find that paradoxical consequences of interjurisdictional transfers arise if people are mobile: while self-sufficient regions are necessarily identical with respect to policies and average incomes in our model, interregional redistribution always leads to the divergence of regional policies and per capita incomes. Thus, interregional redistribution prevents interregional equality. At the same time, however, transfers may allow for more interpersonal equality among the inhabitants of each region. The voting population may therefore in a decision over the fiscal constitution deliberately implement such a transfer scheme to foster regional divergence.

We explore this issue in a Ricardian model and show that it depends on the balance between protection and specialization rents. In particular, wage inequality among similar workers (residual wage inequality) may be U-shaped, at first decreasing and then increasing in the process of product market integration. Consequently, there may be gains in both the efficiency and the equity dimension until integration reaches a certain level at which a trade-off arises.","[Andersen, Torben M.; Sorensen, Allan] Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Andersen, TM (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Aarhus, Denmark.",tandersen@econ.au.dk,"Sørensen, Allan/ABC-5928-2021","Sørensen, Allan/0000-0001-8707-3576",,,,,26,1,2,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Bai et al. (2009) propose two iterative procedures that jointly estimate the slope parameters and the stochastic trends. The resulting estimators are referred to, respectively, as Continuously Updated and Bias Corrected (CupBC) and Continuously Updated and Fully Modified (CupFM) estimators. Our results show that, if we ignore the cross-sectional dependence generated by global stochastic trends when estimating the Fisher equation, we could erroneously infer that there is a full Fisher effect, as found by Westerlund (2008) for a panel of OECD countries. However, if we explicitly introduce the common factors in the Fisher equation, the CupBC and CupFM estimators of the slope parameter on inflation are significantly lower than unity, which implies the existence of a 'partial' Fisher effect.","[Badillo, Rosa] Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Econ, E-30201 Cartagena, Spain; [Reverte, Carmelo] Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Accounting & Finance, E-30201 Cartagena, Spain; [Rubio, Elena] Tech Univ Cartagena, R&D Grp Fundamentos Decisiones Sociales Econ, E-30201 Cartagena, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Badillo, R (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Econ, C Real 3, E-30201 Cartagena, Spain.",rosa.badillo@upct.es,"Badillo-Amador, Rosa/JNR-5610-2023","Badillo-Amador, Rosa/0000-0002-8580-0271; REVERTE, CARMELO/0000-0002-5947-664X",,,,,11,4,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Of the twenty-nine existing comparisons, sixteen find no difference, while four do find differences, and nine comparisons find mixed evidence. We also find some indications about the underlying determinants of when the two methods lead to different responses. For example, it appears that levels of punishment are substantially lower with the strategy method. In addition, it also appears that difference across these elicitation methods are more likely when people make fewer contingent choices. Finally, in no case do we find that a treatment effect found with the strategy method is not observed with the direct-response method.","[Charness, Gary] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Brandts, Jordi] U Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Business Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Brandts, Jordi] CSIC, Inst Anal Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Spain",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Charness, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, 3051 North Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",jordi.brandts@uab.es; charness@econ.ucsb.edu,"Charness, Gary/JVP-0357-2024","Brandts, Jordi/0000-0001-9082-9258",,,,,66,377,390,1,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

The decomposition results show that wage structure effects, such as a widening gender earnings gap, increases in returns to college education, and increases in earnings differentials between industries, company ownership types, and regions, have been the major contributors to the overall increases in income inequality.

Whether or not to restructure a bank is a key determinant of who bears the costs. The present article surveys the main issues concerning banks' restructuring, by considering the bargaining game that is played between regulators and shareholders when a bank is in distress. This revolves around the framework of negotiation that was established by the regulator, the fall-back position which is determined by bankruptcy legislation, and the objective function of the regulator. In this context, we argue that it is possible to improve upon existing restructuring mechanisms by making banks' bail-outs less costly to taxpayers and improving the ex ante incentives of banks' managers and shareholders.","[Dewatripont, Mathias] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch, Brussels, Belgium; [Dewatripont, Mathias] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Freixas, Xavier] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Pompeu Fabra University,"Dewatripont, M (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch, Brussels, Belgium.",mdewat@ulb.ac.be; xavier.freixas@upf.edu,"Freixas, Xavier/F-5579-2012","Freixas, Xavier/0000-0001-5849-6668",,,,,57,11,13,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

An expanding-variety setup with two different R&D technologies, agricultural, and non-agricultural, is employed. The analysis, based on numerical simulations, shows that the biased technical change hypothesis finds most support in the data.

Several models are applied to set of these variables, and their impact on the export dynamics of the Czech Republic is evaluated.","[Husek, Roman] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,david.havrlant@cnb.cz; husek@vse.cz,,"Havrlant, David/0000-0003-0139-3494",,,,,27,11,11,1,12,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

For rational theories, beliefs are determined by given information and updated via Bayes's rule. For normative theory, best represented by Hayek and sociological theory, beliefs are categories that precede information and, in fact, formulate the otherwise impenetrable information. For procedural theory, best represented by Herbert Simon and pragmatic philosophy, while beliefs formulate the information, they can be replaced in response to shocks. While each theory manages to capture one kind of belief, all three largely fail to explain internal motivations that characterize entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity. The failure arises from the fact that the three theories are about cognitive beliefs (i.e., beliefs about the world), while internal motivations are beliefs concerning self-ability.","Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"Khalil, EL (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",,"Khalil, Elias/ABA-3606-2021; Khalil, Elias L/I-7075-2012","Khalil, Elias/0000-0002-0510-447X;",,,,,68,7,10,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Using data from two provinces in northeastern China we find that parental labor migration is associated with a.7 grade-level lag in educational attainment among girls.

Using data from Mexico. I am able to estimate the mothers' bargaining power separately from the other parameters of the model. I find that an increase in a mother's bargaining power is associated with fewer hours of work for her daughters but not for her sons. This implies that policies that target the mother as the recipient of welfare benefits, if they manage to affect the distribution of power within the household, may affect her children's work with different impacts for boys and girls. This result also suggests that the distribution of bargaining power within the household is a relevant factor that should be considered when analyzing household's decisions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates a range of determinants of the exit rate for twelve different sectors in the Italian provinces for a period of eleven years. The analysis shows that the exit rate is positively affected by entry in the previous year (displacement) in the same sector. Previous exit has a different effect for the manufacturing industry as compared to the business services. More specifically, exit persists in manufacturing while in the business services it is rather exit in related sectors in the same province that leads to increased exit, probably due to the loss of clients or suppliers. The presence of industrial districts diminishes exit, especially in two manufacturing sectors (Food and Clothing), Commerce and Transport. Provinces with strong trademark activity appear to have lower exit rates.","[Santarelli, Enrico] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Carree, Martin A.] Maastricht Univ, UM Sch Business & Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Verheul, Ingrid] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Bologna; Maastricht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Santarelli, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",m.carree@maastrichtuniversity.nl; iverheul@rsm.nl; enrico.santarelli@unibo.it,,"SANTARELLI, ENRICO/0000-0001-8986-2755",,,,,55,18,23,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Simultaneous left-wing governments improve business cycle synchronization while the results for right-wing governments, although statistically weak, suggest the opposite effect. In some particular cases, also elections and cabinet changes are found to have a negative impact on synchronization.

The paper uses the concept of an equivalent tax function, raising the same present value of tax payments as the actual function, in which the effective rate on losses in any period, and thus the degree of asymmetry, is explicit. The influence on the elasticity of tax revenue with respect to the tax rate of this effective rate is then examined, where 'loss-shifting' occurs. Results suggest that estimates of the behavioural effect on tax revenues of changes in tax rates can be expected in general to be smaller in regimes which involve greater asymmetries in the tax treatment of losses. Importantly, as losses vary over the economic cycle, the model predicts that the asymmetric tax treatment generates effects on tax revenues that are non-linear between above-trend and below-trend parts of the cycle.","[Creedy, John] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Creedy, John; Gemmell, Norman] New Zealand Treasury, Wellington, New Zealand; [Gemmell, Norman] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Victoria University Wellington; University of Nottingham,"Creedy, J (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.",jcreedy@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,15,5,6,5,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Despite marked divergence of opinion even within political parties, several important reforms have been introduced in the post 1965 era. The purpose of this paper is to carry out a systematic analysis of the drivers of the voting behavior of US representatives on immigration policy in the period 1970-2006, and in particular to assess the role of economic factors at the district level. Our findings suggest that representatives from more skilled labor abundant districts are more likely to support an open immigration policy towards the unskilled, whereas the opposite is true for representatives from more unskilled labor abundant districts.

To illustrate this we use information gathered from the Spanish Electric Industry and analyze electricity activities following three approaches: the traditional aggregate activity view, the multistage model and the multioutput-multistage approach. We estimate the degree of economies of scale S and derive marginal costs for all models, plus economies of vertical integration (EVI) for the last two ones.

In particular, we examine how advertising for statin medications affects the delay between diagnosis and pharmacological treatment for patients with elevated cholesterol, as well as the time between treatment initiation and therapy switching. Duration models of delay to treatment indicate that over some ranges, advertising increases the likelihood of treatment, while over other ranges greater advertising is associated with lower likelihood of treatment. Results for the switching behavior models indicate that on net, advertising tends to both discourage switching between drugs and encourage therapy continuation. However, the component of the advertising that represents credence effects is generally positive, which indicates that as patients' spell of drug usage lengthens, the Food and Drug Administration required warnings in advertisements induce consumers to switch away from the pharmaceuticals they are using.","[Bradford, W.

For this we use time series data (1970-2008) from seven European countries and the United States. We find that the demographic structure of the population and the incarceration rate are important determinants of crime. Our results suggest that a tougher incarceration policy may be an effective way to contrast crime in Europe.

We show that cognitive skills can account for growth differences within the OECD, whereas a range of economic institutions and quantitative measures of tertiary education cannot. Under the growth model estimates and plausible projection parameters, school improvements falling within currently observed performance levels yield very large gains. The present value of OECD aggregate gains through 2090 could be as much as $275 trillion, or 13.8% of the discounted value of future GDP for plausible policy changes. Extensive sensitivity analyses indicate that, while different model frameworks and alternative parameter choices make a difference, the economic impact of improved educational outcomes remains enormous. Interestingly, the quantitative difference between an endogenous and neoclassical model framework - with improved skills affecting the long-run growth rate versus just the steady-state income level - matters less than academic discussions suggest.

These findings of the paper provide strong evidence that, in both major Western and East Asian capital markets (including several emerging ones), real interest rates are mean-reverting.

This article builds an exchange rate model of managed float under conditional official intervention. In the model, the government minimizes social loss through a trade-off between targeting the exchange rate and lowering intervention costs. We obtain an endogenous threshold model and derive an analytical solution of the exchange rate stochastic interventions. The implication of a managed float causing a lower volatility of the exchange rate has been found by past empirical studies. Our model provides not only a justification for the central banks' conditional interventions but also a rationale for the use of regime-switching models of two states (intervention vs. non-intervention) in the empirical studies of exchange rates.

J,"Tarozzi, A",,,,"Tarozzi, Alessandro",,,Can census data alone signal heterogeneity in the estimation of poverty maps?,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Census; Heterogeneity; Poverty mapping; Small area estimation,INEQUALITY,"Methodologies now commonly used for the construction of poverty maps assume a substantial degree of homogeneity within geographical areas in the relationship between income and its predictors. However, local labor and rental markets and other local environmental differences are likely to generate heterogeneity in such relationships, at least to some extent. The purpose of this paper is to argue that useful if only indirect and suggestive evidence on the extent of area heterogeneity is readily available in virtually any census. Such indirect evidence is provided by non-monetary indicators-such as literacy, asset ownership or access to sanitation-which are routinely included in censuses. These indicators can be used to perform validation exercises to gauge the extent of heterogeneity in their distribution conditional on predictors analogous to those commonly used in poverty mapping. We argue that the same factors which are likely to generate area heterogeneity in poverty mapping are also likely to generate heterogeneity in such kind of validation exercises. We construct a very simple model to illustrate this point formally. Finally, we evaluate empirically the argument using data from Mexico. In our empirical illustrations, the performance of imputation methodologies to construct maps of indicators typically feasible with census data alone is indeed informative about how effectively such methodologies can produce correct inference in poverty mapping.

Recent decisions by the antitrust authorities seem however to indicate that there exists a tradeoff between the tragedy and the lack of competition characterizing an integrated market structure. In this paper we analyze such tradeoff in oligopolistic complementary markets when products are vertically differentiated. We show that quality leadership plays a crucial role. When there is a quality leader, forcing divestitures or prohibiting mergers, thus increasing competition, lowers prices and enhances consumer surplus. However, when quality leadership is shared, disintegrating firms may lead to higher prices. In this case, concerns about the tragedy of the anticommons are well posed in antitrust decisions.","[Carbonara, Emanuela] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, BO, Italy; [Alvisi, Matteo] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40125 Bologna, BO, Italy; [Alvisi, Matteo] Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS, Bologna, BO, Italy; [Parisi, Francesco] Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Parisi, Francesco] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Bologna; University of Bologna; Johns Hopkins University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Carbonara, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, 2 Piazza Scaravilli, I-40126 Bologna, BO, Italy.",m.alvisi@unibo.it; emanuela.carbonara@unibo.it; parisi@umn.edu,"Parisi, Francesco/CAJ-0100-2022","Parisi, Francesco/0000-0003-2807-2279; ALVISI, MATTEO/0000-0003-1607-1009",,,,,24,11,11,0,15,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

J,"Bodvarsson, OB; Sessions, JG",,,,"Bodvarsson, Orn B.; Sessions, John G.",,,The measurement of pay discrimination between job assignments,LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Wage discrimination; Complementarity; Monopsony power,MARKET; DECOMPOSITION,"The traditional Becker/Arrow model of taste discrimination in pay depicts majority and minority labour as perfectly substitutable, implying that all workers perform precisely the same job assignment and have the same qualifications. The model is thus only appropriate for determining whether ceteris paribus pay differences between white workers and non-white workers, for example, performing job assignment A are attributable to prejudice ('within-assignment discrimination'). The model is inappropriate for determining whether ceteris paribus pay differences between white workers in assignment A and non-white workers in assignment B reflect prejudice ('cross-assignment discrimination'). We extend the traditional model to allow for cross-assignment discrimination and we propose an empirical methodology for its estimation. In so doing we address two broad questions: (1) Do predictions about cross-assignment discrimination vary with the form of the production function?; and (2) How can one estimate such discrimination when there is no common measure of productivity? We address the first question by deriving a measure of cross-assignment discrimination for four different production functions-Generalized Leontief, Quadratic, CES, and Cobb-Douglas. The Generalized Leontief provides the most general results, although closed form solutions are not possible. Closed form solutions are obtainable from the other three functions, but only under restrictive assumptions. There are two main findings. First, most predictions are generally robust across functional forms. Second, cross-assignment discrimination depends upon productivity and labour supply differences between the two worker groups, labour market structure, and the interaction between relative group productivity and prejudice. We address the second question by outlining, for future exploration, a two-stage regression methodology in which a standardised (i.e. common) measure of productivity is estimated separately for each occupation. This measure is then incorporated as a right-hand-side explanatory variable in a second-stage, all-occupation regression designed to estimate cross-assignment discrimination. We discuss the proposed methodology with reference to a valuable and interesting test case: The market for professional sports players. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the high-skill type faces a positive marginal tax rate, rather than zero as in the conventional case. In this paper, agents' utility functions are postulated to exhibit habit formation in consumption such that the prototypical two-ability-type optimal nonlinear income tax model becomes a dynamic analytical framework. We show that if the government can commit to its future fiscal policy, the presence of consumption habits does not affect the standard results on optimal marginal tax rates. By contrast, if the government cannot precommit, the high-skill type will face a negative marginal tax rate, while the low-skill type's marginal tax rate remains positive.","[Guo, Jang-Ting] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Krause, Alan] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of York - UK,"Guo, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, 4123 Sproul Hall, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",guojt@ucr.edu; ak519@york.ac.uk,"Guo, Jang-Ting/AAY-8365-2021","Guo, Jang-Ting/0000-0001-9948-9691",,,,,27,17,17,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

According to our simulations, this kind of measure is pro-cyclical and therefore poorly suited to the current situation of the French economy. Furthermore, even in the case of good conditions, the scheme would not be funded. Without financing, this measure would widen the deficit and would amount to a fiscal stimulus.

We examine this problem theoretically and empirically by studying the effect of market belief on risk premia. Individual belief is taken as a fundamental primitive state variable. Market belief is observable; it is central to the empirical evaluation and we show how to measure it. Our asset pricing model is familiar from the noisy REE literature but we adapt it to an economy with diverse beliefs. We derive equilibrium asset prices and implied risk premium. Our approach permits a closed form solution of prices; hence we trace the exact effect of market belief on the time variability of asset prices and risk premia. We test empirically the theoretical conclusions. Our main result is that, above the effect of business cycles on risk premia, fluctuations in market belief have significant independent effect on the time variability of risk premia. We study the premia on long positions in Federal Funds Futures, 3- and 6-month Treasury Bills (T-Bills). The annual mean risk premium on holding such assets for 1-12 months is about 40-60 basis points and we find that, on average, the component of market belief in the risk premium exceeds 50% of the mean. Since time variability of market belief is large, this component frequently exceeds 50% of the mean premium. This component is larger the shorter is the holding period of an asset and it dominates the premium for very short holding returns of less than 2 months. As to the structure of the premium we show that when the market holds abnormally favorable belief about the future payoff of an asset the market views the long position as less risky hence the risk premium on that asset declines. More generally, periods of market optimism (i.e. bull markets) are shown to be periods when the market risk premium is low while in periods of pessimism (i.e. bear markets) the market's risk premium is high. Fluctuations in risk premia are thus inversely related to the degree of market optimism about future prospects of asset payoffs. This effect is strong and economically very significant.","[Motolese, Maurizio] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Ist Polit Econ, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Kurz, Mordecai] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Stanford University,"Motolese, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Ist Polit Econ, Lgo A Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",mordecai@stanford.edu; maurizio.motolese@unicatt.it,,,,,,,55,13,14,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

It is not limited to a comprehensive description of the tax systems, but goes to a detailed analysis of the effective average tax burden, which is relevant for investors' decisions on location, scale and mode of finance of a potential investment. The calculation is based on the European Tax Analyzer. This approach allows capturing different types of taxes borne by corporations, the respective tax bases and tax rates in great detail and hence extends the literature on company taxation in Asia. In addition, we seek to contribute to literate not only by establishing a country ranking based on the overall tax burden, but also by identifying the underlying tax drivers. In doing so, sensitivity analyses are run to examine the effects of altering model assumptions, thereby illustrating the sensitivity of the base case results to selected financial ratios.

Some recent papers examining this issue use ad hoc estimates and measure variability rather than uncertainty. We employ a multivariate GARCH model, which measures uncertainty by the conditional variance of the data series, to investigate whether macroeconomic uncertainty and monetary uncertainty Granger-cause changes in real money. The estimated model also allows us to investigate how monetary uncertainty impacts economic activity. We find that macroeconomic uncertainty impacts positively on US real M2 growth over a two-year horizon but that monetary uncertainty does not cause changes in real M2. Instead, our results indicate that real money growth causes monetary uncertainty. Monetary uncertainty is found to have a negative effect on real economic activity and on macroeconomic uncertainty. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results and the methodological approach used for institutions such as the ECB that give monetary analysis a prominent role in their monetary policy strategy.","[Cronin, David; Kelly, Robert; Kennedy, Bernard] Cent Bank & Financial Serv Author Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland",,"Cronin, D (通讯作者)，Cent Bank & Financial Serv Author Ireland, Dame St, Dublin 2, Ireland.",dave.cronin@centralbank.ie,,,,,,,23,7,7,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2011,38.0,2,,,,,155,167,,10.1007/s10663-010-9124-5,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022VU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309993100001,0

Leading models of intraindustry trade (Krugman (1981), Melitz (2003)) assume homogeneous workers and full employment, and thus predict that all workers win from trade liberalization, a conclusion at odds with the public debate. Our paper develops a new model that merges Melitz (2003) with Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984), so also links product market churning to labor market churning. Workers care about their jobs because the model features aggregate unemployment and jobs that pay different wages to identical workers. Simulations show that, for reasonable parameter values, as many as one-fourth of existing good jobs (those with above average wage) may be destroyed in a liberalization. This is true even as the model shows minimal impact on aggregate unemployment and quite substantial aggregate gains from trade. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis is based on a combination of a large-scale survey and administrative data that is rich with respect to individual, household, agency level and regional information. We use this richness of the data to base the econometric evaluation on a selection-on-observables approach. We find that short-term training programmes, on average, increase their participants' employment perspectives. There is also considerable effect heterogeneity across different subgroups of participants that could be exploited to improve the allocation of welfare recipients to the specific programmes and thus increase overall programme effectiveness.","[Huber, Martin; Lechner, Michael; Wunsch, Conny] Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Empir Econ Res SEW, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Lechner, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Empir Econ Res SEW, Varnbuelstr 14, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",martin.huber@unisg.ch; michael.lechner@unisg.ch; conny.wunsch@unisg.ch; walter@zew.de,,"Huber, Martin/0000-0002-8590-9402; Lechner, Michael/0000-0003-4308-1579; Wunsch, Conny/0000-0003-0483-5219",,,,,50,20,21,1,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

Specifically, it exploits the fact that some metropolitan areas experienced faster growth in the relative supply of less-skilled labor in the 1980s and 1990s due to an immigration wave and the tendency of immigrants to regionally cluster. Plants in these areas adopted significantly less machinery per unit output, despite having similar adoption plans initially.

Social exclusion shapes the structure of incentives, and thereby can in itself be the cause of differences in economic performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In this frame, we model the volatility of spot and futures returns employing several GARCH-class models. Then, using two non-parametric methods, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and rescaled range analysis (R/S), we compare the long memory properties of conditional volatility series obtained from GARCH-class models to that of actual volatility series. Our results show that GARCH-class models can well capture the long memory properties for the time scale larger than a year.

Alternative research assessment measures (RAM) are discussed, with an emphasis on the Thomson Reuters Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science database. ISI RAM that are calculated annually or updated daily are defined, including the classic 2-year impact factor (2YIF), 5-year impact factor (5YIF), immediacy (zero-year impact factor (0YIF)), eigenfactor score, article influence, citation performance per paper online, h-index, Zinfluence, PI-BETA (papers ignored - by even the authors) and two new RAM measures, self-citation threshold approval rating and impact factor inflation. The data are analysed for the most highly cited journals in economics, management, business and business-finance on the basis of 2YIF. In addition to evaluating research in the most highly cited journals in economics, management, business and business-finance, the paper evaluates alternative RAM, highlights similarities and differences in RAM criteria, finds that several RAM capture similar performance characteristics, and finds that immediacy and PI-BETA are not highly correlated with other RAM. Harmonic mean rankings of the 12 RAM criteria are also presented. Emphasizing 2YIF to the exclusion of other useful RAM criteria can lead to a distorted evaluation of journal performance and influence.","[Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Oxley, Les] Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Christchurch, New Zealand",National Chung Hsing University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Kyoto University; University of Canterbury,"Chang, CL (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung, Taiwan.",,"Oxley, Les/JDW-1971-2023; Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; Oxley, Les T/A-6075-2008","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X; Oxley, Les/0000-0003-3621-2323",,,,,8,32,32,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0950-0804,,,J ECON SURV,J.

Allowing for strategic complementarities in price setting, we highlight a new dimension of the exchange rate channel by which monetary policy directly impacts domestic inflation: a monetary contraction which appreciates the exchange rate lowers the local currency price of imported goods; this, in turn, induces domestic producers to lower their prices too. We pin down key parameters of the model by matching impulse responses obtained from a vector autoregression on time series for the US relative to the euro area. Our estimation procedure yields plausible parameter values and suggests a strong role for strategic complementarities. Counterfactual simulations show that openness alters monetary transmission significantly. While the contractionary effect of a monetary policy shock on inflation and output tends to increase in openness, we find that monetary policy's control over inflation increases, as the output decline which is necessary to bring about a given reduction of inflation is smaller in more open economies.

On the one hand, the time-span is long enough to map the co-evolution of its discipline and of its editorial context, and to enrich the debate of the history of science. On the other hand, the mass of its articles is large enough to identify the structural characteristics of its typical contents, the general profile of its representative authors, and to orient eventual submission decisions. With these two aims, the paper presents a snapshot of the last 27 years of the Italian economics journal Economia Politica. Looking at the JEL (Journal of Economic Literature) codes of its articles and at the bibliographic info of its authors, some distinguishing features are identified, along with some structural changes occurred along its history. The journal distinguishes as a generalist one (as opposed to specialist journals), with a remarkable distribution of subjects, but with some specializations too. In the last ten years, it has undergone some important changes. In particular, a substantial boost of internationalisation (not only in terms of publication languages, but also in terms of authorships), an increasing weight of co-authorships (and of non academic authorships, though to a lesser extent), a widening of the topics coverage, an increased specialisation on the growth and development implications of technological change, and a new focus on cutting-edge issues of industrial organization (e.g. firm strategy and organization). In terms of authorships, the journal distinguishes for a balanced ratio between senior professors (or equivalent) and junior researchers (or equivalent), towards whose contributions it shows a substantial propensity. In spite of the long editorial history of a group of Italian academics, the distribution of the authors' affiliations is far from concentrated. The distribution of their faculties is instead dominated by those of economics, but with relevant shares of other surrounding disciplines, such as political sciences and law.","[Grassano, Nicola] Univ Bologna, Fac Giurisprudenza, I-40100 Bologna, Italy; [Montresor, Sandro] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Pini, Paolo] Univ Ferrara, Fac Econ, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna; University of Ferrara,"Grassano, N (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Fac Giurisprudenza, Via Zamboni 22, I-40100 Bologna, Italy.",nicola.grassano2@unibo.it; sandro.montresor@unibo.it; pnipla@unife.it,"Montresor, Sandro/K-1833-2019; PINI, PAOLO/ITT-3182-2023","montresor, sandro/0000-0002-1195-901X",,,,,17,0,0,0,9,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1120-2890,,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Relying on the shape of this distribution we then estimate a life-cycle incomplete markets model. We find that considering a wide range of net worth percentiles for prime-age consumers between ages 26 and 55 delivers very precise estimates of the structural parameters, impatience and risk aversion. The estimated model captures how average net worth increases with age while the dispersion of net worth falls with age. The model also predicts some of the evolution of the net worth distribution since the 1980s. Feeding the observed higher labor income risk into the model increases precautionary savings while the higher experience premium of labor earnings reduces wealth accumulation. Quantitatively, these two forces imply that the model reproduces the stable average net worth for young consumers since the 1980s and the increasing dispersion of net worth for all prime-age consumers, while the model does not predict the observed increase of average net worth for older consumers between ages 46 and 55.

My empirical strategy exploits the exogenous variation that arises due to which country hosts the World Cup, as this will determine the time games are broadcast across different time zones in the United States. The hour of the day when games are broadcast differentially affects hours of work across different time zones. Further, the calendar timing of the World Cup allows me to compare labor market outcomes in June/July for a worker in World Cup year t, with the outcomes in June/July for a worker in non-World Cup years t + 1, t + 2 and t + 3. My results highlight the importance of the worker's pay frequency in their workweek flexibility, as all differences in weekly hours of work due to the World Cup are concentrated among salary paid workers. Also, my results show that after controlling for observable demographic characteristics as well as year and month fixed effects, a worker reduces on average his hours of work during the World Cup by statistically significant estimates that range from 9 weekly minutes to 28 weekly minutes, depending on specification choice and time of the day during which World Cup games are broadcast live in the United States.

Based on this trend, we study the overload problem within the Patent Office and its consequences on the firms' R&D incentives. We assume that the examination process of patent applications is imperfect, and that its quality is poorer under congestion. Depending on policy instruments such as submission fees and the toughness of the non-obviousness requirement, the system may result in a high-R&D equilibrium, in which firms self-select in their patent applications, or in an equilibrium with low R&D, opportunistic patent applications and the issuance of bad patents. Multiple equilibria often co-exist, which deeply undermines the effectiveness of policy instruments. We investigate the robustness of our conclusions as to how the value of patent protection is formalized, taking into consideration the introduction of a penalty system for rejected patent applications, as well as the role of commitment to a given patent protection policy.

In this paper, we combine the stabilization and credibility branches of the currency union literature and construct a simple welfare criterion that can be used to evaluate alternative monetary arrangements.

Yet, eliciting this information from the data is typically difficult. This paper uses a structural model to explain the answers on a set of questions regarding the perception of foreigners and Jews by native Germans. In this model it is assumed that in addition to observable individual characteristics there exists an underlying unobserved attitude towards minorities which drives the distribution of answers by native respondents. This latent variable in turn is assumed to be influenced by a set of observable socio-economic characteristics of the individuals. In order to estimate this model it is necessary to impose strong identification restrictions. Estimation results show that education is the key correlate of the perception of foreigners and Jews in Germany.","[Fertig, Michael; Schmidt, Christoph M.] Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Fertig, Michael] ISG, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; [Fertig, Michael; Schmidt, Christoph M.] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Schmidt, Christoph M.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany; [Schmidt, Christoph M.] CEPR London, London, England",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ruhr University Bochum; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Schmidt, CM (通讯作者)，Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",schmidt@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,23,16,17,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Ultimate privatization is defined as the incidence of transferring the ultimate control of a state-owned company from the government to private owners. Using a sample of 127 Chinese listed companies that have had controlling blocks transferred from the government to private owners, we show that firm performance improved significantly following this transfer. In addition, gains in profitability and efficiency are more prominent when the new controlling shareholder is an outsider, one who does not own shares in the company prior to the transfer of control. Our results suggest that the Chinese government should continue to reduce its controlling ownership in listed companies, as the transfer of control to private owners enhances operating efficiency and profitability.

Modelling observed and unobserved heterogeneities treat individual firms in different ways and even though the expected mean inefficiency scores in both cases diminish the firm level efficiency rank orders turn out to be very different. The best fit with the data is obtained by modelling unobserved heterogeneity through randomizing frontier parameters and at the same time explicitly modelling the observed heterogeneity into the inefficiency distribution.

Both German employees and Czech commuters in the western German borderland of Bavaria are compared to other domestic and foreign workers. At the beginning of the 1990s, German legislation was relatively unrestrictive, so that it was quite easy for Czech workers to obtain a work permit beyond the border. Most of them had only low education. More than 5% of the eastern Bavarian male, low-skilled workforce was reported Czech in the early 1990s.

The use of transaction costs to get the result is only a modeling tool. Many other mechanisms-able to generate losses for a large mass of the agents' distribution in periods in which financial constraints bind-can produce the same result.

Irrespective of whether the setting is hot or cold we find that partners provide higher initial contributions than strangers. In the cold setting (without revision possibility) partners contribute more on average but do not react differently to past contributions by others than strangers. In the hot setting the dynamic contribution plans of strangers are somewhat upward-shifted. Furthermore the contributions of partners decrease more strongly than those of strangers over time in a hot setting. The reason for this effect lies in the fact that partners react much more strongly to negative experiences than strangers. Our design and results contribute to explaining the mixed evidence in the literature on partner versus stranger comparisons.and allow us to understand under which conditions commitment can be conducive or harmful to achieving and sustaining higher levels of contribution.

First, transition probability matrices are computed to look at changes in the position of countries at the world distribution of the export to GDP ratio. It finds that transitions toward high export ratios have been mainly experienced by Asian countries, but also that some reformers, like Mexico and Chile, have been able to improve their position relative to other studied economies. African countries mainly sunk to the bottom part of the world distribution, although they constitute only half of the economies with relatively bad export performance. In the consideration of the structural factors that may play an important role for long-run transitions, the results suggest that more open economies and those with better institutions are more likely to move to high export ratios in the long-run. Second, the within-country experiences are analyzed for identifying episodes of export transitions. Using an event study methodology, a very weak association is found between export transitions and investment rate. In contrast, the results suggest that transitions are potentially driven by improvements in financial development. Finally, favorable terms of trade, increments in productivity, and reductions in exchange rate distortions are not found to be a catalyst for export transitions.","[Alvarez, Roberto] Univ Chile, Cent Bank Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Alvarez, Roberto] Univ Chile, INTELIS, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Central Bank of Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Alvarez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Cent Bank Chile, Santiago, Chile.",ralvarez@bcentral.cl,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In one, as in all past variants of Nash demand games, the Nash bargaining solution is the equilibrium outcome. The other demand game allows for probabilistic continuation in cases of infeasible joint demands. Specifically, with probability (1 - p) the game terminates and the players receive their disagreement payoffs; but with probability p the game continues to a second stage in which one of the two incompatible demands is randomly selected and implemented. Surprisingly, the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution is always the outcome of the most robust equilibrium of this game. Moreover, ranking other solution concepts is impossible. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

These were: population of the town and its hinterland, distance to the nearest academic centre, education level of inhabitants, local authority revenue and the existence nearby of other, potentially competing colleges. The analysis proved that the most important location factor of non-public higher education institutions was the existence of other, potentially competing colleges in the vicinity.

This basic nexus helps to understand new unexplored paths in the so-called 'happiness-income paradox'. To illustrate them we show that personal income has two main effects on happiness. The first is a positive effect which depends on individual's ranking within domestic income quintiles. The second is determined by the relationship between income and relational goods. In principle, more productive individuals may substitute (if the income effect prevails over the substitution effect) worked hours with the nonworking time made free for enjoying relationships, when they have strong preferences for them. The problem is that these individuals tend to have ties with their income class peers who share with them a high opportunity cost for the time spent for relationships. Hence, a coordination failure may reduce the joint investment in relational goods (local public goods which need to be co-produced in order to be enjoyed together) and, through this effect, individuals in the highest income quintiles may end up with poorer relational goods. The indirect impact of personal income on happiness through this channel is therefore expected to be negative.","[Becchetti, Leonardo; Trovato, Giovanni; Bedoya, David Andres Londono] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Econ & Inst, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Becchetti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Econ & Inst, Rome, Italy.",becchetti@economia.uniroma2.it,"Londoño Bedoya, David Andrés/JZE-5622-2024","Londoño Bedoya, David Andrés/0000-0001-7502-1453; BECCHETTI, LEONARDO/0000-0002-7629-0716",,,,,63,42,42,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Unlike almost all other European countries, Sweden has had budget surpluses and a government debt ratio around 40 percent of GDP during the recent crisis. We attribute this to two important factors. First, Sweden entered the crisis with strong public finances and second that unemployment did not rise as much as normally during recessions. The Swedish fiscal framework that was introduced after the banking crisis in the early 1990s with expenditure ceilings, a top-down budget process, balanced budget requirement for local governments has played an important role. We show that the behavior of budget deficits has changed significantly recently, from a deficit bias to a surplus bias. Aggregate demand remained strong during the crisis even though exports fell sharply. As unemployment in the manufacturing sector increased, it was to a large extent offset by increased employment in the service sector.","[Bergman, Michael] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Bergman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",Michael.Bergman@econ.ku.dk,,,,,,,22,7,7,1,27,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,4,,,,,431,453,,10.2298/PAN1104431B,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,867MC,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298457500001,0

Therefore, in order to take advantage of positive trends, markets need to be confronted with winning strategies, with instruments that create a valid orientation in the implementation of long-term objectives. The new economic reality is highly complex, thus triggering an equal development of the management techniques and control practices not to lose sight of a significant feature of the monitoring of the economic evolution and management decisions of companies.

Ventura (Quarterly Journal of Economics 112: 57-84.) offers an explanation for the success of the Asian Tigers in sustaining exceptional growth rates over an extended period based primarily on capital accumulation. He points to their ability as export-oriented economies to exploit the accumulated capital to reallocate from labor-intensive to capital-intensive sectors instead of raising the capital intensity within each sector. We test this argument using industry-level data on manufacturing in 33 countries over three decades. The evidence on the argument is mixed. We identify two stages in the evolution of the structural change in the Tigers. It was labor-intensive initially and became capital-intensive only in the 1980s. Compared to other countries, the Tigers are exceptional in the extent of their shift from a labor-intensive to a capital-intensive structural change during the sample period. However, structural change in the 1980s accounted for only a negligible part of capital accumulation in manufacturing.","[Braude, Jacob; Menashe, Yigal] Bank Israel, Res Dept, Jerusalem, Israel",Bank of Israel,"Menashe, Y (通讯作者)，Bank Israel, Res Dept, Jerusalem, Israel.",yigal.menashe@boi.org.il,,,,,,,21,4,5,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In fact, in our set-up, countries can obtain international risk sharing even in the absence of default penalties.

The housework penalty is uniform across occupations within full-time jobs but some part-time jobs appear to be more compatible with housework than others. We find tentative evidence that the housework penalty is larger when there are children present.","[Bryan, Mark L.] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Sevilla-Sanz, Almudena] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Essex; University of Oxford,"Bryan, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",markb@essex.ac.uk; almudena.sevilla@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Bryan, Mark/0000-0002-5000-8946",ESRC [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,33,37,40,2,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The year of birth and the department of birth jointly determine an individual's exposure during school age to three different periods of the civil war, namely the initial period (1960-1978), the worst period (1979-1984), and the final period (1985-1996). We find a strong negative impact of the civil war on the education of the two most disadvantaged groups, namely rural Mayan males and females. Among rural Mayan males, those who were school age during the three periods of the civil war in departments where more human rights violations were committed completed 0.27, 0.71, and 1.09 years less of schooling respectively whereas rural Mayan females exposed to the three periods of the war completed 0.12, 0.47, and 1.17 years less of schooling respectively. Given an average of 4.66 and 3.83 years of schooling for males and females, these represent declines of 6, 15, and 23% for males and 3, 12, and 30% for females. Our results are robust to the inclusion of indicators for department of residence, year of birth, and controls for different trends in education and human development in war-affected and peaceful departments of Guatemala and suggest that the country's civil war may have deepened gender, regional, sectoral, and ethnic disparities in schooling.

For work seeking to arbitrate empirically between the two main alternative theoretical explanations for such discrimination as it exists, we distinguish between indirect analyses, which do not directly study the variation in prejudice or the variation in information, the mechanisms at the heart of the two types of models we review, and direct analyses, which are more recent and much less common. We highlight problems with both approaches. Throughout, we discuss recent work, which, the various challenges notwithstanding, permits tentative conclusions about discrimination.

We propose alternative concepts of well-being that can be used to classify individuals from rich to poor, and we show how social security redistributes differently under each concept. We use the PSID to estimate lifetime wage profiles and actual earnings each year for a sample of 1778 individuals, and we use mortality probabilities to calculate expected payroll taxes and social security benefits. For a given set of facts about the net flows experienced each year by each individual, measured progressivity depends on many assumptions. This paper attempts to capture and to quantify all of the data and characteristics relevant to determine each individual's income under several definitions. We then use each definition of income to classify individuals from rich to poor and to calculate the progressivity of social security. We proceed in seven steps. First, we classify individuals by annual income and use Gini coefficients to find that social security is highly progressive. Second, we reclassify individuals on the basis of lifetime income and find that social security is less progressive. Third, we remove the cap on measured earnings and find that social security is even less progressive. Fourth, we switch from actual to potential lifetime earnings (the present value of the wage rate times 4000 hours each year). This measure captures the value of leisure and home production, so those out of the labor force are less poor, and net payments to them are less progressive. Fifth, we assign to each married individual half of the couple's income. The low- wage spouse is then not so poor, and social security becomes even less progressive. Sixth, we incorporate mortality probabilities that differ by potential lifetime income. Since the rich live longer and collect benefits longer, social security is no longer progressive. Finally, we increase the discount rate from 2% to 4%, which puts relatively more weight on the earlier-but-regressive payroll tax and less weight on the later-but-progressive benefit schedule. Depending on the definition of income used to classify people, the overall social security system could be deemed progressive, only mildly progressive, or neutral. With an even-higher discount rate, it could even be deemed regressive.","[Fullerton, Don] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,,julia.l.coronado@americas.bnpparibas.com; dfullert@illinois.edu; tglass@glasscpa.com,,,,,,,47,18,18,5,18,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Our explanation for the weakened relationship relies on the theoretical prediction, which we verify empirically, that inequality influences marital decisions of young singles much more than those of older singles.

Both non-parametric methods allow for a rigorous statistical analysis of the freight process by detecting correlation, scaling and fluctuation behavior regardless of nonlinearity issues. By applying different data-frequencies and a temporal framework, the Hurst exponents indicate that freight rates exhibit trend-reinforcement and persistence subject to limited time-dependency and controlled volatility. The found long-range dependence corroborates that a predictive freight model can be built undermining the efficient market hypothesis. Memory effects seem to each time build up until they are interrupted by seasonal transitions, stochastic events or cycles which all spark a sudden loss in correlations or increase in nonlinearities. The surrogate and shuffling data procedures demonstrate that, dependent on the data-frequency used, memory effects and fat-tail distributions should be contained differently in freight rate models.

In contrast, the financing of the public education system is beneficial to both fertility and human capital. These results hold in the cases of both fixed and time cost of children.

Based on the best specification for each quantile we construct predicted conditional density functions, which guided us to identify two sources of asymmetry: (1) dispersion depends on the conditioned value of the RER, i.e. 'conditional' heteroskedasticity; (2) the probability of increases and falls also changes according to the conditioned value, i.e. there is higher probability for the RER to appreciate (depreciate) given the currency is depreciated (appreciated). We only verified strong heterokedasticity in relations among the lire, franc and mark, which was resolved by estimating quadratic autoregressive model for some quantiles.

Two-step procedures have problems, ranging from component misspecification to incorrect assumptions about the correlation between cyclical and non-cyclical components. In this paper, I present a one-step method, where DSGE structural parameters are jointly estimated with filtering parameters. First, I illustrate the properties of the one-step procedures using simulated data. Then, I show that different data transformations imply different structural estimates and that two-step approaches lack a statistical-based criterion to select amongst them. The one-step approach allows to choose the most likely specification of the non-cyclical component for individual series and/or to construct robust estimates by Bayesian averaging.

One of the new products, which were developed regarding to the investors' demand changes, is socially responsible investment (SRI). According to the market development, the needs of investors have been extended with the new extra-financial investment criteria, so called environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. By these criteria is SRI closely related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and these two concepts are encouraging each other. Both, institutional and individual investors are considering ESG criteria within their investment decisions more and more often. This is the clear sign that SRI is rising from the niche investment service and it is becoming fast growing, dynamic and highly demanded service. The main goal of our study is to provide comprehensive overview of SRI in the selected European countries. There is a development of this new approach in investment services investigated. The growth of SRI in the developing Central European (CE) countries is compared with the developed ones. As far as the level of financial integration is growing among the European countries, there is an expectation of similar conditions for European investors even in the field of SRI. Among the selected countries, there is a difference in the maturity of the SRI approach. Our paper provides great contribution to the literature on SRI among the European countries, especially on the comprehensive overview, when there is an obvious lack of literature on this topic.

Later developments considered repeated games and trigger strategies as well as the stability of coalitions. It is argued that the latter literature is overly pessimistic in that it does not pursue breakdown of successive coalitions to its ultimate end, which may provide a worse outcome than an apparently unstable coalition. The choice of strategic variable is considered at some length, but in the existing literature this choice is seldom explicitly motivated. Similarly the spatial distribution of fish is seldom analyzed in the existing literature, but it could make a difference.

Economic growth is supposed to be the key to increase labour demand and reduce unemployment. Departing from Okun's law, most research on the unemployment intensity of growth has focused on national disparities and the role of labour market institutions. Empirical evidence at the regional level is scarce. We investigate differences in regional labour market responsiveness and their potential determinants for a cross section of European regions. The data set covers the NUTS 2 regions in the EU15 for the period 1980 to 2002. Following a spatial modelling approach interaction among neighbouring labour markets is taken into account. Our findings point to substantial differences in labour market effects of output growth among European countries and regions. Both national labour market institutions and regional characteristics, such as structural change explain a significant part of these disparities.","[Niebuhr, Annekatrin] Inst Employment Res, Reg Res Network, IAB Nord, D-24106 Kiel, Germany; [Herwartz, Helmut] Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Okonometrie, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Niebuhr, A (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res, Reg Res Network, IAB Nord, Projensdorfer Str 82, D-24106 Kiel, Germany.",annekatrin.niebuhr@iab.de,,"Niebuhr, Annekatrin/0000-0001-8218-0954",,,,,37,23,25,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

For Central and Eastern European countries this evolution was an important dimension of the wider process of institutional change which accompanied their transition to market economies. This article presents the complex picture of EU countries at the outset of the recent crisis (2007) in terms of the components of earnings differentials, with particular emphasis on the dimensions of labour market flexibility identifiable with contractual arrangements (temporary versus permanent employment) and self-employment. Our main focus is on Central and Eastern European countries but we keep old EU members as benchmarks. Results highlight that different factors lie behind permanent/temporary and permanent/self-employed earnings gaps in the two regions. The dualism between regular and flexible jobs in the CEE labour market is mainly based on workers' attributes; in the Western EU the dualism is instead mainly driven by discrimination associated with labour positions.","[Perugini, Cristiano; Pompei, Fabrizio] Univ Perugia, I-06100 Perugia, Italy; [Hoelscher, Jens] Univ Brighton, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Perugia; University of Brighton,"Perugini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, I-06100 Perugia, Italy.",perugini@unipg.it,"Perugini, Cristiano/AAH-5782-2021; Holscher, Jens/A-6703-2013; Pompei, Fabrizio/AAM-2441-2020; Holscher, Jens/G-1834-2018","Pompei, Fabrizio/0000-0002-3867-8904; Holscher, Jens/0000-0001-6689-8392",,,,,90,13,13,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,3,,,,,271,310,,10.1080/14631377.2011.595119,0.0,,,40,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,883HJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299624500001,0

It describes, with particular reference to Africa and Melanesia, some of the assumptions that underpin these responses. Using the allegory of theatre, we suggest that much of the formal process of interaction between aid agencies and local actors can be seen as a 'performance', and what goes on behind the scenes is often, and sometimes deliberately, ignored. We review why this 'theatre' is constructed and how it is maintained, as well as why attempts to dismantle it, or at least change the way it functions, have not met with much success. As a result, we propose alternative ways of addressing issues of accountability, as it relates to International Aid and Cooperation, based on some rather different assumptions about states, civil society, citizens and change than those upon which many of the current attempts to address accountability are based.","[Hoffstaedter, Gerhard] La Trobe Univ, Inst Human Secur, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Roche, Chris] Oxfam Australiae, Dev Effectiveness, Carlton, Vic, Australia",La Trobe University,"Hoffstaedter, G (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Inst Human Secur, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",g.hoffstaedter@latrobe.edu.au,"; Hoffstaedter, Gerhard/C-5725-2019","Roche, Chris/0000-0001-9879-5769; Hoffstaedter, Gerhard/0000-0001-6083-3141",,,,,58,7,7,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Thus, it is possible that the effects are non-linear. This paper uses a threshold regression model proposed by Hansen (1999) to examine this impact on bilateral exports between the US and its top 13 trading partners. The estimated results illustrate that the threshold effects exist if the threshold variable is real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of partner countries relative to US GDP per capita. Exchange rate volatility reduces the exports from the US to relative high-income partner countries but increases exports from the US to relative low-income partner countries.","[Hsu, Kuang-Chung; Chiang, Hui-Chu] Univ Cent Oklahoma, Dept Econ & Int Business, Edmond, OK USA",University of Central Oklahoma,"Hsu, KC (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Oklahoma, Dept Econ & Int Business, Edmond, OK USA.",khsu1@uco.edu,,,,,,,18,11,12,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

These interactions illustrate how local NGDOs attempt to cultivate 'model developing citizens', enrolling the poor into regimes of governmentality, in which their bodies become the means through which global and national goals are achieved.

In contrast, an increase in the interest rate decreases both planned and cyclical consumption. Fiscal policy has a direct negative effect on cyclical consumption, which is not dependent on the interest rate.

Mathematical model is visualized by two numerical experiments. The first experiment was performed with the purpose to show the procedure of selecting the most appropriate item characteristic function and adjusting the parameters of the model. Goodness-of-fit statistic for detecting misfit of the selected model is calculated. In the second experiment a test of 10 items is constructed for the population with latent ability having normal distribution. Probability distribution of total test result and test information function are calculated when item characteristic functions are selected from four classes of parametric functions. In the next step it is shown how test information function value could be increased by adjusting parameters of item characteristic functions to the observed population. This model could be used not only for knowledge testing but also when solving diagnostic tasks in various fields of human activities. Other advantage of this method is the reduction of resources of testing process by more precise adjustment of the model parameters and decreasing the standard error of measurement of the estimated examinee ability. In the presented example the methodology is applied for solving the problem of microclimate evaluation in office rooms.","[Kosareva, Natalja] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Krylovas, Aleksandras] Mykolas Romeris Univ, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Mykolas Romeris University,"Kosareva, N (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",Natalja.Kosareva@vgtu.lt; Krylovas@mruni.eu,,"Kosareva, Natalja/0000-0003-2489-892X",,,,,28,4,4,0,8,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Shifts in sectoral contributions to gross value added cause two distinctive trends in the development of labour productivity: firstly, by increasing the contribution of the secondary sector to gross value added, which causes the increase of the labour productivity of the whole national economy, and by increasing the contribution of the tertiary sector to gross value added, which causes decline in labour productivity across the whole national economy. Generally, it is considered that economic characteristics of each industry determine through their consistency economic characteristics of their enterprises. The research question is whether for the determination of economic performance and financial health of a company its individual result is more important, or whether these issues are predetermined by its industry classification. The aim is to show the example of the Czech economy, both the development of selected economic characteristics of each industry in the context of the changing sectoral structure of the national economy, and the differences in results of the assessment of financial-economic indicators among six selected industries and selected sample of 72 companies within these industries. On the basis of available statistical data, there are assessed trends in labour productivity, capital endowment of labour and selected indicators of financial analysis of industry group the industry and the market services in the Czech Republic, which show the main differences between both segments of the economy. But the focus of the article is on the research aimed at the degree of result differences in assessment of economic performance and financial health within each industry and among industries. Using the data of financial statements of assessed companies, there were calculated both ratio indicators and synthetic indicators of financial analysis and their results were compared for each company within each industry, within companies of the whole sample and of the industry average. There was assessed variability of indicators within each industry and among industries. Attention was concentrated on 5 ratio indicators of financial analysis (current liquidity, return on costs, costs to revenues ratio, capital turnover and financial leverage) and 2 synthetic indicators - the Altman's model of 2002 and the Czech Grundwald's model of 2001. The analysis certified that ratio indicators of financial analysis of companies within industries show slightly higher variability than ratio indicators among industries, but the assessment of industry indicators of variability shows their slightly higher values. For the synthetic indicators of financial analysis this issue cannot be concluded clearly because there is the crucial way of construction of these models. Based on the performed research, there were formulated two other conclusions, both for financial analysis of enterprises, and for guiding regional growth area.","[Kraftova, Ivana; Mateja, Zdenek; Prasilova, Pavlina] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Kraftova, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",Ivana.Kraftova@upce.cz; Zdenek.Mateja@upce.cz; Pavlina.Prasilova@upce.cz,"Kraftova, Ivana/G-8935-2017","Kraftova, Ivana/0000-0003-0740-2670",,,,,32,8,8,0,28,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We assume that national governments respond to excess debt in an optimal manner, but that they do not have access to a commitment technology. This implies that national fiscal policy gradually reduces debt: the lack of a commitment technology precludes a random walk in steady-state debt, but the need to maintain national competitiveness avoids excessively rapid debt reduction. If the central bank can commit, it adjusts its policies only slightly in response to higher debt, allowing national fiscal policy to undertake most of the adjustment. However, if it cannot commit, then optimal monetary policy involves using interest rates to rapidly reduce debt, with significant welfare costs. We show that in these circumstances the central bank would do better to ignore national national fiscal policies in formulating its policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The New Strategy of the European Union concerning SMEs is highlighted by the financial crisis, the globalization process of the economies and the pressure issued on the surrounding environment. Synchronizing the economic crisis in several countries in Europe is an endangering fact, which leads to a slow process of recovery of national economies affected by the economic crisis. In the state of the current crisis, SMEs are more vulnerable than large companies, because they have low reserves, a small mass of incorporated resources, a low technical level, low stability and not a lot of experience. One of the biggest opportunities of which Romanian SMEs benefit of due to E.U. adhesion represents the accessing of structural European funds: the European Regional Development Fund (FEDR), the European Social Fund (FSE), and the Cohesion Fund (FC). In order to make better the financing access, Romania decided to use the JEREMIE initiative, allocating the sum of 100 million euros through the Operational Sector Program Increase of Economic Competitiveness (POS CCE).

Furthermore, learning is at the heart of corporate governance and it has become the essence of productive activity that has new rules, new boundaries and new ways of behaving (Garcia et al., 2009). Thus, one of the strategic values of an organization lies in becoming a learning organization. These organizations have an enterprise architecture that converts the firm into a place of learning, so the organization can make appropriate approaches to changing environment (Kogut & Zander, 1996; Garcia et al., 2007). The concept of knowledge management involves managing the learning processes of individual and collective members of an organization. Therefore, it includes organizational learning (related to the creation of new knowledge), and most processes related to the acquisition of knowledge from outside, dissemination, storage and exploitation of knowledge at the firm (Day, 1992; Garcia et al., 2009). So this paper analyzes how the 4 modes of knowledge conversion model proposed in the knowledge creating organization (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995): Socialization, Externalization, Combination and Internalization (SECI) affect organizational learning and the results of the organization. Analyzing a sample of 284 Spanish companies, we propose a model to analyze this relationship. The results show (1) a positive relation between the modes of knowledge creation, (2) knowledge creation influences organizational learning as an essential part of Knowledge Management (Garcia et al., 2007; Garcia et al., 2009), (3) knowledge creation and organizational learning can create a new approach of continuous improvement leading to the increase of organizational performance (Senge, 1990; Peters, 1992).","[Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio; Garcia Morales, Victor Jesus; Marti Rojas, Rodrigo] Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Mihi-Ramirez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Campus Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",amihi@ugr.es; victorj@ugr.es; rodrigomr@ugr.es,"Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/N-2217-2017; GARCIA, VICTOR G./HOF-9077-2023; Garcia-Morales, Victor J./F-9736-2016; Martin-Rojas., Rodrigo/G-3029-2015","Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/0000-0003-3801-9906; Garcia-Morales, Victor J./0000-0001-9061-6973; Martin-Rojas., Rodrigo/0000-0002-9210-408X",,,,,65,10,22,2,43,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We develop a model to consider the main trends related to the phenomenon of maternity postponement, considering changes in first and later births separately. Using retrospective life history data developed from the 1994 Living In Ireland Survey we estimate a hazard model to empirically test the relationship between career planning and the timing of first and subsequent births. We incorporate a declining marginal return to experience and thereby provide a human capital/career planning explanation for maternity postponement. The results of our analysis demonstrate that career planning has an impact on the timing of maternity.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that The New York Times has a Democratic partisanship, with some anti-incumbent aspects, in that-during a presidential campaign-it gives more emphasis to issues over which the (Republican) incumbent is weak. To the extent that the interest of readers across issues is not systematically related with the political affiliation of the incumbent president and the election cycle, the observed changes in news coverage are consistent with The New York Times departing from demand-driven news coverage.

In spite of a great interest in quality of life and many attempts to measure it, there is no method of quality of life measurement, which is grounded methodologically and accepted generally. Quality of life remains a contested concept, which is measured in different ways: analyzing one or several factors of quality of life (material well-being and GDP per person), using objective and subjective dimensions, creating composite indices. Following works and studies of scientists (Cummins, 1996; Diener & Suh, 1997, 1999; Easterlin, 1974, 1995, 2001; Hagerty et al, 2001; Layard, 2005, 2007; Veenhoven, 2000, 2005, 2009), who have analyzed quality of life and its measurement, the present article examines factors determining quality of life and complexity of their measurement. The article raises questions for discussion: what factors are involved in quality of life? How do they determine the quality of life in a particular country? Furthermore, on the basis of theoretical and empirical studies of quality of life, insights into opportunities for the development and implementation of quality of life studies are presented. A special focus of the present article is on complexity of quality of life measurement, which is primarily dependent of the levels and kinds of quality of life identified in the first part of the article. If studies of quality of life are conducted without having first identified its levels and kinds, this reduces validity and reliability of the results. Factors of quality of life and their groups are presented in the second part. It is important to note that in the scientific literature only premises for the identification and systematization of factors of quality of life and for analyzing their interrelationships are mentioned, while a wide range of quality of life factors and their different classifications only create a great confusion in quality of life research. Theoretical studies of quality of life measurement indicate that the analysis of one or several factors of quality of life fails to do justice to the topic of quality of life measurement. Measurement of quality of life requires systemic approach involving identification of factors of quality of life and determination of their interrelationships. Finally, on the basis of theoretical studies of quality of life and empirical research in this field, factors of quality of life are identified, categorized, and united in a single model. In the model of measurement of quality of life two environments of quality of life are identified - external and internal environment of quality of life. They in turn are divided into four groups of factors, including natural, political, social and economic environments as well as physical, personal developmental, social and material well-beings, which constitute the basis of the theoretical model for measurement of quality of life. The authors of the article believe that the concepts involving multiple criteria, which are determined by several groups of factors, different factors and indicators reflecting them, are best measured by means of indexes.","[Pukeliene, Violeta; Starkauskiene, Viktorija] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Pukeliene, V (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, S Daukanto Str 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",v.pukeliene@evf.vdu.lt; v.starkauskiene@evf.vdu.lt,,,,,,,40,43,49,5,92,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It focuses on fixed effects models with less than 100 cross-sectional units and between 10 and 25 time periods (such as are commonly employed in empirical growth studies). Estimator performance is compared on two dimensions: (i) root mean square error and (ii) accuracy of estimated confidence intervals. An innovation of our study is that our simulated panel data sets are designed to look like 'real-world' panel data. We find large differences in the performances of the respective estimators. Further, estimators that perform well on efficiency grounds may perform poorly when estimating confidence intervals and vice versa. Our experimental results form the basis for a set of estimator recommendations. These are applied to 'out of sample' simulated panel data sets and found to perform well.","[Reed, W.

Efforts to curtail rising drug expenditures have been exhibited by Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), yet drug expenditures continue to rise. Using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) for 1997-2000, this study examines how managed care, specifically Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), influence the physician's decision to prescribe the generic version of a multi-source drug. The findings show that HMO physicians are not significantly more likely to prescribe generic drugs than non-HMO physicians. Among HMO physicians, different cost reduction tools effect generic prescribing behaviour in different ways, with, the size of the effect depending on the patient and physician relationship with the HMO.","Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA",Eastern Michigan University,"Rice, JL (通讯作者)，Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 703 Pray Harrold Hall, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA.",jennifer.rice@emich.edu,,,,,,,16,2,3,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, temporal variation in firm efficiency could be substantial even for a short period of time. We demonstrate this point by examining the X-efficiency for the US property casualty insurers utilizing stochastic panel frontier models. Efficiencies are estimated under both time-invariant and time-varying efficiency assumptions using a large panel dataset from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) of years 2001-2006. It is shown that the two assumptions result in significantly different estimates. To test whether the estimated efficiencies correspond well to the properties that the true efficiencies should have, we investigate the relationship between the efficiency measures and other indicators of firm performance. The results suggest that the stochastic panel frontier model with time-varying efficiency provides more reasonable estimates.","[Zhang, Wei] No Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Shi, Peng] No Illinois Univ, Div Stat, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA",Northern Illinois University; Northern Illinois University,"Zhang, W (通讯作者)，No Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Zulauf Hall 515, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",wzhang1@niu.edu,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Technically, we examine the speed of adjustment and pass-through from policy rate to deposit and lending rates. The empirical evidence of the Jordanian economy shows deposit and lending rates adjust primarily in response to the previous period's departure from the long-run equilibrium. Further, retail interest rates follow a symmetric movement for their deviations from the long-run equilibrium. Accordingly, the CBJ has the power to control the spread between deposit and lending rates. Furthermore, deposit rate adjusts larger and faster than lending rate for a deviation from the long-run equilibrium. As a result, Jordan's monetary policy action needs approximately 11 quarters to be effective.","Univ Sharjah, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",University of Sharjah,"Sweiden, OD (通讯作者)，Univ Sharjah, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",osweidan@sharjah.ac.ae,,"Sweidan, Osama/0000-0003-4503-5883",,,,,39,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Such cases are gamma process or inverse Gaussian process leading to variance gamma model or normal inverse Gaussian model. Moreover, on the basis of backtesting procedure and utilizing various tests of exceptions in the risk estimation we can analyze the efficiency of a particular model with respect to a given security. In this context we try to identify, if there is any important difference/similarity of particular assets in question and/or which kind of test seems to be the most useful.

Second, with time passing and reform deepening, the government shows a more and more affirmative attitude towards farmer's choice about working in non-agricultural sectors inside rural areas and rural laborer flow to the cities. Third, the political system innovation, which has been carried out since the Chinese reform of 1978, is a process from bottom to top with a strong motivation derived from the farmers.

The research approach concerning causality and the estimating of the long-run equilibrium is based on the error-correction model. The problem of parameter heterogeneity is handled by the use of interaction terms. The result indicates that residential construction Granger causes Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the short and long run and it seems likely that the interaction term indicating high unemployment do add some explanation power to the model. This is not true when it comes to infrastructural and other building construction and its impact on economic growth. A high housing stock per capita seems to reduce the short-run effect. This implies that residential construction seems to have a larger effect if the accumulated residential stock is on a low level. The speed of adjustment to long-run equilibrium differs considerably between a country with a low residential capital stock and a country with a high-capital stock. Moreover, high owner occupation rates seem to be associated with a stronger relationship between residential construction and economic growth.","[Wilhelmsson, Mats] Royal Inst Technol KTH, Ctr Banking & Finance CEFIN, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wigren, Rune] Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res IBF, S-80129 Gavle, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Uppsala University,"Wilhelmsson, M (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol KTH, Ctr Banking & Finance CEFIN, Brinellv1, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",matsw@infra.kth.se,"Wilhelmsson, Mats/GLS-2270-2022","Wilhelmsson, Mats/0000-0002-9944-0510",,,,,37,11,14,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The perceived benefit of core inflation rates is that they help to inform monetary policy. This is achieved by uncovering the underlying trend in inflation or by helping to forecast inflation. Studies which compare core inflation rates frequently assess candidate core rates on these two criteria. Using US data, the two standard tests of core inflation the ability to track trend inflation and the ability to forecast inflation are applied to a more comprehensive set of core inflation rates than has been the case in the literature to date. Furthermore, the tests are applied in a more rigorous fashion. A key difference in this paper is the inclusion of benchmarks to the tests, which is non-standard in the literature. Two problems with core inflation rates emerge. Firstly, it is very difficult to distinguish between different core rates according to these tests, as they tend to perform to a very similar level. Secondly, once the benchmarks are introduced to the tests, the core inflation rates fail to outperform the benchmarks. This failure suggests that core inflation rates are of less practical usefulness than previously thought. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Scrapping is endogenous, and the model allows for a clean distinction between age and usage dependent capital depreciation and obsolescence. It is also shown that in this set-up past investment profile completely determines the size of current maintenance expenditures. Among other findings, a closed-form solution to optimal dynamics is provided taking advantage of very recent development in optimal control of infinite dimensional systems. More importantly, and in contrast to the pre-existing literature, we study investment and maintenance co-movements without any postulated ad hoc depreciation function.

We examined this with industry-level data on Japanese FDI flows into Asian economies. In order to deal with possible problems of serial correlation and endogeneity, we estimated coefficients using a difference and system generalized method of moments to examine the China effect on industries. We found a significantly high degree of crowding out effect by China on its Asian counterparts. Among twelve industries, a crowding out effect was found in nine industries, including electrical & electronics the biggest industry for Japanese FDI. However, a complementary effect was found in two industries, one of them being transport, which is the second biggest industry for Japanese FDI. We conclude that while China's rise is a prominent threat for the region, it could be transformed into an opportunity in vertically fragmented industries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We focus on price-based and quantity-based emission regulations. First, we show that in contrast to uniform taxes, under tradable emissions permits (TEPs), the fall in permit price produced by technology adoption reduces the benefits of violating the environmental regulation at the margin and leads firms to modify their compliance behavior. Moreover, when TEPs are used, the deterrent effect of the monitoring effort is reinforced by the effect that technology adoption has on the extent of violations. Second, we show that the regulator may speed up the diffusion of new technologies by increasing the stringency of the enforcement strategy in the case of TEPs while in the case of uniform taxes, the rate of adoption does not depend on the enforcement parameters.","[Villegas-Palacio, Clara; Coria, Jessica] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Villegas-Palacio, Clara] Univ Nacl Colombia Medellin, Fac Minas, Medellin, Colombia; [Coria, Jessica] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Empresa, Santiago, Chile",University of Gothenburg; Universidad Nacional de Colombia; University Diego Portales,"Villegas-Palacio, C (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Clara.Villegas@economics.gu.se; Jessica.Coria@economics.gu.se,"Bolaños Chavarría, Silvana/F-4277-2011","Villegas-Palacio, Clara/0000-0002-8258-9191",,,,,33,37,43,2,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Our analysis confirms that simply by virtue of its size and extremely low level of labor productivity, China's farm sector continues to weigh heavily in China's overall economic advances. Labor savings have levied the largest influence on the labor productivity on all sectors across all three study subperiods. We find that this transition is highly correlated with capital deepening that accompanies China's opening up process. Still, changes in the intra-sectoral shares and the intersectoral mix of China's final demand also have become quite strong, especially in recent periods. Due to ever-increasing competitive pressures as China continues to open, changes in industries value-added coefficients have tended to counteract some of the positive benefits of labor savings for most sectors. The effects on changes in labor productivity of technology change and changes in the use of imports have been comparatively negligible and any variation in their sectoral effects have been waning over time.

This includes whether grant aid has encouraged the PNG government to be less fiscally responsible and accumulate higher levels of foreign debt; whether grant aid has tended to lower the PNG government's domestic revenue raising efforts; whether grant aid has drawn government expenditures away from key service delivery sectors; and whether budget support and project and program aid have had differential effects with respect to any of the foregoing questions. The analysis reveals several important insights regarding the interplay between foreign aid and public sector fiscal behaviour including evidence that grant aid has been an important source of debt reduction during this period. However, grant aid has tended to erode the domestic tax base, which has limited the government's ability to increase aggregate expenditure levels. Evidence is also found that suggests a significant portion of budget support was spent on key development sectors, although it also undermined domestic revenue collection.

What is the effect of for-profit intermediation on seller investment incentives? Since for-profit intermediaries reduce the available rents in the market, one might naively suspect that sellers have weaker investment incentives with competing for-profit platforms. However, we show that for-profit intermediation may lead to overinvestment when free access would lead to underinvestment because investment decisions affect the strength of indirect network effects and, thus, access prices.

When multiple attributes are considered, a criterion determining the relative importance attached to the different dimensions has to be adopted. There has not been thus far in the literature a specific attempt to conceptualize the nature of the desired hierarchy among the selected poverty dimensions. The aim of this paper is to take the first step in this direction. We envisage two simple and highly intuitive ways in which such a hierarchical system can be understood, which we label restricted and unrestricted hierarchy. The analytical conditions allowing the incorporation of these into a poverty index are derived and their implications in terms of the understanding of poverty are discussed. An empirical application shows how the choice of the hierarchical scheme for poverty dimensions can lead to opposite conclusions on the poverty trend.","[Esposito, Lucio] Univ E Anglia, Sch Dev Studies, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Chiappero-Martinetti, Enrica] Univ Pavia, Dept Publ Econ, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of East Anglia; University of Pavia,"Esposito, L (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Dev Studies, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",lucio.esposito@uea.ac.uk; enrica.chiappero@unipv.it,,,,,,,29,12,13,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

We find that bilateral investment treaties have promoted foreign direct investment, but that their effect diminishes in a country as the political environment stabilizes. A bilateral investment treaty can therefore function as a substitute for political stability. In addition, this study finds that, on average, a BIT ratified by a country in the selected Asian countries raises FDI by, on average, 5.4 percent in the long-run.","Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, D (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, 262 Seongsanno, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",dhkim2@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,34,0,0,2,24,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Results indicate the presence of a long-run relationship between growth and electricity consumption; specifically we find that the non-residential sector is a key driver of growth. In addition, the evidence reveals a bidirectional causal relationship between electrical energy consumption and real GDP in the long run, but only a unidirectional causal relationship from energy to output in the short run. Forecasts indicate increasing consumption of electrical energy, particularly by the residential sector. We suggest that plans by the Government to liberalise the sector should encourage efficiency and innovation in production and distribution which should result in lower prices, as independent suppliers compete to maintain their market shares. Changes in the regulatory environment will also be necessary if such plans materialise. Policymakers will need to pay greater attention to the expected increase in the rate of consumption by the residential sector, as this will help to reduce the imports of oil and depletion of scarce foreign exchange resources by a sector that does not spur economic growth. An increase in energy capacity should be encouraged as contingency planning in the event of a technical or political disruption to fuel imports will be critical, notwithstanding the drive to use more renewable sources of energy.

In a nutshell, the problem is that when one's favorite theory is foisted on the data, the end result is invariably an empirical model which is both statistically and substantively misspecified, but one has no way to disentangle the two sources of error in order to draw reliable inferences. It is argued that ignoring statistical misspecification, and focusing exclusively on the evaluation of the statistical results - taken at face value - on substantive grounds, has proved a disastrous strategy for learning from data. Moreover, the traditional textbook stratagems of error-fixing designed to alleviate statistical misspecification often make matters worse. Instead, the paper proposes a number of strategies that separate the statistical and substantive sources of information, ab initio, and address the problem by replacing goodness-of-fit with statistical adequacy to secure the statistical reliability of inference, and then proceed to pose questions of substantive adequacy.

We find the following stylized facts: the value of the RMB became stable after the reform; the weight of the US dollar remained high in the basket, while other currencies remained statistically significant; and the floating hand gradually increased to 10 percent during 2005 2008, and then,greatly narrowed from the late summer of 2008 under the assumption of a yearly resetting interval. We find that the foreign exchange market pressure increased from 2005 to 2008. A possible reason is that the weight of the US dollar in the basket was slightly lower than the share of the US dollar in total transactions on the Chinese foreign exchange market. Therefore, it is reasonable far China to adopt a dollar peg exchange rate regime.","[Sun, Jie] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Sun, J (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jiesun_@hotmail.com,,,,,,,23,14,16,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2010,18.0,6,,,,,19,35,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01218.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,681MK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284319600002,0

At the same time it can increase direct monitoring and pressure by the supervisor, and mutual monitoring and peer pressure from other workers that is transmitted through the supervisor. Using UK data on satisfaction with the boss, we show in both cross-section and panel estimates that workers under profit sharing tend to have lower satisfaction with their supervisor. This result persists even as profit sharing has no or a positive influence on other dimensions of job satisfaction. Additional estimates show that lower satisfaction with the supervisor is largely generated by women, who may be less able to respond to peer pressure, and by non-union workers, who may have more to lose by failing to respond to peer pressure.

Drawing on critical realism, experimental replication is useful for assessing the generalizability of the treatment effects or for confirming treatment effects across diverse entrepreneurship settings. Yet, experiments in entrepreneurship have traditionally relied on single experimental trials and have not considered potential variance in treatment effects across contexts. Accounting for variance in treatment effects is even more pertinent under higher levels of environmental uncertainty. To help assess the contingent effects of treatments across contexts, we propose a set of methodological and statistical approaches for entrepreneurship researchers. Using different types of experimental replications and proposed statistical methods, one may draw inferences about treatment effects at the trial-, the treatment-, and at the individual-level. We illustrate the proposed approach using experimental replications across three randomized, post-test, experiments.

We explore three economic explanations for the observed structural state dependence: preference changes due to past purchases or consumption experiences which induce a form of loyalty, search, and learning. Our data are consistent with loyalty, but not with search or learning.

Despite these massive public bail-outs, a government and elite consensus has emerged that these nationalized or quasi-nationalized financial institutions should be privatized as soon as possible, and that, apart from modest changes in financial regulation, our economies should return to the status quo ante financial structure. I disagree. As the crisis reveals, financier dominated finance has a number of devastating flaws: it creates major externalities that contribute to financial and real economic instability; it promotes short-term investment strategies; it contributes to inequality; and it undermines economic efficiency and the achievement of social goals in the real economy. I argue that a better strategy for achieving economic recovery, restructuring, and widely shared, sustainable prosperity is to use public investments in the financial sector to build on the successful post-World War II experiences of publicly oriented financial institutions to create a stronger presence of finance without financiers.","[Epstein, Gerald] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Epstein, Gerald] Univ Massachusetts, PERI, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Epstein, G (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",gepstein@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,32,6,6,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

These direct channels of spillover effectively accelerate China's economic growth. Therefore, China should invest more in human capital and in its telecommunication network to enhance the absorptive capacity of direct R&D spillovers, and to increase communication with other nations, in particular the USA and Japan.

The indirect effect recognises that the development of securitisation markets made it possible for mortgage originators to compete with banks, which contributed to a decline in banks' market power and a fall in their NIMs. In estimating the model econometrically, this article finds evidence that both the direct and indirect effects worked to reduce Australian banks' NIMs prior to the onset of the credit crisis.","Reserve Bank Australia, Sydney, NSW 2001, Australia",Reserve Bank of Australia,"Kirkwood, J (通讯作者)，Reserve Bank Australia, GPO Box 3947, Sydney, NSW 2001, Australia.",kirkwoodj@rba.gov.au,,,,,,,8,3,3,0,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

However, while many are looking back to the Great Depression and to the theories and policies that seemed to contribute to recovery during the first part of the twentieth century, we argue that the current context is different from the earlier one; and there are more recent events that may provide better insight into the causes and contributing factors giving rise to the present crisis and to the implications for theory and policy that follow.","Univ London, Sch Business Econ & Informat, London WC1 7HX, England",University of London,"Konzelmann, S (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Business Econ & Informat, Malet St Bloomsbury, London WC1 7HX, England.",s.konzelmann@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,45,7,9,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

A much more important factor seems to be the Central Bank's monetary policy, modeled on the new monetary consensus. The misguided response of monetary authorities to the situation set off a credit crunch that had a negative impact on domestic consumption and destabilized the whole economy.

Nowhere in the world has this increase in flexible work arrangements being more evident than in Spain, where about a third of the wage and salary workforce holds fixed-term contracts. Using Spanish panel data and maximum-likelihood binary models that account for state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity, we examine the poverty implications of past and present temporary employment. Our findings suggest that fixed-term contracts are linked to a greater poverty exposure among women and older men relative to open-ended contracts. Furthermore, this greater poverty exposure can last several years due to feedback effects operating via job instability or via the transition to work statuses characterized by higher poverty hazards. Finally, the adverse impact of temporary employment is linked to the short duration of some contracts, thus signaling the importance of work attachment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Multiple equilibria arise naturally. We identify a new answer to the old question of why non-maximal penalties are used to punish moderate actions: marginal penalties are much more attractive in the Pareto inferior crime wave equilibrium. Specifically, although marginal penalties have both costs and benefits, the net benefit is strictly positive in the crime wave equilibrium. In contrast, marginal penalties frequently have a net cost in the noncrime wave equilibrium. We also show that increasing enforcement resources may worsen crime.","[Bond, Philip] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, SHDH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hagerty, Kathleen] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Finance, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Northwestern University,"Bond, P (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, SHDH, 3600 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",pbond@wharton.upenn.edu; k-hagerty@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Bond, Philip/Q-3302-2019",,,,,,14,11,11,0,6,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

Received wisdom has emphasised the economic functions of Schumpeter's entrepreneur, neglecting behavioural aspects. Schumpeter's model is examined; it posits a continuum of behaviours which are 'entrepreneurial', that rely on socially situated, tacit knowledge and are expressions of conscious, subjective rationality. Schumpeter's model excluded unconscious optimisation and decision rules derived from bounded rationality. Comparisons are drawn with modern neoclassical, Austrian, and the older behavioural characterisations of entrepreneurial behaviour. The newer 'effectuation' model of entrepreneurial behaviour is also contrasted with Schumpeter's approach. We find, among other things, that modern Schumpeterian economics associated with Nelson and Winter is not a natural continuation of Schumpeter's model. However, some developments in neo-Schumpeterian economics, including the effectuation model deriving from the older behavioural tradition, are congruent with both the original 'conduct model' and Schumpeter's directions for further research.","[Endres, Anthony M.] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Woods, Christine R.] Univ Auckland, Dept Management, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Auckland; University of Auckland,"Endres, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",a.endres@auckland.ac.nz; cr.woods@auckland.ac.nz,"Woods, Christine/T-9555-2019","Woods, Christine/0000-0002-0483-6513",,,,,57,23,28,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

A sub-sample of 760 titles which also received an initial theatrical release reveals that the DVD revenue distribution has thicker tails than the theatrical revenue distribution implying the top-ranked DVDs earning a greater share of revenues than their theatrical contemporaries. A comparison of revenues finds not only a high degree of correlation between the two markets, but a relationship that is nonlinear and increasing at higher theatrical revenue levels. This finding is consistent with a word-of-mouth momentum effect and more institutional flexibility in the DVD market. The high levels of correlation are present across all genres/ratings and are observed to be stronger for large release titles. Finally, a seemingly unrelated regression structure is proposed to jointly consider the two markets, which is shown to be empirically valid.","Univ Sydney, Discipline Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"McKenzie, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Discipline Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",J.Mckenzie@econ.usyd.edu.au,"Mckenzie, Jordi/AFN-3907-2022","Mckenzie, Jordi/0000-0003-4081-6189",,,,,41,11,12,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Human rights are the set of rights common to all equilibrium social contracts under perfectly competitive conditions. I explain that in reality, states may renege on their promises to citizens and may interfere with the market for social contracts.

The measure of their success will depend on the degree that these plans spread through the system. In this light the inter-industry linkages turn out to be quite significant for the effectiveness of policies. We propose in this paper an adaptation of the hypothetical extraction method to measure the role of energy and non-energy efficiency gains in an interconnected, multisectorial economy while relating the results to the Rebound effects literature.

The example is a Muthian cobweb model where producers have heterogeneous expectations and select forecasting strategies based upon recent realized profits. By means of a simple three types example we show that a locally stable RE fundamental steady state may co-exists with a locally stable two-cycle. We also study the Muthian model with a large number of different producer types, and investigate conditions under which an evolutionary adaptive learning process based upon recent realized profits enforces global convergence to the stable RE steady state and when persistent periodic price fluctuations can arise.

Surprisingly, no matter how obvious this question may a priori be when thinking of the effectiveness of these programs, there is virtually no empirical evidence on how they affect export performance in different parts of the distribution of export outcomes. This paper aims at filling this gap in the literature. We assess the distributional impacts of trade promotion activities performing efficient semiparametric quantile treatment effect estimation on assistance, total sales, and highly disaggregated export data for the whole population of Chilean exporters over the 2002-2006 period. We find that these activities have indeed heterogeneous effects over the distribution of export performance, along both the extensive and intensive margins. In particular, smaller firms as measured by their total exports seem to benefit more from export promotion actions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
