We apply a switching regression model to data from 260 farm households in western Kenya in order to allow for the possibility of discontinuities in fertilizer demand based on a soil carbon content (SCC) threshold. We find that the usual factors reflecting liquidity and quasi-fixed inputs are important on high-SCC plots but not on those with poorer soils. External inputs become less effective on soils with low SCC, hence the discernible shift in behaviors across soil quality regimes. For many farmers, improved fertilizer market conditions alone may be insufficient to stimulate increased fertilizer use without complementary improvements in the biophysical conditions that affect conditional factor demand.","[Marenya, Paswel P.] Univ Nairobi, Dept Agr Econ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Nairobi; Cornell University,"Marenya, PP (通讯作者)，Univ Nairobi, Dept Agr Econ, POB 29053-00625, Nairobi, Kenya.",paswel.marenya@uonbi.ac.ke,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721",Rockefeller Foundation; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Biocomplexity Initiative of the National Science Foundation [BCS-0215890],Rockefeller Foundation; United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Biocomplexity Initiative of the National Science Foundation,"We acknowledge with gratitude support from the Rockefeller Foundation, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Leadership Enhancement in Agriculture Program (LEAP), and the Coupled Natural and Human Systems Program of the Biocomplexity Initiative of the National Science Foundation, through grant BCS-0215890.

This article explores the effect of off-farm income on agricultural production activities, using data from the 2003 Mexico National Rural Household Survey. We first discuss the theoretical conditions under which access to off-farm income may influence production in an agricultural household model. Instrumental-variable (IV) estimation methods are then used to test whether agricultural production activities, technologies, and input use differ between households with and without access to off-farm income. We find that off-farm income has a negative effect on agricultural output and the use of family labor on the farm, but a positive impact on the demand for purchased inputs. There is also a slight efficiency gain in households with access to off-farm income. Findings offer insights into how household production evolves as rural households increasingly engage in off-farm income activities.","[Pfeiffer, Lisa; Taylor, J.

The analysis exploits farm-level panel census data to compare farm-specific changes in enterprise diversification over time. By examining diversification decisions of the same farms over time, we control for time-invariant unobserved individual heterogeneity. We then use pooled cross-sectional data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Resource Management Survey to estimate the relationship between farm diversification and average returns. We find that the insurance subsidies caused a modest increase in enterprise specialisation and production efficiency.

It evaluates agriculture as a whole and its contribution to the national economy, as well as the economic performance of the individual legal forms of business and production sectors. The results achieved by agriculture in 2004-2007 suggest that the income within the sector (except of 2005) has improved also due to the inflow of the EU subsidies. On the other hand, despite the growing aid the production output is shrinking, wages stagnate and the employment is failing. This suggests that the CAP should be changed after 2013, especially as regards the ways of subsidy payments. Economics of the individual products are largely affected by input prices, realisation prices, as well as by the volume of direct subsidies, namely in the plant production - the subsidies for crops grown on arable land, and in animal production - the subsidies per 1 Big Cattle Unit.","[Chrastinova, Z.; Burianova, V.] Res Inst Agr & Food Econ, Bratislava 82480, Slovakia",,"Chrastinová, Z (通讯作者)，Res Inst Agr & Food Econ, Trencianska 55, Bratislava 82480, Slovakia.",zuzana.chrastinova@vuepp.sk; viera.burianova@vuepp.sk,,,,,,,7,16,17,0,9,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

In particular, we investigate the impact of investments promoted by the MARENA Programme in Honduras on the total value of agricultural production (TVAP) of its beneficiaries.

The econometric estimates suggest that MARENA has had a positive and significant effect on the TVAP of beneficiaries. In addition, the analysis shows that, under alternative scenarios, MARENA yielded higher than expected internal rates of return. The results of this study shed light on the response of small-scale hillside farmers to economic incentives and lend support to the role of natural resource management projects in Central America as a tool to increase household income while also promoting the conservation of natural resources.","[Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.; Almeida, Alexandre Nunes] Univ Connecticut UConn, ARE, New Haven, CT USA; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Talca, Talca, Chile; [Solis, Daniel] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Affairs & Policy, Miami, FL 33149 USA",Universidad de Talca; University of Miami,"Bravo-Ureta, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut UConn, ARE, New Haven, CT USA.",boris.bravoureta@uconn.edu,"Almeida, Alexandre Nunes/AAP-3307-2020; Almeida, Alexandre Nunes/P-4285-2015; Solis, Daniel/B-1031-2009","Almeida, Alexandre Nunes/0000-0002-0680-5446; Solis, Daniel/0000-0002-7322-7201",Ricardo Quiroga (IADB); MARENA Team in Honduras,Ricardo Quiroga (IADB); MARENA Team in Honduras,They are also very thankful for all the support provided by Ricardo Quiroga (IADB) and the MARENA Team in Honduras during the initial study.,,50,24,28,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The Polya urn process is an internally consistent dynamic representation of yield expectations over a growing season that accommodates agronomic events such as growing degree days. The limiting distribution is the commonly used beta distribution. Binomial tree analysis of the process allows us to explore hedging decisions and crop valuation. The method is empirically flexible to accommodate alternative assumptions on the growing environment, such as intra-season input decisions.","[Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Hennessy, DA (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,,,,,,,44,3,6,0,13,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,2327-8285,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

So too has agricultural export taxation in poor countries, which has had the opposite impact on those terms of trade.

To what extent are Australian farmers and rural regions still adversely affected by farm and non-farm price- and trade-distortive policies abroad? This paper draws on new estimates of the current extent of those domestic and foreign distortions: first, to model their net impact on Australia's terms of trade (using the World Bank's Linkage model of the global economy); and second, to model the effects of that terms of trade impact on output and real incomes in rural versus urban and other regions and households within Australia as of 2004 (using Monash's multi-regional TERM model of the Australian economy).","[Anderson, Kym; Valenzuela, Ernesto] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Giesecke, James] Monash Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",University of Adelaide; Monash University,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352; Giesecke, James/0000-0002-7283-0551; Valenzuela, Ernesto/0000-0002-9621-7524",,,,,20,2,2,3,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Lag and structural break coefficients are estimated using a reversible jump algorithm that traverses the model space. In addition to producing estimates and standard deviations for the coefficients, the probability that a given lag (or break) enters the model is estimated. The approach is extended to select models populated with gamma distributed lags of different frequencies. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that R&D positively drives productivity. Gamma lags are found to retain their usefulness in imposing a plausible structure on lag coefficients, and their role is enhanced through the use of model averaging.","[Balcombe, Kelvin] Univ Reading, Dept Food Econ & Mkt, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Balcombe, K (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Food Econ & Mkt, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.",,"Balcombe, Kelvin G/F-8418-2010","Balcombe, Kelvin/0000-0001-7224-9233",,,,,24,6,6,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Many food retailers have developed even more stringent private food safety protocols relating to pesticide use, storage and disposal and passed them on to their suppliers. Exporters in developing countries enforce these developed-country pesticide standards (DC-PS) by subjecting farmers to close monitoring. This study explores the effects of enforcing compliance with DC-PS on smallholder farmers' pesticide-related health costs. Results suggest that enforcing DC-PS encourages farmers to use protection that lowers pesticide-induced morbidity, hence reducing farmers' health costs from pesticide exposure. The study concludes that there are health benefits to family farmers from complying with DC-PS beyond the acknowledged income generation from selling fresh produce in premium export markets.","[Okello, Julius J.] Univ Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya; [Swinton, Scott M.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Nairobi; Michigan State University,"Okello, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.",jjokello@gmail.com,,"Juma Okello, Julius/0000-0003-2217-2770","Agricultural, Food and Resource Economics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA","Agricultural, Food and Resource Economics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA","Julius J.

The economic model that underpins multilateral trade policy-as manifest in World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements-only predicts that firms will lobby for protection, with no provisions for how governments faced with requests for protection from other groups can respond. Consequently, governments have been forced to defend the imposition of trade barriers using spurious justifications; the WTO dispute mechanism has largely dismissed these justifications, and consumers (and others) feel disenfranchised. The result has been a loss of credibility for the WTO and sometimes its demonization. The WTO needs to change but a new economic model must also be developed to deal with a broader spectrum of protectionist interests.","Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Kerr, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, 51 Campus Dr,Off 3D20, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada.",william.kerr@usask.ca,,,,,,,37,11,11,1,17,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-3976,,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

A primary complicating factor in achieving conservation is the large number of public good environmental services provided by large numbers of individuals acting under diverse economic and ecological conditions. The complexity of the problem implies that additional consideration must be given to transaction cost economics and the theory of incomplete contracting. Drawing on insights from organisational economics, this paper argues that conservation policy and research could be improved with explicit consideration of the effects of 'holdup problems', transaction costs and trust on the provision of conservation services. 'Bottom-up' approaches are promising as they directly incorporate these organisational issues, and the paper concludes with an example of a 'bottom-up' conservation programme, the Ontario Environmental Farm Planning programme.","Berea Coll, Dept Econ & Business, Berea, KY 40404 USA",,"Steele, S (通讯作者)，Berea Coll, Dept Econ & Business, Berea, KY 40404 USA.",scott_steele@berea.edu,,,Appalachian College Association (ACA),Appalachian College Association (ACA),"I thank the Appalachian College Association (ACA) for generously providing a Faculty Fellowship and the Department of Economics at NUI, Galway for playing host to me during this time.",,38,2,3,1,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

Design/methodology/approach - Data from a survey held among 317 households in Minle County, Zhangye City, Gansu Province, covering the year 2007, are used for a probit analysis explaining investments in land leveling and for an ordinary least squares regression explaining irrigation water use per mu. Findings - Off-farm employment is not significantly related to investments in land leveling, but is negatively associated with water use per mu. In addition, the paper finds that the share of migrant students in a household is positively related to investments in land leveling. The results indicate the presence of major factor market imperfections in the research area, and confirm that the new economics of labor migration (NELM) approach is more relevant for analyzing off-farm employment and agricultural production in China than neoclassical economic theory. Originality/value - The paper expands the NELM approach towards the analysis of water-saving investments and water use. In addition, it distinguishes migrant students as an important category that should be taken into account in analyzing farm household decisions making.","[Castro, Veronica Wachong; Heerink, Nico] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Shi, Xiaoping] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Qu, Wei] Gansu Acad Social Sci, Inst Rural Dev, Lanzhou, Peoples R China",Wageningen University & Research; Nanjing Agricultural University,"Heerink, N (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",nico.heerink@wur.nl,"Heerink, Nico/AAA-2045-2020","Heerink, Nico/0000-0002-9911-3501",,,,,17,15,19,1,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

An agent-based modeling (ABM) framework was developed based on a theoretical economic model that incorporates a spatially explicit damage function. The framework was applied to a representative commodity (broccoli), invasive species (crucifer flea beetle), ports-of-entry (Calexico and Otay Mesa U.S./Mexico land ports), and vulnerable location (California). The ABM evaluated the economic impacts of port-specific and importer-specific enforcement regimes, enabling regulators to improve both the allocation of scarce enforcement resources and the effectiveness of current enforcement policies. The analysis generated several policy relevant findings concerning importing firm behavior and suggests conditions under which increasing enforcement may or may not significantly reduce invasive species risk and associated crop damages. The analysis illustrates that with a more realistic parameterization, the ABM could be used to make real-world policy decisions concerning allocation of limited resources across ports-of-entry.","[Cash, Sean B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Consumer Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ameden, Holly A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Boxall, Peter C.; Vickers, D.

We present an agent-based land market model where land from agriculture use is transferred into urban. The model combines the microeconomic demand, supply, and bidding foundations of spatial economics models with the spatial heterogeneity of spatial econometric models in a single methodological platform. Heterogeneous agents exchange heterogeneous spatial goods via simulated bilateral market interactions. We model a coastal city where both coastal amenities and flooding or erosion disamenities drive land market outcomes, facilitating separate analysis of the effects of each driver on land rents and land development patterns. We also analyze the implications of homogeneous versus heterogeneous but unbiased flood risk perceptions. Since buyers with low risk perceptions drive market outcomes, spatial development under heterogeneous risk perceptions differs qualitatively, with more expansion into risky areas. Our results highlight the shortcomings of policy models based on representative agent assumptions and the importance of including agent-level data in empirical modeling.","[Filatova, Tatiana; van der Veen, Anne] Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, Dept Urban & Reg Planning & Geo Informat Manageme, ITC Int Inst Geo Informat Sci & Earth Observat, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Parker, Dawn C.] Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Sch Planning, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Twente; University of Waterloo,"Filatova, T (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, Dept Urban & Reg Planning & Geo Informat Manageme, ITC Int Inst Geo Informat Sci & Earth Observat, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",T.Filatova@ctw.utwente.nl; veen@itc.nl; dcparker@connect.uwaterloo.ca,"Parker, Dawn C/H-3793-2015; van der Veen, Anne/A-5331-2010; Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","van der Veen, Anne/0000-0003-1574-9332; Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930","NWO-ALW (LOICZ-NL) [014.27.012]; US National Science Foundation [0414565, 0813799]; Directorate For Geosciences [0814542, 0813799] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0414565] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NWO-ALW (LOICZ-NL)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Funding from NWO-ALW (LOICZ-NL) project 014.27.012 and the US National Science Foundation grants 0414565 and 0813799 is gratefully acknowledged.

Given the observed income gap between Internet users and non-users, we then investigate the extent to which socioeconomic factors may be associated with this income gap. Using a nationwide survey of farm households in Taiwan, a novel econometric model is proposed and estimated employing a semi-parametric technique. Our results support the conclusion that Internet use improves farm household income. Most of the income gap between adopters and non-adopters can be explained by the differences in the return of the socioeconomic factors.","[Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Just, David R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",National Taiwan University; Cornell University,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 1 Roosevelt Rd,Sec 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw; drj3@cornell.edu,"Just, David R/K-7302-2012","chang, hung-hao/0000-0003-2296-134X",National Science Counsel of Taiwan [96-2415-H-002-020],"National Science Counsel of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","Hung-Hao Chang is Assistant Professor at the Department of Agricultural Economics, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Roosevelt Rd, Sec 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.

The main goal of the analysis is to bring out how and to what extent the distributive outcomes of support are affected by the structural relations existing among production activity, factor ownership and the distribution of income from farming among households. A particular manipulation, the singular value decomposition, of the matrix of income multipliers is used to highlight the major trade-offs, implicit in the structure of the economy, between the support to different farm types and the impact on incomes of different households groups. The results outline the existence of a structural trade-off between targeting and equity in supporting Italian agriculture through payments to farms and suggest flexibility in the application of reformed payments according to different distributive features of agriculture in member countries.","Univ Florence, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, I-50144 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Rocchi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ple Cascine 18, I-50144 Florence, Italy.",benedetto.rocchi@unifi.it,"Rocchi, Benedetto/C-1677-2013","Rocchi, Benedetto/0000-0002-7545-3093",Edoardo Pizzoli ( ISTAT),Edoardo Pizzoli ( ISTAT),"The author wishes to thanks the anonymous referees for their insightful and sometimes challenging observations on a previous version of this article.

The aim of the paper is to give an objective information about the influence of agrarian policy on the development of agricultural commodities, especially with reference to the comparison of changes in the pre-accession (period I = 2002-2003) and in the after-accession of the CR to the EU (period II = 2004-2006). This deals with the economic position of Czech producers related to the most considerable commodities of Czech agriculture through 2 indicators, profitability without supports (R-S) and profitability with supports (R+S). There was proved that profitability R+S in the period I was positive for most plant commodities while it was negative for most animal commodities. In connection with the membership of the CR in the EU, agricultural supports significantly increased for nearly all commodities as the consequence of applying the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on Czech agriculture. Therefore, there were monitored in the period II important positive changes of the indicator R+S for most commodities. For the average of the Czech Republic, there were obtained the following values of R+S in the period I, resp. period II: wheat 2.6%, resp. 24.9%, barley 27.7%, resp. 39.8%, rapeseed -18.0%, resp. 23.4%, sugar beet 9.1%, resp. 41.4%, potatoes 10.5%, resp. 2.5% (the only one case of decrease), milk 2.1%, resp. 8.5%, fattening cattle -14.6%, resp. -3.6%, suckler cows -8.8%, resp. 19.7%, fattening pigs -5.5%, resp. -1.2%, fattening broilers -2.9%, resp. 0.1%.","[Foltyn, I.; Kopecek, P.; Zednickova, I.; Vavra, V.] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Foltyn, I (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Slezska 7, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic.",foltyn.ivan@uzei.cz; kopecek.petr@uzei.cz; zednickova.ida@uzei.cz,,,Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [MZE 0002725101]; Rural Areas in the Czech Republic in Conditions of the EU and European Model of Agriculture,"Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Agriculture, Czech Republic); Rural Areas in the Czech Republic in Conditions of the EU and European Model of Agriculture",Supported by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (Research Plan MZE 0002725101 - Analysis and Evaluation of Possibilities of the Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Areas in the Czech Republic in Conditions of the EU and European Model of Agriculture).,,11,6,6,0,4,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We focus on the hypothetical introduction of a disease-resistant GM banana variety in Uganda, where bananas are among the most important staple crops. A choice experiment is used to investigate consumer preferences for various attributes related to the banana (such as bunch size, technology, producer benefit, and price) and examine their opinions on GM foodstuff. Choice data come from 421 banana-consuming households randomly selected from three regions of Uganda. A latent class model is used to investigate the heterogeneity in consumers' preferences for selected attributes related to the banana and to profile consumers who are more or less likely to accept GM bananas. Our results reveal that there is significant heterogeneity in consumer preferences across our sample. GM bananas are valued the most by poorer households located in the rural areas of the Eastern region. These food-insecure households would experience the highest benefits (i.e., welfare gains) from the commercial release of GM bananas. In contrast, urban consumers are less accepting of GM bananas, and they would experience significant welfare losses if GM banana is released. According to our welfare estimates, both the total welfare benefits acquired by the gainers and the total welfare losses borne by the losers of this technology are significant and large. These results suggest the need for further investigation of the overall welfare effects of the introduction of GM bananas on the Ugandan society as a whole.","[Kikulwe, Enoch M.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Birol, Ekin] IFPRI, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Wesseler, Justus] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Falck-Zepeda, Jose] IFPRI, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Gottingen; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Kikulwe, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",ekikulw@uni-goettingen.de,"Wesseler, Justus/H-5347-2016","Wesseler, Justus/0000-0002-6009-8543",International Food Policy Research Institute; Wageningen University,International Food Policy Research Institute(CGIAR); Wageningen University,"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the International Food Policy Research Institute and Wageningen University.

In this article, both the financial and the agricultural literature lead to the identification of many rationales for the crop insurance decision. Using data from the period 2003-2006 on a representative survey of French farms (FADN-RICA), we investigate the different factors that incite farmers to insure against crop risk. We emphasize that the highest risk farms are more likely to have insurance and this decision is positively related to the past amount of claims.

Asset-based poverty classification can be used to distinguish structural from stochastic poverty and can enable projection of poverty dynamics through time. Nonetheless, little work has empirically compared poverty measurement based on assets and expenditures to indicate the practical implications of the choice of poverty measure. This article uses panel data (between 1994 and 2004) from Ethiopia to generate asset- and expenditures-based poverty classifications. Asset dynamics are then explored to test for the existence of multiple asset index equilibria that could constitute evidence of poverty traps. Results provide evidence of multiple equilibria and show that the asset- based poverty classifications predict future asset and expenditures poverty status more accurately than expenditures-based measures. The findings confirm that the asset- based measure could be used to more carefully target poverty interventions.","[Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis Saweda O.] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Winter-Nelson, Alex] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Liverpool-Tasie, LSO (通讯作者)，IFPRI, 2033 K St, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",saweda_l@yahoo.com,,,,,,,24,27,30,0,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Farms are large, multi-enterprise businesses underpinned by expensive capital investments, changing production technologies, volatile markets and social challenges. The complexity of modern broadacre farming leads to the question: what is the nature of the relationship between farm business complexity and farm profitability? This study uses bioeconomic farm modelling and employs eight measures of complexity to examine the profitability and complexity of a wide range of broadacre farming systems in Australia. Rank order correlations between farm profitability and each measure of complexity show inconsistent relationships, although the most profitable farming systems are found to be reasonably complex on several criteria. Among the set of highly profitable systems are found some characterised by less complexity. A commonly acknowledged feature of farm business complexity is the annual workload of the farmer, yet the trade-off between farm profit and this workload is found not to be large. A case is outlined where the farmer's annual hours worked could be reduced by 9 per cent for a 3 per cent reduction in farm profit. If farmers' workloads are proving problematic now, and in the future, then agricultural R&D, service delivery and policy development will need to focus more on being highly attractive to increasingly time-poor farm managers.","[Kingwell, Ross] Dept Agr & Food, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Kingwell, Ross] Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Kingwell, R (通讯作者)，Dept Agr & Food, Nedlands, WA, Australia.",rkingwell@agric.wa.gov.au,"Kingwell, Ross/AAU-9315-2020; kingwell, ross/AAK-2952-2021","Kingwell, Ross/0000-0003-0324-9488;",,,,,70,57,59,0,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

A large portion of China's counties (county-level cities) have to run with the shortage of financial resources and huge government debt. To make a suitable policy to solve this problem is a top priority. Design/methodology/approach - Using the first-hand survey data, the paper compares nine sample counties whose economic development level is different, sums up the difficulties county-level governments are facing and explores countermeasures from qualitative and quantitative approaches. Findings - By studying the survey data of nine sample counties (cities), it is found that county-level finance is facing the following problems: low-level fiscal revenue, high debt risk and large gap of fiscal revenue between different counties (cities). Based on these findings, the paper provides suggestions such as ensuring that the county-level government has sufficient fiscal resources and improving the transfer payment system. Originality/value - Data from three well-developed counties (county-level cities), three middle-income counties (county-level cities) and three backward counties made the paper's findings more comprehensive and realistic and suggestions more practical.","[Ju, Ronghua] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Luo, Dan] Dev Res Ctr State Council, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Ju, RH (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",juronghua@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of the peasant household credit investigation system in Hubei RCCs and provide some evidence and ideas to the formulation of relevant policies. Design/methodology/approach - First, this paper briefly reviews the related literature of the efficiency in credit investigation system; second, the paper gives a brief description of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and designs the indicators for efficiency evaluation; third, the paper accounts data sources and processing methods; and finally, the paper performs the empirical analysis and draws a conclusion. Findings - The paper finds that the efficiency of the resource allocation in both regions is unoptimistic, the general efficiency is somewhat low, and it shows the trend of declination. The efficiency of pure technology in two regions represents the adverse trend. Every year's average scale efficiency in both regions is higher than the pure technology efficiency. Originality/value - The main contributions of this paper include the first use of DEA model to practically evaluate the efficiency of credit investigation system based on 54 samples of RCCs in Hubei Province and the horizontal and vertical comparisons of the results. The conclusions of this paper not only make the efficiency of credit investigation system in the province's 54 credit cooperatives comparable but also has a great application value to the. actual decision-making departments in formulating credit policies, and each credit cooperative in further building the credit investigation system according to its own conditions. Moreover, it has certain reference value to other similar studies.","[Xiong, Xueping; Tian, Jie] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Ruan, Hongxin] Peoples Bank China, Financial Res Dept, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University; People's Bank of China,"Xiong, XP (通讯作者)，Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",xxp@mail.hzau.edu.in,,,,,,,19,0,2,1,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The approach consists of determining yield gains from bean improvement research; applying these yield gain estimates to measure benefits attributable to different institutional players and time periods; and then assessing the benefit-cost ratios of investments in a bean improvement program since 1980 by Michigan State University (MSU). The results indicate that investments in MSU's bean breeding program have yielded benefits to costs ratio in the range of 0.7 to 2.2, depending on the attribution rule used to estimate the benefits. The estimated benefit/cost ratios reported in this study are lower-bound estimates, as they do not account for potential benefits from area planted to MSU varieties outside of Michigan (spillover effects), which was 1.5 times greater than the area planted to MSU-bred varieties within Michigan in the period 1998-2002. The implications of the increasingly privatized bean seed markets for the role of public sector research in bean improvement research are discussed.","[Maredia, Mywish K.; Bernsten, Richard] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Ragasa, Catherine] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA",Michigan State University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Maredia, MK (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 321 Agr Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",maredia@msu.edu,"Maredia, Mywish K./JZE-0332-2024","Maredia, Mywish K./0000-0002-3200-532X; Ragasa, Catherine/0000-0002-8033-0784",USAID [GDG-G-00-02-00012-00],USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),Financial support from the Bean/Cowpea Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP) under the USAID grant number GDG-G-00-02-00012-00 is acknowledged and greatly appreciated.

Findings suggest that continental migration has a positive relation and intercontinental migration no relation with technical efficiency. For continental migrant households, migration has removed surplus male labor, a cause for inefficiency in production. Intercontinental migration leads to a gender imbalance in the household, which cannot be compensated for by investments in farm equipment. The failure of intercontinental migration to transform cereal production from traditional to modern is attributed to an imperfect market environment.","IFPRI Dakar, Immeuble Ousseynou Thiam Gueye, Dakar, Senegal",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Wouterse, F (通讯作者)，IFPRI Dakar, Immeuble Ousseynou Thiam Gueye, Rue Thies,Point E,BP 15702 CP 12524, Dakar, Senegal.",f.wouterse@cgiar.org,,"Wouterse, Fleur/0000-0001-7186-9270",,,,,45,46,52,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Inertia in consumer demand enlarges retailers' gains in gross profits from raising prices in response to higher wholesale prices and reduces gains from decreasing prices in response to lower wholesale prices. Thus, consumption inertia can cause asymmetries in price transmission whereby retailers are more willing to change their prices, and change them more quickly, in response to wholesale price increases as opposed to wholesale price decreases.","[Xia, Tian; Li, Xianghong] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Xia, TA (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,"li, yue/HSF-7296-2023; li, yueyue/IVH-9846-2023",,,,,,55,12,12,1,19,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

Design/methodology/approach - Special attention is directed to the construction of confidence interval (Cl) for individual efficiency estimates using stochastic frontier production model. Findings - The results show that the coefficient of the regression monotonically and significantly increased output level, while returns-to-scale (RTS) of 0 943 suggest decreasing RTS in the study. An average point estimate of TE of 0 669 is obtained from the analysis Cl show that the TE intervals are quite wide, as the assumption that farms originally identified to be on the frontier, or very close to the frontier, by the point estimate may be below the frontier. Age and years of schooling of the farmers are efficiency-increasing policy variables found in the study. Originality/value - Contrary to the previous efficiency studies, the present study demonstrates that economic inferences drawn on the basis of Cl seem plausible to provide much more fruitful and insightful information about the TE of farms in the country, rather than the point estimation alone.","[Ogundari, K.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwichlung, Gottingen, Germany; [Amos, T.

Making use of the 1998-2001 Kyrgyz Household Budget Survey, we show that when the hypothesis of decreasing return to scale holds, the relation between the threshold value of revenue per hectare and the amount of land cultivated is positive. In addition, the relation between the threshold and the amount of land owned is positive in the case of continuous supply of land and negative when there is discontinuous supply of land. The direct consequence is that, in the first case, smaller farms will be more willing to rent land and exercise the option where, in the second case, larger farms will exercise first. The results suggest three main conclusions: (i) the combination of uncertainty and irreversibility is an important factor in land development decisions, (ii) farmer behavior is consistent with the continuous profit maximization model, and (iii) farming unit revenue tends to be positively related to farm size, once uncertainty is properly accounted for.","[Savastano, Sara] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Inst, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Scandizzo, Pasquale Lucio] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Dept SEFEMEQ, I-00133 Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Savastano, S (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Inst, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",sara.savastano@uniroma2.it,"Scandizzo, Pasquale/HIZ-8395-2022","Scandizzo, Pasquale/0000-0002-8824-3589; Savastano, Sara/0000-0002-9642-4195",,,,,34,15,15,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The method overcomes the lack of observed data on bilateral trade flows and accounts for differentiated goods by place of origin. We apply the derived random utility model to international trade in apples to identify the tariff equivalent of prohibitive phytosanitary barriers imposed by Australia on potential imports of New Zealand apples. We estimate the forgone apple trade between the two countries, the implied trade injury imposed by Australia on New Zealand, and the welfare loss to Australia.

Four possible agreements between Europe and Mercosur are simulated, including a broader multilateral agreement proposed in the G20. The results suggest that a bilateral scenario involving larger tariff rate quota increase, as called for by Mercosur, generates larger gains than accepting the European Union proposal of 2004 or further multilateral trade liberalization based on the G20 proposal. However, much larger increases in tariff rate quotas for all products are not necessarily justified in all cases.

This study examines the effect of nonlinear threshold dynamics on asymmetric price transmission for three U.S. dairy products (butter, cheese, and fluid milk) using threshold error correction models. The empirical result suggests that price transmission of changes between producer and retail stages of the marketing chain is asymmetric for butter and fluid milk, but not for cheese prices. Also, this paper's findings indicate that conclusions about price asymmetries depend on the model specification assumptions made about symmetry and threshold effects.

The focus is on the contribution of explanatory variables that represent transaction costs, risk-sharing incentives, or both. An empirical model of contract choice is tested against the 1999 Agricultural Economics and Land Ownership Survey (AELOS) and finds mixed evidence for low transaction cost and risk-sharing-incentive motives for landlord-tenant choices of a share versus cash-rent contract. However, the behavior of landlords and tenants is consistent with them being risk averse. Although it is standard to control for the riskiness of the principal's task that is contracted, we find that other attributes of the landlord are an important part of a relatively complex story for U.S. land tenancy contacting. The latter results have generally been ignored in other published landlord-tenant contracting studies.","[Fukunaga, Keita] Natl Econ Res Associates Inc, Tokyo, Japan; [Huffman, Wallace E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA USA",Iowa State University,"Fukunaga, K (通讯作者)，Natl Econ Res Associates Inc, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,Iowa Agriculture and Home Economics Experiment Station,Iowa Agriculture and Home Economics Experiment Station,Helpful comments were obtained from William Edwards and Mike Duffy and anonymous referees of the Journal.

Then a four-quadrant method is applied in this study, where trade specialization of agricultural products consists of 2D: labor-intensive and land-intensive. The study intends to test the changing routes of CA of agricultural products under the background of economic development and changing situation of factor endowments. Findings - The analysis result supports that economic development has impact on the trade mode of agricultural products.

The framework highlights that these choices should depend on the relative levels of private (or internal) net benefits, and public (or external) net benefits. Incentive-based mechanisms (polluter-pays and/or beneficiary-pays) and extension need to be targeted carefully to appropriate projects-where private net benefits are close to zero, and/or public net benefits are more extremely positive or negative. This article focuses on policy mechanisms that alter the net benefits of changing land management, including R&D to develop new technologies, and training to improve the skill of landholders at using existing technologies. These policy options are now treated more comprehensively within the public benefits: private benefits framework. Benefits of technology-change projects can include reductions in the opportunity cost of compliance with environmental programs, increases in the public benefits of a particular type of land-use change, or improvements in private net benefits, resulting in public benefits through greater or more rapid adoption by private landholders. From an environmental management perspective, technology development is most relevant where public net benefits of land use change are positive and private net benefits are negative, but not highly negative. There is a set of projects for which technology change is the only viable alternative to no action, highlighting the importance of technology change in these cases.","Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Pannell, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley 6009, Australia.",David.Pannell@uwa.edu.au,"Pannell, David/B-4476-2008","Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908",,,,,10,17,17,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Prior fertilizer demand studies have largely failed to account for the effects of government programs on farmers' commercial purchases. Using a double hurdle model and nationally representative rural household panel data in Zambia, we distinguish between these sources and measure the contemporaneous crowding in and crowding out effects of government input programs on commercial fertilizer sales. Where the private sector is relatively active and average wealth is higher (areas seemingly more likely to be targeted by government programs), results indicate that subsidies have substantially crowded out the private sector, in some cases to the point that such programs could actually lower overall fertilizer use. On the other hand, in poorer areas where the private sector is relatively inactive, subsidies help to generate demand and crowd in private sector retailers. Empirical studies explicitly modeling farmers' fertilizer purchase behavior within a dual marketing framework can provide important insights for agricultural policy discussions in developing countries.","[Xu, Zhiying; Burke, William J.; Jayne, Thomas S.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Govereh, Jones] Food Secur Res Project, Lusaka, Zambia",Michigan State University,"Jayne, TS (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jayne@msu.edu,"Burke, William J/AAI-9265-2020","Burke, William J/0000-0003-4961-2211",Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives; Republic of Zambia; USAID/Zambia; AID/Washington's Africa; Economic Growth and Agricultural Technology Bureaus through the Food Security III Cooperative Agreement at Michigan State University,Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives; Republic of Zambia; USAID/Zambia(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); AID/Washington's Africa; Economic Growth and Agricultural Technology Bureaus through the Food Security III Cooperative Agreement at Michigan State University,"Support for this study was provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Republic of Zambia, USAID/Zambia, and AID/Washington's Africa and Economic Growth and Agricultural Technology Bureaus through the Food Security III Cooperative Agreement at Michigan State University.",,32,68,89,2,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The results of the analysis indicate that the subsidy cost of permanently reducing carbon emissions by 26 per cent is a little over US$1 per metric tonne of carbon emissions abated.

This article examines the impact on production of an intervention in the Ecuadorian Sierra designed to improve returns to potato production through training and through linking smallholders to high-value markets. Critical to identifying the impact of the programme is the careful construction of a counterfactual and meticulous data collection. To assess the impact of the programme on production, a weighted estimation, where weights are constructed through propensity score matching, is employed to estimate a production function within a damage abatement framework. The function incorporates a series of interaction terms to assess the impact of the programme on the production technology. The findings provide evidence that the programme enhances yields both through a general shift in technology as well as increased input use. The results suggest that the use of effective farming techniques that are learned through the programme induce this technological shift.","[Cavatassi, Romina] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resource Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Salazar, Lina] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Strategy Dev Div, Washington, DC USA; [Gonzalez-Flores, Mario; Winters, Paul] American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Wageningen University & Research; Inter-American Development Bank; American University,"Cavatassi, R (通讯作者)，Food & Agr Org, Viale Terme di Caracalla, Rome, Italy.",romina.cavatassi@fao.org,"Winters, Paul/HKE-8169-2023; Cavatassi, Romina/IQX-1116-2023","Winters, Paul/0000-0001-9976-4534; Cavatassi, Romina/0000-0002-8600-5691",FAO-Netherlands Partnership Program (FNPP); FAO Norway Partnership Program (FNOP),FAO-Netherlands Partnership Program (FNPP); FAO Norway Partnership Program (FNOP),"This study was funded by FAO-Netherlands Partnership Program (FNPP) and FAO Norway Partnership Program (FNOP).

We find that technological spillovers are the key convergence force regardless of how the spillover effects are computed. At the same time, forces favoring convergence are almost offset by divergence forces (mainly scale or learning effects). This decomposition may explain the persistence of TFP growth rate differences in Italian agriculture, and could be applicable elsewhere.","Univ Politecn Marche Ancona Italy, Dept Econ, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",,"Esposti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche Ancona Italy, Dept Econ, Piazza Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",r.esposti@univpm.it,,"ESPOSTI, Roberto/0000-0002-1656-0331",,,,,69,25,25,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Further, the balance between consumption, available supply, and stocks seems to be as relevant for our understanding of these markets as it was decades ago.

Nevertheless, they are able to be innovative towards their products, processes, distribution channels, and geographical markets. Therefore, even for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the level of innovativeness can be high. The literature shows that the firm marketing capabilities are very important for innovation in the food industry, to guarantee that innovation reflects the market needs. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the relationship between the level of firm innovativeness and different steps of the marketing management process, to understand if good marketing capabilities can affect the firm innovativeness. An interactive questionnaire available on the web was used for the data collection. The survey was conducted on 468 European SMEs. Linear Regression was run to assess the link between marketing activities and the level of firm innovativeness. Our empirical analysis reveals that the SME marketing capabilities show significant and positive relationships with firm innovativeness.","[Banterle, Alessandro; Cavaliere, Alessia; Carraresi, Laura; Stranieri, Stefanella] Univ Milan, Dept Agr Food & Environm Econ, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Banterle, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Agr Food & Environm Econ, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",alessandro.banterle@unimi.it; alessia.cavaliere@unimi.it; laura.carraresi@unimi.it; stefanella.stranieri@unimi.it,"Carraresi, Laura/AAG-1718-2019; Cavaliere, Alessia/AGZ-9326-2022; Banterle, Alessandro/ACT-7678-2022","Carraresi, Laura/0000-0003-0081-6651; Cavaliere, Alessia/0000-0001-7164-4549; Stranieri, Stefanella/0000-0002-9936-8942; BANTERLE, ALESSANDRO/0000-0003-2301-5646",European Commission [FOOD-CT-2006-016264],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The paper was carried out within the research project Traditional United Europe Food (TRUEFOOD), which is an Integrated Project financed by the European Commission under the 6th Framework Programme for RTD.

The behaviour of business entities in agriculture is significantly influenced by the current support scheme and the level of support within the EU CAP but also by market conditions. The impacts of the particular scenarios on the changes of production indicate that Slovak agriculture will approach just slowly the 2008 production level. This will be decisively influenced by the price development. Despite of this, it is evident that the most favourable result can be achieved under the Flat Rate Scenario while the absolute abolition of direct payments (Liberal Scenario) will bring very unfavourable economic consequences with impacts on agricultural production in Slovakia.","Res Inst Agr & Food Econ, Bratislava 82480, Slovakia",,"Bozík, M (通讯作者)，Res Inst Agr & Food Econ, Trencianska 55, Bratislava 82480, Slovakia.",marian.bozik@vuepp.sk,,,,,,,8,5,6,0,11,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

It results from the low profitability of milk production on these farms and therefore the difficulties in reaching the income parity. It leads to a decline in the bovine population not compensated by an increase in the yield per animal and it poses a serious hazard to protecting the natural resources which is the function dairy farms perform in this region. The problem is serious since in the analyzed region, milk is acquired from 75% of farms keeping herds of up to 10 cows. Moreover, grasslands constitute a notably high share in the arable land structure, and for maintaining them cow keeping is a crucial condition. Hitherto functioning system of EU payments proved insufficient; therefore the Polish government intends to provide an additional financial support for dairy farms. The authors intended to reason that despite the hardly important participation of the analyzed regions in total milk production in Poland, an additional support for small and medium sized dairy farms from the state budget is socially necessary, in the first place because of the additional functions fulfilled by these farms.","[Krasnodebski, Andrzej] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Agr & Econ, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland",Agricultural University Krakow,"Krasnodebski, A (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Agr & Econ, Al Mickiewicza 21, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland.",rrkrasno@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Cieslik, Jerzy/H-2596-2019","Cieslik, Jerzy/0000-0002-0611-432X",,,,,12,0,0,0,10,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The research is important for Chinese public policy makers to find the reasons of retail price fluctuations and provides policy makers with the direction and rationale to intervene in retailing markets. Design/methodology/approach - This paper empirically applies dynamic oligopolistic competition model using Markov switching regression. The dataset used in this study includes 58 four-week-ending observations covering the period from March 1996 to July 2000 for three cities, Boston, Dallas, and Seattle. Findings - The empirical results illustrate the Markov switching regression not only successfully identifies the Markov perfect equilibrium in each market, but decomposes the retail price series into the corresponding equilibrium regimes. The forecasting power of the model is surprising so it can serve as a price monitor of the government. Additionally, the model reveals the different consumer welfare implications given different price regimes. The welfare analysis shows that consumers are most likely to be worse off through price fluctuations, while they are not always better off through a sticky (stable) price series in a market. Research limitations/implications - The first limitation of the paper is the retail price data is four-week ending. If a cycle evolves faster within four weeks, the model would overestimate the duration and underestimate the amplitude of cycles. So the study serves as an upper bound of the reality. The second limitation is the number of regimes. More than three regimes studied in a Markov switching regression may cause a series of empirical issues. However, if we integrate several regimes into one regime, we will lose rich information about the competitiveness of the markets. Practical implications - This paper is the first work to apply the dynamic pricing analysis to food industry by using fluid milk market as a case study. This paper empirically identifies four retail pricing regimes in fluid milk price series and evaluates the characteristics of the regimes. Social implications - This paper assesses the welfare implications of each pricing regime. The results show that the forecasting power of the model is strong in fluid milk retail market. Therefore, the study could serve as a price monitor to the public policymaker. Originality/value - This paper presents the first study to apply dynamic oligopolistic competition model to food marketing research.","[Zhu, Xinkai; Liu, Xiaoou] Renmin Univ, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Liu, XO (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xiaoou2010@gmail.com,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [20100303414],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China,"The research is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China 20100303414.",,32,0,0,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Such a setting is interesting when examining the increasing occurrence of multiple job-holdings among farmers in Western economies. Most existing analyses of off-farm labor supply only model the decisions of the farmer, not the joint decisions of the farm couple. This article presents a framework for handling such interrelated discrete/continuous choices, involving also farm production and household consumption. The derived two-equation sub-model for husband/wife's censored labor responses is estimated from a 10-year Norwegian panel data for 342 farms. The results agree to some extent with earlier studies, but are more informative because of the longer panels-which allows a more extensive examination of latent heterogeneity and behavioral persistence-because it provides cross-effects in the spouses' labor supplies. The results show some interesting differences between how the independent variables influence the labor supply of operator and spouse. This is most evident for the cross-effects of education, children, and wage rate. Overall, the results strongly support applying a panel-censoring model that accounts for latent heterogeneity in this context.","[Biorn, Erik] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Bjornsen, Hild-Marte] Norwegian Inst Urban & Reg Res, N-0349 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Biorn, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",erik.biorn@econ.uio.no,,,,,,,37,7,7,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

China has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world since late 1970s. GDP grew at about 10% annually in the past 30 years. China's experience shows the importance of both domestic and external policies in achieving sustainable growth. The results from this study provide significant policy implications to many countries that are currently China's major trade partners or those seeking greater economic and trade relations with China. The main conclusions on the implications of China's rapid economic growth are that China's growth will provide more opportunities than challenges to the rest of the world, on average.

The literature suggests that the effectiveness of liberalisation depends upon which of the three elements of a TRQ constrains imports. Most contributions assume perfect competition. This article uses an oligopoly two-stage capacity constrained model, in which the mode of competition is endogenous, to investigate the impact of different liberalisation options of TRQs, that is, the reduction in the in-quota and out-of-quota tariffs and the expansion of the quota. This article shows that consideration of the nature of competition between traders may provide unconventional conclusions about the effectiveness of the various TRQ liberalisation options; furthermore, the article shows how an increase in the number of rivals, under certain circumstances, may be more effective in increasing trade than reducing tariffs.","Univ Macerata, Dipartimento Studi Sviluppo Econ, Macerata, Italy",University of Macerata,"Scoppola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Macerata, Dipartimento Studi Sviluppo Econ, Macerata, Italy.",scoppola@unimc.it,,,"European Commission; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research","European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","Margherita Scoppola is Professor of Agricultural Economics, Dipartimento di studi sullo sviluppo economico, Universita di Macerata, Macerata, Italy.

A major methodological issue addressed is how to estimate price relationships when data contain intermittent structural breaks with unknown break dates. The adopted procedures endogenously search for structural break dates while explicitly accounting for this search in statistical inferences. Four breaks for the beef/cattle price relationship and three breaks for the pork/hog price relationship are identified. The estimation results further confirm the importance of allowing for structural breaks in the analysis of vertical price relationships.,"[Boetel, Brenda L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr Econ, River Falls, WI 54022 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Boetel, BL (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr Econ, River Falls, WI 54022 USA.",,,,Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station [MIN-14-057],Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station,"Brenda L.

An attempt is made in this article to estimate an Error Corrected Almost Ideal Demand System for four major cereals consumed in Kenya employing annual data from 1963 to 2005. This demand system performs well on both theoretical and empirical grounds. The symmetry and homogeneity conditions are supported by the data and the Le Chatelier principle holds. Empirically, all own-price elasticities are negative and significant at 5% level and irrespective of the time horizon, maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum may be considered as necessities in Kenya. While the expenditure elasticities of all four cereals are positive, they are inelastic both in the short run and in the long run. Finally, wheat and rice complement maize consumption in Kenya while sorghum acts as a substitute. Since cereal consumers have price and income inelastic responses, a combination of income and price-oriented policies could improve cereal consumption in Kenya.","[Sarker, Rakhal] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Nzuma, Jonathan M.] Univ Nairobi, Dept Agr Econ, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Guelph; University of Nairobi,"Sarker, R (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",rsarker@uoguelph.ca,"Nzuma, Jonathan/AAV-8401-2020",,"African Economic Research Consortium in Nairobi, Kenya; International Development Research Centre in Ottawa, Canada","African Economic Research Consortium in Nairobi, Kenya; International Development Research Centre in Ottawa, Canada","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support for data collection from the African Economic Research Consortium in Nairobi, Kenya, and the International Development Research Centre in Ottawa, Canada, through their Doctoral Research Awards programs.

The survey data are used to test the applicability of the One Case One Meeting system. Design/methodology/approach - Applying the Nash equilibrium and the nested game models, this paper analyzes the formation mechanism of the One Case One Meeting system. Based on the survey data, the zero-inflated Poisson regression model (ZIP) and the zero-inflated negative binomial regression model (ZINB) are applied to examine the impacts of the One Case One Meeting system on village-level public investment Findings - The results suggest that the One Case One Meeting system can be executed more effectively, provided that the following two conditions are both satisfied: first, acquaintance community; and second, election participants have the freedom to express their real opinions. The empirical results from the ZINB model show that the system has a significant positive impact on village-level public investment in production while the results from the ZIP model show that the system does not significantly affect village-level public investment in consumption. Originality/value - Based on the findings, the paper suggests that villages adopt the One Case One Meeting system for issues related to public investment in production, but does not suggest this model for issues related to public investment in consumption. In addition, it is necessary to enhance democratic consciousness in farmers' education and, in order to create more channels for village public investment in production, it is necessary to regulate the election system.","[Zhang, Guangsheng; Zhou, Mi] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China",Shenyang Agricultural University,"Zhang, GS (通讯作者)，Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China.",gshzhang@163.com,"Zhou, Mi/JJC-6514-2023; ZHANG, Guangsheng/I-5774-2015","Zhou, Mi/0000-0002-8932-1315; ZHANG, Guangsheng/0000-0003-1482-9429","National Natural Science Foundation of China [70773077, 70973082]; Program for Liaoning Excellent Talents in University [2008RC47]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Liaoning Excellent Talents in University,"This research is jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (70773077, 70973082) and supported by Program for Liaoning Excellent Talents in University (2008RC47).",,18,1,1,1,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

(Coping with Risk in Agriculture, 2004b) describe a procedure for determining an efficient set from among a set of random alternatives. This procedure, called stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF), is claimed to make the same assumption concerning the risk aversion measures as does stochastic dominance with respect to a function (SDRF). This is claim is incorrect. SERF imposes an additional requirement on the risk aversion measures of the decision makers. Both procedures assume a lower and an upper bound on risk aversion, but SERF also assumes that all risk aversion measures are of the same functional form as these lower and upper bound functions. This additional strong requirement on risk preferences implies that the efficient set identified under SERF is usually smaller than that identified using SDRF.","[Meyer, Jack] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Richardson, James W.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Schumann, Keith D.] Simetar Inc, College Stn, TX USA",Michigan State University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Meyer, J (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jmeyer@msu.edu,,,,,,,5,11,15,0,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

A simultaneous equation model for services and price competition is estimated with scanner data from fifteen supermarket chains using two alternative measures of services, namely store size and principal components of in-store services. Empirical results show that increasing services results in economies of scope, greater supermarket chain-level demand, lower price elasticity of demand, and enhanced market power, leading to higher milk prices and quantity sold. We conclude that, as result of service competition, supermarkets differentiate themselves from competitors and successfully attract less price-sensitive consumers.","[Bonanno, Alessandro] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lopez, Rigoberto A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Connecticut,"Bonanno, A (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,CSREES [2006-34178-17109],CSREES(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"The authors wish to thank the editor, Wally Thurman, two anonymous reviewers, Ronald Cotterill, Xenia Matschke, and participants of the 2006 NAREA and the 2007 AAEA annual meetings for their helpful comments that improved the manuscript.

Further, and as predicted by the theory of storage but previously unrecorded, the effects of housing starts shocks decline with lumber inventories.

Overall, we find a high level of external validity. Our specific results suggest that the nonhypothetical elicitation approaches, especially the nonhypothetical ranking method, outperformed the hypothetical choice experiment in predicting retail sales.

The need to account for respondents' preference heterogeneity in such models has motivated researchers in agricultural, environmental, health, and transport economics to apply random parameter logit and latent class models. In most of the published literature these models incorporate heterogeneity in preferences through the systematic component of utility. An alternative approach is to investigate heterogeneity through the random component of utility, and covariance heterogeneity models are one means of doing this. In this article we compare these alternative ways of incorporating preference heterogeneity in stated choice models and evaluate the sensitivity of estimated welfare measures to which approach is selected. We find that a latent class approach fits our data best, but all the models perform well in terms of out-of-sample predictions. Finally, we discuss what criteria a researcher can use to decide which approach is most appropriate for a given data set.","[Colombo, Sergio] IFAPA, Dept Agr Econ, Granada 18080, Spain; [Hanley, Nick] Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Louviere, Jordan] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Study Choice CenSoC, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Louviere, Jordan] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Mkt, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Stirling; University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Colombo, S (通讯作者)，IFAPA, Dept Agr Econ, Apdo 2027, Granada 18080, Spain.",scolombo@ugr.es,"Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012; Colombo, Sergio/IXD-1645-2023; Colombo, Sergio/D-2143-2011","Colombo, Sergio/0000-0001-7307-9811; Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499","U.K. Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","U.K. Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA))","We thank the U.K. Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for funding data collection for this article, and two referees for their extremely helpful comments on an earlier version of this article.",,65,118,132,1,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Findings - Results from this paper show that pork, the primary meat in Chinese diets, has become a necessity and that poultry, beef, mutton, and fish are considered luxuries within the meat budget allocation of Chinese households. Furthermore, the results predict that for any increase in future meat expenditure, the largest share of that increase will be allocated to pork consumption. Originality/value - This paper fills a gap currently present in the empirical literature regarding time series meat demand analysis in China.

The shift-share analysis is used. Different amount of subsidies according to the type of farming together with increasing subsidy rate may influence the type of farming. Therefore, it may cause a paradox that the structure of subsidies according to the type of farming will stimulate products that are currently suppressed.

Design/methodology/approach - In this paper it is argued that the Chinese official poverty line substantially misestimates the actual rural poverty situations. The poverty lines are derived with Ravallion's method with a rural household survey data of China's two provinces, Hubei, and Inner Mongolia. Poverty determinants using the derived as well as the other rural poverty lines are compared. Findings - The results indicate that the poverty lines derived from a pan-country level food bundle cannot fully reflect the regional poverty situation. Merely adjusting rural poverty lines at the country-level consumer price index without fully considering changes in the structure of food consumption and food prices with respect to different regions may also lead to wrong poverty estimates. The comparisons between the model regression results using the newly derived poverty lines with the alternative rural poverty lines suggest that the current literature uses the World Bank or the Chinese official rural poverty lines to assess how the rural poverty determinants might yield implausible policy implications. Practical implications - China needs to adjust the rural poverty lines with full consideration to the structure of food consumption and food prices with respect to different regions. Originality/value - It is indicated that the Chinese official poverty line substantially misestimates the actual rural poverty situations in China and this in turn affects the associated policy implications.","[Wang, Xiuqing; Liu, Juan; Xin, Xian] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Liu, Juan] Beijing Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Inst Agr Scientech Informat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yao, Shujie] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",China Agricultural University; Beijing Academy of Agriculture & Forestry Sciences (BAAFS); University of Nottingham,"Wang, XQ (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",wangxq@cau.edu.cn,,,International Development Research Centre of Canada (IDRC),International Development Research Centre of Canada (IDRC),"The work was carried out with the aid of a grant from the Poverty and Economic Policy (PEP) Research Network, financed by the International Development Research Centre of Canada (IDRC).

Based on data from 339 Minnesota school districts from 2001-2008, this research examined whether the NSLP's in-kind food program is an efficient and equitable way to fund school food services. Multivariate models suggested that the program is inefficient, though offered limited insight into district-level factors that affected utilization of commodity funding, and therefore offered less clear conclusions about equity. It was estimated that districts obtained just $0.60 in commodity food value given a $1 increase in available commodity funding over the years observed, and that the commodity program's system of reconciled and rollover funding accounted for much of this discrepancy. Based on these results, it is recommended that a cash benefit replace the NSLP's current in-kind food benefit for schools.","[Peterson, Cora; Le Grand, Julian] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,,c.peterson1@lse.ac.uk,"Peterson, Cora/AAU-2740-2021","Peterson, Cora/0000-0001-7955-0977",,,,,24,1,4,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

This study shows the effect of lCERs on the private owner's forest rotation intervals decision and carbon credit generation in afforestation and reforestation projects. A credit verification mechanism with a harvest penalty implemented under the lCERs policy distorts the timber harvesting decision and the corresponding carbon credit supply. Two opposing incentives are created by the lCERs mechanism which leads to either longer or shorter rotations compared to the Faustmann rotation, depending on which incentive prevails. Our numerical results show that both lCERs and tCERs seem to have similar impacts on harvesting incentives, but the resulting carbon supply differs among the instruments owing to the credit verification mechanism. The tCERs carbon supply curve is monotonically increasing in the carbon price, while a lCERs carbon supply is non-monotonic and may have a backward bending region over a range of carbon prices.","[Galinato, Gregmar I.; Olanie, Aaron; Yoder, Jonathan K.] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Uchida, Shinsuke] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Washington State University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Galinato, GI (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",ggalinato@wsu.edu,"Yoder, Jonathan K/F-4840-2011","Uchida, Shinsuke/0000-0002-2803-4734; Yoder, Jonathan/0000-0002-9049-9591",,,,,27,6,7,3,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Reported food safety expenditures appear relatively small (from < 1 to 7% of the value of production) but can erode profit margins for many firms. This article responds to claims that reported firm-level expenditures do not reflect true costs of compliance with food safety systems. We estimate incidental cost savings and uncounted costs associated with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) certification among Philippine seafood producers by modelling the interactions between conventional production and food safety expenditures using translog cost functions. Results indicate a significant underestimation of reported HACCP costs by an average of US$1.10 for a dollar of reported expenditure.","[Ragasa, Catherine] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Thornsbury, Suzanne; Joshi, Satish] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Michigan State University,"Ragasa, C (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",c.ragasa@cgiar.org,"Joshi, Satish/AAI-2470-2020","Joshi, Satish/0000-0003-3748-6940; Ragasa, Catherine/0000-0002-8033-0784; Thornsbury, Suzanne/0000-0002-8911-7920",Michigan State University Graduate School; Institute of International Agriculture; Philippine Institute for Development Studies,Michigan State University Graduate School; Institute of International Agriculture; Philippine Institute for Development Studies,"Catherine Ragasa is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), 2033 K Street, NW Washington, DC 20006, USA.

The standard CES monopolistic competition trade model and the gravity equation were used to estimate trade substitution elasticities, exploring their sensitivity to different estimation methods. Using these elasticities, we simulate the trade effect of the elimination of tariffs, dealing with the problem of uncertainty in the estimated values. Results point to a significant variation in the elasticities estimated by different econometric methods, suggesting that the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator significantly inflates their magnitude. Simulation results indicate that trade liberalisation will strongly increase food exports especially from high income and emerging countries, leading to a general loss of market share by developing countries. The simulated trade flows obtained from the econometric approach are quite close to current evidence based on computable general equilibrium models.","[Raimondi, Valentina; Olper, Alessandro] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Food Econ, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Raimondi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Food Econ, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",valentina.raimondi@unimi.it,"RAIMONDI, VALENTINA/AGY-1199-2022","RAIMONDI, VALENTINA/0000-0002-5431-7885","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Centre for Institutions and Economic Performance (LICOS) of the Catholic University of Leuven (KUL)","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Centre for Institutions and Economic Performance (LICOS) of the Catholic University of Leuven (KUL)","Valentina Raimondi and Alessandro Olper are based in the Department of Agriculture and Food Economics, Universita' degli Studi di Milano, via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milano, Italy.

Drought reduces real GDP in some small regions by up to 20 per cent. Irrigation water trading and farm factor movements alleviate losses. The drought results in an estimated 6000 jobs being lost across the southern basin. Depressed farm investment during drought results in farm capital not returning to baseline levels after drought.

It is claimed that the practice is unsustainable because shortened fallow lengths result in soils too degraded to support forest vegetation. The decline in fallow lengths is often attributed to increases in population density and greater market participation. The conventional wisdom makes several claims that are as yet unsubstantiated. This article investigates whether there is evidence to support two of these claims in southern Cameroon. First, using both cross-sectional and panel data, I find that there is indeed a robust negative association between fallow lengths and population density in the study area and weaker evidence for a negative relationship between fallow lengths and market participation. Second, a stochastic frontier production function approach is used to investigate the marginal contribution of fallow to output. Results indicate that fallow lengths are not low enough to be affecting yields and therefore do not appear to be resulting in declines in soil fertility. Thus overall, while some of the assumptions of the conventional wisdom appear to be true, there is little evidence to support its dramatic conclusion that shifting cultivators are causing deforestation in the forested region of Cameroon.","Clark Univ, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Ickowitz, A (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Dept Econ, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",aickowitz@clarku.edu,,"Ickowitz, Amy/0000-0002-0965-7661",,,,,48,7,9,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Based on specification tests we estimate a general spatial model to account for both spatial relationships among rental prices of neighbouring farmers and spatially autocorrelated error terms. A euro1 per hectare higher rental price in a farmer's neighbourhood coincides with a euro0.72 higher rental price paid by the farmer. The marginal incidence of EU per-hectare payments paid for eligible arable crop land on rental rates amounts to euro0.38 for each additional euro1 of premium payments. Regional livestock density, which is indirectly influenced by different policies, is also a major determinant of rental prices. Results are confirmed by sensitivity analyses. Consequently, German farmland rental rates are heavily influenced by agricultural policy instruments and therefore, these policies exhibit substantial distributional effects.","[Breustedt, Gunnar; Habermann, Hendrik] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Breustedt, G (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",gbreu-stedt@agric-econ.uni-kiel.de,,,Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes,Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes,"Both Gunnar Breustedt and Hendrik Habermann are with the Department of Agricultural Economics, University of Kiel, Olshausenstrasse 40, 24118 Kiel, Germany.

The development of employment in the target years will be characterised by the increased number of self-employed persons, the increased social polarisation between the owners of enterprises or managers and agricultural employees. The class of the socially degraded agricultural pensioners characterised by income deprivation will be formed.

Over the past five years, annual announcements have trumpeted rises in subsidies. Surprisingly, despite the historic turnaround of policy and the likely implication of this subsidy policy to China's grain economy, there has been no household-level survey-based research that has sought to understand the effect of China's subsidy programme on household behaviour. Using data from a national survey of more than 1000 households, we examine in detail a number of different dimensions of the subsidy programme. According to the survey-based findings, we have shown that although agricultural subsidies per farm are low, on per unit of cultivated area basis or total amount of budget, the subsidies are high. Almost all producers are receiving them. Subsidies are mostly being given to the land contractor, not the tiller. Most importantly, the subsidies appear to be nondistorting. No matter if we look at descriptive statistics in tables, scatter plots or regression analyses, there is no evidence that grain subsidies are distorting producer decisions in terms of grain area or input use decisions.","[Huang, Jikun; Wang, Xiaobing; Zhi, Huayong; Huang, Zhurong] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rozelle, Scott] KU, LICOS, Louvain, Belgium","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Stanford University; KU Leuven","Wang, XB (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xbwang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,", IAMO/G-2328-2012",,"Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX1-YW-09-04, KACX1-YW-0906, 2009S1-37]; Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe; European Community (SSPE) [044255]",Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe; European Community (SSPE),"The authors acknowledge the financial support of Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCX1-YW-09-04; KACX1-YW-0906; Visiting Professorship for Senior International Scientists, Grant No. 2009S1-37), Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe, and The European Community (044255, SSPE).",,13,116,126,2,93,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

One of the aspects, which globalization brings, is the social differentiation deepening between countries as well as across the particular countries. This phenomenon occurs in the Slovak Republic also as a consequence of the increasing households' income differentiation. It is logical to assume that the household's members who live in the different living conditions behave differently in the commodity and service market due to different preferences. The purpose of this article is to quantify the influence of the household income differentiation on their behaviour in the food market. This market is divided into five separated food market groups according to the Healthy Eating Pyramid. The share of the particular food groups' expenditures in the total household food expenditures is used as a representative of the household food purchase preferences. The results of the analysis did not confirm the assumption about the significant influence of the household income differentiation on the purchases of the particular food groups. The estimation of the Engel's expenditure functions and the food expenditures elasticities with respect to the income changes are used for quantification of the impact of the household income differentiation on the particular food groups' expenditures. The food expenditures elasticities referred to the income changes verified differences among the household behaviour in the food market. The food expenditures of the households with a higher income are less elastic regarding the income changes than the food expenditures of the households with a lower income.","[Zentkova, Iveta; Hoskova, Elena] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Zentková, I (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Econ, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",Iveta.Zentkova@uniag.sk; elenahoskova@yahoo.com,,,,,,,13,3,3,1,14,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

In 2008, food prices rose sharply in many countries, and global poverty and hunger levels increased quite markedly. The good news is that the agricultural supply response in many countries was also strong. The impacts of the financial crisis on poor countries have yet to fully roll out, but it is clear that more people have fallen into poverty and more are suffering from hunger. Lastly, there are strong indications that the global food system is fundamentally changing in a number of dimensions. Biofuels are here to stay, and energy and food prices appear to have adjusted to a higher equilibrium and will in turn raise the prospects of renewed volatility in agricultural commodity markets. Trade protection has also resurfaced, but so have renewed investments in agriculture.

Based on historical data for the period of 1977-2005, the empirical results show that both R&D and climate change matter for long-run productivity growth. The long-run elasticity of total factor productivity (TFP) with respect to R&D expenditure is 0.497, while that of climate change is 0.506. There is a unidirectional causality running from R&D expenditure to TFP growth in both the short run and long run. Further, the variance decomposition and impulse response function confirm that a significant portion of output and productivity growth beyond the sample period is explained by R&D expenditure. These results justify the increase in R&D investment in the deteriorating climatic condition in the agricultural sector to improve the long-run prospects of productivity growth.","[Salim, Ruhul A.] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA, Australia; [Islam, Nazrul] Curtin Univ, Grad Sch Business, Perth, WA, Australia",Curtin University; Curtin University,"Salim, RA (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA, Australia.",Ruhul.salim@cbs.curtin.edu.au,"Islam, Nazrul/AAO-9069-2020","Islam, Nazrul/0000-0002-9276-8388",,,,,51,40,43,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In contrast to previous studies, firm heterogeneity is explicitly considered through the novel integration of efficient techniques for the calibration and decomposition of large optimisation models. Nitrogen fertiliser application should not be targeted by policy given its minor role in determining emissions. In contrast, livestock intensity is an appropriate base for regulation given its strong correlation with pollutant load. Abatement cost increases as stocking rate declines, but this can be offset at low levels of regulation through utilising slack feed resources to improve per-cow milk production. Both uniform and differentiated input standards based on livestock intensity achieve substantial decreases in pollutant load at moderate cost. However, because of disparity in the slopes of abatement cost curves across firms, a differentiated policy is more cost-effective at the levels of regulation required to achieve key societal goals for improved water quality.","[Doole, Graeme J.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Western Australia; University of Waikato,"Doole, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",gdoole@waikato.ac.nz,,"Doole, Graeme/0000-0002-6293-6491",,,,,41,27,28,0,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

The model incorporates the uncertainty in producers' expectations about future returns and about the impact of policy changes on these expectations in particular. We demonstrate that a new policy which favours organic can have opposing effects on the rate of conversion. An increase in relative returns to organic today will increase conversion rates. However, if the future of the policy programme is uncertain, its introduction can increase the value of waiting to switch, which will decrease conversion rates. We then develop an empirical switching regression model that enables direct estimation of the value associated with being able to postpone the conversion decision until some of the uncertainty is resolved. The model is applied to data on organic and conventional soybeans before and after major changes in US farm policy toward organic growers. The results suggest that sunk costs associated with conversion to organic coupled with uncertainty about future returns can help to explain why there is so little organic farmland in the USA.","[Kuminoff, Nicolai V.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wossink, Ada] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Manchester,"Kuminoff, NV (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Main Campus,POB 873806, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",kuminoff@asu.edu; ada.wossink@manchester.ac.uk,"Wossink, G.

Since regional differences cannot be explained by the occurrence of the target pest alone, we assume that under the given regulatory framework for genetically modified (GM) crop production in Germany, farm structures as well as the sociopolitical environment have also influenced regional adoption rates during the past years. Following a description of the relevant legal and economic framework in Germany, we develop theoretical hypotheses for regional variation in Bt maize adoption and test them econometrically with unique data at the federal state (Laender) and county (Landkreis) level. According to our analysis at the federal state level, the maize acreage per farm is the main driver of Bt maize adoption. In addition, there are signs that public opposition to GM cultivation as measured by membership in the German Friends of the Earth association significantly dampens GM cultivation. At the level of Brandenburg counties, the regional infestation frequency of the European Corn Borer, the target pest of Bt-Maize, is the major determinant of adoption. Although Bt maize is a scale-neutral technology for controlling damages caused by the Corn Borer, additional fixed costs due to regulation make the technology scale dependent.","[Consmueller, Nicola; Beckmann, Volker] Humboldt Univ, Div Resource Econ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Beckmann, Volker] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Chair Environm Econ, D-03013 Cottbus, Germany; [Petrick, Martin] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Dept External Environm Agr & Policy Anal, D-06120 Halle, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Consmüller, N (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Div Resource Econ, Philippstr 13, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",nicola.consmueller@agrar.hu-berlin.de,"Petrick, Martin/AAI-1154-2020; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Beckmann, Volker/Q-7377-2018","Beckmann, Volker/0000-0001-6595-7995",,,,,19,15,17,2,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The primary data source are obtained from the European Union survey project - Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). Our reference period, in view of the data availability at the time of the article processing, is represented by the year 2007. The core studied variable is represented by the volume of the income calculated for each household. The information obtained by the study of this variable was complemented by other variables enabling the logical validity check and analysis of the socioeconomic environment of households under examination. The main findings and conclusions are derived from the analysis of the decile and quintile classification of the relevant equivalized income data. The prime goal of the study was to quantify the share of the Czech agriculture related households living in the monthly income lower than 60% of the nationwide median value of the income variable under consideration. The households identified with such income position are referred to as the households-at-risk-of-income poverty. The results are calculated per 1 physical household member, which the authors found more illustrative and easy to understand. The household size equalization procedures according to the EU and the OECD methodology will follow.

We show that the pattern of shares is best explained as a response to moral hazard problems spread over large numbers of inputs. A contracting model explains the pattern of shares, the difference in flexibility with cash rent contracts, and the lower bound on shares. Empirical analysis using micro data on over 3,000 contracts are used to test implications of the model.

This article examines the statistical link between food aid shipments and food prices in Ethiopia over the period 1996-2006. Monthly data from three markets and three commodities are used to estimate a system of seemingly unrelated regression models for food prices. Results indicate that previous year food aid shipments reduce prices in all producer and consumer markets. These effects, however, appear to be limited to the set of internationally traded commodities that are domestically marketed. A recursive regression procedure is used to identify the food aid threshold at which a negative aid effect emerges. Food aid shipments that constitute less than 10% of domestic production appear to be benign, but shipments above this level show signs of being disruptive to local markets. We use a simple policy simulation to argue that production-sensitive targeting, e.g., conditioning food aid on local food production, would help to circumvent disincentive effects.","[Tadesse, Getaw] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Resource Management, As, Norway; [Shively, Gerald] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Indiana, PA USA",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Tadesse, G (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Resource Management, As, Norway.",,,,"Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Bureau of Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade,; U.

This study uses longitudinal farm survey data to estimate maize yield response functions in a relatively high-potential zone of Zambia to determine the profitability of fertilizer use under a range of small-farm conditions found within this zone. The theoretical framework used in this study incorporates agronomic principles of the crop growth process. We generalize the asymmetric production models and define a concept of yield scaling factors. The model distinguishes different roles of inputs and non-input factors in crop production. We estimate the effects of conventional production inputs as well as of household characteristics and government programs on maize yield. The results indicate that recommended fertilizer application rates in the two specific years were often unprofitable, given observed price conditions and the yield response to fertilizer. However, there was substantial variability in yield response to fertilizer based upon the rate of application, the timeliness of fertilizer availability, the use of animal draught power during land preparation, and whether the household incurred the death of an adult member in the past three years. These modifying factors, as well as variations in input and output prices due to proximity to roads and markets, substantially affected the profitability of fertilizer use on maize.","[Guan, Zhengfei; Jayne, T.

To a lesser extent, they have also been promoted to enhance the management of herbicide-resistant weeds. No previous economic analysis of perennial pasture has considered both of these benefits. This study combines a dynamic linear programming model to estimate the magnitude of salinity-related benefits and a complex simulation model to assess the economics of herbicide-resistance management. We present a case study of the perennial pasture lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) in the Wheatbelt of Western Australia, where the weed annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaudin) is resistant to multiple herbicide groups. Sequences incorporating lucerne are the most profitable land use at the standard set of parameter values if (i) annual ryegrass is resistant to all selective herbicides, (ii) the water table is so shallow (approximately < 3.5 m deep) that frequent rotation with perennials is required to avert soil salinisation, (iii) sheep production is highly profitable, or (iv) there is a combination of less extreme cases. The value of perennial pasture is sufficient under these circumstances to overcome its high establishment cost and the displacement of multiple years of crop. Consideration of dryland salinity and herbicide resistance are about equally important in evaluating the economics of lucerne; neither should be neglected.","[Doole, Graeme J.; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Doole, Graeme J.; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Cooperat Res Ctr CRC Plant Based Management Dryla, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.] CRC Australian Weed Management, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Waikato; University of Western Australia,"Doole, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",gdoole@cyllene.uwa.edu.au,"Pannell, David/B-4476-2008","Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; Doole, Graeme/0000-0002-6293-6491",,,,,21,6,6,0,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the essential reasons of this issue in theoretical and empirical perspectives. Design/methodology/approach - The paper develops the model of derived demand for petroleum in agro-production; analyzes the effect on agricultural labor-machinery due to the changes in relative price of input factors; and reveals the reasons for the rigid growth of the demand for farm diesel; as well as estimates the substitution of agricultural machine for labor. Findings - The results indicate that the rigid growth characteristic of the demand for farm diesel is due to the adjustment of the product and factor markets; and the most important reason is the changes in structure of the agro-production inputs caused by the relative soaring price of agricultural labor-machinery. Practical implications - The government should attach importance to its impact on farmers and take effective measures to insure the stable development of agricultural production. Originality/value - This research investigates the main reasons for the rigid growth characteristic of demand for oil in China's agro-production from a novelty perspective. The proposed conceptual model is unique, it analyzes the substitution of agricultural mechanical for labor from the perspective of changes in relative price, and selects the two level constant elasticity substitution production functions to estimate the substitution of agricultural machinery for labor.","[Wang, Lihong; Tian, Zhihong] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Tian, ZH (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",cautzh@cau.edu.cn,,,,,,,24,0,1,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Comprehensive bioeconomic modelling frameworks are increasingly needed to assist in the resolution of import access disputes. However, frameworks that combine welfare analysis attributable to trade and invasive species spread management are lacking. This study provides a demonstration of how a comprehensive economic framework, which takes into account both the gains from trade and the costs of invasive species outbreaks, can inform decision-makers when making quarantine decisions. We develop a partial equilibrium trade model considering international trade and combine it with a stratified dispersal model for the spread and management of potential outbreaks of an invasive species. An empirical estimation is made of the economic welfare consequences for Australia of allowing quarantine-restricted trade in New Zealand apples to take place. The results suggest the returns to Australian society from importing New Zealand apples are likely to be negative. The price differential between the landed product with SPS measures in place and the autarkic price is insufficient to outweigh the increase in expected damage resulting from increased fire blight risk.

The problems of semi-subsistence farms are low cash incomes and incidence of poverty, sub-optimal use of land and labour, a lack of capital and poor contribution to rural growth. However, they play an important welfare function in some rural areas in Europe; they manage more than 11 million ha of agricultural land and deliver ecosystem services. The Common Agricultural Policy will have to accommodate this now widespread production system, through existing or new policy packages. Particularly important is support for commercialisation to incentivise and smooth the transition to commercial agriculture, and agri-environmental payments to compensate the semi-subsistence farmers for the provision of ecosystem services.","Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Davidova, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England.",S.M.Davidova@kent.ac.uk,,"Davidova, Sophia/0000-0001-8653-8191",European Network for Rural Development,European Network for Rural Development,"Sophia Davidova is a Professor of European Agricultural Policy at the University of Kent, School of Economics, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, UK.

This article contributes to this line of research by building up composite indicators for different facets-social, economic, environmental, and global-of farm sustainability using a methodological approach that combines data envelopment analysis (DEA) and multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods, and assigns common weights to each individual sustainability indicator. This approach is applied to a database of 163 farms located in the Campos County, a region belonging to the dry lands of the Spanish Northern Plateau, using 12 individual indicators of sustainability. Our findings show that both economic and environmental composite sustainability indicators are positively correlated, but that this is not the case for the social indicator. We also check the influence of a set of variables on farm sustainability using bootstrapping statistical techniques, and showing that increasing farm size, membership in agricultural cooperatives and farmers' medium and upper agricultural-specific technical education, all exert a significant positive influence on sustainability. These results provide clues for policy makers that intend to design sustainability-increasing structural agricultural policies.","[Reig-Martinez, Ernest; Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J.] Univ Valencia, Dpto Econ Aplicada 2, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Reig-Martinez, Ernest] IVIE, Valencia 46020, Spain; [Gomez-Limon, Jose A.] Inst Andaluz Invest & Formac Agr & Pesquera, Dpto Econom Agr, Cordoba 14080, Spain",University of Valencia,"Reig-Martínez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dpto Econ Aplicada 2, Campus Dels Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain.",Ernest.reig@uv.es,"GÓMEZ-LIMÓN, José A./B-8247-2011; Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J/C-2545-2011","GÓMEZ-LIMÓN, José A./0000-0002-6364-0027; Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J/0000-0002-7129-5606; Reig-Martinez, Ernest/0000-0001-5036-8880","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2008-05908-C02-02/ECON]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [AGL2010-17560-C02-01, 02/AGRI]; PROMETEO (Generalidad Valenciana)",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)); PROMETEO (Generalidad Valenciana),The authors would like to express their gratitude to the anonymous reviewers.

Analytical approaches are often intractable. As an alternative, we propose a computational economics approach to analyze a general spatial competition model and study firms' choices of spatial pricing policy. Instead of the commonly presumed free-on-board pricing, we find that buyers choose price discrimination, either through uniform delivered pricing or through partial freight absorption.","[Graubner, Marten] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA USA",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); University of California System; University of California Davis,"Graubner, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany.",,"Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; Balmann, Alfons/E-6870-2011; , IAMO/G-2328-2012","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; Graubner, Marten/0000-0002-3096-0702","German Research Foundation (DFG) [BA-1654/11-1, BA-1654/12-1]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Financial support by the German Research Foundation (DFG, Project Reference No. BA-1654/11-1 and BA-1654/12-1) is gratefully acknowledged.",,61,32,39,2,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The usual first-order welfare approximation formula is extended to a second-order formula that allows for supply and demand responses to the price change. Results show that many rural households are not affected greatly by the price change, and there are about as many gainers as losers. However, these full sample results mask important differences across regions. Welfare gains generally take place in major production areas while losses are in areas where most households are net buyers of maize. Semiparametric methods are used to investigate the relationship between income and the size of the welfare effect, and poverty dominance techniques are applied to study the impacts of the maize price increase on rural poverty.","[Mghenyi, Elliot] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Myers, Robert J.; Jayne, T.

Various measures are prescribed under the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPS) agreement of the World Trade Organization. In order to prevent the spread of trans-boundary cattle diseases, the SPS agreement recommends the establishment of Disease-Free Zones (DFZs). These have been implemented successfully in some major beef-exporting countries, but in Kenya are still at a pilot stage. To understand Kenyan farmers' preferences on the type of DFZ that would be readily acceptable to them, a choice experiment was conducted using a D-optimal design. Results show that farmers would be willing to pay to participate in a DFZ where: adequate training is provided on pasture development, record keeping and disease monitoring; market information is provided and sales contract opportunities are guaranteed; cattle are properly labelled for ease of identification; and some monetary compensation is provided in the event that cattle die due to severe disease outbreaks. Preferences for the DFZ attributes are shown to be heterogeneous across three cattle production systems. We also derive farmers' preferences for various DFZ policy scenarios. The findings have important implications for policy on the design of DFZ programmes in Kenya and other countries that face similar cattle disease challenges.","[Otieno, David Jakinda; Ruto, Eric; Hubbard, Lionel] Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Otieno, DJ (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",d.j.otieno@ncl.ac.uk,,"Ruto, Eric/0000-0001-7318-0688",Commonwealth Scholarship Commission (CSC),Commonwealth Scholarship Commission (CSC),"David Jakinda Otieno is a PhD candidate in the School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK.

Oligopsonists are hypothesized to follow a discontinuous pricing strategy in equilibrium, and we focus on shocks in the normal throughput of supply as a potential catalyst for regime switching between cooperative and noncooperative phases. We adopt an algorithm developed by Bellone (2005) that relies on Hamilton's (1989) multivariate first-order Markov process to test for the cooperative/noncooperative switching behavior. We find strong evidence that links switching conduct by packers to disruptions in coordinating the derived demands for processed beef with the supply of live cattle. Once switched, cooperative regimes lasted an average of 21 weeks, while noncooperative regimes averaged 33 weeks. The average marketing margin for processed beef was 68% lower in the noncooperative regimes compared to the cooperative regimes. This led to an annual average increase in profits of 408 million dollars to the beef packing industry and about an 8-9% reduction in live cattle prices.","[Koontz, Stephen] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, B-324 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Cai, Xiaowei] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Agribusiness, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Stiegert, Kyle] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Colorado State University; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Koontz, S (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, B-324 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",kwstiegert@wisc.edu,,"Stiegert, Kyle/0000-0001-6835-6132","Food System Research Group at the University of Wisconsin, Madison","Food System Research Group at the University of Wisconsin, Madison","The authors thank Gerald Shively and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments that greatly improved the article.

This study applies dynamic spatial panel data regression models to yields and prices of four major food crops across regions of Burkina Faso and Niger, over sample periods between 1984 and 2006. Results lend support to mainly simultaneous spatial spillovers, particularly for millet and cowpea prices and sorghum yields in Niger, and maize yields in Burkina Faso. After accounting for these effects, most crop yields are found to be weakly price-responsive, as envisaged by a supply-side geographical diffusion hypothesis. Seasonal rainfall elasticity estimates suggest that dominant food crops have slight advantage margins in terms of relative resilience to rainfall shortages. However, this result is to be weighed against low millet yields in Niger, and marked drops in sorghum yields during officially declared droughts in Burkina Faso.","UKSW Card S Wyszynski Univ, Dept Informat & Econometr, Warsaw, Poland",,"Mainardi, S (通讯作者)，UKSW Card S Wyszynski Univ, Dept Informat & Econometr, Warsaw, Poland.",smainardi@interia.pl,,"Mainardi, Stefano/0000-0002-4684-9857",,,,,69,12,13,0,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This situation is part of a long-term structural problem: decades of under-investments in agricultural sector and poor policies of support for smallholder farmers who form the bulk of the farming population. The inability of these farmers to achieve a supply response when commodity prices were high and market access was less of a problem suggests that there are multiple sets of binding constraints that continue to limit the potential of agricultural growth to reduce food security and poverty on the continent. This article reviews some of the historical trends that have hampered the performance of the agriculture sector. In addition, it reviews the impacts of more positive trends that could stimulate agricultural growth in Africa that could change the African agricultural landscape. The article however warns that there are more recent global developments and some continental challenges that could prevent or slow agricultural growth. These include the global financial crisis, public sector investments, inequities in global agricultural development policies, rush for agricultural lands by foreign investors, domestic commercial financing markets, climate change, and emerging carbon markets. The article argues that while opportunities for accelerated growth exists for African agriculture, new sets of policy instruments will be needed to support smallholder farmers to access new agricultural technologies, finance, reduce impacts of climate change, and adopt sustainable land use practices that can allow them to benefit from emerging global carbon markets.","AGRA, Nairobi, Kenya",,"Adesina, AA (通讯作者)，AGRA, Nairobi, Kenya.",,,,,,,,22,16,19,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Adequate modeling should include and combine elements, such as strategic interactions among economic agents, nonconvexities induced by nonlinear feedbacks, separate spatial and temporal scales and modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics, and allowance of alternative time scales. Ignoring these characteristics might obscure very important features that we observe in reality, such as bifurcations and irreversibilities or hysteresis. As a consequence, the design of policies that do not take CAS characteristics into account might lead to erroneous results and undesirable states of managed economic-ecological systems.","Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Xepapadeas, A (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, 76 Patission St, Athens 10434, Greece.",,"Xepapadeas, Anastasios/ABH-3240-2020",,,,,,45,8,8,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We examine the contribution of sustainable land management (SLM) practices to net value of agricultural production in areas with low vs. high agricultural potential. A combination of parametric and non-parametric estimation techniques is used to check result robustness. Both techniques consistently predict that minimum tillage (MT) is superior to commercial fertilisers (CFs), as are farmers' traditional practices (FTPs) without CFs, in enhancing crop productivity in the low agricultural potential areas. In the high agricultural potential areas, in contrast, use of CFs is superior to both MT and FTPs without CFs. The results are found to be insensitive to hidden bias.

To this end, we carry out an empirical estimation of urban water demand in Zaragoza (Spain) distinguishing between households with different sizes using data at the individual level. As far as we are aware, this approach to urban residential water demand is new in the literature. The analysis suggests that all households are sensitive to prices regardless of size.

Also several methods of estimation of the cost function's parameters are elaborated in the literature. But all these methods are based on the past data taken from the financial accounting while the financial accounting is not able to separate the fixed and variable costs and it is also strongly adjusted to taxation in the many companies. As a tool of the managerial decision making support, the cost functions should provide a vision to the future where many factors of risk and uncertainty influence economic results. consequently, these random factors should be considered in the construction of cost functions, especially in the long-run. in order to quantify the influences of these risks and uncertainties, the authors submit the application of the Bayesian Theorem.","[Beranova, Michaela; Martinovicova, Dana] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Beranová, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",beranova@node.mendelu.cz; martinov@node.mendelu.cz,,,,,,,21,5,5,0,11,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Based on the study of large amount of local (Slovak) and foreign literature and other sources, we have analyzed and compared many (often inconsistent and contradictory) approaches and opinions of Slovak and foreign authors related to outsourcing and offshoring. Following the questionnaire survey which we performed in years 2008 and 2009 on the sample of 51 Slovak companies, and as well as on the set of interviews carried out with managers and employees of these companies, we have identified several weaknesses in the outsourcing decision-making and also in the management of outsourcing projects. These weak points are connected with the insufficient assessment of risks resulting from outsourcing and managing these risks, rather than with an inadequate monitoring of outsourcing provider and an insufficient measurement of outsourcing efficiency. We have elaborated the standardized methodology, which can be used in decision making, implementation and management of outsourcing. In more details, we focus on the areas that show the gaps in the applied management and in the available theory: on risk management in the case of outsourcing and on measurement of outsourcing efficiency.","[Milecova, Miroslava] UniCredit Bank, Milan, Italy; [Milecova, Miroslava; Grznar, Miroslav; Szabo, Luboslav] Univ Econ, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",UniCredit Group; University of Economics Bratislava,"Milecová, M (通讯作者)，UniCredit Bank Slovakia As, Sancova 1, Bratislava 81333, Slovakia.",miroslava.milecova@unicreditgroup.sk; mirog@euba.sk; szabo@euba.sk,,,,,,,11,4,5,1,47,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

A farm system that has inter-year crop dynamics, but lacks inter-annual water storage capabilities, is used as a case study to demonstrate that dynamics unrelated to large reservoirs or groundwater can necessitate a multiyear model to estimate drought's impact. Results demonstrate the importance of analysing individual years of drought in the context of previous and future years of drought.","[Peck, Dannele E.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Adams, Richard M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",University of Wyoming; Oregon State University,"Peck, DE (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",dpeck@uwyo.edu,,"Peck, Dannele/0000-0001-5464-8097",,,,,35,27,28,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Supplementary results indicate that interest is equal between planting, cultivating, and harvesting Furthermore, results suggest that farmers are willing to adopt new ideas, and where possible action has already been taken to self-insure through diversification and other means. Research limitations/implications - This research is based on primary data gathered in China. However, the authors are limited in the access to Chinese weather station data to illustrate how weather insurance operates. Instead, the authors use weather data from the weather station in Ashland. Kansas which has similarities to the wheat growing regions of China While the example is for illustrative purposes only, the authors cannot claim that it actually represents premiums that might actually be found in China Practical implications - The Chinese Government has within the past year authorized an investigation into agricultural Insurance. The burst of research and applications of weather insurance in both developed and developing countries suggest that a wide array of applications could be feasible in China The results are encouraging because they suggest that farmers in China would have an Interest in purchasing weather insurance. Originality/value - The authors believe that this is the first study conducted on weather insurance in China. The survey instrument is designed to specifically determine what weather risks are important to Chinese farmers and the interest that farmers would have in using such a product.","[Turvey, Calum G.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kong, Rong] NW A&F Univ, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Cornell University; Northwest A&F University - China,"Turvey, CG (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",cgt6@cornell.edu,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020","Turvey, Calum/0000-0001-5812-2957",W.I.

In many countries, the exclusion of small producers from so-called dynamic marketing channels (that is, remunerative ones) has become a concern. Based on data collected in Turkey in 2007 at the producer and the wholesale market levels, we show that intermediaries are important to understanding the impact of downstream restructuring (supermarkets) on upstream decisions (producers). Results show first that producers are not aware of the final buyer of their produce, because intermediaries hinder the visibility of the marketing channel, thereby restricting a producer's choice to that of the first intermediary. Econometric results show that producers who are indirectly linked to the supermarkets are more sensitive to their requirements in terms of quality and packaging than to the price premia compensating the effort made to meet standards. Therefore, the results lead us to question the role of the wholesale market agents who act as a buffer in the chain and protect small producers from negative shocks, but who stop positive shocks as well, and thereby reduce incentives.","[Bignebat, Celine] INRA, UMR MOISA 1110, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Koc, Ahmet Ali] Adkeniz Univ, Dep Econ, Antalya, Turkey; [Lemeilleur, Sylvaine] CIRAD UMR MOISA 1110, F-34060 Montpellier, France",INRAE; Akdeniz University; CIRAD,"Bignebat, C (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR MOISA 1110, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",bignebat@supagro.inra.fr,,"Lemeilleur, Sylvaine/0000-0003-4855-7644",Regoverning Markets program,Regoverning Markets program,"The authors thank the Regoverning Markets program for funding and scientific support.

As such, they are competing with small grocery and convenience stores they sell inputs to. A review of the industry suggests that there are important economies of size in distribution, but that smaller stores offering convenience face a more inelastic demand. Concerns over the survival of smaller stores in Quebec have motivated two types of regulations. The first type aims at reducing the cost advantage of dominant retailers by restricting the number of employees that they are allowed to use during specific time periods. The second type restricts retail prices. We develop a simple model capturing the main features of the industry to ascertain the impact of these regulations on retail and wholesale prices.

Using a linear equilibrium displacement model, we find evidence that, when the producer group is allowed to control quota levels, an input quota policy entails a smaller absolute deadweight loss than an output quota policy. This finding suggests that if producer groups are allowed to resort to production-distorting instruments to limit output, they will make production choices that are less costly for society than if they had been allowed to directly control output levels.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Mérel, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,French ministry of agriculture,French ministry of agriculture,"The author thanks Richard Sexton, Colin Carter, Daniel Sumner, Julian Alston, Walter Thurman, and an anonymous referee for helpful comments.

This article considers the design of optimal demand management and supply augmentation policies for urban water. In particular, scarcity pricing is considered as a potential alternative to the predominant demand management policy of water restrictions. A stochastic dynamic programming model of an urban water market is developed based on data from the ACT region. Given a specification of the demand and supply for urban water state dependent optimal price and investment policies are estimated. The results illustrate how the optimal urban water price varies inversely with the prevailing storage level and how the optimal timing of investment differs significantly between rain dependent and rain independent augmentation options.","[Hafi, Ahmed; Goesch, Tim] Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",,"Hughes, N (通讯作者)，7B London Circuit,GPO Box 1563, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",neal.hughes@abare.gov.au; ahmed.hafi@abare.gov.au; tim.goesch@abare.gov.au,,"Hughes, Neal/0000-0002-3959-3830",,,,,23,22,24,2,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The way in which the industry policy has manifested from central to local levels of government is outlined along with how the industry policy relates to other measures intended to improve household livelihoods. Findings - The outcomes of this forage-livestock industry policy do not always match the intention, and the paper examines the various disconnects that arise between government agencies, government and households and households and the market. The foremost challenge for policy makers is in connecting households and markets.

The extent of trade specialization exhibits a declining trend in the country. It has lost comparative advantage for a number of product groups over time. The indices of specialization have tended to converge. For the particular product groups, the indices display a greater variation. They are stable for the product groups with comparative disadvantage, but the product groups with strong comparative advantage show a significant variation.

Production economics reveals that producers will not maximize animal welfare, even if animal well-being is highly correlated with output. Welfare economics raises thorny issues about the double-counting of benefits when humans exhibit altruism towards animals, while public economics uncovers potential market failures and possible solutions. Consumer economics provides a means of determining human and animal benefits from animal well-being policies in dollar terms. Overall, economists have much to contribute to the animal welfare debate and the well-being of humans and animals could be improved with more economic analysis on the effects of private and government actions related to animal welfare.","[Lusk, Jayson L.; Norwood, F.

Using a sample of 337 Ontario dry red wines, we construct both parametric and semiparametric hedonic pricing models. We find that our semiparametric model yields a superior fit to its parametric counterpart. We also estimate separate hedonic price functions for higher and lower priced wines which indicate that the term Reserve on the label and the vintage year information are important for consumers of lower priced wines whereas these attributes are not important for consumers of higher priced wines. Unlike other studies, we include both environmental and quantity variables resulting in improved fits. Thus, our results suggest that future studies should consider semiparametric hedonic pricing models and include both the quantity and environmental variables in the analysis. Finally, our results indicate that Canadian consumers for the most part look for the same attributes in wine as their counterparts in other countries do but they also look at the viticulture techniques used in the cultivation of the grapes.","[Kwong, Lester M.

The travel cost method (with a zero truncated negative binomial specification) is used to estimate the price elasticity of demand, and those estimates are used to estimate the deadweight losses, the losses in visitor numbers that could be 'blamed' on the EMC and the associated taxation revenues for different types of trips. The welfare loss for each dollar of revenue raised from the EMC was estimated at less than one per cent for each type of trip considered. The analysis therefore suggests that, for these types of trips in this part of the reef at least, the EMC is a very efficient tax - particularly when compared with other taxes. This has important implications beyond the GBR, particularly in countries who struggle to find sufficient funds to properly manage world heritage areas: taxes such as these may be a relatively efficient and equitable means of collecting such revenues.","[Farr, Marina; Stoeckl, Natalie; Beg, Rabiul Alam] James Cook Univ, Sch Business, Townsville, Qld, Australia",James Cook University,"Farr, M (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, Sch Business, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",marina.farr@my.jcu.edu.au,"Stoeckl, Natalie/AAU-8562-2020; Beg, Rabiul/N-1697-2017","Stoeckl, Natalie/0000-0001-5899-4771; Beg, Rabiul/0000-0003-0255-9863",James Cook University,James Cook University,"The data analysed in this paper were collected as part of a larger research project led by Alastair Birtles and funded by the Australian Government's Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility.

The prices for labeled varieties are increasing functions of the cost differential and do not reveal which variety is cheaper to produce. Nondisclosure is most common under moderate uncertainty about costs and not too much idiosyncrasy in valuations and quality asymmetry. Mandatory disclosure decreases expected welfare when cost variability is large and quality asymmetry is small. The cheaper variety tends to be oversupplied (undersupplied) when disclosure is voluntary (mandatory). Competition among multiproduct firms that source inputs in the same upstream market may not lead to more disclosure.,,,,,,"Saak, Alexander/0000-0002-7564-8317",,,,,43,2,2,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We use an instrumental variables Poisson regression model to deal with the endogeneity of perceived health status in functional ingredient use. The first stage results indicate that perceived health status is associated with attitude towards functional foods, food consumption motives and information seeking and being female. The second stage results suggest that individuals who consume more functional ingredients tend to have a positive attitude towards functional foods, are novelty-seeking, female and older. As expected, consumption of functional ingredients is more likely when consumers' self-reports indicate that they are aware of functional foods' nutritional value and the link with their own health. Consistent with previous research, most of the socio-demographics are poor predictors of functional ingredient consumption.","[Cranfield, John; Henson, Spencer] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Masakure, Oliver] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Org Leadership & Human Rights, Brantford, ON N3T 6C9, Canada",University of Guelph; Wilfrid Laurier University,"Cranfield, J (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jcranfie@uoguelph.ca,,"Cranfield, John/0000-0002-3475-6709",,,,,68,29,31,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Much of the evidence of the impact of irrigation does not use counterfactual analysis to estimate such impact or distinguish between the scale of the irrigation projects to be evaluated. In the dataset collected by the author, both a large-scale irrigation project and small-scale projects are used to construct counterfactual groups. Propensity score matching is used to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for small and large irrigators relative to non-irrigators on agricultural production, agricultural income and consumption per capita. Small-scale irrigation has a larger effect on agricultural production and agricultural income than large-scale irrigation, but large-scale irrigation has a larger effect on consumption per capita. This suggests that market integration and non-farm externalities are important in realising gains in agricultural surplus from irrigation.","Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Dillon, A (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",a.dillon@cgiar.org,,,Projet du Developpement de la Zone Lacustre - Phase II of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); Programme Mali-Nord (GTZ/KfW); Cornell University; Clark Atlanta University; Einaudi Center at Cornell University and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),Projet du Developpement de la Zone Lacustre - Phase II of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); Programme Mali-Nord (GTZ/KfW); Cornell University; Clark Atlanta University; Einaudi Center at Cornell University and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Financial support for the 2006 data collection was provided by the Projet du Developpement de la Zone Lacustre - Phase II of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Programme Mali-Nord (GTZ/KfW), the Strategies and Analysis for Growth and Access program (Cornell University and Clark Atlanta University), the Einaudi Center at Cornell University and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).

Also, results suggest that farms without well access experience larger losses than those with well access. Econometric results suggest education, the presence of tank water management efforts, and well access influence the level of foregone rent due to allocative and Nerlovian inefficiencies.

Specifically, constant relative yield risk resulting in growing absolute variance through time and other restrictive requirements are required for the LCR to result in unbiased rates. These requirements are tested against a large farm-level data set for Illinois corn. Our findings indicate that the conditions required for appropriate use of the LCR methodology are violated for this high premium volume market, resulting in large implied rate biases.

Design/methodology/approach - The relationship between agricultural policy and the adjustment process of agricultural labor in Taiwan was analyzed by modeling labor movement between the agricultural sector and other sectors. Through empirical analysis of labor migration function, it is clear that the following policy factors, affect the incentive for labor migration, and obstruct off-farm labor migration: the price support policy; the incomplete farmland conversion regulations, which increase farmers' farmland possession motive; and government agricultural expenditure, which includes direct transfers to the agricultural sector. Findings - The study confirms that after the late 1980s the factors that obstruct agricultural adjustment much more than the price support policy are the incomplete farmland conversion regulations and increasing government agricultural payments, from the result of the simulation with the influence of the policy eliminated. Research limitations/implications - The implication of this paper is that even though Taiwan has been participating in World Trade Organization from 2002 and consented to cut the tariff on agricultural products and reduce agriculture support policies not linked to production, a delay in labor adjustment between the agricultural sector and other sectors may not necessarily be eliminated if there are other policy factors that affect the incentive for off-farm migration by farmers. Originality/value - Many studies use the labor migration function for empirical analysis, but most of them estimated the function by a simple single regression which shows that the labor movement from the agricultural sector to the other sectors increases as a result of an expanding wage gap. However, off-farm labor movement reduces the wage gap between sectors adversely. Therefore, a reverse causal relation exists between labor movement and the wage gap between sectors. The endogeneity problem was considered as analyzing the measurement of the labor migration function.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Chang, TY (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",aa087075@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Chang, Tsaiyu/AAI-9843-2021","Chang, Tsaiyu/0000-0003-1515-1293",,,,,15,6,6,1,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

However, the operating team of the cooperatives may have different interests. Under this situation, the terms of contract between farmers and cooperatives are important to both sides. Farmers' share of the cooperatives' profits specified in the contracts is an important issue in the long- term sustainability of rice processing and marketing in Korea. This paper discusses the behavior of farmers and their cooperatives in determining the optimal share of profits in their contracts. It also illustrates the impacts of the policy changes due to the Korea's accession to the WTO on the relative negotiation power between farmers and cooperatives. The results show that the Korean rice cooperatives have more negotiation power than farmers. They set the profit share to farmers based on their own profit maximization criteria, while taking farmers supply decision into consideration. Farmers only choose how much to supply. This relationship was seen changing after 2005, when the Korean government reduced and removed the price subsidy it provided to rice cooperatives before. As the cooperatives' margin goes down without the subsidy, farmers are pushed to bargain hard for their share of the margin to maintain their revenue.","[Wang, H.

However, significant variation exists among geographic locations; price premiums for organic over conventional eggs in Dallas are almost twice as high as those in San Francisco. Estimates indicate that about 42% of the typically observed premium for cage-free eggs over conventional eggs (and 36% of the premium for organic eggs) can be attributed to egg color rather than differences in hens' living conditions.

However, many applications of the MD approach are in developing countries where semi-subsistence systems with multiple production activities are being used and data availability is limited. This paper discusses how MD analysis can be applied to more complex production systems such as semi-subsistence systems with multiple production activities and presents validation analysis for studies of soil carbon sequestration in semi-subsistence farming systems in Kenya and Senegal. Results from these two studies confirm that ecosystem service supply curves based on the MD approach are close approximations to the curves derived from highly detailed data and models and are therefore sufficiently accurate and robust to be used to support policy decision making.","[Antle, John M.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Diagana, Bocar] IFDC, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Stoorvogel, Jetse J.] Wageningen Univ, Land Dynam Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Valdivia, Roberto O.] Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",Oregon State University; Wageningen University & Research; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Antle, JM (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",john.antle@oregonstate.edu,"Stoorvogel, Jetse/A-8690-2013; Valdivia, Roberto/R-1755-2017","Valdivia, Roberto/0000-0002-0002-848X; Stoorvogel, Jetse/0000-0003-4297-122X",,,,,24,23,33,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

We analyze the choice of agrobiodiversity by risk-averse farmers who have access to financial insurance, and study the implications for agrienvironmental policy design when on-farm agrobiodiversity generates a positive risk externality. While increasing environmental risk leads private farmers to increase their level of on-farm agrobiodiversity, the level of agrobiodiversity in the laissez-faire equilibrium remains inefficiently low. We show how either one of the two agrienvironmental policy instruments can cure this risk-related market failure: an ex ante Pigouvian subsidy on on-farm agrobiodiversity and an ex post payment-by-result for the actual provision of public environmental benefits. In the absence of regulation, welfare may increase rather than decrease with increasing environmental risk, if the agroecosystem is characterized by a high natural insurance function, low costs, and large external benefits of agrobiodiversity.","[Baumgaertner, Stefan] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Dept Sustainabil Sci, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany; [Baumgaertner, Stefan] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Dept Econ, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany; [Quaas, Martin F.] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; Leuphana University Luneburg; University of Kiel,"Baumgärtner, S (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Dept Sustainabil Sci, POB 2440, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany.",baumgaertner@uni.leuphana.de,"Quaas, Martin/C-4220-2012; Baumgärtner, Stefan/A-9597-2012","Quaas, Martin/0000-0003-0812-8829; Baumgärtner, Stefan/0000-0001-8314-8462","Volkswagen Foundation [II/79628, II/82883]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01UN0607]; Kiel Cluster of Excellence Future Ocean",Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Kiel Cluster of Excellence Future Ocean,"We are grateful to Salvatore di Falco, Unai Pascual, and anonymous reviewers for helpful discussion and comments.

It analyses the market and welfare impacts of the introduction of these new products in markets, like the EU, that mandate the segregation and labelling of the first-generation, producer-oriented GMPs. Developing an empirically relevant model of heterogeneous consumers and producers, the study determines the effects of the consumer-oriented GMPs on the markets of conventional, GM and organic products, and the welfare of consumers and agricultural producers. Analytical results indicate that the market effects of the new GMPs are case specific and depend on: (i) the consumer valuation of the quality-enhancing attribute of the new GMP; (ii) the level of consumer aversion to GMOs; (iii) the strength of consumer preference for organic products; and (iv) the production costs and marketing margins in the different supply channels. The policy on the labelling of the first-generation GMPs does not affect the impacts of the second-generation GMPs on the quantities and market shares of the different products. However, it does affect their price effects and welfare implications. The introduction of consumer-oriented GMPs under a mandatory labelling regime can result in losses for some GM consumers and all producers of the conventional product.","[Giannakas, Konstantinos] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Agr & Food Ind Org, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Lassoued, Rim] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Saskatchewan,"Giannakas, K (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Agr & Food Ind Org, 217 HC Filley Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",ril089@mail.usask.ca; kgiannakas@unl.edu,,"Giannakas, Konstantinos/0000-0002-3628-2869; Lassoued, Rim/0000-0002-7435-9935",,,,,17,3,5,0,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

This study details the bioeconomic model used to provide scientific management advice for the NPF, in terms of the amount of allowable total gear length in the fishery, for both the MEY target and the path to MEY. It combines the stock assessment process for two species of tiger prawns with a specification for discounted economic profits, where the harvest function in the profit equation is stock-dependent. Results for the NPF show a substantial 'stock effect', indicating the importance of conserving fish stocks for profitability. MEY thus occurs at a stock size that is larger than that at maximum sustainable yield, leading to a 'win-win' situation for both the industry (added profitability) and the environment (larger fish stocks and lower impact on the ecosystem). Sensitivity results emphasize this effect by showing that the MEY target is much more sensitive to changes in the price of prawns and the cost of fuel, and far less so to the rate of discount.","[Kompas, Tom; Che, Tuong Nhu] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Dichmont, Cathy M.; Deng, A.; Bishop, Janet; Ye, Yemin; Zhou, S.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Cleveland, Qld, Australia; [Punt, Andre E.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Punt, Andre E.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Che, Tuong Nhu; Gooday, Peter] Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Kompas, T (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",tom.kompas@anu.edu.au,"Kompas, T/F-5930-2010; Kompas, Tom/M-8851-2019; Zhou, Shijie/JNR-8845-2023; Dichmont, Catherine M/A-9528-2008; Zhou, Shijie/A-1886-2010","Kompas, Tom/0000-0002-0665-0966; Punt, Andre/0000-0001-8489-2488; Deng, Roy/0000-0001-9368-1332; Zhou, Shijie/0000-0002-9358-1013",Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) [2004/022],Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC)(Fisheries R&D Corp),Funding from the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC 2004/022) is gratefully acknowledged.

The results showed that transaction cost-related factors such as geographical location of households, market information sources, and travel time to the nearest urban center influence market participation. Non-price-related factors such as security of land tenure, labor availability, off-farm income, gender of the household head, and years of farming experience had a significant influence on the transacted volumes. Output prices had a significant correlation with sales volume, indicating price incentives increased supply by sellers.

Conversely, the income elasticities of import demand in India are similar to other low-income countries and for the most part statistically equal to zero.","[Haq, Zahoor] Agr Univ Peshawar, NWFP, Dept Agr Econ, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Meilke, Karl] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Peshawar; Agricultural University Peshawar; University of Guelph,"Haq, Z (通讯作者)，United Arab Emirates Univ, Coll Food & Agr, Dept Agribusiness & Consumer Sci, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",zahoor.haq1@gmail.com,,"Haq, Zahoor/0000-0001-6813-6746",,,,,17,8,8,1,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

We ask whether the growing RNF sector allows for economies of diversification within farms, how it affects household input demands, and whether it has measurable effects in overall household production efficiency. We explore the intrahousehold linkages between agricultural and RNF activities, first assuming perfectly competitive input and output markets and then with market failures, in particular missing labor and credit markets. We then measure these linkages using a household level input distance function, finding high levels of inefficiency in Ghanaian farms. Also, there are cost-complementarities between the RNF sector and the agricultural sector, particularly with food crops in which the poorest tend to specialize. The expansion of the RNF sector increases demand for most inputs including agricultural land. Finally, we show that smaller farms tend to be more efficient, and that RNF output is helping the farm household to become more efficient, but the latter result is not robust.","[Anriquez, Gustavo; Daidone, Silvio] FAO, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Daidone, Silvio] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Anríquez, G (通讯作者)，FAO, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",Gustavo.Anriquez@fao.org,"Anriquez, Gustavo/AGF-2067-2022; Daidone, Silvio/AAJ-4490-2021; Daidone, Silvio/ABC-5526-2021","Daidone, Silvio/0000-0002-1789-5635; Anriquez, Gustavo/0000-0003-2968-8286",,,,,32,20,21,3,33,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Economic research has identified two plausible hypotheses regarding this association. The first hypothesis emphasizes the need to start with democracy and institutions that secure property rights. The second hypothesis emphasizes the need to start with physical and human capital accumulation. In this article, we discuss some of the econometric evidence on the relationship between institutions, human capital, and agricultural productivity growth across developed and developing countries with the objective of finding support for one or the other hypothesis. We find that most variables used in the literature to capture the effect of institutions are not independent of the process of growth.

For this purpose, we use the Theory of Planned Behaviour. The main results suggest that the majority of farmers are a relatively homogeneous cluster about their attitudes but not in their behavioural intentions. These farmers still maintain a productivist mindset, wish to maintain an agricultural focus and strongly reject the notions of policy liberalisation.

Using the case of France, we employ statistical and econometric analysis of data from the Farm Structure Survey (N = 70,000) for the period 2000-2007. The principal findings suggest that small farms are no more likely than other farms to employ alternative strategies to the predominant model of increasing farm size, nor are they more likely to diversify on-farm activities or operate under quality-labeled production systems, with the notable exception of organic agriculture. However, where small farms do adopt or practice these activities, they are seen to have a favorable effect in ensuring their survival and growth. In contrast, we are unable to conclude that pluriactivity of farm households has a positive impact on the survival of small enterprises. The effect of geographical location on small farms is largely expressed in their concentration in mountainous or disadvantaged regions. Overall, the trajectory of small farms is marked by farm exit, principally as the result of farmers retiring at the end of their careers. The small farm sector is also revitalized by both larger farms declining and thus being reclassified as small farms, as well as the progressive entry into agriculture of small farm holders whose income was previously derived largely off-farm.","[Aubert, Magali; Perrier-Cornet, Philippe] INRA, UMR MOISA, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France",INRAE,"Aubert, M (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR MOISA, Bat 26,2 Pl Pierre Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France.",aubert@supagro.inra.fr,"Aubert, Magali/GXV-6317-2022; Aubert, Magali/JRW-7575-2023","AUBERT, Magali/0000-0002-3905-4298",,,,,19,17,17,1,46,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The default assumption for choice modelling has been that all the attributes presented to respondents somehow influence their choices. More recently, choice modelling research has begun examining how respondents use information. This article presents research that focused on which pieces of information respondents used in responding to a choice modelling survey. The use of information by respondents was captured in the course of the administration of a computer-aided survey, so the research did not rely on posterior self-reporting. Access to the information was captured for each attribute of every alternative, which allowed flexibility in assessing use of information. Three mixed logit models are presented, based on three different assumptions about information use.

We apply an extended three-stage damage control production framework, accounting for multiple endogeneity problems, to farm-level data collected from a random cross-sectional sample of 539 small-scale producers. Estimation results show that farmers producing vegetables for the domestic market use significantly lower quantities of pesticides than do export farmers. However, contrary to findings elsewhere, the econometric evidence here shows that both domestic and export-oriented vegetable farmers in Kenya use pesticides at levels below the economic optimum. The results also show that the adoption of standards by export farmers does not have any significant impact on total pesticide use. However, adopter categories are distinguishable in terms of types of pesticide used, i.e. adopters use safer pesticides based on World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The third-stage structural revenue model results demonstrate that adoption of standards has a positive and significant impact on revenue raised in vegetable production. Nevertheless, farmers producing for the export market are indistinguishable from those producing for the domestic farmers in terms of the total revenue earned from producing vegetables during the rainy season, on a 'per acre' basis. Although standards can potentially prevent resource-poor smallholders from maintaining their position in the lucrative export markets, they can also result in positive changes in the production systems of those small-scale farmers who adopt it, as shown by these results.","[Asfaw, Solomon] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mithoefer, Dagmar] ICIPE, Nairobi, Kenya; [Waibel, Hermann] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE); Leibniz University Hannover,"Asfaw, S (通讯作者)，Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, POB 39063-00623, Nairobi, Kenya.",s.t.asfaw@cgiar.org,,,German Development Cooperation (BMZ/GTZ),German Development Cooperation (BMZ/GTZ),The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the German Development Cooperation (BMZ/GTZ) and the technical support by the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture and export companies.

Within Spain, the COP sector accounts for almost a third of total Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund expenses, and half of the utilized agricultural area (UAA). The COP sector is not only relevant because of its physical and economic magnitude, but also because of the political attention it receives. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms that occurred during the 1990s paid special attention to this sector. This article aims to determine the impacts of Agenda 2000 on a sample of Spanish COP farmers' production decisions by using an output-oriented stochastic distance function. The distance function allows for an assessment of the reform-motivated changes on total output, input used, input composition, and crop mix. It also permits an assessment of the impacts of the reform on farms' technical efficiency. Results show that the reform has shifted the production frontier inward and changed output composition in favor of voluntary set-aside land. With respect to input composition, Agenda 2000 induced a decrease in land, fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs in favor of labor. In addition, Agenda 2000 has had a negative impact on technical efficiency.","[Lambarraa, Fatima; Serra, Teresa; Gil, Jose M.] CREDA UPC IRTA, Ctr Recerca Econ & Desenvolupament Agroalimentari, Castelldefels 08860, Spain; [Stefanou, Spiro] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Stefanou, Spiro] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands",IRTA; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Wageningen University & Research,"Lambarraa, F (通讯作者)，CREDA UPC IRTA, Ctr Recerca Econ & Desenvolupament Agroalimentari, Parc Mediterrani Tecnol,Edifici ESAB,Avinguda Can, Castelldefels 08860, Spain.",fatima.lambarraa@upc.edu,"GIL, Jose M./B-2699-2012; Lehnhardt, Fatima Lambarraa/Q-5092-2019; Stefanou, Spiro/V-5770-2017","GIL, Jose M./0000-0003-3313-9052; Lehnhardt, Fatima Lambarraa/0000-0001-8955-1180; Stefanou, Spiro/0000-0001-8366-6577","Spanish Ministry of Environment, Rural and Marine Affairs (MARM); Spanish Ministerio Ciencia e Innovacion [AGL2006-00949/AGR]","Spanish Ministry of Environment, Rural and Marine Affairs (MARM); Spanish Ministerio Ciencia e Innovacion(Spanish Government)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Spanish Ministry of Environment, Rural and Marine Affairs (MARM) for permitting access to the FADN dataset and financial support from the Spanish Ministerio Ciencia e Innovacion (Project Reference Number AGL2006-00949/AGR).",,32,12,13,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Findings - The results reveal that chemical intensity may increase with freer trade The effect of freer trade on chemical intensity was less significant in earlier days such as the 1980s than in recent years. The basic model explains, to some extent, why some country representative conveyed their concerns in the Committee of Trade and Environment under WTO about the environmental degradation due to freer trade in agriculture. It also implies that more investment on environmental protection is warranted in the course of trade liberalization Research limitations/implications - Given the dramatic inflation of energy prices, more elaboration on the price specification with respect to pesticides may be warranted for future researches.

The Green Book represents a key document of the European energy policy and it originated as a consequence of the fears of the European Committee regarding the growing energy dependence on the energy resources imports, from the politically not stable parts of the world. Among the three key points of the energy strategy, there belong stable supply of energy, acceptable energy prices and environment protection.

Between February 2001 and the end of June 2008, a total of 1 263 749 cows were examined and 28 cases of the BSE were detected. Consequently, 4 022 cows in cohorts were killed and their carcasses were safely disposed of. The farmers whose herds had been affected were provided compensations for the losses suffered. The total of the compensations in this period reached CZK 198,413 thousand. Of these, 83.3% (CZK 164.9 million) were compensations for the value of the killed animals, 9.7% (CZK 19.2 million) for the related costs, i.e., killing, safe disposal of carcasses and the examination for the BSE, and 6.9% (CZK 13.5 million) for the losses due to non-materialised production. The average costs per 1 BSE-positive animal were CZK 7.08 million and the average costs per 1 cohort animal were CZK 49 331. In the rendering plant responsible for killing the infected and cohort animals and safely disposing of their carcasses, the total of 2 221 tons of raw material was processed between March 2003 and February 2008, and this cost CZK 9 315 thousand. The fact that there were only two cases of the BSE in 2007 and none in 2008 suggests a trend towards the disease eradication, which is in agreement with the situation in the other EU countries.","Palacky Univ, Fac Law, Olomouc 77100, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc,"Pospísil, R (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ, Fac Law, 17 Listopadu 6, Olomouc 77100, Czech Republic.",richard.pospisil@upol.cz,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,3,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Different price policies have thus different influence on national agricultural markets. These policies can also influence the world market and third countries provided that the exporting country places a high share of its production on the world market. Using a Cobb-Douglas market model we quantitatively assess global implications of national price policies in the EU-27, Russia, and the US (as leading wheat exporting countries) on the world market price for wheat and on welfare, foreign exchange, and producer surplus in third countries. The results prove that increasing protectionist price policies in the EU-27, Russia, and the US would only slightly influence the welfare in third countries.

The empirical evidence strongly supports the conclusion that Saputo's stock price rose with its takeover announcement. This outcome is consistent with a number of explanations, including that Saputo was unaffected by hubris, a factor often suggested as the reason that many firms overbid when they undertake acquisitions. Dairyworld's poor liquidity and capital shortage problems, as well as a limited number of suitors, may have weakened its bargaining position in its dealings with Saputo. The observed increase in Saputo's stock price is also consistent with the possibility that, by taking over a cooperative, Saputo was able to decrease competition and thus increase its profits.

Increasing the scale and scope of tenders increases the likelihood that a larger range of proposals will be proposed and cost-effective ones selected. However, the use of larger and more broadly scoped tenders may reduce landholder participation and increase asking bids. In the study reported here, these issues have been tested with a single water quality tender run in north-eastern Australia in 2007 and 2008. Post hoc tests and workshop exercises show that while larger-scale and scope tenders can generate efficiency gains, care has to be taken to maintain participation and avoid higher bid levels.","[Rolfe, John; Windle, Jill] Cent Queensland Univ, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia; [Greiner, Romy] Charles Darwin Univ, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Hailu, Atakelty] Univ Western Australia, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",Central Queensland University; Charles Darwin University; University of Western Australia,"Rolfe, J (通讯作者)，Cent Queensland Univ, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia.",j.rolfe@cqu.edu.au,"Greiner, Romy/AAA-4928-2021; Hailu, Atakelty/AAB-7606-2020; Rolfe, John/O-2945-2017; Greiner, Romy/N-2104-2013","Hailu, Atakelty/0000-0002-1024-7520; Rolfe, John/0000-0001-7659-7040; Greiner, Romy/0000-0002-2792-5391",Australian Government,Australian Government(Australian Government),"This research reported in this paper has been funded by the Australian Government's Market-Based Instruments Programme with additional support from the Burdekin Dry Tropics NRM (BDTNRM).

Yet, these fears often ignored that many of these poor households were food producers. This study examines the impact of rising food prices on welfare in Vietnam. Our results show that, overall, higher food prices raised the average Vietnamese household's welfare. However, higher food prices made most households worse off. Average welfare was found to increase because the average welfare loss of households whose welfare declined (net purchasers) was smaller than the average welfare gain of those whose welfare increased (net sellers).","[Linh Vu] Vietnam Natl Univ, Univ Econ & Business, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Glewwe, Paul] IRC, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Glewwe, Paul] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Vietnam National University Hanoi; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Linh, V (通讯作者)，Vietnam Natl Univ, Univ Econ & Business, Hanoi, Vietnam.",,,"VU, LINH/0000-0002-5096-8584",,,,,16,37,43,0,10,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

This hypothesis is tested on a sample of primary data and an analysis of the selected indicators of social capital is presented. These include personal social networks, membership in agricultural associations and access to sources of information. Following the results, it is argued that the presence of informal personal ties displays a stronger relationship to the entrepreneurial success than formal membership in agricultural associations.

The authors' analysis relies on Heckman model (a probit and Tobit model) with the data obtained from questionnaires collected from Chinese enterprises. Given the fact that only a small portion of Chinese agribusinesses hedge, this paper provides some initial academic evidence to help the agricultural sector devise useful programs to assist participations of hedging. Design/methodology/approach - A Heckman selection model was developed to analyze questionnaire information obtained using face-to-face interviews with 218 Chinese agribusinesses. This paper presents summary statistics, Heckman estimation results, and interpretations of the results. Findings - Survey results show that a majority of surveyed firms believe that futures market cannot reduce risks or increase income. According to the study, factors affecting enterprises hedging decisions include: to what degree that Chinese enterprises believe hedging leads to business stability; whether these enterprises had attended a hedge training or seminar; perceived price volatility in the market; and have alternative strategies to reduce price risks. Practical implications - Agribusiness assistance programs can use this paper's findings to plan effective hedge training to help improve participation of futures hedging.

Moreover, those who always have a concern about the safety of the alternatives to milk powder are more easily affected. Originality/value - Different from other researches, the paper focuses on consumers' attitudes towards food safety by studying a specific case, namely the melamine scandal.","[Zhou, Yingheng; Wang, Erpeng] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Econ & Management Dept, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Wang, EP (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Econ & Management Dept, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",2009206026@njau.edu.cn,,,,,,,11,23,24,2,44,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Usually, land fragmentation is regarded as a harmful phenomenon as it increases production costs and reduces the advantages of scale economies. However, it is also known that fragmentation may have beneficial effects in reducing risk through spatial dispersion of plots. Thus, land fragmentation has both costs and benefits, and whether it is beneficial or harmful is determined by the magnitude of these costs and benefits. This article investigates the costs and benefits of land fragmentation empirically using panel data from Japanese rice farms. The empirical results reveal that fragmentation increases production costs and offsets economies of size, and these impacts strengthen as farm size increases. Moreover, although fragmentation does reduce production risk, its monetary value is far below the cost of land fragmentation. From these findings, we conclude that land fragmentation is an impediment to efficient rice production in Japan.","PRIMAFF, Tokyo, Japan",,"Kawasaki, K (通讯作者)，PRIMAFF, Tokyo, Japan.",kenkawa@affrc.go.jp,,,,,,,39,83,93,10,72,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

We find evidence that land protection directly reduced local employment growth and increased net migration.

The sources of productivity growth are examined using a fixed-effects regression model and a polynomial distributed lag structure for agricultural R&D expenditures. While conventional estimates show an average productivity growth rate of only 0.3% per year, the improved measures under sequential technology show that African agricultural productivity grew at a higher rate of 1.8% per year. Technical progress, rather than efficiency change, was the principal source of productivity growth. Agricultural R&D, weather, and trade reforms turned out to have significant effects on productivity in African agriculture. With a rate of return of 33% per year, R&D is shown to be a socially profitable investment in African agriculture. While a strong R&D expenditure growth of about 2% per year in the 1970s led to strong productivity growth after the mid 1980s, stagnation of R&D expenditure in the 1980s and early 1990s led to slower productivity growth in the 2000s. Consistent with recent economic recovery in Africa evidenced by stronger agricultural GDP growth rates, results showed that policy reforms as well as improved weather contributed to the recovery of agricultural productivity after the mid 1980s.","Int Inst Trop Agr, Lilongwe, Malawi",,"Alene, AD (通讯作者)，Int Inst Trop Agr, POB 30258, Lilongwe, Malawi.",A.Alene@cgiar.org,,,,,,,47,77,91,1,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The article develops a solution by establishing explicitly the theoretical link between composite demand and physical quantities, from which a novel empirical approach to the estimation of nutrient elasticities is derived.

Rainfall variability, on the other hand, impacts fertilizer use decisions negatively, implying that variability raises the risks and uncertainty associated with fertilizer use. Abundant rainfall in the previous year could depict relaxed liquidity constraints and increased affordability of fertilizer, which makes rainfall availability critical in severely credit-constrained environments.

In particular, the study evaluates the effect of transaction costs on the decision to convert partially or completely from conventional to organic practices. The results highlight the importance of lowering certain transaction costs to encourage the adoption of organic management practices. Significant transaction costs were found to include infrastructure and services, satisfaction with marketer performance, marketing problems, and Internet use. Results suggest that farmers with smaller land holdings are more inclined to undertake complete adoption. While the education levels of organic farmers show no significant effect on the probability of adoption, younger organic farmers allocate significantly less of their cultivated area to organic practices.","[Weseen, Simon; Gray, Richard] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N SA8, Canada; [Khaledi, Mohammad] Agr Econ Res Bur, Tehran, Iran; [Ferguson, Shon] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Saskatchewan; Stockholm University,"Weseen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr Econ, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N SA8, Canada.",m_khaledi2002@yahoo.com; simon.weseen@usask.ca; e.n.sawyer@gmail.com; shon.ferguson@gmail.com; richard.gray@usask.ca,"Ferguson, Shon/GXH-0211-2022","Ferguson, Shon/0000-0003-4809-5697; Gray, Richard Stanley/0000-0002-2073-3987",,,,,54,41,50,3,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

First, from an extensive literature review and the resulting global inventory of impact studies, 23 studies are identified that calculate aggregate rates of return for Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and partner investments in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). These studies are then appraised against a review framework consisting of principles, criteria, and indicators for study rigor. Subsequently, the economic benefits reported by studies grouped on the basis of its analytical rigor are aggregated and set against total investment by the CGIAR and national agricultural research systems to determine if the total investment to date can be justified by documented benefits under a range of assumptions. As a result, the study finds that aggregate investment is justified under a fairly wide range of suppositions. Under all scenarios, the vast majority of documented benefits stem from a relatively limited array of activities with a majority of benefits stemming from biological control (80%). Close to 20% of total benefits result from crop genetic improvement, and less than 1% result from all other activities. The implications of these results for research investment strategies in SSA and impact assessment are discussed.","[Maredia, Mywish K.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Raitzer, David Anthony] IRRI, Manila 1301, Philippines",Michigan State University; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"Maredia, MK (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 321 Agr Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",maredia@msu.edu,"Maredia, Mywish K./JZE-0332-2024","Maredia, Mywish K./0000-0002-3200-532X",,,,,55,23,26,0,22,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The framework employs country-specific agroecological-drought risk zones and considers both yield increases and yield variance reductions when estimating producer and consumer benefits from research. Benefits from yield variance reductions are shown to be an important component of aggregate drought research benefits, representing 40% of total benefits across the eight countries.

A trade costs index is inferred from a micro-founded gravity equation that incorporates bilateral 'iceberg' trade costs. For 2000, the trade costs, expressed as weighted average tariff equivalent, range from 73% for the north to 134% for the south countries. The time patterns show an average reduction of about 13% in the observed period that rises to 26% for the emerging countries. However, the same does not occur for south countries. On ranking the trade costs determinants, we find that, on average, geographical and historical factors seem to dominate those of infrastructure and institutions. However, trade policy emerges as an important determinant of the trade costs between north and emerging countries.","[Olper, Alessandro; Raimondi, Valentina] Univ Milan, DEPA, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Olper, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, DEPA, Via Cerloria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",alessandro.olper@unimi.it,"RAIMONDI, VALENTINA/AGY-1199-2022","RAIMONDI, VALENTINA/0000-0002-5431-7885",Universita degli Studi di Milano,Universita degli Studi di Milano,"We are grateful for useful comments from the Editor, two anonymous referees and participants in several seminars and conferences.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper comprises three stages: analyzing the process of CAI from the household responsibility system, to agricultural industrialization, until the stage of CAI led by farmers' co-operatives; discussing the related practice together with literature; and historically proving that there is no better way to promote CAI than letting it be led by farmers' co-operatives. Findings - The paper finds that, the development of China's agricultural economic organizations is owing to CAI, and can be studied stage by stage; the process of CAI proves that it needs to be promoted as a new style led by farmers' co-operative in order to increase rural income; literature review also gives eloquent proof of the above viewpoint; agricultural integration led by farmers' co-operative should be taken as a better way to upgrade CAI and to increase rural income, for it can decrease the benefit disputes that usually happened in the former type of agricultural industrialization. Originality/value - The obvious value of the paper is to show, by a historical review, a way to promote CAI and to increase farmers' income. A literature review finds these countermeasures comprehensively, historically, and theoretically.

One of the major policy adjustments is to strengthen the supply of public goods in rural areas and set up the rural cooperative medical system (RCMS) financed by both governments and farmers. The purpose of this paper is to outline the background, recent developments, achievements and problems of the RCMS and help people to understand the RCMS in China. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a time approach, meaning the paper is organized by initiate background, system framework design, experiment and extension, achievement, problems and discussion about the RCMS development process. Findings - The Central Government intended to establish a new medical system in rural areas, so that farmers could protect themselves if they got sick. The paper finds that, with the help of the government, farmers have gradually accepted the medical cooperation system. The RCMS has rapidly been extended, and forms a basic medical security net for rural residents The RCMS has achieved the initial goals of the policy reform mitigating farmers' financial burden, increasing the number of visits to doctors, and reducing the cost of the RCMS. However, there are still some pending issues such as fund-raising, monitoring-efficiency, and medical targets that need to be solved. Originality/value - This paper is a general review, which provides a brief and general image of the Chinese RCMS and helps people to understand the RCMS in China.","[He Xiurong] Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang Zhongyi] Minist Agr, Res Ctr Rural Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs,"He, XR (通讯作者)，Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,7,6,6,0,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

In years of drought, nonfarm income can also be part of the coping strategies. A multivariate sample selection model was used to analyze three years of data from a nationally representative household survey in Mozambique. The analysis was guided by the following three questions. During a drought year: (1) Do households increase their participation in nonfarm activities? (2) Are poorer households as likely as others to participate in and benefit from nonfarm activities? and (3) Which factors are associated with higher nonfarm incomes? The results suggest that households are more likely to engage in at least one nonfarm income-generating activity during a drought year. Although poorer households are more likely to engage in nonfarm activities, they are less likely to participate in nonfarm activities of high return. The results suggest that policies reducing entry barriers (e.g., improved road infrastructure, micro-credit schemes, and livestock promotion programs) and increasing education levels can facilitate income diversification, thus allowing rural households to better cope with the effects of drought. When designing polices, care must be taken to avoid exacerbating income inequality by targeting measures toward poorer and female-headed households.","[Cunguara, Benedito; Darnhofer, Ika] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Agr & Forestry Econ, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Cunguara, Benedito] Res Dev Ctr, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Langyintuo, Augustine] AGRA, Nairobi 00800, Kenya","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Cunguara, B (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Agr & Forestry Econ, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",cunguara@gmail.com,,"Darnhofer, Ika/0000-0002-0809-9602",Ministry of Agriculture; Michigan State University; USAID; OeAD,Ministry of Agriculture(Gida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi); Michigan State University; USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); OeAD,"Special thanks are due to Milton Cunguara who helped writing the multivariate sample selection script in MatLab.

We estimate income elasticities of dietary diversity for demographic cohorts allowing asymmetric behavior depending on household circumstances. We find that household heads disproportionately bear the nutritional burden when household income is below mean, while other cohorts disproportionately enjoy the nutritional gains when it is above mean. The commonly assumed symmetric framework masks this intrahousehold behavior and produces biased elasticity estimates. Stochastic dominance tests show adult daughters as better-off than other household members in their dietary diversity, sons as worse off, and little difference between male heads and their wives.","[Villa, Kira M.; Barrett, Christopher B.; Just, David R.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Villa, KM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009; Just, David R/K-7302-2012","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721;","Office of Agriculture and Food Security, Global Bureau, USAID [DAN-1328-G-00-0046-00, PCE-G-98-00036-00]; USAID Assets and Market Access CRSP","Office of Agriculture and Food Security, Global Bureau, USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); USAID Assets and Market Access CRSP","Kira M.

Estimates of the aggregate supply curve for carbon dioxide (CO(2)) equivalent offsets from the adoption of anaerobic digestion (AD) were developed based upon dairy farm data collected by the National Agricultural Statistics Service/Economic Research Service Agricultural Resource and Management Survey. The estimated supply curve demonstrates how the supply of CO(2) offsets from AD would be influenced by offset prices. A sensitivity analysis examines how changes in capital and operating costs, as well as energy prices, would influence the supply of offsets. Under a base set of assumptions, offset prices in excess of $15 per ton of CO(2) equivalent would be required to reduce methane emissions from manure storages by 50% from 2005 levels.","Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Gloy, BA (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",bgloy@purdue.edu,,,,,,,24,11,16,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

A marketing experiment/trial to test these ideas is evaluated. Design/methodology/approach - The case of fine-wool marketing is used to illustrate issues associated with specialty product marketing. The market efficiency approach highlights the difficulties involved in relaying accurate product prices and values (exchange efficiency) while aligning the logistical requirements of higher value market segments with the small, dispersed and locationally remote smallholders (operational efficiency). The marketing experiment/trial was conducted in three fine-wool-growing counties in Western China in 2008. Findings - The fine-wool case study highlights that modernization of the marketing system is required not only so that smallholders can access the premium prices potentially available but also to improve international competitiveness. Originality/value - Engaging smallholders in specialty agricultural product markets poses significant challenges for China. The market efficiency approach (exchange efficiency versus operational efficiency) provides a new perspective on these challenges and offers new insights about appropriate policy settings both at a macro- and micro-level.","[Brown, Colin; Waldron, Scott] Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Syst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Brown, C (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Syst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",colin.brown@uq.edu.au,,,,,,,20,6,7,3,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Also the explanations of realistic options of governance to mitigate and streamline the effects associated with climate variability in order to achieve the least possible damage of global environment are not always given appropriately. Because of a lack of specific statistical data on climate variability, which are usually at the sole disposal of professional climate scientists, and owing to the attention the public pays to these phenomena only at times of climatic anomalies (floods, extreme heat and drought, etc.), the issue is still on the edge of a broader awareness of people and academic research.

Design/methodology/approach - Using 1993 and 2001 household survey data from three selected provinces in China, the authors estimated a quantile regression (QR) model to demonstrate how changes of fresh fruit and vegetable consumption over time may differ across regions, and additionally, how these changes may differ over the entire distribution. Findings - Results show significant increases in fresh fruit consumption for all provinces; in addition, the pattern of changes over time differs across the entire distribution. In contrast, significant decreases of fresh vegetable consumption are evident, and results are robust across regions; however, the disparities of fresh vegetable consumption across regions are not significant. Research limitations/implications The results may shed some light on the national food policy. First, any food policy that may affect prices of fresh fruits and vegetables will likely affect households in lower percentiles more than those in upper percentiles. In addition, based on the findings, households in Guangdong may have a higher risk of inadequate fruit consumption. Lower level consumption of fruits in Guangdong may be caused by its relatively high prices of fruits and perhaps the shifting consumption pattern to a more meat-based diet as income increases. Originality/value - There has been considerable interest in estimating food demand structure in China due to its huge market for food products. However, little is known about the fruits and vegetables products. In addition, most of the previous studies used the linear regression-type model for analysis, which fails to capture the effects of the exogenous factors on the entire distribution. To fill the knowledge gap, this paper uses a QR model with the different-in-difference method to examine the changes in fruit and vegetable consumption of Chinese households.","[Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Liu, Kang Ernest; Chern, Wen S.] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Ming Hsiung, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Chung Cheng University,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,,"LIU, KANG ERNEST/0000-0001-6067-6027; chang, hung-hao/0000-0003-2296-134X",,,,,37,2,4,0,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Reorientation towards rural development measures and not towards supporting agricultural production raised a whole issue in which the efficiency criteria of the agricultural policies are concerned. If until now the Union entire attention was directed towards industrial farms, the option to promote family farms, with lower returns but with a high social impact by mobilizing the human resources from the rural area towards this field and preventing migration towards the city and the industrial areas, raised fierce debates. This paper presents a brief analysis of the impact of re-focusing the CAP towards promoting family-farms, mostly of the subsistence type, in the Romanian agrarian economy, in the context of an increased globalization of the agricultural relations.","[Andrei, Jean] Petr & Gas Univ Ploiesti, Econ & Business Adm Dept, Ploiesti 100680, Prahova, Romania; [Popescu, Gabriel] Acad Econ Studies, Ctr Anal & Reg Policies, Bucharest, Romania",Oil & Gas University of Ploiesti; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Andrei, J (通讯作者)，Petr & Gas Univ Ploiesti, Econ & Business Adm Dept, Bucharest Ave 39, Ploiesti 100680, Prahova, Romania.",ajvasile@upg-ploiesti.ro,"Jean-Vasile, Andrei/A-5270-2011","Jean-Vasile, Andrei/0000-0002-8332-6537",,,,,27,20,20,0,19,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

A regional convergence analysis is performed in order to examine if the EU overall aim of convergence is reached. The main growth- and convergence theories are used as the theoretical framework and form the study's hypothesis. The results show that an absolute beta-convergence exists between the EU member states as well as regions. However, the sigma-convergence is not confirmed, meaning that that the disparities between the regions are rather increasing than decreasing. Perhaps a possible reason why the sigma-convergence does not occur at the EU level is that it is easier for smaller regions which are more similar to each other to converge than for larger regions which tend to be more dissimilar to each other. This reasoning is in line with the convergence theories which state that smaller regions within a country are more likely to converge towards each other in the absolute sense than countries. On the other hand, the EU countries and regions tend to convergence in the tasks like unemployment rate, showing that they are not successful in resolving this difficult task. One of the main reasons of the high unemployment in all EU member states is their structural problem in the respective economies, consequently reflected in the long-term unemployment. The EU countries tend to convergence in terms of inequality as well, showing that they are egalitarian in character.","[Qineti, Artan; Serences, Roman] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Matejkova, Eva; Pietrikova, Miriam] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Toth, Marian] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Dvorak, Marek] Acad Publ Adm, Prague, Czech Republic",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Qineti, A (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",Artan.Qineti@fem.uniag.sk; Eva.Matejkova@fem.uniag.sk; Miriam.Pietrikova@fem.uniag.sk; Roman.Serences@fem.uniag.sk; dvorak72@gmail.com,"Tóth, Marián/AAD-8706-2019; Dvořák, Marek/H-4582-2018; Qineti, Artan/AAD-8740-2019; Toth, Marian/H-4857-2016","Dvořák, Marek/0000-0003-3731-2633; Serences, Roman/0000-0003-4581-2339",,,,,25,15,15,1,18,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

There are presented the author's views on the advantages and weaknesses of some of the proposed methods of reporting the lease contracts. These findings result from the performed comparisons of recording simplified specific lease contracts on operational lease from the business practice, reported according to the current IFRS methodology and the concept of the right of use, and from the comparison of views of specialists, in particular those published on the IASB and FASB websites. These views were further completed by the author with the partial results of the investigation made in 203 Czech SMES dealing with the suitability of the future application of these principles to SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Entities). The survey was conducted among the selected Czech companies whose leaders knew the problems of reporting operational and financial leases under the IAS/IFRS and were willing to study the concepts presented by the IASB and the FASB and other materials relating to leases. The analyzed entities generally believe that the application of the right to use the concept will lead to a true and fair view on the side of the lessee but the application of this concept is associated with inappropriate costs. Most respondents believe that the asset and liability should be recognised in one aggregated amount and the decreasing of the obligation and the asset amortization should be assessed separately. The best solution in the case of changes in the estimates is to use the historic incremental borrowing rate.","Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Fac Business & Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Svoboda, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",patrik.svoboda@mendelu.cz,"Svoboda, Patrik/AAE-1145-2020","Svoboda, Patrik/0000-0002-2274-4778","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6215648904]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6215648904).",,10,3,3,0,19,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality allocated A$1.4 billion of public funds to 1700 projects over 7 years. Here, we assess the performance of the program in relation to 12 features that we propose as being essential for programs that aim to address complex environmental problems. The features include use of technical information to guide investment prioritization, use of socio-economic information, effective integration of information for prioritization, selection of appropriate targets, choice of appropriate policy mechanisms, and provision of incentives and support to environmental managers to pursue environmental outcomes cost effectively. Our assessment reinforces findings from a number of public reviews that found serious weaknesses in the program. Overall, with a few exceptions, projects under the National Action Plan generated few worthwhile salinity mitigation benefits and will have little enduring benefit. This was readily foreseeable given attention to the scientific and economic knowledge of salinity available at the time the program was developed.","[Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Roberts, Anna M.] Dept Primary Ind, Rutherglen, Vic, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Pannell, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Crawley, WA, Australia.",david.pannell@uwa.edu.au; anna.roberts@dpi.vic.gov.au,"Pannell, David/B-4476-2008","Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908",Future Farm Industries CRC; Australian Research Council,"Future Farm Industries CRC(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","The authors are grateful to the Future Farm Industries CRC and the Australian Research Council for funding that contributed to this analysis, to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for the data underpinning Tables 1 and 2, and to two anonymous reviewers.",,42,57,59,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In this study, both methods have been used to estimate the recreational values associated with the Coorong on the Murray River in south-eastern Australia. Values per adult visitor per recreation day are estimated with the TCM at $149 and with the CVM at $116. A number of methodological and framing issues to explain these value differences are tested. In summary, while no single methodological or framing issue could be identified that would reconcile the difference between TCM and CVM values, it appears likely that there may be a combination of factors that drive the systematic variations in consumer surplus values. The evidence in this study suggests that the most important of these are likely to be the different decision points underpinning data collection and the consideration of substitute sites, strategic responses and the treatment of uncertain responses within the CVM.","[Rolfe, John] Cent Queensland Univ, Ctr Environm Management, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia; [Dyack, Brenda] Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Central Queensland University,"Rolfe, J (通讯作者)，Cent Queensland Univ, Ctr Environm Management, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia.",j.rolfe@cqu.edu.au,"Rolfe, John/O-2945-2017","Rolfe, John/0000-0001-7659-7040; Dyack, Brenda/0000-0002-5161-469X",CSIRO National Research; Flagship Collaboration Fund,CSIRO National Research(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Flagship Collaboration Fund,"This research was funded through the CSIRO National Research.

Potential correlation across wheat cultivar yields increases the complexity of cultivar selection decisions, with gains in one attribute (yield potential) often associated with losses in another (yield stability). Using location-specific empirical data, portfolio theory can provide producers in low-income countries a tool for developing a recommended portfolio of varieties given a desired risk-aversion level.

During the whole analysed period, there was estimated the most numerous group of companies which occurred in the area of decreasing returns to scale. This fact confirmed that the total input exploitation in agricultural companies is in a higher measure not profitable, because in comparison with production inputs, lower profits were reached. On the basis of these results, it is not possible to exactly estimate which inputs are indispensable to optimize (for a more specific estimation, it is necessary to apply the non-radial DEA methods), despite the fact that there was evidently confirmed the low measure of input profitability.","[Bielik, Peter; Hupkova, Daniela; Vadovic, Matus; Turcekova, Natalia] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Bielik, P (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",peter.bielik@fem.uniag.sk; daniela.hupkova@fem.uniag.sk; matus.vadovic@gmail.com; natalia.turcekova@fem.uniag.sk,"Bielik, Peter/AAL-5561-2020; Turčeková, Natália/AAL-5536-2020; Hupkova, Daniela/E-5605-2019","Hupkova, Daniela/0000-0002-3038-3669",,,,,16,3,4,0,14,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The central finding is that policy and institutional variables, including public agricultural expenditure and proagricultural price policy reforms, are significant correlates of TFP growth.

We examine the collapse of four historical societies with a model of endogenous population growth and renewable resources employing components of optimal resource management, economic growth theory, and the moral philosophy of social welfare function choice. We find that these collapses may have been socially optimal. Further, we show that the transient behavior of the system is more sensitive to assumptions than the equilibrium behavior and that focusing solely on equilibria may miss key insights.","[Good, David H.; Reuveny, Rafael] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Good, DH (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,,94,9,11,1,34,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9092,,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This research uses data elicited from consumer surveys and experimental auctions to provide insight on product attributes (taste/flavour, credence and nutritional characteristics) and socio-demographic factors that are most important in determining US consumers' preferences and willingness to pay premiums for grass-finished versus grain-finished beef. Information related to beef production processes increased the probability consumers would be willing to pay a premium for grass-fed beef. However, it appears that health-related messages are more important drivers of willingness-to-pay, on average, than the absence of antibiotics and supplemental hormones and traceability. Labelling information regarding grass-fed beef's nutritional content and related production processes is vital for maintaining and growing premium niche markets for grass-fed beef in the US. The relative size of the willingness to pay estimates compared to previous cost estimates suggest that the Australian beef industry may have a comparative advantage for finishing beef on forage and marketing premium grass-fed differentiated beef products in the US market.","[Umberger, Wendy J.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Urrbrae, SA 5005, Australia; [Boxall, Peter C.] Univ Alberta, Dept Rural Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Lacy, R.

About 43% of the total observations of bilateral trade flows for the selected regions and products are zero. Therefore, the fixed-effects Heckman Maximum Likelihood estimation procedure is used to account for the zero observations. The results show that, in general, the three regions (Canada, the EU countries, United States) face statistically significant and positive income elasticities from developing countries. However, only Canadian and United States' exports of agri-food products benefit from elastic income elasticities. Middle-income developing countries are the growth market of the future as growth in their expenditures on agri-food imports outpaces the growth in their per capita incomes. Homotheticity is consistently rejected for Canada and the EU and less often for the United States. Thus, income plays an important role in agri-food trade; however, further investigation is needed to better understand the forces that generate rather widely divergent results across countries and products.","[Meilke, Karl] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,,zhaq@uoguelph.ca; kmeilke@uoguelph.ca,,"Haq, Zahoor/0000-0001-6813-6746",,,,,25,4,4,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The resulting system of equations is estimated with two-stage least squares (2SLS), showing that this sample of Malian cotton producers have responded to prices in a relatively inelastic manner, with supply elasticities only about one-half of those estimated for producers in developed countries.

The purpose of this article is to analyse the demand for wheat delineated by protein class. A choice-based econometric model is specified and estimated using a novel dataset of pooled wheat shipments to individual importing countries. Buyers are importing countries that make purchase decisions among different protein levels. The model frames the choice in terms of attributes of the choice and of the importing countries. Results indicate that there have been shifts over time, and purchase probabilities are highly price elastic and vary across importing regions. Functional characteristics including wet gluten content and extraction rates have significant impacts on purchase probabilities. These results have implications for breeders as it clearly illustrates the role of protein and functional characteristics on demand. The results also have implications for analysts modelling wheat trade in that there are many factors impacting market segments that would not be captured in conventional demand specifications.","[Wilson, William W.; Dahl, Bruce] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Wilson, Wesley] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; University of Oregon,"Wilson, WW (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",william.wilson@ndsu.edu,"Wilson, Wesley W/A-4256-2013",,,,,,27,1,1,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

We use OECD's procedure for decomposing changes in the market price support part of producer support estimates as the starting point for our decomposition method, and our method provides a basis for critiquing OECD's decomposition approach. The transmission of changes in border prices (world prices and the exchange rate) to domestic prices is a key element in the decomposition. The method is demonstrated using Russian agricultural price gaps. The results support the argument that for Russian agriculture during the transition period, the main cause of changes in price gaps has been incomplete transmission of changes in the exchange rate to domestic prices, and where the weak transmission results mainly not from policy intervention, but rather from deficient market conditions, in particular poor market infrastructure. The policy implication is that underdeveloped infrastructure has strongly limited the benefits to the Russian economy from agricultural trade liberalization.","Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20036 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Liefert, WM (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, 1800 M St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",wliefert@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,27,6,6,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the essential change of the relationship from the fiscal term since the beginning of the new century. Design/methodology/approach - Utilizing first-hand survey data, this paper illustrates the changes of relationship between state and peasants by certain qualitative and quantitative approaches. Findings - Recent positive changes in China have seen the creation of a new public finance system designed to improve equality within basic public services not only for the world's largest population but also the world's largest number of peasants. This development has produced a change in the relationship between state and peasant from take more to take less. Research limitations/implications - The sample size used in the empirical studies in this paper is relatively small. In addition, the studies focus only on the effects of relationships in the fiscal term while the social impacts are neglected.

Options for specification of entitlement and allocation regimes in ways that have hydrological integrity are presented.

Owing to market liberalization and globalization, one of the most challenging issues along agri-food chains in China is becoming the issue of how to link these small-scale farmers into the modern chains. Consequently, it is essential for both policy makers and private sectors to understand the governance structure in agri-food supply chains. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework for supply chain governance, including its antecedents and consequences, as well as a series of hypotheses for empirical testing. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual framework of chain governance is proposed in this study, where governance structure consists of two dimensions: contractual governance and relational governance. The study intends to propose a complementary relationship between contracts and relational aspects, such as trust, in the Chinese context. Future research is needed to empirically test this model. Findings - The proposed conceptual model is unique, since the majority of the articles addressing this topic focuses on contract farming while limited research touches upon the issues of trust and relations. However, a combination of both contracting and relationships are seldom addressed.

We demonstrate that the interaction of market power and government intervention may lead to outcomes that are counter to key results of policy analysis for perfectly competitive markets. We show that market power may reduce or eliminate entirely the net welfare benefits from removing two traditional support mechanisms, price floors and deficiency payments, and may increase considerably the government's cost of implementing either of them. Accordingly, optimally designed price support measures may improve welfare in the presence of downstream oligopoly and/or oligopsony power.","[Russo, Carlo] Univ Cassino, Fac Econ, Cassino, Italy; [Goodhue, Rachael E.; Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Cassino; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Russo, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino, Fac Econ, Cassino, Italy.",,,"Goodhue, Rachael/0000-0003-4576-9035",,,,,16,21,28,1,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We use an experimental elicitation method, the random nth price auction, to identify consumers' valuation for traceable imported beef. We also analyse the effect of different types of information on these valuations. Results indicate that consumers are generally willing to pay a 39 per cent premium for the traceable imported beef over similar beef without traceability. Results also suggest that in contrast to the insignificant effect of positive information, negative and two-sided information about traceability significantly reduces WTP.","[Lee, Ji Yong] Korea Rural Econ Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Han, Doo Bong; Lim, Song Soo] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Korea University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Lee, JY (通讯作者)，Korea Rural Econ Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",han@korea.ac.kr,"Lim, Song Soo/Q-1560-2015; Lim, Song Soo/AAQ-7712-2020","Lim, Song Soo/0000-0002-2894-1879",,,,,21,56,60,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Under root mean squared error (RMSE), the futures market forecast is most accurate at the first and second horizon but less accurate than Iowa outlook and the other forecast methods at the third horizon. In terms of the individual time-series models, some vector autoregressions (VARs) and Bayesian VARs flexible in specification and estimation and model averaging tend to perform better than Iowa outlook forecasts. Evidence from encompassing tests, more stringent tests of forecast performance, indicates that many price forecasts can add incremental information to the Iowa forecast. Simple combinations of these models and outlook forecasts are able to reduce forecast errors by economically significant levels. Overall, the results indicate that it is possible to provide more accurate forecasts than Iowa outlook at every horizon.","[Colino, Evelyn V.] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Escuela Econ Adm & Turismo, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Irwin, Scott H.; Garcia, Philip] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Colino, EV (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Escuela Econ Adm & Turismo, Villegas 147, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",Evelyn.dv.colino@gmail.com,"Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020; Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848",Aurene T.

We explore whether this is true by conducting an econometric ex post evaluation of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the three East German States Brandenburg, Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt. Whereas previous studies have employed descriptive statistics or qualitative methods and have looked at single policy instruments in isolation, we apply a difference-in-differences estimator to analyze the employment effects of the entire portfolio of CAP measures simultaneously. Based on panel data at the county level, we find that investment aids and transfers to less-favored areas had a zero marginal employment effect. We present evidence that full decoupling of direct payments in 2005 led to labor shedding, as it made transfer payments independent of factor allocation. Spending on modern technologies in processing and marketing and measures aimed at the development of rural areas led to job losses in agriculture. Agrienvironmental measures, on the other hand, kept labor-intensive technologies in production or induced them. This analysis calls into question whether an expansion of existing second pillar measures is a reasonable way to use funds modulated away from the first pillar.","[Petrick, Martin; Zier, Patrick] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Petrick, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",petrick@iamo.de,"Petrick, Martin/AAI-1154-2020; Policy, Department Agricultural/X-9655-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012",,"agrienvironmental program for the extensive use of agricultural land (Kulturlandschaftsprogramm KULAP) [EC 1254/1999, EC 1673/2000, EC 2529/2001, EC 1782/2003]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)",agrienvironmental program for the extensive use of agricultural land (Kulturlandschaftsprogramm KULAP); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Table A1 presents the components of the eight policy aggregates used in the analysis of this article.

Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology has strictly followed the recommended scale development procedures, which include specifying each constructs, item generation, data collection, reliability and validity test, and finally test hypothesis. The primary data were collected in October 2008 in Hubei Province, China. Both exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis are applied to assess the reliability and validity of the three constructs. Findings - In total, 22 items were retained to measure six dimensions for the three core concepts: contract (marketing and production), trust (reliability and benevolence), and market environments (diversity and volatility). Second, the finding supported this argument that contracts and trust functions as complements. Furthermore, a positive relationship between environmental uncertainty and the use of contractual governance was found. Research limitations/implications - The measurement model for environmental volatility is less satisfied. More research should be carried out on the measurement of market environment in the future. Originality/value - This paper identifies and validates key constructs underlying supply chain management research: contract, trust and market environment, in a Chinese context. These measurable concepts could be applied in similar settings to further investigate small-scale farmer's position along the supply chain.","[Zhang, Xiaoyong] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, LEI, The Hague, Netherlands; [Hu, Dinghuan] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Wageningen University & Research; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,"Zhang, XY (通讯作者)，Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, LEI, The Hague, Netherlands.",xiaoyong.zhang@wur.nl,,,Dutch funding agency,Dutch funding agency,The authors wish to thank Ms Zhao Qun and Mr Ben Kamphuis for their great help in data collection and Dr Jos Bartels and Dr Ivo van der Lans for their valuable comments on the research methodology.

In the frame of the solved grant projects, there was developed the basic methodology for the losses on the immovable property in the territory assessment and consequently the database of input data for its use. The output of the described methodology enables the comparison of the potential losses on immovable property with the investment costs for the flood protection measures. In order to be able to estimate the occurred losses, the own method has been developed by the members of the research team. This method consists of the specification of the territorial property valuation and the evaluation of the damage on the territorial property caused by floods. The basic quality of the Territorial Property Index is that it respects the generally defined structure of the real estate property in the given area. The Territorial Property Index is then calculated for the individual area categories. While evaluating the damage, first the measure of the damages of the property representatives depending on the hydrological situation defined in advance must be investigated. The damages are then estimated based on three defined primary parameters.","[Korytarova, Jana; Hromadka, Vit] Brno Univ Technol, Inst Struct Econ, Fac Civil Engn, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Korytárová, J (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Inst Struct Econ, Fac Civil Engn, Rybkova 1, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",korytarova.j@fce.vutbr.cz,"Hromadka, Vit/G-5587-2019; Korytárová, Jana/E-1253-2019","Hromadka, Vit/0000-0002-9590-9828; Korytarova, Jana/0000-0002-0046-0141","Czech Science Foundation [103/05/0160]; Institute of Structural Economics and Management, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno University of Technology","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Institute of Structural Economics and Management, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno University of Technology","Supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Project No. 103/05/0160) and by the Institute of Structural Economics and Management, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno University of Technology.",,5,8,8,0,6,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The effects are measured using a censored, two-stage, least-square regression. Findings - The results show that the effects of market liberalization on planting decisions are more significant in the case of crops with minimum support price (rice, wheat, and corn) than in the case of crops where planting decision is determined by market prices (cotton and soybean). The effects appear to be different across regions and time zones and more significant in 1993 than in 2005. Originality/value - The result suggests that market liberalization along the past ten years achieved significant effects in Chinese farmers planting decision. This outcome should be taken into consideration when evaluating and implementing future Chinese agricultural policy income-based interventions as a means to meet domestic food security goals and increase farmers' income level.","[Pan, Suwen] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Cotton Econ Res Inst, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [He, Xiurong] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; China Agricultural University,"Pan, SW (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Cotton Econ Res Inst, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",s.pan@ttu.edu,,,,,,,25,3,4,0,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This paper asks the question of how much an established irrigator would pay for water and at what price farmers planning to expand the area they have under irrigation would consider paying for the right to access water. An analytical framework is developed to estimate the net present value of both annual and perennial agricultural activities in the Murrumbidgee catchment. Using these estimates the total value of water used in Murrumbidgee catchment is estimated. An aggregate water supply curve is derived for the catchment from where water may be acquired from irrigators for environmental flows.","[Qureshi, Muhammad Ejaz] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Gungahlin, ACT, Australia; [Qureshi, Muhammad Ejaz] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Ranjan, Ram] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst Wembley, Wembley, WA, Australia; [Qureshi, Sumaira Ejaz] Australian Natl Univ, Inst Math Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University,"Qureshi, ME (通讯作者)，CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Gungahlin, ACT, Australia.",ejaz.qureshi@csiro.au,"Kirby, John M/D-2249-2013; Qureshi, Ejaz E/G-5567-2010","Qureshi, Sumaira/0009-0009-2857-4755",,,,,31,20,21,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The article estimates returns to scale relationships across dairy farms of different sizes and across different regions, incorporating variables hypothesized to influence farm performance. Results point to significant scale economies in U.S. dairy farms and underscore the importance of taking account of inefficiency when estimating scale economies. Contrary to previous research, the preferred cost function specification does not show a region of decreasing returns to scale. This finding helps explain why the average size of dairy farms has been increasing.","[Lovell, C. A. Knox] Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Lovell, C. A.

In order to investigate the conversion decisions of Dutch arable farms, a discrete stochastic dynamic utility-efficient programming (DUEP) model is developed with special attention for yield and price risk of conventional, conversion and organic crops. The model maximizes the expected utility of the farmer depending on the farmer's risk attitude. The DUEP model is an extension of a dynamic linear programming model that maximized the labour income of conversion from conventional to organic farming over a 10 year planning horizon. The DUEP model was used to model a typical farm for the central clay region in the Netherlands. The results show that for a risk-neutral farmer it is optimal to convert to organic farming. However, for a more risk-averse farmer it is only optimal to fully convert if policy incentives are applied such as taxes on pesticides or subsidies on conversion, or if the market for the organic products becomes more stable.","[Acs, Szvetlana; Berentsen, Paul; Huirne, Ruud] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Business Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Asseldonk, Marcel] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Inst Risk Management Agr & Agr Econ, Res Inst, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Acs, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Business Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",paul.berentsen@wur.nl,"Berentsen, Paul/P-6457-2014","Berentsen, Paul/0000-0001-9675-1041",,,,,40,44,52,2,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

An optimisation model is developed to estimate the economic value of quota. Quota values are aggregated to derive quota sale and purchase curves under two scenarios: first, where quotas can be traded nationally and second, where the trade of quota is regionally restricted. Quota trade is simulated and the consequent effects on supplier structure estimated. Through the derivation of sectoral cumulative cost curves it is possible to estimate the impact of regionalising quota trade on sector efficiency. The model is solved using National Farm Survey data from Ireland and the inefficiencies of regionalised quota trade in Ireland are estimated at Euro27 million. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of restricted quota trade, especially in the context of eventual quota removal.","[Hennessy, Thia; Shrestha, Shailesh] Rural Econ Res Ctr, Galway, Ireland; [Shalloo, Laurence] Moorepk Res Ctr, Cork, Ireland; [Wallace, Michael] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr Food Sci & Vet Med, Dublin, Ireland",Teagasc; Teagasc; University College Dublin,"Hennessy, T (通讯作者)，Rural Econ Res Ctr, Galway, Ireland.",thia.hennessy@teagasc.ie,"Shrestha, Shailesh/J-5366-2019","Shrestha, Shailesh/0000-0001-6053-0212; Hennessy, Thia/0000-0002-6137-1249","Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Stimulus Research","Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Stimulus Research","Thia Hennessy and Shailesh Shrestha are researchers at the Rural Economy Research Centre, Teagasc, Galway, Ireland.

The model is applied to recent genetically modified corn adoption data from Minnesota and Wisconsin farmers, using a mixed-multinomial logit (MMNL) model to estimate the effects of traits and farm and farmer characteristics on adoption outcomes.

Degradation of reefs may affect the number of tourists visiting the reef and, consequently, the economic sectors that rely on healthy reefs for their income generation. This study uses a contingent behaviour approach to estimate the effect of reef degradation on demand for recreational dive and snorkel trips, for a case study of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Results from a negative binomial random effects panel model show that the consumer surplus current reef visitors derive from a diving or snorkelling trip is approximately A$185 per trip. Furthermore, results indicate that reef trips by divers and snorkellers could go down by as much as 80 per cent given a hypothetical decrease in coral and fish biodiversity. This corresponds to a decrease in tourism expenditure by divers and snorkellers on full-day reef trips in the Cairns management area of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park of about A$103 million per year.","[Kragt, Marit E.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Roebeling, Peter C.] Univ Aveiro, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal; [Ruijs, Arjan] Royal Haskoning, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Kragt, Marit E.] Australian Natl Univ, Integrated Catchment Assessment & Management Ctr, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University; Universidade de Aveiro; Australian National University,"Kragt, ME (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, 13 Ellery Crescent, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",marit.kragt@anu.edu.au,"Kragt, Marit E./D-3185-2011; Roebeling, Peter/G-6233-2011","Kragt, Marit E./0000-0001-6847-4817; Roebeling, Peter/0000-0002-2421-9299",,,,,39,63,67,3,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In equilibrium there is considerable variation in transport prices because transport prices rise when the demand to ship goods exceeds the capacity limit. This variation is necessary to attract shipping capacity into the industry. In turn, prices in different locations differ by a time varying amount.

Given the importance of major food staples to both poor and nonpoor households in production and consumption, introducing a poverty dimension revealed no significant shift in priorities compared with those implied by efficiency. The results showed that neither the additional benefits to the poor nor the foregone benefits to society are significant from prioritizing research according to equity-relative to efficiency-criteria. As current priorities are supported by neither efficiency nor equity criteria, however, there is considerable scope for maximizing research benefits to the poor through informed reallocation of research resources.

Evidence shows that strong property rights to reservation and reserve land and natural resources, whether communal or individual, are and always have been important determinants of productivity. Political and legal institutions that are perceived as stable and predictable to tribal members and to non-Natives also improve economic opportunities for indigenous people living on reservations and reserves. Research reviewed here also shows that culture and acculturation are important in the development process. Although our emphasis is on North America, the findings are applicable to indigenous people in other parts of the world and shed light on growth questions that loom large for developing countries around the world.","[Anderson, Terry L.] PERC, Bozeman, MT USA; [Parker, Dominic P.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Anderson, TL (通讯作者)，PERC, Bozeman, MT USA.",tla@perc.org; dparker@bren.ucsb.edu,,,PERC; Hoover Institution,PERC; Hoover Institution,The authors wish to thank PERC and the Hoover Institution for their support of this research.,,39,20,31,2,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

These situations are all examples of the 'The Tragedy of the Commons'. In this paper, I consider options for mitigating the losses of open access: common or group property regimes, government tax and regulation policy, more formal private property rights.

Using panel data from 2002 to 2007 and a survey conducted in January 2008, households are clustered by the survey respondent's risk perceptions and attitudes toward beef. For each cluster, two-stage meat demand systems are constructed, incorporating the demographic characteristics of the households and BSE media coverage. The analysis for the entire panel and for each of the clusters suggests that beef risk attitudes and perceptions do affect household-purchasing behavior. Households with lower willingness to accept the risks of eating beef have more elastic beef demand and more willingness to substitute beef for other meats as compared to the household clusters with higher willingness to accept the risks of eating beef. BSE media coverage has stronger negative influences on households with lower willingness to accept the risks of beef. Across the entire sample, beef demand is more responsive to media coverage of BSE after the May 2003 domestic BSE case.","[Yang, Jun; Goddard, Ellen] Univ Alberta, Dept Rural Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada",University of Alberta,"Goddard, E (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Rural Econ, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",jy8@ualberta.ca; ellen.goddard@ualberta.ca,,"Goddard, Ellen/0000-0002-5638-0562",Alberta Prion Research Institute; University of Alberta,Alberta Prion Research Institute; University of Alberta(University of Alberta),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the helpful comments of two reviewers and Elwin Smith, and financial support provided by the Alberta Prion Research Institute, the Co-operative Program in Agricultural Marketing and Business at the University of Alberta, and the University of Alberta.",,61,20,23,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The increasing use of water in industrial, urban, and agricultural applications together with the continuous increase in population require the proposal of efficient solutions. In the case of agricultural use, it is necessary to not only maximize the economic benefits, but also to establish optimal water-saving crop planning, especially for water-deficient regions. Due to the multi-objective nature of these problems, the decision-making process is complex. Fortunately, the increase in computational resources available in recent years has allowed researchers to develop efficient computational algorithms to deal with real and complex optimization problems, including agricultural ones. In particular, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are known for their ability to optimize several objective functions simultaneously to provide a representative set of the Pareto front, which is a set of problem solutions representing a trade-off between the best values of each of the objectives. This article proposes solving a multi-objective crop planning problem using two Pareto-based MOEAs. Results obtained when solving this problem using real data collected from a large number of greenhouses in Spain to show the advantages of using these multi-objective approaches.","[Marquez, Antonio L.; Banos, Raul; Gil, Consolacion; Montoya, Maria G.] Univ Almeria, Dept Comp Architecture & Elect, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Manzano-Agugliaro, Francisco; Montoya, Francisco G.] Univ Almeria, Dept Rural Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain",Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria,"Márquez, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Almeria, Dept Comp Architecture & Elect, La Canada San Urbano S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain.",almarquez@ual.es,"Manzano-Agugliaro, Francisco/K-8184-2014; Baños, Raúl/D-6433-2013; Gil Montoya, Consolacion/D-1335-2015; Gil Montoya, Francisco/L-8067-2014","Manzano-Agugliaro, Francisco/0000-0002-0085-030X; Baños, Raúl/0000-0001-7844-4902; Gil Montoya, Consolacion/0000-0001-8663-8395; Gil Montoya, Francisco/0000-0003-4105-565X","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [TIN2008-01117, CTM2007-66639/TECNO]; Regional Government of Andalusia [P2007-TIC-02988]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Regional Government of Andalusia(Junta de Andalucia),"This work has been financed by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (TIN2008-01117 and CTM2007-66639/TECNO), and the Regional Government of Andalusia (P2007-TIC-02988, in part financed by the European Regional Development Fund).",,29,31,32,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

It is based on the estimation of a threshold vector autoregressive econometric model that is shown capable of taking the workings of the import regime into account.

However, there are few valuation studies that have addressed natural resource management (NRM) changes in Tasmania. Furthermore, few studies have focussed on the estimation of estuary values. The CE study described in this paper aims to analyse community preferences for NRM options in the George catchment, Tasmania. Catchment health attributes were: the length of native riverside vegetation; the number of rare native animal and plant species in the George catchment; and area of healthy seagrass beds in the Georges Bay, which was used as a measure of estuary condition. Mixed logit models with interactions between socio-economic variables and the choice attributes were estimated to account for systematic and random taste heterogeneity across respondents. Results reveal considerable variation in preferences towards the attributes and show that value estimates are significantly impacted by the way in which we account for preference heterogeneity. Preference heterogeneity thus needs to be considered when estimating community willingness-to-pay for environmental changes. This study further shows little responsiveness to the presented changes in estuary seagrass area.","[Kragt, Marit E.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Bennett, J.

It complements the existing theory of groundwater use, which assumes away the possibility of demand perfect inelasticity. Under perfectly inelastic water demand, the common-pool resource dilemma is by-passed if groundwater users are equally productive in water use. If they are not, a new type of inefficiency can arise due to the lack of a rationing mechanism on the basis of productivity. Our analysis suggests that groundwater management research should pay more attention to water demand elasticity and productivity heterogeneity.","[Wang, Chenggang; Segarra, Eduardo] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Wang, Chenggang] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Wang, CG (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",,,,"College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Texas Tech University","College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Texas Tech University","Chenggang Wang is assistant professor in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at Texas Tech University and in Texas AgriLife Research, Texas A&M University.

This paper expands farmers' options and models their choices of tillage frequency. Less frequent tilling sequesters more carbon but permits a greater accumulation of weeds, whereas more frequent tilling eliminates weeds but releases carbon (tillage emissions). The timing of tillage balances its marginal benefits and costs. Higher payments from industry or government for atmospheric greenhouse gas reductions will increase marginal cost and reduce tillage frequency. Other key parameters, such as higher rates of tillage emissions or reduced weed impact, also influence tillage frequency. However, for the discount rate and the natural decay rate of carbon, the net change depends on the magnitude of other parameters.","Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Wilman, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",,"Vitullo, Marina/ABB-9483-2020",,BIOCAP Canada Foundation; Alberta Environment,BIOCAP Canada Foundation; Alberta Environment,"Elizabeth A.

The influence of the weight of an animal on the daily growth tells us that the growth is increased with the increase of the entry weight to 19 kg and with the exit weight of the fattened animal of 100 kg. The growth is decreased over these weights. The relationship between the daily growth and the feed costs by a feeding day shows us the tendency of the increase of a daily growth with the increase of the feed costs. With the increase of labour inputs to 2.6 hours/100 kg of the live weight and the increased profit to 29 monetary units, first, the daily growth is decreased, and, then, it begins to grow. Labour productivity grows with the increase of the capacity usage to 87%, and, then, it decreases. The influence of the feedlot capacity usage on the productivity measured by the correlation coefficient is 0.756 at the risk level of 1%. With the increase of the feedlot capacity usage, the economics of production is increased and the cost price is decreased. The economics of the production of pork meat is increased with a decreasing rate with the increase of the daily growth. The manifold influence of the examined factors on the economics movement is low (R = -0.355). The partial influence of the costs to the economy is 90.3% that of the direct costs is 80.3%, from which the feed costs have an influence of 51.7%. The influence of the indirect costs on the economics is low, but with their increase, the economics is decreased. It has been noticed that the economics changes can be explained with 66.8% by the change of the relationship of the selling and purchasing price of pigs and the purchasing price of feed concentrate. By the relationship of the price of the fattened animals and the feed concentrate lower than 1 : 5, the economic result is below 1, and above the previously mentioned parity, the economics is increased as well as the economic effects of production.","[Babovic, Jovan; Caric, Marko; Djordjevic, Dragomir] Univ Business Acad, Fac Econ & Engn Management, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Lazic, Stevo] Republ Inst Stat, Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia",,"Babovic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Business Acad, Fac Econ & Engn Management, Cvecarska 2, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",babovic@fimek.edu.rs,,"Caric, Marko/0009-0008-7675-9976",,,,,8,8,8,3,29,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Following on from this and taking GM herbicide-tolerant oilseed rape (Brassica napus) as a model crop, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate data and then estimate the effect of several important policy variables (including width of buffer zones and spatial aggregation) on the magnitude of the externality associated with pollen-mediated gene flow.","[Ceddia, Michele Graziano] Univ Reading, Dept Food Econ & Mkt, Reading, Berks, England; [Bartlett, Mark] Univ York, Dept Comp Sci, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [De Lucia, Caterina] Univ York, Dept Environm, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Perrings, Charles] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, EcoSERV Grp, Tempe, AZ USA",University of Reading; University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Ceddia, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Food Econ & Mkt, Reading, Berks, England.",m.ceddia@reading.ac.uk,"de lucia, caterina/AAB-3431-2019; Bartlett, Mark/B-2674-2019","de lucia, caterina/0000-0001-9377-9233; Bartlett, Mark/0000-0003-3383-4100",Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [0832858] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),,,28,13,14,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The differences between the DMEs and DCs in the case of resources (prevalence of DCs) and in the case of outputs and performance (prevalence of DMEs) is evident. The difference in the economic level and the level of living between the DCs and DMEs had deepened during the last three decades, however, it has to be pointed out again, that this difference is increasing still more slowly what can be a presage of an approaching turn (in the sense of the possible beginning of a slow decrease of this gap). While the per capita GDP indicator is regarded as one of the most important indicators of the economic level, the HDI can be regarded as the most important indicator of the given country population level of living and as such, it is hitherto rather underestimated. Similarly, the CPM indicator (as the measure of poverty), which is a composed indicator, has a higher testifying ability than a simple income level per capita in USD defined as the poverty level. It is obvious, that economic development is impossible without social development, and vice versa. Generally, the gap between the more developed developing countries, measured through the world income distribution, is then still widening. As a positive phenomenon, there can be, however, regarded the fact that deepening of this gap occurs at a lower rate. Through a more detailed analysis by the individual indicators, the most valuable from which are the indicators composed from several partial indicators (for example HDI, CPM), a certain tendencies towards the gradual improvement of the socio-economic situation in developing countries as a whole - but with the relevant differences in the individual regions of the world - can be discerned. In general, close ties have been proven between the economic growth and the growth of the population level of living, their mutual influencing and the main elements from which they are composed.","Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Jenícek, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jenicek@vse.cz,,,"Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic [MSM 6138439909]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6138439909).",,18,2,2,0,10,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Some models describe only the behaviour of two companies in the monitored market (duopoly), others describe several companies of the same power (cartel), still others assume that one of the companies has a dominant position in the market, etc. The text of this article deals with oligopolistic competition in the food market in the terms of the behaviour of grocers and with the impact of this competition upon the market competition in the sector. First, it mentions the agreements on common cooperation and procedure, when cartel market structure originates. It also analyzes the examples of behaviour of oligopoly with a dominant firm on the market with products in the food sector, with the goal of detecting whether the market with these products is significantly influenced by the oligopolistic behaviour of companies.","[Severova, Lucie; Kopecka, Lenka; Svoboda, Roman; Brcak, Josef] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Severová, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic.",severova@pef.czu.cz; kopeckal@pef.czu.cz; svobodar@pef.czu.cz; brcak@pef.czu.cz,"Svoboda, Roman/G-3320-2017; Severová, Lucie/J-2548-2017; Brcak, Josef/C-6000-2018; Kopecka, Lenka/J-2617-2017","Brcak, Josef/0000-0001-8430-3073; Kopecka, Lenka/0000-0002-4781-7259","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6046070906]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6046070906).",,12,13,13,3,19,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Many TFP indexes can be further decomposed into measures of technical change, technical efficiency change, scale efficiency change and mix efficiency change. The class of indexes that can be decomposed in this way includes the Fisher, Tornqvist and Hicks-Moorsteen TFP indexes but not the Malmquist TFP index of Caves, Christensen and Diewert (1982). This paper develops data envelopment analysis methodology for computing and decomposing the Hicks-Moorsteen index. The empirical feasibility of the methodology is demonstrated using country-level agricultural data covering the period 1970-2001. The paper explains why relatively small countries tend to be the most productive, and why favourable movements in relative prices tend to simultaneously increase net returns and decrease productivity. Australia appears to have experienced this relative price effect since at least 1970. Thus, if Australia is a price-taker in output and input markets, Australian agricultural policy-makers should not be overly concerned about the estimated 15 per cent decline in agricultural productivity that has taken place over the last three decades.","Univ Queensland, Ctr Efficiency & Prod Anal, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"O'Donnell, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Ctr Efficiency & Prod Anal, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.odonnell@economics.uq.edu.au,,"O'DONNELL, Christopher/0000-0002-0107-7371",Generalitat de Catalunya (Spain),Generalitat de Catalunya (Spain)(Generalitat de Catalunya),"This paper is a revised version of the Presidential Address to the 53rd Annual Conference of the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society.

The two markets share price transmissions, and based on results from an Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model, we find their price volatilities are similar. We argue that China's recent exchange rate reform and its gradual liberalization in bilateral cotton trade since it joined World Trade Organization have had important impacts on these futures markets.

Even though proximity to consumers is important, an increase in agrifood imports does not increase agrifood production with a high demand but makes low-wage regions more attractive. In addition, an increase in imports of agricultural products processed by agrifood firms leads to the reallocation of agrifood production away from regions with good agricultural access and toward those with limited access to agricultural products.","[Bagoulla, Corinne] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Nantes, France; [Chevassus-Lozza, Emmanuelle; Daniel, Karine] LERECO, INRA, UR1134, Nantes, France; [Daniel, Karine] ESA LARESS, Angers, France; [Gaigne, Carl] SMART, INRA, UMR1302, F-35000 Rennes, France",Nantes Universite; INRAE; Ecole Superieure d'Agriculture d'Angers (ESA); Universite de Rennes; INRAE,"Bagoulla, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Nantes, France.",,,"Gaigne, Carl/0000-0002-1540-234X","INRA; CEMAGREF; French Regional Councils of Basse-Normandie, Bretagne, Pays de la Loire; Poitou-Charentes","INRA; CEMAGREF; French Regional Councils of Basse-Normandie, Bretagne, Pays de la Loire; Poitou-Charentes(Region Nouvelle-Aquitaine)","The project was part of the research project CLAP (Competitiveness, Location of Activities, and Public Policies) run in the framework of the For and About Regional Development program (PSDRGO).

Specifically, I use survey data on a sample of 480 households from semirural areas of south-western Nigeria to analyze the response of per capita calorie intake to changes in women's share of household income, after controlling for per capita income and demographic characteristics at individual, household, and community levels. I also examine the effect of marginal increases in household income on per capita calorie intake conditional on the income distribution factor: women's share of income. My results suggest that redistributing household income from men to women would neither raise per capita food energy intake nor increase the quality of food calorie source of households in rural south-western Nigeria. I also find that while the income elasticity of quantity of calorie intake is close to zero, income elasticity for quality of calorie intake is substantially positive. I conclude that neither gender-neutral household income increases nor redistribution of household income in favor of women would substantially motivate increased amounts of food energy intake within households in the population under study. However, gender neutral increase in household income is likely to substantially increase the household demand for high-quality food calorie sources.","Univ Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Farm Management, Abeokuta, Nigeria","University of Agriculture, Abeokuta","Aromolaran, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Farm Management, PMB 2240, Abeokuta, Nigeria.",adebayo.aromolaran@sbcglobal.net,,"Aromolaran, Adebayo B/0000-0003-2027-7659","African Economic Research Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya; Rockefeller Foundation; Yale University","African Economic Research Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya; Rockefeller Foundation; Yale University","I thank the African Economic Research Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya, and the Rockefeller Foundation Grant for postdoctoral research on the economics of the family in low-income countries, Yale University, for providing the financial support for this study.

A large farm-level data set and a logistic regression model were used to examine the determinants of farm succession decisions in the United States, with special emphasis given to the treatment of endogenous wealth and farm size variables.

The paper outlines a series of factors for the delay in the negotiations. The author contends that if developed countries had been more proactive on a trade and development agenda, then there could have been an agreement reached several months ago. Such a developmentally friendly agenda could involve (i) better Special and Differential Treatment on market access and more flexible market access protection for developing countries, (ii) a binding commitment to increase aid for trade assistance, (iii) more resources to provide human resource capacity building in export marketing in developing countries, (iv) an agreement for the termination of trade distorting domestic support, and (v) revisions to the SPS Agreement to accommodate the concerns of developing countries. A developmentally friendly agreement would likely still allow the majority of the Doha Round gains to be realized by developed countries.

The model integrates a wide range of engineering, environmental, and economic factors, including estimated production functions based on agronomic experimental data, as well as demand functions for vegetative agricultural products. The model is applied to the case of Israel, comprising 14 groups of municipalities as the source of organic municipal solid waste and wastewater-treatment sludge, 8 composting plants, and 13 agricultural regions; the latter constitute the source of livestock manure and are the consumers of compost to be potentially applied to 42 crops. From a social point of view, 90% of the compost's potential production was found to be warranted. This efficient solution, however, does not emerge under the base-year-observed situation, largely because of the absence of source separation of organic municipal solid waste and the farmers' lack of awareness of compost's advantages as a substitute for conventional fertilizers and as a soil-amending product. Consequently, most of the organic wastes are disposed of by landfilling, resulting in a loss of $102 million per year in terms of net social benefits. While the consumers of agricultural products are expected to benefit from a shift from the base-year situation to the efficient solution, most of their gain is expected to come at the expense of the farming sector. Nevertheless, the appearance of the efficient solution does not depend on administrative compensation payments, but on the removal of bottlenecks. Potential government intervention strategies to promote the change are analyzed.","[Kan, Iddo] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Ayalon, Ofira; Federman, Roy] Univ Haifa, Nat Resource & Environm Res Ctr, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Haifa,"Kan, I (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, POB 12, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",kan@agri.huji.ac.il,,,Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection,Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection,"The authors thank the reviewer and editor for helpful comments, and the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection for funding support.",,45,15,18,0,40,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This means a 100 per cent cut in the tobacco leaf tax rate would necessitate an increase in the cigarette excise tax rate of between 6.3 and 12.7 per cent. Sensitivity analysis indicates SEE is most sensitive to the retail demand elasticity and oligopoly power and least sensitive to input substitution elasticity and returns to scale. Originality/value - This paper provides a framework to analyze the policy effects of the Chinese tobacco industry. The findings in this study are very important for government to make policies in the future,"[Cai, Hailong; Wang, Xiuqing] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Cai, HL (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",caihlmail@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,3,4,1,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The key difference between the proposed estimator and the two-step estimator is that the parameters of the binary censoring equations are estimated using a distribution-free single-index model.

Adoption has been rapid by farmers in the central valley of the watershed, while farmers at higher altitudes, lacking transferable land titles that could serve as mortgage collateral, have been unable to obtain loans for greenhouse investment. The objectives of the paper are both methodological and empirical. On the methodological side, it shows that econometrically estimated models of farm household behavior are useful to design and to parameterize an agent-based model. On the empirical side, simulation results show that if mortgage collateral would not be required, then adoption in the upper part of the watershed could reach nearly 77% of farm households by 2020, as compared to about 36% under current conditions. Furthermore results suggest a significant increase in incomes related to the innovation and a substantially greater irrigation water use, especially in the central part. As bell pepper under greenhouses has replaced pesticide-intensive chrysanthemum, it has declined average levels of pesticide use. Nevertheless, pesticide use is high and farmers are struggling to control pests, which raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the innovation.","[Schreinemachers, Pepijn; Berger, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim 490D, Dept Land Use Econ Trop & Subtrop, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Schreinemachers, Pepijn] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agr, Uplands Program, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Sirijinda, Aer; Praneetvatakul, Suwanna] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Bangkok 10900, Thailand",University Hohenheim; Chiang Mai University; Kasetsart University,"Schreinemachers, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim 490D, Dept Land Use Econ Trop & Subtrop, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",p.schreinemachers@uni-hohenheim.de; i490d@uni-hohenheim.de; fecoasj@ku.ac.th; fecoswp@ku.ac.th,"Borve, Knut/I-5934-2012; Pettersson, Lars G.M./F-8428-2011; Pettersson, Lars GM/J-4925-2013","Borve, Knut/0000-0002-5782-8963; Schreinemachers, Pepijn/0000-0003-1596-3179; Berger, Thomas/0000-0003-3316-9614",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB-564],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),We acknowledge the financial support of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under SFB-564.

Consumers in all three countries have risk perceptions shaped by their level of reliance on observable and credence attribute information. Risk perceptions of consumers in each country are significantly higher for those less trusting of doctors. Moreover, personal and indirect food safety experiences substantially affect risk perceptions.

This article examines the effect of participation in nonfarm activities on crop expenses of farm households in Nigeria. The relationship is modeled using a nonseparable agricultural household model that suggests that participating in nonfarm activities can relax the credit constraints facing farm households and reduce risk thereby helping households improve farm production and smooth consumption over time. The results show that participation in nonfarm activities by Nigerian farmers has a positive and significant effect on crop expenses and in particular on payments for hired labor and inorganic fertilizers. Separate analysis of the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria indicates that it is in the South-South and South-East zones where nonfarm participation appears to induce more hiring of labor. The results support the hypothesis that nonfarm participation helps relax liquidity constraints but suggests how that liquidity is used is zone-specific. In general, the results also indicate that liquidity is used more to pay for inputs into staple production as opposed to cash crops.","[Oseni, Gbemisola] World Bank, AFTAR, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Winters, Paul] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",The World Bank; American University,"Oseni, G (通讯作者)，World Bank, AFTAR, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",goseni@worldbank.org,"Winters, Paul/HKE-8169-2023","Winters, Paul/0000-0001-9976-4534",,,,,21,72,93,1,28,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Some papers have also inadvertently assumed that although farmland values are influenced by prices realised by nearby sales, these sales need not necessarily be comparable in terms of their attributes. Using data on sales of farmland obtained through public auctions in England and Wales, this paper examines the consequences of explicitly allowing for the presence of a spatio-temporal lag in the estimation of hedonic models of farmland value. The results indicate that spatio-temporally lagged values of the dependent and independent variables contribute significant additional explanatory power. Accounting for spatio-temporal relationships appears moreover to somewhat alter the perceived size and statistical significance of key farmland attributes.","Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Maddison, D (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",d.j.maddison@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,33,38,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

In addition to the implementation analysis of these programming documents, the article also describes territorial distribution of direct subsidies and state aid over the monitored period of 2004-2007. A summarized overview is given for the drawdown of all types of subsidies and their proportionate amounts. The evaluation of all subsidies has shown that most of them were paid to the Northern and Eastern parts of Slovakia, due to the agroenvironmental and direct payments (mostly LFA). The article also describes, in quantitative terms, the social and economic impact of investment subsidies from the Sectoral Operational Programme Agriculture and Rural Development and the Rural Development Plan 2004-2006, based on the monitoring indicators of result and impact. The comparison of the socio-economic development of the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of investment subsidies from the SOP and RDP has shown a faster growth in income of the beneficiaries, as well as a faster growth of labour productivity. Also, the subsidies significantly helped to reduce the decrease in employment and/or helped to maintain the employment in agriculture.","[Buchta, S.] Res Inst Agr & Food Econ, Bratislava 82480, Slovakia; [Buchta, T.] Univ Trnava, Fac Law, Dept Int & European Law, Trnava, Slovakia",University of Trnava,"Buchta, S (通讯作者)，Res Inst Agr & Food Econ, Trencianska 55, Bratislava 82480, Slovakia.",stanislav.buchta@vuepp.sk; buchtatomas@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,12,13,0,17,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The limited predicative ability of all indicators as compared to th recommended values is revealed in the first part of the paper. The second part of the article proves the hypothesis of the efficiency of indices in the inter-enterprise and time comparison. According to this hypothesis, holdings with a higher index value should be more successful in the following years. This part of investigation has shown the conditional efficiency of the Gurcik index and the IN99 index for the prediction of the increase in the value of a company. The relation between the calculated value of an index and the value of its future profit/loss has been proved for those indices. The possibilities how to predict a bankruptcy are limited. Agricultural holdings are threatened both with a long-term negative profitability and with a sudden fluctuation in the profit/loss from operations together with a high debt ratio. Each type of danger largely applies to a different kind of holding and each type of danger is indicated by a different kind of index. The possible problems with the long-term negative profitability have been indicated reliably by the OP index of financial health and by the Gurcik index. Problems with solvency have been partially predicted by the IN95 index and the Chrastinova index (these results were not statistically significant). The final part of the paper is aimed at the analysis of the advantages and disadvantaged of individual indices. A number of financial indicators for agricultural holdings correlate with the future development of a holding but the relation is non-linear (e.g. debt ratio indicators) or outweighed by another factor (e.g. activity indicators, where the development corresponds rather to the production specialization). Another reason for unsatisfactory results of the prediction are the frequent extreme values of the non-standardized indicators. The predicative ability of individual indicators is also reduced by the unsuitable setting of weights for indicators.","Univ S Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Kopta, D (通讯作者)，Univ S Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",kopta@ef.jcu.cz,"Kopta, Daniel/AAG-2730-2019","Kopta, Daniel/0000-0002-6122-6332","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6007665806]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6007665806).",,9,16,16,0,17,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

This paper derived the indirect utility function in terms of expenditure and price through the use of nonlinear demand quadratic almost ideal demand system (QUADS) model to estimate price, expenditure and elasticities of food items consumed in the North-Central, Nigeria, and the impact of the socio-economic variables on households' food demand. Design/methodology/approach - The primary data used came from random selection of 396 households between 2006 and 2007 through a stratified random sampling procedure from Kwara and Kogi states making up the North Central zone in Nigeria. Findings - All own price elasticities of the six food groups analyzed (root and tubers - RT, cereal - CR, legume - LG, animal protein - AP, fruits and vegetable - FV, fats and oil) showed that they are price inelastic. The results of income elasticity show that AP consumption is the most sensitive to income changes, while fats and oil is the least sensitive to income changes. Factors that positively and significantly affected demand for LG, FV, AP, CR and RT were household size (HSZ), level of education, primary occupation, access to credit, presence of children <= 6 years mainly at P < 0.01. HSZ (P < 0.01) negatively affected demand for AP. Originality/value - This paper is original and novel in that it examines the impact of socio-economic variables on households' food demand. High-income elasticities of demand for ill the food groups in QUAIDS except fruits and vegetable, as well as fats and oils, suggests that income-generating policies will foster higher levels of consumption for these commodities.","[Obayelu, Abiodun Elijah; Okoruwa, V.

The primary data were collected from 180 maize farmers representing 12 village development committees (VDCs) including one municipality of the district during May-June 2005 for the cropping year 2004-2005. Among various factors, use of manure accounted the highest share in the production cost followed by labour and tractor costs. The maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the parameters revealed that estimated coefficients of cost of tractor, animal power, labour, fertilizer, manure, seed and maize output gave positive coefficients and were significant at 5% level. Further, quantitative estimates obtained from the cost function shows the mean cost efficiency of 1.634 indicating that an average maize farms from the study incurred about 63% costs above the frontier cost-an indication of inefficiency. Also, the significant years of schooling of the household head and maize area in the inefficiency model indicated the positive effect of these factors on cost efficiency of the farms. From the analysis of scale effect among maize farms, it was revealed that the maize farms experienced an increasing return to scale, that is, the output increased more proportionately than the total production cost.","[Paudel, P.] Ehime Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908566, Japan; [Matsuoka, A.] Ehime Univ, Fac Agr, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908566, Japan",Ehime University; Ehime University,"Paudel, P (通讯作者)，Ehime Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Tarumi 3-5-7, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908566, Japan.",paudelp@agr.ehime-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,24,16,16,1,8,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Both Mali and Nicaragua obtain the bulk of their export revenue from a particular agricultural commodity-cotton for Mali and coffee for Nicaragua-and both import the same key staple food of rice. To reap the economic gains from this trade specialization, the two countries' agriculture must be well-integrated into world markets. The two countries present an important policy contrast that affects their degree of world market integration and price transmission. In Mali, a parastatal enterprise controls its cotton industry, while Nicaragua has less state direction over agriculture. Reflecting this difference, the results show that for both its main export and import commodity, Nicaragua is more integrated into world markets and has higher price transmission than Mali. The results for Nicaragua also show much higher integration and price transmission for its main agricultural export (coffee) than its major import (rice).","[Baquedano, Felix G.; Liefert, William; Shapouri, Shahla] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20036 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Baquedano, FG (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, 1800 M St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",fbaquedano@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,39,18,21,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Focusing on a required reduction in the use of a potentially damaging input under an agri-environmental scheme, we address the implications of risk aversion for a farmer's decision on compliance.

This article demonstrates how data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods can be adapted to accommodate stochastic elements in a state-contingent setting. Specifically, we show how observations on a random input, not under the control of the producer and not known at the time that variable input decisions are made, can be used to partition the state space in a fashion that permits DEA models to approximate an event-specific production technology. The approach proposed in this article uses observed data on random inputs and is easy to implement. After developing the event-specific DEA representation, we apply it to a data set for Western Australian barley production data.

The development analysis of yields per hectare, costs, revenues and production profitability was carried out over the years 2003-2009 in the Agro Zlunice and it was compared with the results of the Czech Republic as a whole. In the enterprise, it deals with the traditional growing technology with a higher intensity of the intensification factors inputs in growing. Yields per hectare in the farm reached very favourable values which supported the stable position of the enterprise in the market with this agricultural commodity. It is possible to see a competitive advantage in the level of the per hectare yields. An average yield in the joint-stock company from 2003 to 2009 was 4.34 t/ha and an average yield in the CR over the last seven years was 2.9 t/ha. The enterprise's yield is by 1.44 t per ha higher compared to the average yields in the CR. In comparison of the average costs per hectare over the evaluated period in the enterprise and in the CR - in the enterprise, the costs were by 2.71% higher comapred to the CR (the enterprise 21 991 CZK/ha, the CR 21 394 CZK/ha). However, the enterprise Agro Zlunice, a.s. reached in comparison of the cost per 1 tonne of production by 31.31% lower costs than is the CR average. The amount of expenses incurred was compensated by high yields per hectare which the enterprise reached and thereby it improved the profitability of growing of this crop-plant. The highest share in the total costs belonged to direct material costs. The share of material costs in the enterprise over 7 years was 55.28%. Among the direct material costs, there are mainly seeds, fertilizers and chemical prophylactics. From the indicators of production profitability, there are expressed the profit achieved per 1 t of seedsfrom 1 ha of the area under crop and cost profitability. The profitability indicators considerably fluctuate during the evaluated years in the monitored enterprise and in the CR in dependence on the fluctuation of the seed price.","[Homolka, Jaroslav; Mydlar, Radek] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Homolka, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",homolka@pef.czu.cz; radekmydlar@centrum.cz,"Homolka, Jaroslav/H-6666-2018","Homolka, Jaroslav/0000-0002-5349-082X","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6046070906]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6046070906 Economics of resources of Czech agriculture and their efficient use in frame of multifunctional agri-food systems).",,16,2,3,0,2,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

A classical rational expectation model is modified to account for seasonal correlation of shocks. Model predictions are reduced to computable periodic threshold autoregression. Several nonlinearity tests are applied to detect threshold effects. A regime-switching normalized maximum likelihood method is formulated to estimate thresholds and threshold autoregression parameters using monthly data from Ethiopia for the period 1996-2006. The result indicates the presence of periodic price thresholds that could be formed as a result of speculative storage. Comparison of price movements below and above thresholds indicates that prices are more correlated below the thresholds than above them. However, the effect on error variance is not very strong. Temporal arbitrage, which is the gross return from speculative storage, appears to be modest. The long- and short-term implications of the findings are discussed within the context of ongoing policy debates.","[Tadesse, Getaw; Guttormsen, Atle G.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Tadesse, G (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",getaw.gebreyohanes@umb.no,"Guttormsen, Atle/GZG-2356-2022",,,,,,29,14,17,1,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This has led to a concern that increased aquaculture production poses a threat to the sustainability of capture fisheries. We use a shrinkage estimator to estimate fishmeal demand from countries with different make-up of meat and farmed salmon production. Although we are not able to identify structural differences between these sectors, the empirical results show that fishmeal demand is price inelastic. Technological change, however, is reducing fishmeal usage in feeds, suggesting that strong demand pressure on pelagic fish resources targeted for fishmeal is a temporary phenomenon.","[Tveteras, Sigbjorn] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, CENTRUM Catolica Business Sch, Lima, Peru; [Tveteras, Ragnar] Univ Stavanger, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Tveterås, S (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, CENTRUM Catolica Business Sch, Jr Daniel Alomia Robles 125-129, Lima, Peru.",stveteras@pucp.edu.pe,"Tveteras, Sigbjorn/A-9724-2012; Tveteraas, SIgbjorn/Y-2283-2019","Tveteras, Ragnar/0000-0002-8553-556X",,,,,33,37,39,2,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

When consumers cannot distinguish food qualities, asymmetric information threatens the efficiency of local food markets. We examine in a sequential game whether prices can credibly signal quality when farmers face production constraints due to the allocation of scarce water. Besides inefficient pooling equilibria and separating equilibria with distorted prices, we surprisingly find efficient equilibria with undistorted prices if the water allocation to wastewater irrigated agriculture is large.

Just-Pope production functions that explicitly account for output variability are estimated using panel data of Dutch organic and conventional farms. Prior investigation of the data indicates that within variation of output is significantly higher for organic farms, indicating that organic farms face more output variation than conventional farms. The estimation results indicate that in both types of farms, unobserved farm-specific factors like management skills and soil quality are important in explaining output variability and production risk. The results further indicate that land has the highest elasticity of production for both farm types. Labour and other variable inputs have significant production elasticities in the case of conventional farms and other variable inputs in the case of organic farms. Manure and fertilisers are risk-increasing inputs on organic farms and risk-reducing inputs on conventional farms.

Southeastern Brazil was chosen to carry the analyses because that is the current battleground region for food, ethanol and biodiesel. Design/methodology/approach - The analyses to be carried out encompass the following steps: evaluate the investment needs for the ethanol and biodiesel programs in Southeast Brazil; gather information on financial costs, converting them to economic costs to evaluate the economic desirability of the programs; evaluate the possible subsidy needed to fulfill the programs' goals; and evaluate the biofuel-food tradeoff under some different scenarios. Findings - The conclusion is that Brazil, despite being the most efficient producer of ethanol, may very well be forced to use compensatory subsidies for ethanol production if the USA persists in imposing importing tariffs on that Brazilian commodity. On food security matters, the production of ethanol has to compete with beef production, whose prices present a rising trend because of strong demand in emerging countries. For the same reason biodiesel becomes less viable the stronger the demand for vegetable oil. Originality/value - The competition among these three alternative uses of natural resources will become tougher in the coming decades as, on the one hand, consumption of food and energy increases at high rates. Developed countries, on the other hand, continue to be heavy polluters and at the same time create all sorts of obstacles to the expansion of food and clean energy production elsewhere.","[de Camargo Barros, Geraldo Sant'ana; Aparecido Alves, Lucilio Rogerio; Osaki, Mauro] Univ Sao Paulo, USP, Ctr Adv Studies Appl Econ CEPEA ESALQ USP, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr ESALQ, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Alves, LRA (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, USP, Ctr Adv Studies Appl Econ CEPEA ESALQ USP, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr ESALQ, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",lualves@esalq.usp.br,"Alves, Lucilio Rogerio Aparecido/D-5878-2012","Alves, Lucilio Rogerio Aparecido/0000-0002-9959-590X; SANT'ANA DE CAMARGO BARROS, GERALDO/0000-0002-2452-850X; Osaki, Mauro/0000-0003-1343-1988",,,,,28,1,1,2,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We use instrumental variables to account for the endogeneity of initial farm size, and correct for selectivity as a result of farm survival. We also include a technical efficiency index, derived from the estimation of a stochastic frontier production model, as an explanatory variable. Our aim is to check whether ignoring efficiency could have been the reason for convergence results obtained elsewhere in the literature. We found that technical efficiency is an important determinant of farm growth, and that not controlling for technical efficiency could seriously bias the results. In particular, larger farms are found to grow faster over time, while without controlling for technical efficiency the farm growth process seemed to be independent of initial farm size. The increasing polarisation of farm sizes in Israel has ramifications for the inefficiencies induced by the historical quota system, for the political power of the farm sector and for the social stability of farm communities.","[Dolev, Yuval; Kimhi, Ayal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Rehovot, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Dolev, Y (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Rehovot, Israel.",kimhi@agri.huji.ac.il,"Kimhi, Ayal/AAI-9654-2020","Kimhi, Ayal/0000-0002-6716-7118",BARD - the United States - Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development [IS-3291-02]; Center for Agricultural Economic Research,BARD - the United States - Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development; Center for Agricultural Economic Research,"This research was supported in part by Research Grant Award No. IS-3291-02 from BARD - the United States - Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, and by the Center for Agricultural Economic Research.",,46,7,7,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Survey data collected in 2006 from 309 sample households in three districts of Ethiopia are used for the analyses. Tobit regression models are used to measure the effect of access to services on the intensity of inputs use for fertilizer and agrochemicals. A probit model is used to measure these effects on the adoption of improved seeds. Intensity of use of seeds is analyzed using an ordinary least squares model. Logarithmic Cobb-Douglass functions are estimated to analyze the effect of access to services on crop productivity. Heckman's two-stage estimation is used to examine determinants of household market participation and the extents of participation. Results show that access to institutional support services plays a significant role in enhancing smallholder productivity and market orientation. Our results imply that expanding and strengthening the institutional services is critical for the intensification and market orientation of smallholder agriculture in Ethiopia. In particular, appropriate incentives and regulatory systems are urgently needed to encourage the involvement of the private sector in the provision of agricultural services.","[Gebremedhin, Berhanu; Jaleta, Moti; Hoekstra, Dirk] ILRI, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Gebremedhin, B (通讯作者)，ILRI, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",b.gebremedhin@cgiar.org,,"Hoekstra, Dirk/0000-0002-6111-6627",,,,,22,60,71,1,33,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This study is undertaken to improve our understanding of interfarm differences in, and opportunities to improve, farm household efficiency in utilizing their land, labor, and capital resources to achieve household objectives. The technical, allocative, and scale efficiencies of farm households are estimated using a nonparametric, output-based data envelopment analysis (DEA) of a panel data set from 1993 to 2006. Single and double bootstrapping procedures are used to estimate technical efficiency. Initial technical efficiency assuming variable returns to scale (TEV) is estimated to be 0.83. Using single bootstrapping, the average bias-corrected TEV estimate is 0.70; using double bootstrapping, the TEV estimate is 0.72. Allocative efficiency is estimated to be 0.81. Scale efficiency is estimated to be 0.93. The only factor that is consistently associated with higher technical efficiency across analysis methods and years is larger farm size (as measured by the log of farm income). The significance of other factors changes with analysis methods.","[Olson, Kent] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Vu, Linh] Inst Policy & Strategy Agr & Rural Dev, Ctr Agr Policy, Hanoi, Vietnam",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Olson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",kdolson@umn.edu,,"VU, LINH/0000-0002-5096-8584",,,,,20,27,31,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

However, we often do not know how involved respondents are in reading and processing the informational content of a survey and making choices, and whether different levels of involvement result in systematic differences in estimated models. To address this issue, we recorded response times for each respondent of an internet-based choice experiment for stream restoration. Response times per survey section and for the entire survey were used as proxies for the amount of involvement in reading information provided or answering choice questions. Response times per survey section fell rapidly, possibly signaling learning, use of heuristics, or attempts to quickly dispel with the survey. Response times were found to be independent of demographics and attitudes. Log-likelihood ratio tests failed to reject the null hypotheses of equal coefficients and scale parameters across response time-partitioned data. However, there exists an association between response times and the increasing learning curve or difficult choice trade-offs, suggesting a heuristic response. Additional research on response time effects and survey design is needed, especially with the rise in electronic surveying media.","[Vista, Arvin B.; Rosenberger, Randall S.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Collins, Alan R.] W Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",Oregon State University; West Virginia University,"Vista, AB (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, 100 Peavy Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",Arvin.Vista@oregonstate.edu; R.Rosenberger@oregonstate.edu; alan.collins@mail.wvu.edu,"Vista, Arvin B./C-1741-2014","Rosenberger, Randall/0000-0002-5138-525X",USDA; CSREES [2001-35106-11070],USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); CSREES(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"Funding for this research was provided by the USDA, CSREES under agreement 2001-35106-11070.

The sum of the latter two's premiums were not significantly different than the organic premium, suggesting diminishing marginal utility for added attributes. Results from a two-stage heteroskedastic tobit model demonstrated that WTP premiums for the varieties differ significantly by demographics and beliefs regarding the conventional version.

The model is applied to evaluate tariff reductions and targeted transfers in Madagascar. Although lowering tariffs generates substantial efficiency gains, these accrue mainly to the top half of the welfare distribution, and poor net sellers are actually worse off. Developing a system of targeted direct transfers to poor households is likely to be a substantially more cost-effective approach to poverty alleviation.","[Coady, David] Int Monetary Fund, Dept Fiscal Affairs, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Dorosh, Paul] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",International Monetary Fund; The World Bank,"Coady, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Dept Fiscal Affairs, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,"Dorosh, Paul/0000-0001-6049-6018",,,,,22,6,6,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Using a unified conceptual framework that draws from risk behavior and transaction cost theories, in combination with unique survey and accounting data, we demonstrate that risk preferences and asset specificity impact Illinois producers' use of contracts and spot markets. In particular, producers' investments in specific hog genetics and human capital are related to selection of long-term marketing contracts over spot markets.

Using a multiregion, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, we simulate the economic effects of introducing GM rice in India with or without China in the presence of labeling and import approval regulations of GM food in GM sensitive importing countries. We find that the welfare gains with GM rice in India would largely exceed any potential export loss, and that the segregation of non-GM rice could help reduce these minor losses. We also find no significant first mover advantage for India or China on GM rice. The opportunity cost of segregation of non-GM rice is much larger for sensitive importers than for India, which suggests that these importers would have the incentive to pay for the cost of segregation.","[Gruere, Guillaume P.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Mevel, Simon] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Bouet, Antoine] UPPA, CATT, F-64000 Pau, France",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); The World Bank; Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour,"Gruère, GP (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",g.gruere@cgiar.org,,,United States Agency for International Development.

This article explores the foundations of yield distributions for the Law of the Minimum resource constraint technology at the plot level of analysis. With independent, identical, uniform resource availability distributions the yield skew is positive, whereas it is negative whenever the distributions are normal. Simulations show how asymmetries in resource availabilities determine skewness. It is suggested that a negative yield skew occurs whenever production is tightly controlled so that the left tails of some resources availabilities distributions are thin. Irrigation may increase yield skewness.","[Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, CARD, Ames, IA USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Hennessy, DA (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,,,,,,,36,41,52,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Wheat is the main staple diet of the people of Pakistan. It contributes 13.7 percent to the value added in agriculture and 3.0 percent to GDP. Given its importance to the national economy, the government attaches high priority to raising agricultural productivity and farmer's income. For this purpose, financing for agricultural sector is very much needed and important. Like other institutional sources, commercial banks also provide agricultural credit. The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of credit disbursed by them on the productivity of wheat. Design/methodology/approach - Primary data were collected from 114 randomly selected respondents through a well-structured interview schedule. Cobb Douglous function was used to calculate the impact of credit on the productivity. Findings - The coefficient of credit was highly significant, which showed that credit has a positive impact on the productivity of wheat and hence is an important tool for improving the productivity of agriculture sector. Originality/value - The study, in hand will be useful for the planners who are responsible for allocating funds for the agricultural sector in general and for wheat growers in particular. The recommendations of the study will go a long way to mitigating the problems being faced by the small farmers of Pakistan in securing institutional credit.","[Bashir, Muhammad Khalid; Gill, Zulfiqar Ahmad] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Fac Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Dept Dev Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Hassan, Sarfraz] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Fac Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Dept Environm & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan",University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Bashir, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Faisalabad, Fac Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Dept Dev Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",kbc450@yahoo.co.uk,"Bashir, Muhammad Khalid Khalid/H-9729-2014","Bashir, Muhammad Khalid Khalid/0000-0001-5572-2666",,,,,12,7,7,0,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Our economic and risk analysis points to current policies as part of the problem. The study compares three domesticated indigenous timber trees (Shorea contorta V., Pterocarpus indicus J., and Vitex parviflora W.) intercropped with maize against a benchmark of the widely used exotic mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla K.). We used a biophysical simulation model (WaNuLCAS 3.1) to represent interaction between trees and crops for a fundamental level of water, nutrient and light capture as the basis for production functions. External conditions affecting systems profitability were accounted for in the Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM). Elements of risk were introduced through Monte Carlo simulation. Study results revealed that from a farmer's perspective intercropping systems provide similar (within an uncertainty range of + or - 10%) returns to monocropping scenarios. When net subsidies and taxes are accounted for, social profitability evaluations favour tree intercropping at high tree densities. The net effect of the current bias in price policies towards food production therefore refrains farmers from making decisions to integrate trees on farms; a decision that is actually in the national interest on economic grounds, even without consideration of positive environmental effects.","[Santos Martin, Fernando] Univ Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain; [van Noordwijk, Meine] World Agroforestry Ctr, Bogor, Indonesia",Universidad de Cordoba,"Martin, FS (通讯作者)，Univ Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain.",santosmartinfer@gmail.com,"van Noordwijk, Meine/C-3338-2008","van Noordwijk, Meine/0000-0002-7791-4703; Santos Martin, Fernando/0000-0002-2301-5876",EU [ICA4-CT-2001-10092]; Forestry Department from University of Cordoba (Spain); World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF),EU(European Union (EU)); Forestry Department from University of Cordoba (Spain); World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF),"This study was conducted within the framework of the Smallholder Agroforestry Options on Degraded Soils (SAFODS), EU funded project (No: ICA4-CT-2001-10092), in close collaboration between the Forestry Department from University of Cordoba (Spain) and the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF).

Price volatility and transaction size are positively related to liquidity costs, while a negative relation is found between daily volume and liquidity costs. Price clustering at whole cent prices occurs in the open-outcry market which helps explain its higher liquidity costs. Daily volumes were distinctively higher during the Goldman-Sachs roll, but not enough to explain the higher liquidity costs in the open-outcry market.

An MACC illustrates the costs of specific crop, soil and livestock abatement measures against a 'business as usual' scenario. The results indicate that in 2022 under a specific policy scenario, around 5.38 Mt CO2 equivalent (e) could be abated at negative or zero cost. A further 17% of agricultural GHG emissions (7.85 Mt CO(2)e) could be abated at a lower unit cost than the UK Government's 2022 shadow price of carbon [34 pound (tCO(2)e)-1]. The article discusses a range of methodological hurdles that complicate cost-effectiveness appraisal of abatement in agriculture relative to other sectors.","[Moran, Dominic; Macleod, Michael; Wall, Eileen; Eory, Vera; McVittie, Alistair; Barnes, Andrew; Rees, Robert; Topp, Cairistiona F.

The premium that consumers are willing pay for fortified maize (24%) was higher than the discount they require to buy yellow maize (11%), and in one zone consumers prefer yellow.

Optimal strategies for an importing agent, who hedges with futures and options are derived, based on the objective of minimizing the unpredictability of import bills. Ex post simulations for a set of LIFDCs are run on wheat and maize imports hedged with futures and options in the Chicago Board of Trade, to explore the extent to which hedging reduces the unpredictability in import bills. Simulations encompass both periods of normal price behavior, as well as the period of global upheaval that occurred in 2007 and 2008. Results show that hedging with futures alone affords agents considerable opportunities for reducing import cost unpredictability, and the same holds with options, albeit, to a lesser extent. However, during the recent price spike of 2007-2008, hedging with options would have increased the unpredictability of some countries' maize import bills, due to the combination of erratic import patterns and pronounced market uncertainty.","[Sarris, Alexander; Conforti, Piero; Prakash, Adam] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Trade & Markets Div, I-00153 Rome, Italy",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Sarris, A (通讯作者)，Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Trade & Markets Div, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",alexander.sarris@fao.org,,,,,,,22,9,9,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Individual incentives are not aligned with group gains in cooperatives because individual members bear the costs of offering higher qualities, whereas the benefits from these higher qualities are shared among all members. We present a blind mechanism whose quality-enhancing properties are analyzed in a theoretical model. This mechanism, which does not require individual monitoring, consists of individually punishing co-op members by using aggregate co-op performance in such way that the better the co-op quality, the lower the exclusion probability. In a computerized environment, using experimental methods, we specifically test the effectiveness of our mechanism in alleviating the incentive problem.

We also investigate the costs of second-best policies that depend on the degree of spatial heterogeneity, the nature of the linkages, and the dispersal rates.","[Sanchirico, James N.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Sanchirico, James N.; Coleman, Conrad] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Wilen, James E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; Resources for the Future; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Sanchirico, JN (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,"U.S. EPA [R832223]; Resources for the Future; California Agricultural Experimentation Station (AES) [CA-D-ESP-7084-H]; EPA [909056, R832223] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",U.S. EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency); Resources for the Future; California Agricultural Experimentation Station (AES); EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"Sanchirico acknowledges support from the U.S. EPA Science to Achieve Results (R832223), Resources for the Future, and California Agricultural Experimentation Station (AES) project CA-D-ESP-7084-H.",,32,14,15,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This creates a potential incentive compatibility problem which, combined with information asymmetry about farm land potential, can lead to adverse selection of land into the Scheme and therefore a less cost-effective provision of environmental goods and services. However, the Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) Scheme design includes some features that potentially reduce adverse selection. This paper studies the adverse selection problem of the HLS using a principal-agent framework at the regional level. It is found that, at the regional level, the enrolment of more land from lower payment regions for a given budget constraint has reduced the adverse selection problem through contracting a greater overall area and thus higher overall environmental benefit. In addition, for landscape regions with the same payment rate (i.e. of the same agricultural value), differential weighting of the public demand for environmental goods and services provided by agriculture (measured by weighting an environmental benefit function by the distance to main cities) appears to be reflected in the regulator's allocation of contracts, thereby also reducing the adverse selection problem.","[Quillerou, Emmanuelle] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Fraser, Rob] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Fraser, Rob] Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",University of Kent; University of Kent; University of Western Australia,"Quillérou, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England.",emmanuelle_quillerou@yahoo.fr,"QUILLÉROU, Emmanuelle/F-8397-2010","QUILLÉROU, Emmanuelle/0000-0001-7541-0061",,,,,22,28,32,0,38,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

BC ranks among the top three wine-consuming provinces in Canada and residents' wine preferences are likely linked to an emerging sophistication in tastes. This study uses weekly retail sales data and attributes of Burgundy wines reported by the BC Liquor Distribution Branch. The results confirm the collective reputation effects of the Burgundy wine region and show that the implicit values differ between white and red Burgundy wines with village designation and vintage having a relatively larger effect on white wine prices than in the case of red wines. Burgundy white wines, such as Aloxe-Corton, Chassagne-Montrachet Premier Cru, Meursault Premier Cru, and Chablis Grand Cru, were associated with larger price premia.","[Carew, Richard] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Pacific Agri Food Res Ctr, Summerland, BC, Canada; [Florkowski, Wojciech J.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Griffin, GA USA",Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Carew, R (通讯作者)，Agr & Agri Food Canada, Pacific Agri Food Res Ctr, 4200 Highway 97, Summerland, BC, Canada.",Richard.Carew@agr.gc.ca; wojciech@uga.edu,"Florkowski, Wojciech/ABA-4946-2021",,,,,,34,21,24,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

A decisive role is played by the population transition. its first phase, which still prevails in some regions, started the exponential increase of the Earth population. in the second phase, the demographic revolution causes ageing of the population. At present, the world population increments are decreasing and it can be presupposed in the long run that the size of the population will stabilise.

That is why the content analysis is tested in this paper for its possibilities to observe the preliminary impacts of one of the rural development tools - the Community initiative LEADER+ in the Czech Republic. The research pointed out that content analysis might be an appropriate method to define some impacts (and also the efficiency) of the LEADER+ approach. The results demonstrated that the transparency and public accountability of some local action groups (LAG) activities are not always on a high level. Also the differences among the LAGs are shown as for their ability to learn the principles of the LEADER+. The method also enabled to estimate how the LEADER+ contributes to eliminate the social exclusion in the countryside. It also pointed out a lower representation of farming oriented projects in the LEADER+ approach. The content analysis reflected the transfer of the best practices among the territories and also the possible knowledge of the public about the LEADER+ approach and about the projects implemented in this initiative.,"[Lostak, Michal; Hudeckova, Helena] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Humanities, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Losták, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Humanities, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic.",lostak@pef.czu.cz,"Lostak, Michal/I-6498-2019","Lostak, Michal/0000-0003-0392-0702","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6046070906]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","This paper was generated as a part of the project Economics of Czech agriculture resources and their efficient usage within the framework of multifunctional agri-food systems, the grant No. MSM 6046070906, with the financial support from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.

Design/methodology/approach - The dataset used includes information about inter-provincial grain trade on China's grain market from November 1999 to October 2000. A priori blockmodelling method is used for hypothesis testing. Findings - This paper finds that a partially integrated national grain market had emerged at the beginning of the twenty-first century in China in spite of local protectionism. Additionally, the emergence of this market is found to be partly a result of the reform-oriented state's attempt to create national wholesale grain markets.

Over-supply and market corrections for various livestock products took place over the latter part of the 1990s and large numbers of householders exited this type of production. Using household survey data, we estimate the relationship between a household's specialization in livestock production and household net income in 1995, and use a logit model to explore some predictors of household exit from livestock production over the following decade of market instability. We conclude that specialist livestock households with access to necessary skills, technologies, and markets increase their incomes from further livestock specialization in the base year, whereas those to whom livestock production is relatively unimportant can increase household incomes by diverting their resources away from animal husbandry. It was specialist rather than diversified livestock households that tended to bear the brunt of the adjustment to unfavorable price movements over the decade post-1995. Policy concerns include the exit of larger-scale specialized producers who tended to earn relatively high household incomes in 1995, barriers to the effective formation and operation of horizontal and vertical integration options to help mitigate market instability, the further development of insurance programs and markets for livestock producers, and development assistance to livestock households that for various reasons cannot increase scale and specialization.","[Rae, Allan N.] Massey Univ, Ctr Agribusiness Policy & Strategy, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Zhang, Xiaohui] Minist Agr, Res Ctr Rural Econ, Beijing 100810, Peoples R China",Massey University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs,"Rae, AN (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Ctr Agribusiness Policy & Strategy, Private Bag 11 222, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",a.n.rae@massey.ac.nz,,,Venture Trust,Venture Trust,"The authors thank Tian Weiming, Krishna Iyer, and Hatice Ozer-Balli, along with anonymous reviewers, for their helpful comments and assistance.

Using multinominal and binary logit analyses we identify the factors associated with irrigators who sold or bought water allocations during 1998-1999 and irrigators who at that time had never participated in any kind of water trading. Contrary to expectations we find that early adopters of water trading were older farmers with low farm productivity, but that in line with theory they had higher levels of education, had spent less time farming, had larger irrigated area, farm operating surplus and farm assets, owned farms that were more intensively farmed, and were more progressive in their planning. There was only weak evidence to suggest that water moved from lower value uses to higher value uses, suggesting the water allocation market had limited efficiency in its' initial years.","[Wheeler, Sarah; Bjornlund, Henning; Shanahan, Martin; Zuo, Alec] Univ S Australia, Sch Commerce, CRMA, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Bjornlund, Henning] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada",University of South Australia; University of Lethbridge,"Wheeler, S (通讯作者)，Univ S Australia, Sch Commerce, CRMA, City W Campus, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",sarah.wheeler@unisa.edu,"Shanahan, Martin/N-1500-2019; Bjornlund, Henning/F-4576-2013; Shanahan, Martin P/C-9527-2009; Zuo, Alec/AAU-3394-2020; Bjornlund, Henning/ABB-9446-2020; Wheeler, Sarah Ann/H-4000-2017; Zuo, Alec/F-4562-2013","Shanahan, Martin/0000-0002-0405-2989; Bjornlund, Henning/0000-0003-3341-5635; Zuo, Alec/0000-0003-0425-4633; Bjornlund, Henning/0000-0003-3341-5635; Wheeler, Sarah Ann/0000-0002-6073-3172;","Australian Research Council; Murray Darling Basin Authority; Goulburn Murray Water; NSW Department of Energy and Water; Department of Sustainability and Environment; University of Lethbridge, Canada","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Murray Darling Basin Authority; Goulburn Murray Water; NSW Department of Energy and Water; Department of Sustainability and Environment; University of Lethbridge, Canada","The authors would like to acknowledge the very helpful comments of the journal's anonymous referees in improving this article.

Farmers are no longer required to produce commodities to be entitled to support but only to keep land in Good Environmental and Agricultural Condition. If output declines as a result, there is concern that landscape services produced jointly with commodities will also decline. The aim of this paper is to assess the long-term effects of the 2003 reform on farm structure, landscape mosaic and biodiversity for a sample of EU regions. Impacts are quantified using a spatial agent-based modelling approach by simulating agricultural development with links to indicators of landscape value. Our results demonstrate that eliminating the link between support payments and production has possible negative consequences for the landscape, but only under particular circumstances. It is shown that these effects could be offset by strengthening (Pillar II) agri-environmental schemes. Further the single payment scheme results in higher land rental prices which reduces its ability to achieve its goal of providing income security for farmers. Implications of these results for the direction of continued CAP reform are discussed.","[Brady, Mark] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Econ, AgriFood Econ Ctr, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Kellermann, Konrad; Sahrbacher, Christoph] Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Germany; [Jelinek, Ladislav] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague, Czech Republic",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Brady, M (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Econ, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Box 730, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden.",mark.brady@ekon.slu.se,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; Brady, Mark/J-6313-2014","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; Brady, Mark/0000-0001-9773-9722",European Community [SSPE-CT-2003-502171],European Community,"This research was performed within the IDEMA project (www. agrifood. se/ IDEMA) which was supported by the European Community's Sixth Framework Programme (SSPE-CT-2003-502171).

This is rectified in this paper by utilising an 11-year panel that contains information on 300 farmers for each year. The structure of this dataset allows us to employ discrete time duration random effects panel data logit models to model the determinants of entering the Irish Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS). We introduce a dynamic element into a number of the models by using the random effects logit model estimator, with lagged dependent variables as additional explanatory variables. The results point to the fact that systems of farming that are more extensive and less environmentally degrading remain those most likely to participate in the REPS. In addition, the results highlight the fact that where no attempt is made to control for unobserved heterogeneity or path dependency the effects of the farm- and farmer-specific characteristics may be overestimated.","[Hynes, Stephen] Natl Univ Ireland, Socioecon Marine Res Unit, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Hynes, S (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Socioecon Marine Res Unit, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland.",stephen.hynes@nuigalway.ie,,,"The Irish Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food","The Irish Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food","This paper was written as part of a Rural Stimulus Funded project financed by The Irish Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.",,27,79,88,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

A choice experiment approach was employed to elicit the preferences and a random parameters logit model was used to estimate the relative importance of the preferred attributes of indigenous cows. The results show that fertility, disease resistance and calf vigour traits are at least as important as milk. The location the cows are brought from is also an important attribute for buyers. Results from the simulation on the influence of changes in attribute levels showed that fertility and disease resistance affect preferences more than other traits. The findings suggest that the smallholder community in this part of Ethiopia depends on semi-subsistence agriculture and so livestock development interventions should focus on a multitude of reproductive and adaptive traits that stabilise the herd structure rather than focusing on traits that are only important for commercial purposes.","[Kassie, Girma T.] Int Livestock Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany; [Wollny, Clemens] Univ Appl Sci, Fac Life Sci, Bingen, Germany",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); University of Kiel,"Kassie, GT (通讯作者)，Int Livestock Res Inst, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",g.tesfahun@cgiar.org; aabdula@food-econ.uni-kiel.de; cwollny@gwdg.de,"Girma, Kassie T./F-9179-2017; Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021","Girma, Kassie T./0000-0001-7430-4291; , Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",ILRI-BMZ,ILRI-BMZ,"Girma T.

This study found that uncertainty plays a role in the application decision of farmers but not in the manner typically assumed. Using a time series of field trials of corn yield to nitrogen for the same site, nitrogen was found to be a risk-increasing input suggesting that uncertainty should decrease, rather than increase, a risk-averse farmer's rate of nitrogen application. Similarly, viewing risk as a profit shortfall, in which fertilizer acts in the role of insurance, was also not supported with the empirical results. Instead, the key role of uncertainty is its impact on expected profits. Increasing application rates leads to lower returns in most years but the increase in profits generated under favorable growing conditions results in greater expected profits with a high application strategy.","[Rajsic, Predrag; Weersink, Alfons] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Gandorfer, Markus] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Agr Econ & Farm Management, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",University of Guelph; Technical University of Munich,"Weersink, A (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, JD MacLachlan Bldg,Gordon St, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",prajsic@uoguelph.ca; aweersin@uoguelph.ca; Markus.Gandorfer@wzw.tum.de,"Weersink, Alfons/O-1521-2019","Weersink, Alfons/0000-0001-5081-3593; Rajsic, Predrag/0000-0002-8856-3013; Gandorfer, Markus/0000-0002-0624-153X","Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs","Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs","The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Bill Deen, Glenn Fox, Getu Hailu, and Ken Janovicek.

Transportation costs directly affect the marketing margin and also exacerbate market power by limiting farmers' access to buyers. This article develops a multistage spatial model to determine optimal investment in transportation improvements, taking account of impacts on marketing costs and competition. The beneficial impact of investments from farmers' perspective is mainly through enhanced competition, meaning significant under-investment may occur if this effect is ignored. However, the optimal investment depends on the relative importance of transportation costs; in some settings, transportation improvements reduce farm prices because buyers rationally over-compensate farmers for these costs.","[Faere, Rolf; Grosskopf, Shawna] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Färe, R (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,"GROSSKOPF, Shawnax/H-4031-2013",,Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station,Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station,"RolfFrare and Shawna Grosskopfare both professors of economics at Oregon State University.

A model of litigation and settlement among disputing parties suggests that the public trust doctrine introduces more costs and is more time consuming than would be the case with alternative approaches, such as the purchase of private rights through market transactions or application of eminent domain powers to reallocate the resource. Because the doctrine allows for uncompensated redistribution, it is resisted by current resource owners. Furthermore, by providing open standing to members of the public in challenging existing uses, public trust disputes encourage excessive demands, increasing the incidence of trial over settlement. This outcome is exacerbated if the plaintiffs derive utility from the 'cause' and provide litigation services at below-market rates, leading to greater investment in litigation. The costs of the public trust doctrine appear to have limited its application beyond the level anticipated by proponents. We present a case study of Mono Lake, part of the well-known 1983 litigation, National Audubon v.

Although marine environments generally are not owned, those who use them for commercial fishing often are regulated. These regulations grant harvesters rights to use marine environments in specified ways, and the possibility of encumbering these rights to achieve conservation goals creates a potential role for marine easements. We examine this potential under alternative fishery management regimes and find, generally, that marine easements tend to be most effective when harvest rights are delineated most fully. Our analysis suggests ways that marine easements can have flexibility and transactions cost advantages over other approaches to achieve marine conservation goals. We also propose ways in which the design of laws allowing marine easements should follow, or depart from, the design of laws authorising conservation easements on land.","[Deacon, Robert T.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Deacon, RT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",deacon@econ.ucsb.edu,,,,,,,21,12,13,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

China prioritized a NSC reform policy in 2005 to address the growing disparities in incomes and living standards between rural and urban populations. These policies are evaluated to measure the extent of effective reform concerning farmer, agricultural, and rural economic development. Design/methodology/approach - An index system is developed and factor analysis is performed to describe the relative contributions of economic reform. Aggregate index scores are computed to rank provincial progress. Findings - Rankings indicate the progression of rural economic reform is moderate, at best, and mostly isolated to well-developed eastern provinces. Reform growth is also uneven across similarly rural provinces, indicating a need for continued attention in these poorer areas. Originality/value - Continued applications of the index and scoring procedure developed here will provide useful insights as time progresses and reform efforts continue.","[Guo, Xiang-Yu; Yu, Zhi-Gang; Li, Dan] NE Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Schmit, Todd; Henehan, Brian] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA",Northeast Agricultural University - China; Cornell University,"Li, D (通讯作者)，NE Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin, Peoples R China.",lidandn92@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,13,8,8,2,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

One potential mechanism for increasing yields is the use of improved agricultural technologies, such as fertilizers, seeds, and cropping techniques. Public sector programs have attempted to overcome information-related barriers to technological adoption by providing agricultural extension services. While such programs have been widely criticized for their limited scale, sustainability, and impact, the rapid spread of mobile phone coverage in developing countries provides a unique opportunity to facilitate technological adoption via information and communication technology (ICT)-based extension programs. This article outlines the potential mechanisms through which ICT could facilitate agricultural adoption and the provision of extension services in developing countries. It then reviews existing programs using ICT for agriculture, categorized by the mechanism (voice, text, internet, and mobile money transfers) and the type of services provided. Finally, we identify potential constraints to such programs in terms of design and implementation, and conclude with some recommendations for implementing field-based research on the impact of these programs on farmers' knowledge, technological adoption, and welfare.","[Aker, Jenny C.] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Aker, Jenny C.] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University; Tufts University,"Aker, JC (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, 160 Packard Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",Jenny.Aker@tufts.edu,,,,,,,58,349,416,8,278,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We find that such costs are economically and statistically important for trade in all of the six major agricultural commodities (Cereals, Dairy, Fish, Meat, Vegetables and Fruits, and Sugar), for agricultural producers in both developed and developing countries. We also find evidence suggesting that, in general, market access for both developed and developing exporters had improved in the years following the Uruguay round of trade negotiations (1995-2000).","[Kandilov, Ivan T.; Zheng, Xiaoyong] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Kandilov, IT (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, NCSU Campus Box 8109, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",ivan_kandilov@ncsu.edu,,"Kandilov, Ivan/0000-0002-0761-8095",,,,,44,7,8,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In some cases, such as organics, food is marketed as being produced in an 'equitable' food system. But are consumers willing to pay for a fair food system? Using a model of inequality aversion and a set of real-money experiments, we find that about 15 per cent of consumers' willingness-to-pay a premium for organic foods is attributable to altruism and inequality aversion. The fairness premium is significantly influenced by who receives this premium, how much the consumer earns, and how the experiment is framed.","[Briggeman, Brian C.] Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Omaha Branch, Omaha, NE 68132 USA; [Lusk, Jayson L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Briggeman, BC (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Omaha Branch, 2201 Farnam, Omaha, NE 68132 USA.",brian.briggeman@kc.frb.org,,,"National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, USDA [2007-04447]","National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","This project was supported by the National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, USDA, Grant # 2007-04447.",,31,48,57,2,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

Using household survey data, this study contributes to the empirical literature on globalisation and poverty by analysing the household-level implications of increased foreign investments and trade in the horticulture sector in Senegal. In many aspects this represents what many would consider a 'worst-case scenario'. Stringent rich country standards are imposed on exports and the supply chain is controlled by a single multinational company with extreme levels of supply base consolidation and vertical integration and complete exclusion of smallholder suppliers. We analyse and quantify income and poverty effects under these 'worst-case conditions' and find significant positive welfare impacts through employment creation and labour market participation.","[Maertens, Miet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Agr & Food Econ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Maertens, M (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Agr & Food Econ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200 E, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",miet.maertens@ees.kuleuven.be,"Colen, Liesbeth/E-5790-2019; Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021; Colen, Liesbeth/ABD-1677-2021; Maertens, Miet/A-5509-2013","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978; Maertens, Miet/0000-0001-7245-0375; Colen, Liesbeth/0000-0003-1324-2570",Flemish Interuniversity Council; K.U.

The strategic framework is organized into ten steps in order to organize and develop a practical and applied risk management plan. This paper demonstrates the SRM process in a crop insurance example. A simple version of the program, called Risk Navigator Lite (c), is also applied to crop insurance to demonstrate how robust the framework is for adaptation to field settings, where data may be limited or where decision makers might have limited capacity to understand complicated principles necessary for risk management. Findings This manuscript elaborates upon how the SRM process may be effectively implemented by agricultural producers. The information herein should also help students of risk management better comprehend how to apply what they learn.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors examine the efficiency of SCIPs from a farmers' point of view by testing the existence of adverse selection using nonparametric tests and logit regression on data from individual interviews in Miyun County. Due to adverse selection, producers with more risk should be more likely to buy crop insurance in pursuit of the benefits from SCIPs. Findings - However, both methods conclude no existence of adverse selection, which indicates that the programs are inefficient. This may not be surprising based on the issues of concern cited above. The opportunities and challenges of a growing interest in weather index insurance are discussed toward the end of the paper. Originality/value - This paper weaves together literature on traditional and weather index insurance, along with primary data from a survey, to examine the pros and cons of each type of insurance.

The primary source for the analysis were the data of the survey EU-SILC European Union - Statistics on Income and Living Conditions. The basic variable for the analysis is the level of the household income in 2005-2008. In addition to the decile classification, characteristics such as the average income per one household member, poverty threshold, poverty depth coefficient, Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient. were calculated in order to evaluate the income situation. The results show an increase of the average household income. The Lorenz curve followed by the Gini coefficient demonstrate the uniformity of distribution of income values. The results show a decreasing income differentiation. The poverty threshold was defined on the level of 60% of the median value and with this given threshold, the households were assessed, whether they belong to the ones at the risk of poverty. The results reveal a decreasing number of households at the risk of poverty. The poverty depth coefficient has a stronger explanatory power and shows how far below the poverty threshold the households are, or what is an income deficit of these households. Each category of households at the risk of poverty varies with the depth of poverty. The analysis also provides the results of how the households' income situation or poverty is perceived by the households themselves.","[Turcinkova, Jana; Stavkova, Jana] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Turcínková, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",turcinko@node.mendelu.cz; stavkova@mendelu.cz,"Turčínková, Jana/C-3071-2013; Stávková, Jana/T-8950-2017","Stávková, Jana/0000-0002-0889-0218","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6215648904]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6215648904).",,13,3,3,3,15,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Perhaps the largest challenge of outsourcing the heifer enterprise involves quality, measured as milk production potential, and the possibility for moral hazard due to hidden action on the part of the custom heifer grower. A principal-agent framework was used to elicit contract terms to provide incentives for the heifer grower to achieve desired growth rates, and enable the return of the heifer to the dairy farm on an accelerated time frame, without sacrificing quality. To mitigate incentive asymmetries, bonuses and deductions are proposed.","[Olynk, Nicole J.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Wolf, Christopher A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Michigan State University,"Olynk, NJ (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,"Wolf, Christopher A/G-6418-2013",,Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station,Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station,"Nicole J.

However, possible abandonment of organic farming has received scant attention. Thus, relatively little is known about the exit decisions of farmers. In addition, most studies are based on a static framework where it is not possible to account for changes in farmer decisions over time. This article attempts to fill this gap in the literature by investigating the determinants that affect both adoption and abandonment of organic drystock farming over time. The use of duration analysis allows for the consideration of cross-sectional and time-varying factors over the study period from 1981 to 2008. Using this dynamic econometric framework revealed a significant time effect on entry and exit decisions. Overall, the results highlight that where no attempt is made to account for exit decisions and time effects, important information about sustainable farmer decisions may not be taken into consideration.","[Laepple, Doris] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland; [Laepple, Doris] TEAGASC, Rural Econ Res Ctr, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Teagasc,"Läpple, D (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland.",s.laepple@teagasc.ie,,"Laepple, Doris/0000-0003-4935-5403",Teagasc Walsh,Teagasc Walsh,"The author acknowledges Teagasc Walsh Fellowship Scheme funding for this research, helpful comments from Stephen Hynes, anonymous reviewers and the editor David Harvey, as well as the provision of GIS and time-series data from Stuart Green and Trevor Donnellan, respectively.",,34,93,108,4,46,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Second, instead of making parametric assumptions on outcomes, we employ a variety of difference-in-difference matching estimators to control for selection bias.

Why industry was unable to progress self-management more effectively remains an interesting question. This paper argues that the benefits of greater self-governance were probably less than the significant transactions costs to self-organise. The benefits were probably smaller in New Zealand than elsewhere, because reform had already reduced the costs of fisheries administration. And the transactions costs confronting industry were substantial. First, unanimous agreement was required for self-governance, which created high transactions costs. Second, the tools for private enforcement were limited. Third, policy failed to specify clearly the expectations of self-governance, so the investments in self-governance are unusually risky. The government had unrealistic expectations that self-governance would solve third-party environmental externalities as well as fishing externalities. This implied high transactions costs to negotiate with third parties, such as environmental groups. Fourth, the standards for accountability were difficult to specify. This experience identifies four key policies if devolved fisheries governance is to be promoted: non-unanimous decision-making; private enforcement; clarity on areas for self-governance; and clarity on accountability standards.","Winona State Univ, Winona, MN 55987 USA",Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Winona State University,"Townsend, RE (通讯作者)，Winona State Univ, Winona, MN 55987 USA.",ralph.townsend@umit.maine.edu,,,,,,,36,11,11,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

While the use of state trading was modified by China's accession to the WTO, it remains a dominant feature for some commodities, even though there have been recent attempts to diminish its importance. In this article, we review the role that the state trading enterprise (STE), China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Company (COFCO), continues to play in the importing and exporting of some agricultural commodities. We then review the economic theory that has been developed to measure the tariff equivalent of importing STEs. Finally, we apply that theory through a calibration exercise to measure the tariff equivalent of COFCO in China's import market for wheat. The distortionary impact of COFCO depends on the bias in government policy toward agriculture, the competitiveness of the domestic procurement market, and also the number of firms that are allocated licenses to import alongside COFCO.","[MacLaren, Donald] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [McCorriston, Steve] Univ Exeter, Sch Business & Econ, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England",University of Melbourne; University of Exeter,"MacLaren, D (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",D.MacLaren@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,8,3,3,2,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This paper will quantify the effect associated with the deregulation of wholesale petrol prices on relative retail prices for unleaded petrol in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. This is done through Box-Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average methodology coupled with Box and Tiao intervention analysis. Weekly price data will be used for Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney. It finds that from the beginning of 1999, deregulation coincided with relatively lower retail petrol prices for all three cities. In the absence of any other possible alternative explanation for the simultaneous fall in relative retail petrol prices across all three cities, it is concluded that this change was most likely associated with deregulation. These results suggest that regulation of wholesale petrol prices were ineffectual in terms of constraining capital city retail petrol prices at the very least and may have actually contributed towards relatively higher retail petrol prices. This also suggests that future policy interventions designed to constrain prices in the downstream petroleum industry should be very carefully considered.","ACIL Tasman, Canberra, ACT, Australia",,"Davey, A (通讯作者)，ACIL Tasman, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",a.davey@aciltasman.com.au,,,,,,,24,7,7,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

One potential solution is to rely on local farmers' knowledge for improved management of diverse on-farm resources and integration among various farm enterprises. In this article, we analyze the farm-level impact of one recent example, namely the integrated aquaculture-agriculture (IAA) technologies that have been developed and disseminated in a participatory manner in Malawi. Based on a 2004 survey of 315 respondents (166 adopters and 149 nonadopters), we test the hypothesis that adoption of IAA is associated with improved farm productivity and more efficient use of resources. Estimating a technical inefficiency function shows that IAA farms were significantly more efficient compared to nonadopters. IAA farms also had higher total factor productivity, higher farm income per hectare, and higher returns to family labor.","[Dey, Madan M.] Univ Arkansas, Pine Bluff, AR 71601 USA; [Paraguas, Ferdinand J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kambewa, Patrick] Chancellor Coll, Dept Econ, Zomba, Malawi; [Pemsl, Diemuth E.] WorldFish Ctr, George Town 10670, Malaysia",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; CGIAR; Worldfish,"Dey, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, 1200 N Univ Dr, Pine Bluff, AR 71601 USA.",mdey@uaex.edu,,"Dey, Madan/0000-0001-5273-2789",Standing Panel on Impact Assessment (SPIA) of the CGIAR; WorldFish Center,Standing Panel on Impact Assessment (SPIA) of the CGIAR(CGIAR); WorldFish Center,"We are grateful for the financial support that was provided for this study by the Standing Panel on Impact Assessment (SPIA) of the CGIAR and the WorldFish Center.

Design/methodology/approach - Using nationally representative survey data, the paper gives detailed discussions on the young rural laborers' education attainments, and their off-farm employment status including job patterns, working hours, and hourly wage rates. The relationship between education and employment status is analyzed and tested. Through these discussions, an employment challenge is revealed, and some policy implications are made. Findings - This paper finds that China's young rural laborers are generally poorly educated and mainly unskilled. They work long hours and are low paid. While they lack the labor quality that will be required to meet the industrial upgrading, an employment challenge may face them in the near future. This paper also finds a strong link between education levels and employment status for the young labor force, which implies the possible effect of policies such as improving rural education. Originality/value - Based on a solid foundation of a national rural household survey, this paper updates the understanding of the education and employment situations of the young rural labor force in contemporary China.

The price of land marked an irregular development in the period 2006-2007 having increased in the majority of the EU states. The proportion of rent to the market price of land referred to as the capitalization rate kept varying within the range of 2-3%. The price of a site should, besides the land rent, also reflect the interest on the land rent received. The price of agricultural land with respect to the land rent manifests relatively important price inertia. This inertia in connection with a high growth rate of land rent results in the unrealistically high interest rate. Such situation is an evident advantage for land owners and is, on the contrary, a disadvantage for the tenants of the agricultural land. To make the interest rate realistic means especially stabilizing the land rent with low growth rates. These growth rates are different for different states.

J,"Turvey, CG; Kong, R; Huo, XX",,,,"Turvey, Calum G.; Kong, Rong; Huo, Xuexi",,,Borrowing amongst friends: the economics of informal credit in rural China,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Borrowing; Credit; Farms; Household products; Finance; Rural regions; China,MARKETS; INDIA,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the economic significance of informal borrowing between friends and relatives in rural China. Guided by an economic model of household-production interactions, the paper provides results from a survey of over 1,500 households including general linear model and logistic regression results. The paper finds evidence of a small farm bias in the use of informal credit, but the paper cannot generalize this to credit rationing as a matter of course. In part, it is believed that a preference for informal borrowing is related to some forms of credit rationing, spillover effects and collateral as some literature suggests, but the results suggest that by no means are these mutually exclusive or exhaustive. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses regression techniques based on 1,557 farm household surveys gathered by the authors in Shaanxi, Gansu and Henan Provinces in 2007 and 2008. Findings - The paper argues that informal lending amongst friends and relatives cannot be dismissed as a significant economic-factor in the financing of China's agricultural sector. A small farm bias in formal lending is indicated by the results, but there are many factors other than credit rationing which affect a households' decision to borrow informally. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to the survey data used. China's agricultural economy is too large to assert that the informal-formal relationships described herein are general, even though the results are supported by other research. Practical implications - The paper makes the case that the study of agricultural finance in China should include informal lending as part of any credit study. In addition, the paper argues that the use of the term informal lending should not generally group familial lending with other forms of interest-bearing loans such as pawn shops or money lenders. Social implications - China's rural credit needs are huge and many farmers do not have access to formal credit. This paper argues that the strength of trust relationships between friends and family is sufficiently high that nearly 60 percent of all credit outstanding is between friends and relatives at zero interest rates. Originality/value - This, it is believed, is one of the first comprehensive studies on informal lending in China.","[Turvey, Calum G.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Kong, Rong; Huo, Xuexi] NW A&F Univ, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Cornell University; Northwest A&F University - China,"Turvey, CG (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",cgt6@cornell.edu,"Huo, Xuexi/GPG-3739-2022","Huo, Xuexi/0000-0002-8263-9101; Turvey, Calum/0000-0001-5812-2957",W.I.

Design/methodology/approach - While the most recently available time-series and cross-sectional data from China are used to analyze the trends and disparities of China's milk production and dairy product consumption through graphical and regression analyses, China's custom data from 1995 to 2008 are used to examine the trends and patterns of China's dairy product imports. Findings - China's dairy market has expanded rapidly in the past two decades but there are significant disparities across regions and income groups. The estimated income elasticities suggest that, as per capita income continues to increase, the demand for dairy products, especially yogurt and fluid milk, is expected to grow at a significant rate. The import trend and pattern analysis indicates that China's dairy imports will likely continue to grow and provide opportunities for major dairy product exporters like the USA, New Zealand, and Australia. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the literature by examining the trends and disparities of China's dairy market using the most recently available data, presenting an estimation of demand elasticities for fluid milk, yogurt, and milk powder in urban China, and discussing the future prospects of China's dairy imports and implications for trade.","[Wang, Qingbin; Parsons, Robert; Zhang, Guangxuan] Univ Vermont, Dept Community Dev & Appl Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont,"Wang, QB (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Dept Community Dev & Appl Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",qwang@uvm.edu,,,,,,,29,22,31,1,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Given this type of competitive environment, management scholars have argued that agri-food firms that adopt capabilities for entrepreneurship will outperform firms that do not. We use agent-based simulation methods to explore this hypothesis. Agent-based models are particularly relevant in this study as they allow for the explicit simulation of the entrepreneurial behaviors and firm interactions that lead to wealth creation. In our analysis, we find that entrepreneurial capabilities of alertness, risk-taking, and efficiency vary in their effect on firm performance given alternative agri-food strategic landscape configurations.","[Ross, R.

I argue that (a) the farm structures that have emerged from the transition process are much more diverse than expected ex ante; (b) this diversity is to an important extent determined by economic mechanisms which are influenced by initial conditions and reform policies; (c) non-traditional farm structures have played an important role during transition because they were optimal to address the specific institutional and structural constraints imposed by the transition process; (d) there is more diversity than often argued in the farms that are integrated in global food chains; (e) endogenous institutional (contracting) innovations in food chains may lock existing farm structures in a long-run institutional framework; and (f) indicators based on farm structures are not a good measure of welfare effects of the globalization of food chains.","[Swinnen, Johan F.

Refugia management can delay its development by not exposing a proportion of the worm population to chemical control. A dynamic-optimisation model is used to assess the economic value of refugia for management of the worm species Teladorsagia circumcincta and macrocyclic lactone drenches in an application to Western Australian sheep flocks. A low rate of refugia (2 per cent) is most profitable under standard circumstances because it slows the development of resistance, but also reduces the proportion of the flock not exposed to chemical control. Frequent drench application should remain the primary method of control. However, its efficacy should be preserved through refugia management, rather than greatly reducing treatment frequency.","[Pech, Caris L.; Pluske, Johanna M.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Pech, Caris L.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Western Australia; University of Waikato,"Pech, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",cp@consultag.com.au; gdoole@waikato.ac.nz,"Pluske, John/D-3635-2013","Pluske, John/0000-0002-7194-2164; Doole, Graeme/0000-0002-6293-6491",,,,,24,8,8,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

To answer this question, we surveyed 1,000 shoppers in Seoul, Korea, and conducted a conjoint analysis on consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for country equity of domestic vs. imported beef and quality attributes of marbling, freshness, genetically modified organism (GMO)-free feed ingredients and antibiotic-free production. Among all factors contributing to the price differentials, the most important factor seems to be the country of origin followed by the use of GMO feeds and antibiotics in beef production, marbling grade and freshness. This study finds that Korean consumers value origins of imported beef approximately $14/lb less than the Korean origin. Korean consumers' valuation of beef quality and country of origin differs by some demographic groups: older vs. younger generations, homemakers vs. non-homemakers and consumers who prefer to purchase packaged beef vs. consumers who prefer to purchase butcher shop beef. Our empirical findings suggest that the top priority for beef exporters who wish to increase sales and value of their beef in the Korean market must be to counter Korean consumers' strong ethnocentrism by improving the value of their country of origin.","[Han, Sungill] Konkuk Univ, Dept Livestock Business Management & Mkt Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Chung, Chanjin; Boyer, Tracy] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Konkuk University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Han, S (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Livestock Business Management & Mkt Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",hansi@konkuk.ac.kr,,,"Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea","Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea","This research was supported by Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.",,31,41,55,1,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Balancing tests by checking the mean standardized absolute bias in the matched sample were conducted as well as a sensitivity analysis was conducted to check for hidden bias due to unobservable selection. The empirical results show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of bunds technology on input demand as well as a positive but insignificant impact on output supply and net returns. Adopters of the dibbling technology were found to have higher output supply, whereas no statistically significant difference was found between the incomes of adopters and nonadopters of dibbling seed method. The results, however, reveal a positive and significant effect on output and net returns when the dibbling method is combined with intensified weeding.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of allowing for negative, zero and positive preferences for prospective changes in woodland cover in two UK national parks, the Lake District and the Trossachs. An extended spike model is used to accomplish this. The policy implications of not allowing for negative values in terms of aggregate benefits are also investigated, by comparing the extended spike model with a simple spike making use of only zero and positive bids, and a model which considers positive bids only.

The analysis is carried out based on the derived dynamic optimization model, which is the dynamic investment model with adjustment costs. The credit rationing is introduced by imposing an upper limit on the control variable, which is in this case represented by the investment spending. Then, the optimal control is used to solve the optimization problem in the situation of both with and without credit constraints. Finally, the situations without and with credit rationing are compared. The results show that the occurrence of credit rationing or in general financial constraints significantly determines the capital accumulation and investment decisions of farmers and as a result their supply functions.","Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Agr Econ, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Cechura, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Agr Econ, Kamycka 129,6 Suchdol, Prague 16521, Czech Republic.",cechura@pef.czu.cz,"Cechura, Lukas/H-6694-2018","Cechura, Lukas/0000-0003-2727-1874","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports [MSM 6046070906]; Czech Science Goundation [402/06/P364]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic); Czech Science Goundation","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (Project No. MSM 6046070906) and the Czech Science Goundation (GACR No. 402/06/P364).

J,"Li, Y",,,,"Li, Yun",,,Iron deficiency and its impact on academic achievement,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public health; Education; Children (age groups); China,COGNITIVE SKILLS; ANEMIA,"Purpose - It is widely accepted that good health and education are important components of human capability. Although China has made encouraging progress in education and health causes, the role of poor health as an intervening factor in education has not been fully recognized. Iron deficiency is the major micronutrient deficiency encountered by children and adolescents. Many medical and social studies have found a negative correlation between iron deficiency and children physical growth and cognitive development. However, few of the existing literatures work to the conclusion of a causal relationship considering the endogenity problem in the estimation of a human capital model. The purpose of this paper is to study the iron status of elementary school children living in the poor countryside of western China and its educational consequence with the application of instrumental variable (IV) estimation. Design/methodology/approach - An analytical framework of academic achievement production is adopted in the paper to empirically identify the relationship between iron deficiency and academic achievement to estimate the impact. Findings - Using a sample of 45,549 school children from Gansu, the paper finds that around 86 per cent of the sample children are iron deficient and 40 per cent of the sample children are suffering from iron deficiency anaemia. The use of IV is innovative in identifying the endogenous health variable, namely iron deficiency. Originality/value - This paper enriches existing studies on children health and education. IV estimation indicates that iron deficiency has a significant adverse impact on school children academic achievement. The paper suggests health intervention, such as iron intake fortification, as a possible measure for education cause.","Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Development, CAAS","Li, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liyun@mail.caas.net.cn,,,,,,,15,5,6,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The target objects of the research were farmers taking care of mountain grasslands (meadows and grazing lands) in two protected landscape areas of the Czech Republic - the Beskyds and White Carpathians. The results are based on the sample survey carried out in 2006 and 2007. The first stage of the survey was devoted to the quality of life and business of farmers. The second stage of the survey concerned the financial condition of the farming businesses. Two statistical methods (analysis of variance, logistic regression) and the financial analysis method were used as analytic tools. The agricultural enterprises farming under environmental restrictions perceive their farming activities as a deal and mission. Farmers also accept restrictions while using the current subsidies. Compared to the farms outside the protected landscape areas, the farms in both protected land areas showed a higher profitability but a lower business activity. The analysis found out that the adverse age structure of farmers is a very important risk factor for rural development.","Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague 12058 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Spicka, J (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 75, Prague 12058 2, Czech Republic.",spicka.jindrich@uzei.cz,"Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013; Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013","Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544; Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0002-9266-9435",UNDP-GEF [UNDP-GEF 2255/1705],UNDP-GEF,Supported by the UNDP-GEF (Project No. UNDP-GEF 2255/1705 - Conservation of biological diversity of Carpathian Mountain grasslands in the Czech Republic through targeted application of new EU funding mechanisms).,,8,5,5,0,9,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

According to this scientific discipline, contrary to the neo-classical economy, price is not always the most important factor determining the consumer's purchase decision. The traditional spheres of behavioural approach to price perception have long been the analyses of the purchase processes of electronics and financial market products. Against this conception, the authors propose their own thesis on the possibilities of the behavioural approach utilization in the grocery market. Foodstuff is specific in many aspects, which is given by the fact that food products very often satisfy the very basic human needs. The thesis is backed up by the results of the primary inquiry of 3 520 respondents which has unveiled the fact that the consumer's price perception of grocery products should be more likely examined by the means of behavioural economy than the classical theory of rational choice (homo oeconomicus). The conducted survey showed that the price is surprisingly the least important attribute of food products. Furthermore, after divisioning the addressed consumers into groups by their age or by the achieved education level, the percentage share of those who answered that price is very important when choosing grocery products was very fluctuating. The traditional neo-classical approach assumes a consistent or eventually increasing importance (in the case we accept the presumption that the consumer's ability to decide rationally increases with a higher education level achieved). All findings of the primary inquiry then showed to be inconsistent with the traditional theory and in the author's opinion, the behavioural research in the field of food markets has proven to be highly relevant.","[Stavkova, J.; Stejskal, L.; Prochazkova, Z.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Stávková, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",stavkova@mendelu.cz; ladislav.stejskal@mendelu.cz; zuzana.prochazkova@mendelu.cz,"Stávková, Jana/T-8950-2017","Stávková, Jana/0000-0002-0889-0218",,,,,7,1,1,0,9,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Average levels of market integration are 31% for gross farm output, 35% for variable inputs, 49% for food consumption, and 80% for net family income. By estimating a two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression model, this study finds that integration into output markets is positively associated with a diversification of land use away from rice monoculture, more intense contact with nearby urban centers, and a greater number of roads connecting the village to the outside world. Controlling for these factors, the distance to urban centers does not impede market integration; distant villages are equally well integrated into output markets. The study further finds that integration into output markets improves farm productivity and net per capita income. Concerns about market integration are discussed. Results have implications for Thai policy makers who have recently placed increasing emphasis on the concept of sufficiency economy in order to promote the well-being of rural people.","[Tipraqsa, Prasnee; Schreinemachers, Pepijn] Univ Hohenheim, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Tipraqsa, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, 490D, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",prasnee@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Schreinemachers, Pepijn/0000-0003-1596-3179","global change SysTem for Analysis, Research, and Training; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB-564]","global change SysTem for Analysis, Research, and Training; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","Financial support of the global change SysTem for Analysis, Research, and Training (START program) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under SFB-564 is gratefully acknowledged.

The empirical analysis is based on the quantitative and qualitative approach. The results point out three different groups of producers, which are then described in detail with regard to their practices. The study suggests that the organic sector in the Czech Republic is becoming more differentiated and some of its current forms may violate the principles of sustainability.

The demand system is fitted to U.S. annual aggregate data over the last half of the 20(th) century and findings include that the price and income elasticity of demand for food-at-home are roughly two times larger than for food-away-from-home and that food-at-home and away-from-home are substitutes.

This article examines the economic implications of tariffs and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) regulations that are applied to global markets for fresh apples and fresh oranges. We calculate regional-level tariff rates and ad valorem equivalents for SPS barriers following the price-wedge approach. A simulation model is developed and used to assess the price, quantity, and welfare implications of reducing tariffs, removing SPS barriers, and removing SPS barriers that have been identified as a Specific Trade Concern (STC) by the World Trade Organization. Results suggest that a 36% reduction in global tariffs would lead to greater welfare gains than would the elimination of SPS measures in apple markets. However, in orange markets, we find that SPS measures have much larger economic implications for producers and consumers. Here, a 36% reduction in tariffs would lead to smaller overall welfare effects compared to removal of all SPS measures, and only slightly larger effects than those from removal of STCs alone.","[Rickard, Bradley J.; Lei, Lei] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Rickard, BJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 255 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bjr83@cornell.edu,,,,,,,57,5,6,2,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by an application to fish in Italy. The investigation illustrates the role played by both convexity and complementarity in the valuation of diversity.

Design/methodology/approach - A GARCH(1, 1) model is specified to measure the exchange rate volatility and autoregressive distributed lag regression with structural break dummy variables is estimated based on the results of unit root test with structural break. Findings - The export supply model reveals that the net trade effect of RMB exchange rate movements relies on the comparison of exchange rate level change (appreciation or depreciation) effect and exchange rate risk effect. The empirical examination results, taking China's agricultural exports to Japan as a case, show RMB depreciation against yen will promote export growth while appreciation hinder export, and exchange rate volatility positively stimulates agricultural exports to Japan. However, the effect of exchange rate volatility on the export is much smaller than that of exchange rate level, which leads to a negative net effect to the export. Originality/value - The constructed model and applied methodology contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between changes and volatility of China's RMB exchange rates and its agricultural export.","S China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wushan, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University,"Chen, LJ (通讯作者)，S China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wushan, Peoples R China.",wyclj@zju.edu.cn,,,Hainan University in China,Hainan University in China,Longjiang Chen is a post doctorate in the College of Economics and Management at South China Agricultural University in China.

This study examines whether the format in which ecosystem information is presented to respondents affects stated choice outcomes. Our analysis develops a utility-maximizing model to describe respondent behavior. The model shows how alternative questionnaire formats alter respondents' use of filtering heuristics and result in differences in preference estimates. Empirical results from a large-scale stated choice experiment confirm that different format presentations of the same information lead to different preference parameter estimates and error variances. A tabular format results in choice parameter estimates with statistically smaller variances than parameters estimated from data obtained with a text-based format. A text-based format also appears to induce greater use of decision heuristics than does a tabular format.,"[Hoehn, John P.; Lupi, Frank] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Lupi, Frank] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kaplowitz, Michael D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Agr Recreat & Resource Studies, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Hoehn, JP (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,"Hoehn, John/GZM-2242-2022; Lupi, Frank/N-3939-2019","Lupi, Frank/0000-0003-2287-2259",STAR; National Center for Environmental Research; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station,STAR; National Center for Environmental Research; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station,"John P.

The parameter estimates are used to simulate probabilities of new trade flows and the increase in existing trade flows following reductions in import tariffs, export subsidies and domestic support. The results show that adjustments in beef exports occur at both the extensive and intensive margins. Full liberalisation would entail adjustments in the extensive margins for developing economies that are about six-fold the adjustments under partial liberalisation.","[Tamini, Lota D.; Larue, Bruno] Univ Laval, Dept Econ Agroalimentaire & Sci Consommat, Quebec City, PQ G1A 0V6, Canada; [Gervais, Jean-Philippe] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",Laval University; North Carolina State University,"Tamini, LD (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Econ Agroalimentaire & Sci Consommat, 2425 Rue Agr, Quebec City, PQ G1A 0V6, Canada.",lota.tamini@eac.ulaval.ca,,"Tamini, Lota D./0000-0003-3423-3155",FQRSC; Canada Research Chair,FQRSC; Canada Research Chair(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs),"The Financial support from FQRSC and the Canada Research Chair program is gratefully acknowledged.

The demand for international agriculture research (IAR) continues to be strong today even while becoming increasingly differentiated by the stage of development that a particular country or region is in. The supply of IAR to developing country research programs is, however, becoming increasingly constrained by: variable donor support; a push toward downstream product adaptation and dissemination activities relative to innovation and product development; and a lack of clear links between international public good research and national agriculture development priorities. Country-level donor coordination and alignment mechanisms, specified in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, do not explicitly account for the role of IAR in the development process. While the movement toward national ownership of its development agenda and donor alignment around it is unquestionably good, an unintended consequence could be a break in the R&D pipeline that supplies public good research and technologies for enhancing developing country agriculture productivity growth.

This literature focuses mainly on stated preferences (SPs) and reported behaviours by the consumers. We combine consumers' SPs, obtained through a conjoint ranking experiment, with revealed preferences (RP), obtained through a retail scanner database. We evaluate SPs as predictors of RP, and investigate whether SPs and RPs are consistent. Dry-cured ham in Spain is chosen as the anchor product, mainly because of its broad customer base and long history of origin certification. A 'trick' nested logit model with non-identical and identical samples of consumers is estimated to answer each of the objectives. Results show that, irrespective of the analysed samples, SP can predict general market trends and choices but not accurately predict market shares, and that consumers' actual behaviour is partly consistent with their SPs. We find that consumers prefer ham produced in Teruel, compared with unspecified Spanish origin. Quality Certification and a Distributor's Brand are preferred over the alternatives of no quality label or identified with a brand owned by the producer. Interestingly, SPs for the Quality Certification and the distributor's brand lead to an over- and under-estimation, respectively, of the market share.","[Resano-Ezcaray, Helena; Isabel Sanjuan-Lopez, Ana; Miguel Albisu-Aguado, Luis] Govt Aragon, Ctr Agrofood Res & Technol CITA, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Resano-Ezcaray, Helena] Agrofood Sci & Technol Pk Aula Dei, Zaragoza, Spain",,"Sanjuán-López, AI (通讯作者)，Govt Aragon, Ctr Agrofood Res & Technol CITA, Avda Montanana 930, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.",aisanjuan@aragon.es,,"Resano Ezcaray, Maria Helena/0000-0002-4905-3694",European Commission [QLK1-CT-2002-02225]; National Institute of Agrofood Research and Technology (INIA) of Spain [PET2007-08-C11-10],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); National Institute of Agrofood Research and Technology (INIA) of Spain(Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA)),"Helena Resano-Ezcaray, Ana Isabel Sanjuan-Lopez and Luis Miguel Albisu-Aguado are based in the Centre of Agrofood Research and Technology (CITA), Government of Aragon, Avda Montanana 930, 50059 Zaragoza, Spain.

(2009, p. 521) corrected an error of fact by Hardaker et al. (2004b, p. 253) about the comparison between stochastic dominance with respect to a function (SDRF) and stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF). While both methods compare risky prospects for a bounded range of degrees of risk aversion, SERF, unlike SDRF, also demands an assumption that a chosen measure of risk aversion is constant over all levels of outcomes being evaluated. It is argued that it is generally reasonable to make such an assumption, especially when the form of the utility function and the bounds on the degree of risk aversion are carefully chosen. Then SERF has the advantage that it can lead to a smaller efficient set than that identified by SDRF. SERF also has advantages of ease and transparency in use.","[Hardaker, J.

Traditionally, governments have favoured the free allocation of greenhouse gas permits based on individual historical emissions ('grandfathering') or industry benchmark data. Particularly in the European Union (EU), the free allocation of permits has proven complex and inefficient and the distributional implications are politically difficult to justify; auctioning emissions permits has therefore become more popular. The EU is now moving to auction more than 50 per cent of all permits in 2013, and in the US the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) has begun auctioning more than 90 per cent of total allowances. Another case in point is the Australian proposal for a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), which provides for auctioning a significant share of total permits. This paper discusses the proposed Australian CPRS's auction design. A major difference to other emissions trading schemes is that the CPRS plans to auction multiple vintages of emissions permits simultaneously.","[Betz, Regina] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Ctr Energy & Environm Markets, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Seifert, Stefan] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Cramton, Peter] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kerr, Suzi] Motu Econ & Publ Policy Res, Wellington, New Zealand",University of New South Wales Sydney; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Betz, R (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Ctr Energy & Environm Markets, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",r.betz@unsw.edu.au,"Kerr, Suzi/ABG-5783-2020; Cramton, Peter/ABG-7651-2021","Kerr, Suzi/0000-0002-4730-8761; Cramton, Peter/0000-0001-8621-1092",,,,,36,23,26,2,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Using micro-level decisions from around 9000 household surveys in 11 countries, we analyze the choice of land types across the landscape with a multinomial discrete choice model. The choices and future adaptation measures are analyzed as a mosaic based on the typology of Agro-Ecological Zones. The results indicate that if climate becomes hotter and drier, Africa will adapt by increasing a joint production of crops and animals, especially in the lowland savannahs. On the other hand, if climate becomes wetter, it will switch more to forests, either with crops or with both crops and livestock, especially in the mid and high elevation humid zones. Forestry will play a significant role in adaptation when a substantial increase in precipitation makes animal husbandry an unattractive alternative.","Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Seo, SN (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",niggol.seo@aya.yale.edu,,"Seo, S.

Agricultural economists' empirical work in this field has informed the development of household production theory, hedonic price theory, definitions of poverty thresholds, complete demand systems, and survey and experimental techniques to elicit preferences.","[Unnevehr, Laurian] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Eales, James] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Jensen, Helen] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lusk, Jayson] Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [McCluskey, Jill] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Kinsey, Jean] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Iowa State University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Washington State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Unnevehr, L (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",,,"Unnevehr, Laurian/0000-0001-6754-2881; Jensen, Helen/0000-0001-6878-1729",,,,,114,66,79,2,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This paper explores the rural welfare effects of agricultural trade liberalization called for under the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), using a disaggregated rural economy-wide model nesting a series of agricultural household models. Lower tariffs reduce nominal incomes for nearly all rural household groups in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. However, they also lower consumption costs substantially. The net effect on rural households' welfare is positive in most cases, implying that pre-CAFTA agricultural protection policies are disadvantageous for most rural household groups.","[Taylor, J.

The results reveal significant differences, with more food safety issues coming into play in the case of the product associated with higher perceived risk in the past. This might suggest a non-temporal effect on consumers' level of risk perception in food products, with important implications for crisis management.

Design/methodology/approach - A normative food security framework is used to assess China's food security achievements and examine any remaining and emerging issues in its pursuit for food security. Findings - China has done well in achieving grain security in the past three decades. However, it cannot be concluded that China has achieved its food security according to the normative food security framework. This is because there are serious problems in the aspects of food safety and quality, environmental sustainability, and social stability. To achieve long-term food security, China has to tackle the wide spread issues of unsafe foods and foods of dubious quality, environmental pollution and degradation, and the establishment of a social security system. Originality/value - Examining China's food security practice over the past three decades can generate experiences and lessons valuable not only for China, but also for other developing countries in their efforts to achieving national food security. Issues are identified to which the Chinese government needs to pay attention in order to improve China's food security in the future.","James Cook Univ, Sch Business, Econ Discipline, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University,"Thou, ZY (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, Sch Business, Econ Discipline, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",zhangyue.zhou@jcu.edu.au,,"Zhou, Zhang-Yue/0000-0001-6328-4109",,,,,38,29,32,56,310,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We find that the agricultural chemicals with a different shape and function have different equilibrium prices, and the chemical attributes of permeability, rainfastness, being a substitute of the highly poisonous chemical, having a zero residue, and the internal absorption can all influence the equilibrium prices remarkably. We also find that the prices of biological and non-pollution agricultural chemicals might not be higher than the ordinary agricultural chemicals with the same characteristics.

Yet, while there are studies correlating a wide range of manager-related variables with returns, and, therefore, probably ability, little understanding of the basic determinants of managerial ability exists. Questions such as 'what is the importance of a farmer's family experiences and training in determining the farmer's managerial ability?' need answering. The solution to this, and other, questions will enable determining ways of improving farmers' inherent ability developed both in early, and later, life. In that most decisions on a farm are made intuitively, in contrast to the use of a formal analysis, improving farmers' inherent ability will have a significant payoff. The research reported here uses data from a large stratified random survey of 740 developed farmers (29 per cent had tertiary education, 30 per cent had 4 or more years secondary education) to create a structural equation model of the determinants of managerial ability. The results suggest that a farmer's exposure to experiences is a significant factor in ability, as is the farmer's management style and the family influence on early life experience.","Lincoln Univ, Canterbury 7647, New Zealand",,"Nuthall, P (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Canterbury 7647, New Zealand.",nuthallp@lincoln.ac.nz,,,,,,,62,40,46,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Our model interlinks two types of critical mass phenomena that can explain these outcomes. First, positive network externalities reshape decollectivisation incentives after a sufficient number of reform pioneers shift to private farming. Second, workers have preferences for behaving in conformity with their social reference group. This allows collective farm managers interested in cementing their own power to manipulate reference groups by limiting workers' horizons. We provide empirical support with a threshold regression based on a unique data set of regional reform outcomes in Moldova.","[Petrick, Martin] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Carter, Michael R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Carter, Michael R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Petrick, M (通讯作者)，Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",petrick@iamo.de,"Petrick, Martin/AAI-1154-2020; Policy, Department Agricultural/X-9655-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012","Carter, Michael/0000-0003-0960-9181",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors are grateful to Heinz Hockmann, Andrey Nedoborovskyy, Eberhard Schulze, the referees of this journal and seminar participants in Berlin, Budapest, Halle, Kiel, Madison and Stuttgart for helpful comments.

Transportation costs directly affect the marketing margin and also exacerbate market power by limiting farmers' access to buyers. This article develops a multistage spatial model to determine optimal investment in transportation improvements, taking account of impacts on marketing costs and competition. The beneficial impact of investments from farmers' perspective is mainly through enhanced competition, meaning significant under-investment may occur if this effect is ignored. However, the optimal investment depends on the relative importance of transportation costs; in some settings, transportation improvements reduce farm prices because buyers rationally over-compensate farmers for these costs.","[Merel, Pierre R.; Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Suzuki, Aya] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Mérel, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,,44,18,21,0,25,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9092,,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Four hypothetical brands were developed to individually represent local/Canadian, natural, guaranteed tender, and Angus attributes, respectively. It was found that WTP was highest, approximately $1.31 per 12 ounce steak, for branded steaks associated with the natural, guaranteed tender, and Angus attributes. It was further discovered that WTP is positively affected by preference for the brand name, frequency with which beef is consumed, and the male gender. Conversely, confidence in selecting beef tended to reduce WTP, while effects of age, education, and income were uncertain. It is concluded that the industry should explore opportunities to market higher value products both domestically and abroad if the cost of doing so does not exceed WTP premiums.","[Carlberg, Jared G.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Froehlich, Eve J.] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Winnipeg, MB R3C 3G7, Canada; [Ward, Clement E.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",University of Manitoba; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Froehlich, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",froehliche@agr.gc.ca; jared_carlberg@umanitoba.ca; clement.ward@okstate.edu,,,National Beef Industry Development Fund; Livestock Marketing Information Center,National Beef Industry Development Fund; Livestock Marketing Information Center,"The authors would like to acknowledge research support from the National Beef Industry Development Fund and the Livestock Marketing Information Center, and extend thanks to the two anonymous reviewers and CJAE Editors for their helpful suggestions.",,39,30,37,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

We examine the price impacts emanating from product differentiation, market concentration, and market size. The econometric investigation finds evidence of subadditive bundle pricing in patented biotech traits.

Improvements in agricultural productivity are often found to spill into other areas of a developing economy, potentially improving the standards of living of urban and rural workers alike. Given the importance of this sector, accurate measures of total factor productivity (TFP) across countries can be helpful in identifying conditions, institutions or policies that promote agricultural development. In this article, we estimate TFP growth in agriculture for a panel of 39 sub-Saharan African countries from 1961 to 2007. We also develop a set of development outcome measures theoretically consistent with strong agricultural performance to serve as external validation of our results. We find that three estimation methods (stochastic frontier, generalised maximum entropy, and Bayesian efficiency) generate relative rankings that are consistent with the development outcome measures, providing external validation of the methods.

The paper discusses advantages of using the GCP instead of the Gross Domestic Product. The paper reveals that the GCP falls sharply as temperature increases in the region. A 1 degrees C increase in temperature would decrease the productivity with an elasticity of -2.4. A 1 per cent decrease in precipitation would decrease productivity with an elasticity of -2.3. However, forest vegetation on the coasts will benefit from initial warming. We find that the changes in climate means are potentially more harmful than changes in climate variability. In the long term, a 3.4 degrees warming coupled with 6.6 mm decrease in rainfall would decrease the GCP by 34 per cent by 2060. The damage is largely accounted for by population effects. The paper confirms that Australia is highly constrained by climate and geographic factors.","Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Nat Resources, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Seo, SN (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Nat Resources, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",niggol.seo@sydney.edu.au,,"Seo, S.

With the use of the general equilibrium model, scenarios concerning an increase of subsidies reaching 100% of the national envelope and a complete removal of both SAPS and Top-Up payments are applied. The results show that if the full amount of subsidies is granted, the value added in agriculture and the connected sectors is stimulated, with a positive effect on the total GDP. However, if the direct payments are completely removed, negative effects on employment can be expected, suggesting that the direct payments play a positive role in the economy.

Economic efficiency of the systems is evaluated through the return of investment, net current value and inner profit percentage. Within the assumption of the objective evaluation of input parameters, we can expect an acceptable economic efficiency of the investment only in the slim spindle technological system.

Neither a neoliberal nor a neoregulatory approach is likely to be able to solve pressing problems affecting agriculture and natural resources, such as a deterioration in environmental quality and the challenge of climate change. To find solutions we need to employ a more realistic behavioural model than that typically used in economic analysis, and to recognise the key role played by values in individual and collective decision making. A more devolved approach to policy formation based on collective action seems to offer the greatest chance of success. More effort needs to be directed to understanding the drivers and processes of collective decision making, and how it can be harnessed to address pressing policy issues.","Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Blandford, D (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",dblandford@psu.edu,,,,,,,77,4,6,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

The underlying assumption is that differences in intended behavior are well described by such variables, while there is no a priori reason that this is the case. Moreover, heterogeneity in farmer goals and preferences, in relation to the role of the farm enterprise, are not well documented in developing countries. This article makes a contribution to fill this gap, by empirically determining heterogeneity in farmer goals and attitudes in Nigeria through a pair-wise ranking, supplemented with Likert scales. Factor analysis is used to reduce these data into behavioral factors. We estimate technical and allocative efficiency levels and analyze how these are related to farm characteristics and the identified behavioral factors. The models in which both intended behavior and farmer characteristics are included give a significantly better fit over models in which only household characteristics are included. These regression results suggest that the socioeconomic environment affects efficiency levels both directly and indirectly, through changes in goals and attitudes.","[Berkhout, Ezra D.; Schipper, Robert A.; Kuyvenhoven, Arie] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Coulibaly, Ousmane] Int Inst Trop Agr, Cotonou, Benin",Wageningen University & Research,"Berkhout, ED (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",ezra.berkhout@wur.nl,,"Berkhout, Ezra/0000-0003-2536-8912",,,,,29,20,25,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Specifically, the Random Parameters family of models is a superior specification for the estimation of technical efficiency in the analysis.

City-based social health insurance (SHI) is the primary form of current health insurance, supplemented by various commercial health insurance programs. The rural new cooperative medical system (NCMS) was introduced in 1993 and extended to cover the whole of rural China in 2003. Design/methodology/approach - The paper developed a theoretical model for consumer demand of medical services and health insurance based on an expected utility framework with a two-stage decision under uncertainty. The model is then applied to current health insurance systems in China for urban citizens and rural residents separately. Least square and logistic regressions are employed. Findings - The major results are that although the factors driving the decisions on health insurance participation are basically the same for rural and urban citizens, the participation levels are quite different. The major difference is that urban SHI has higher coverage and urban citizens have higher income, resulting in a much larger urban medical expenditure. Practical implications - The empirical analysis reveals that health insurance programs have played an important role in the healthcare expenditure for urban residents, while the NCMS has not made a significant impact towards increasing the ability of rural residents to seek more medical services, based on data at 2004. Originality/value - This is the first paper employing a health production theory on China's new urban and rural healthcare programs.","[Wang, H.

Data come from farms in five EU New Member States. The contribution of unsold output to total household income is valued. Stepwise linear regression is employed to detect variables useful in explaining the degree of agricultural market integration of farm households. The analysis indicates that subsistence farming is of utmost importance for the rural poor, particularly in Bulgaria and Romania. The proportion of consumption from own production, manual cultivation techniques, and distance to an urban center are negatively correlated with output sales.

Small farms are struggling to retain competitiveness via improved management and low-input systems. Using data from USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey, we determine the extent of U.S. conventional and pasture-based milk production during 2003-2007, and estimate net returns, scale efficiency, and technical efficiency associated with the systems across different operation sizes. We compare the financial performance of small conventional and pasture-based producers with one another and with large-scale producers. A stochastic production frontier is used to analyze performance over the period for conventional and pasture technologies identified using a binomial logit model. Large conventional farms generally outperformed smaller farms using most economic measures-technical efficiency, various profitability measures, and returns to scale.","[Gillespie, Jeffrey] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Ctr Agr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Nehring, Richard; Sandretto, Carmen; Hallahan, Charlie] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Gillespie, J (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Ctr Agr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",jmgille@lsu.edu,,,,,,,21,29,35,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The first is an open-ended choice experiment (OECE) where participants name the quantities of golden rice and conventional rice demanded at each of several price combinations, one of which will be randomly chosen as binding. This allows us to estimate market demand by aggregating demand across participants. This estimate of market demand also allows us to estimate own-price elasticity and consumer surplus for golden rice. Comparing willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates from the OECE with those from a uniform-price auction, we find that OECE WTP estimates exhibit less affiliation across rounds, and the effects of positive and negative information under the OECE are more consistent with prior expectations and existing studies. We also find that, while auction WTP estimates more than double across five rounds, OECE WTP estimates are stable across rounds and are always roughly equal to those from the final auction round.","[Corrigan, Jay R.] Kenyon Coll, Dept Econ, Gambier, OH 43022 USA; [Depositario, Dinah Pura T.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Econ & Management, Dept Agribusiness Management, Los Banos, Philippines; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Wu, Ximing] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Laude, Tiffany P.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Econ & Management, Dept Agr Econ, Los Banos, Philippines",University System of Ohio; Kenyon College; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Corrigan, JR (通讯作者)，Kenyon Coll, Dept Econ, Gambier, OH 43022 USA.",,"Depositario, Dinah Pura T./ABG-5379-2021; Corrigan, Jay/AAH-1630-2020",,,,,,50,76,92,2,62,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Based on Juselius (2006), market integration is found both on the fresh and frozen markets. The Law of One Price is in force on the fresh market within the segments of flatfish and pelagic fish. Assuming transitivity, a loose form of market integration is identified between 13 fresh and seven frozen fish species, and the relative prices are found fairly stable. The policy implication is that catch limitation measures implemented through the Common Fisheries Policy have limited and conditional effects on prices, because of the large size of the market and varying market integration. Therefore, many fishermen are not 'compensated' by price increases as a result of catch limitation measures.","[Nielsen, Max] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Fac Life Sci, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Smit, Jos] LEI, NL-2502 LS The Hague, Netherlands; [Guillen, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Copenhagen; Wageningen University & Research; University of Barcelona,"Nielsen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Fac Life Sci, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",max@foi.dk; jos.smit@wur.nl; jordi.guillen@jrc.it,"Nielsen, Max/F-4544-2015; Guillen Garcia, Jordi/K-4048-2016","Nielsen, Max/0000-0002-4283-1852; Guillen Garcia, Jordi/0000-0003-3705-2253",,,,,20,68,69,1,23,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

We use rice price data across four quarters of 2000-2001 along with data on transportation costs and infrastructure availability for nearly 1,400 communes in Madagascar to examine the extent of market integration at three different spatial scales-subregional, regional, and national-and to determine whether non-integration is due to high transfer costs or lack of competition.

A baseline scenario with existing tariffs was developed; a reduced tariff and free trade scenarios were simulated. Comparison of these scenarios with the baseline shows that apple trade is significantly greater under trade liberalization. China increases its exports by 174% under free trade and replaces France as the largest exporter. U.S. exports increased by about 140% to all regions except to Canada and Southeast Asia.

Import demand equations were estimated using a production version of the Rotterdam model in an Armington framework. With the expiration of the LomE Convention, tariffs (up to 24%) on Kenyan roses were likely if an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) was not signed by January 2008. Roses from African countries not subject to tariffs were expected to displace Kenya's exports in the future. However, results of this study showed that roses from African countries were complements in the EU market and those exports from Zimbabwe and Other African countries would have been negatively impacted if a Kenya-EU EPA was unsuccessful. Given the maximum import duty on Kenyan roses, EU imports from Kenya would decrease by 9.1% and imports from Zimbabwe and Other African countries would decrease by 6% and 4%, respectively.","Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",Mississippi State University,"Muhammad, A (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, POB 5187, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",muhammad@agecon.msstate.edu,,"MUHAMMAD, ANDREW/0000-0002-4825-9324",,,,,39,12,14,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Their demand is a crucial factor in the decisions about production - what to produce, how much, and what way. The aim of this paper is to provide the analysis of the elasticity of the consumer demand on pork, based on the influence of the change of the determinants influencing the demand on the consumer level of the vertical product line, and subsequent evaluation of the character and intensiveness of the consumer demand elasticities. The evaluation is founded on the determined coefficients for the individual elasticities of consumer demand on the selected commodity. The analysis of the elasticity of the consumer demand on pork is based on a five-factor model of the consumer demand on pork. It was estimated and qualified by the microeconomic theory for estimation and interpretation of individual elasticity coefficients and regression analysis. Furthermore, our attention is focused on determination and interpretation of the coefficients of direct price elasticity of demand, cross-price elasticity of demand, and income elasticity of demand. The value of the price elasticity of demand on pork is 0.770937. As an increase in the buyers' income evokes an increase in demand, it can be stated that pork meat is a superior good for the Slovak inhabitants. Cross-price elasticity of demand between pork and poultry is 0.617363, and between pork and beef it is 0.343435. As the value is positive, pork, poultry, and beef are substitute goods for the consumers. During the studied period, the demand on pork was quarterly decreasing by 0.05162% in average. On the basis of the results received from the analysis of the elasticities of the demand on the consumer level of the studied product vertical line, it can be stated that Slovak consumers of pork meat react more responsively to the change of income than to the change of the price of this good.","[Bielik, P.; Sajbidorova, Z.] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Bielik, P (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",peter.bielik@uniag.sk; zuzana.sajbidorova@fem.uniag.sk,"Bielik, Peter/AAL-5561-2020",,,,,,15,8,9,1,12,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Cap-and-trade has been applied to various air pollutants including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the United States and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the European Union. This corresponds to what is likely to become the most expensive environmental undertaking in history - the effort to reduce the heating of the planet. However, the efficacy of a cap-and-trade policy for CO2 depends in large part on the design of the program. In addition to the level of the cap, the most important decision facing policymakers will be the initial allocation of emissions allowances. The method used to allocate tradable emissions allowances will have significant influence on the distributional impact and efficiency of the program.","[Evans, David A.] US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, Washington, DC 20460 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency,,evans.davida@epa.gov,,,Mistra's Climate Policy Research Program (CLIPORE),Mistra's Climate Policy Research Program (CLIPORE),"Research support for Burtraw was received from Mistra's Climate Policy Research Program (CLIPORE).

J,"Guo, P; Jia, XP",,,,"Guo, Pei; Jia, Xiangping",,,The structure and reform of rural finance in China,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; Rural economies; Credit; Loans,CREDIT MARKETS; INSTITUTIONS; ECONOMICS; STATE,"Purpose - Historically, China's political attempts to provide access to rural credit has met with mixed results and an institutional structure that often strays from intended policy goals. Unlike Robin Flood of English lore, the emergence of financial institutions in China appears to have robbed from the poor to lend to the rich, with actions that severely depleted the lending resources required for rural development. Historically, there has been a close correspondence between financial depression and the many policy-driven financial institutions that dominated the rural financial system in China. More recently, ongoing reforms are dedicated towards a gradual liberalization within the system. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to rethink the structure of rural finance in China, reviewing the current reform and putting forward the policy implications. Design/methodology/approach - The paper explores the context of agricultural transition and political process as defined by the various interlinkages across the Chinese rural financial system. Findings - The paper finds that there has been negligible progress in the evolution of the rural financial market in China. The policy-led financial institutions ended up as merely a disbursement window and a costly drain on state budget. Institutional changes were locked in by patching up the existing institutions. The ongoing reforms projected by policymakers promote competition among different institutional lenders and thus potentially improve the financial services in rural areas. Originality/value - This paper analyzes the new-round reform of rural finance in China and brings forward the future direction of rural finance in China.","[Guo, Pei] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Ctr Rural Dev Policy, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Jia, Xiangping] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Guo, P (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Ctr Rural Dev Policy, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",guopei@cau.edu.cn,,,,,,,32,34,36,4,57,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) programs proliferated between the national decree of 2002 and 2008, moving from a situation where less than 10 per cent of the rural population had access to health insurance to one where over 80 per cent had the opportunity to participate in these programs. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how NRCMS affects equity goals in access to health care and explore the gender-specific determinants for farmers to participate in NRCMS and use health care services. Design/methodology/approach - Empirical analysis, by using the national rural socio-economic survey data collected by the Centre for Chinese Agricultural Policy, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2005. Based on Andersen's access to medical care model, the probit model for regression was used. All analyses are conducted with Stata 9.0 software. Findings - Gender was found to have significant effects on both NRCMS participation and health care use. Age, education, deductible level and ceiling limits of reimbursement had positive effects on both NRCMS participation and health care use. The narrow coverage with high co-payment compensation system asserted significant deterrence effects on equity access to health care. This is only a first step toward building an adequate health safety net for all rural residents, there is still a long way to go. Originality/value - Using the national household survey data, this study is one of few studies focusing on the interplay between gender and the distinct determinants of access to health care under the ongoing NRCMS. The relevant findings have important implications for further policy design.","[Liu, Huixia] Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Summerfield, Gale] Univ Illinois, Women & Gender Global Perspect Program, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Shi, Yaojiang] Northwest Univ, NW Socioecon Dev Res Ctr, Xian, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Northwest University Xi'an,"Liu, HX (通讯作者)，Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China.",lhuix666@yahoo.com.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023",,,,,,60,0,0,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Prior research shows that this mutation has effects on performance and traits of fed cattle and milk production in dairy cows.

The risk analysis relates to the growing conditions, crop yields and the livestock productivity. The future role of the Subsidies as the risk management tool in the farming business, as well as the position of this instrument against the other risk management instruments is analysed. The break even analysis and the Monte Carlo simulation are used as analytical tools. The results indicate that the current subsidies have an impact on the stability of the farmers' income. Partially or fully decoupled payments serve as a financial pillow increasing the level of the farmers' income and extending the farmers' decision-making possibilities. Furthermore, the current subsidies reduce the variability of the farmers' income.

To help quantify the costs of this water reallocation, a hydro-economic model was constructed based on the 19 regions of the MDB. The model results indicate the following: (i) substantial reductions in surface water extractions of up to 4400 GL per year impose only a moderate reduction on net profits in irrigated agriculture, Basin wide, given competitive water markets, but the effects are much more pronounced in particular regions/catchments and (ii) the costs of the water reallocation are comparable with the amount budgeted by the Australian government to acquire water from willing sellers and increase environmental flows if inter-regional water trade is unrestricted.","[Grafton, Rupert Quentin] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, CWEEP, Acton, ACT, Australia; [Grafton, Rupert Quentin] Australian Natl Univ, UNESCO Chair Water Econ & Transboundary Water Gov, Acton, ACT, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University,"Grafton, RQ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, CWEEP, Acton, ACT, Australia.",quentin.grafton@anu.edu.au,"Grafton, Quentin/AAS-2316-2021","Grafton, Quentin/0000-0002-0048-9083",,,,,19,25,27,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In particular, the non-market value can be examined by assessing the public's willingness to pay for the policy outputs as a whole or by modelling the preferences of society for the component attributes of the rural landscape that result from the implementation of the policy. In this article we examine whether the welfare values estimated for an agri-environmental policy are significantly different between an holistic valuation methodology (using contingent valuation) and an attribute-based valuation methodology (choice experiment). It is argued that the valuation methodology chosen should be based on whether or not the overall objective is the valuation of the agri-environment policy package in its entirety or the valuation of each of the policy's distinct environmental outputs.","[Hynes, Stephen] Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Socioecon Marine Res Unit, Galway, Ireland; [Campbell, Danny] Queens Univ Belfast, Inst Agri Food & Land Use, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Howley, Peter] Rural Econ Res Ctr, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Queens University Belfast; Teagasc,"Hynes, S (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Socioecon Marine Res Unit, Galway, Ireland.",stephen.hynes@nuigalway.ie; d.campbell@qub.ac.uk; peter.howley@teagasc.ie,"; Campbell, Danny/E-1873-2011","Howley, Peter/0000-0002-3385-629X; Campbell, Danny/0000-0001-7467-2318","Irish Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food","Irish Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food","This paper was written as part of a Rural Stimulus Funded project, financed by The Irish Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.",,51,40,42,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The optimal decision rules differ significantly from the expected net present value rule, which ignores uncertainties, and from real options models that allow only one-way conversion into energy crops. These models also predict drastically different patterns of land conversions into and out of energy crops over time. Using corn-soybean rotation and switchgrass as examples, we show that the model predictions are sensitive to assumptions about stochastic processes of the returns. Government policies might have unintended consequences: subsidizing conversion costs into switchgrass may not much affect proportions of land in switchgrass in the long run.","[Song, Feng] Renmin Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jinhua] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zhao, Jinhua] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Swinton, Scott M.] Michigan State Univ, DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Renmin University of China; Michigan State University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Michigan State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE),"Song, F (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,"Zhao, Jinhua/GYV-4433-2022",,DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (DOE BER Office of Science) [DE-FC02-07ER64494]; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1027253] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (DOE BER Office of Science)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),Research support was provided by the DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (DOE BER Office of Science DE-FC02-07ER64494).,,36,87,107,0,59,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

From the viewpoint of functioning of own agrarian trade it can be stated that the CR is roughly self-sufficient by 70-80% in products of a competitive nature. In case of products of a non-competitive nature, the CR shows almost zero self-sufficiency. It means that agrarian foreign trade occupies a non-substitutable position in the CR economy (at least from the export point of view). In the light of our own trade flows, the CR performs as an active exporter and importer (about 100 billion and 130 billion CZK respectively, in 2009). However, together with the still growing needs of the national economy and the inhabitants' requirements for a varied composition of agri-food products, the CR does not succeed in the long term to decrease the negative balance of the agrarian foreign trade. It is, however, indisputable that if a serious discussion should be held about the competitiveness of Czech agriculture in confrontation with foreign producers or suppliers of agricultural and food products, the priority task to reach a balanced agrarian foreign trade balance can be accepted only for the competitive products segment. The complexity of a greater participation of the basic Czech agricultural and food products on the EU unified market deepens simultaneously with the acceleration of the liberalisation process on this market. The gradual process of the world agrarian market liberalisation then means that the cost and price relationships are determined by such world producers as are able to offer agrarian products for the most advantageous prices, or offer goods of exceptional quality, with a high added value, brand products, national specialties and so on. Potentially, the space for improvement of the active balance of agrarian foreign trade (AFT) is given to us in much the same way as to our competitors, but actually, our possibilities are limited. The stagnation or even growth of the negative AFT balance was, and is influenced by non-substitutable imports of non-competitive food raw materials and foodstuff products and many other raw materials required by the non-agricultural sectors of the national economy.","[Volosin, Josef; Smutka, Lubos] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Selby, Richard] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management & Mkt, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Volosin, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 6, Czech Republic.",volosinj@upcmail.cz; smutka@pef.czu.cz; selby@pef.czu.cz,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 604070906]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Projects No. MSM 604070906).",,31,15,15,0,13,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper first decomposes the regional disparity in China's agricultural productivity growth into its components: technical change, efficiency change and input accumulation per worker. The convergence test is also used to analyze the determinants of regional disparity. Findings - The paper finds that during 1987 and 2005, although the growth of China's agricultural labor productivity mainly depended on the accumulation of inputs, technical changes contributed more to regional disparities in agricultural productivity growth. Originality/value - This paper, which studies the determinants of regional disparities in China's agricultural labor productivity growth, contributes to a better understanding of China's agricultural growth and how to reduce the regional inequality. It is indicated that improving efficiency to promote total factor productivity growth is important for agricultural labor productivity growth for the three regions Eastern, Central and Western of China. The increase in inputs for Western China, and the improvement in technical change for Central and Western China are significant aspects to promote the growth of agricultural productivity and narrow the gap with Eastern China.","[Xin, Xiangfei; Qin, Fu] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Development, CAAS","Qin, F (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qinfu@mail.caas.net.cn,,"Xin, Xiangfei/0000-0002-2141-8911",,,,,15,15,18,2,43,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We estimate California egg consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for cage-free eggs using household-level purchase data and compare the implied premium to higher production costs when calculating the potential change in consumer surplus. Our findings suggest that larger households and/or households with limited means are most likely to be affected. Furthermore, the implied welfare loss for consumers is approximately $106 million. Although consumers value cage-free eggs, higher production costs result in a net welfare loss to consumers. One implication of this finding is that a clear labeling practice may be a more efficient way to motivate animal welfare and non-cage systems.","[Allender, William J.; Richards, Timothy J.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness & Resource Management, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Allender, WJ (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness & Resource Management, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,,"Richards, Timothy/0000-0001-8832-9609",Consumer and Market Demand Network of the University of Alberta; Economic Research Service of the USDA,Consumer and Market Demand Network of the University of Alberta; Economic Research Service of the USDA,"William J.

Of course, the public sector played a pivotal and catalytic role when India ushered in the Green Revolution in late 1960s and early 1970s. The public sector imported new seeds, organized their distribution and demonstration, and provided price and market support, all not-for-profit. The cooperative sector, supported and facilitated by the government, again with the spirit of not-for-profit, helped bring in the White Revolution in milk through Operation Flood in 1970s and 1980s. This spirit is now being gradually replaced by for-profit objective driven by the private sector, as is demonstrated in the revolutionary changes brought about by the introduction of Bacillus thuringiensis technology in the cotton sector during 2002-2007. On top of this, the corporate sector is also changing the complexion of the Indian agrisystem through notable changes in organized food processing and retailing. This change in spirit from not-for-profit to for-profit in the growth process of Indian agriculture has significant implications for the concept of CISS, i.e., competitiveness, inclusiveness, sustainability, and scalability, which needs to be studied carefully and in detail. Accordingly, this article traces some of these dynamic changes and their likely implications.","[Gulati, Ashok; Ganguly, Kavery] IFPRI, New Delhi, India",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Gulati, A (通讯作者)，IFPRI, New Delhi, India.",,,,,,,,13,9,9,1,21,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

To counter these constraints, new cropping systems have been developed, including push-pull, rotations with promiscuous soybean varieties and green manure crops, and imidazolinone resistant- (IR-) maize. To analyze the technical and economic performance of these technologies, both with and without fertilizer, on-farm researcher-managed long-term trials were implemented over six seasons in two sites each in Vihiga and Siaya districts of Western Kenya. The economic results, based on marginal analysis using a multioutput, multiperiod model, show that the new cropping systems with fodder intercropping (push-pull) or soybean rotations were highly profitable. Push-pull is more profitable but requires a relatively high initial investment cost. Green manure rotation, IR-maize, and fertilizer all increased yields, but these investments were generally not justified by their increased revenue. We argue that research on rotation and cropping systems to tackle pest and soil fertility problems in Africa deserve more attention. This will require increased collaboration between agronomists and economists to set up long-term experiments with new cropping systems to develop proper economic models.","[De Groote, Hugo; Rutto, Esther; Kanampiu, Fred] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Nairobi, Kenya; [Vanlauwe, Bernard] Int Ctr Trop Agr TSBF CIAT, Trop Soil Biol & Fertil Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Odhiambo, George D.] Maseno Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Hort, Maseno, Kenya; [Khan, Zeyaur R.] Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol, Nairobi, Kenya",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Maseno University; International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE),"De Groote, H (通讯作者)，Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, POB 1041-00621, Nairobi, Kenya.",h.degroote@cgiar.org,"De Groote, Hugo/C-7525-2009","De Groote, Hugo/0000-0002-5081-0189; vanlauwe, bernard/0000-0001-6016-6027",Department for International Development (DFID),Department for International Development (DFID),"The authors would like to thank the participating farmers for making their land available and their help with the project, D.

Results provide the longitudinal progression of the probability of exiting the tobacco industry since the end of the federal tobacco program in 2004, and identify off-farm participation, percentage of farm receipts from tobacco, tobacco price, educational level, and farm size as the most important determinants of the decision to exit the tobacco industry.

A unique dataset containing firm-level cost and production information on the French Brie cheese is used, covering the period 1980-2000. The Brie cheese data are especially relevant as PDO Brie producers have coexisted with other non-PDO producers since 1981. To evaluate the producers' incentive to opt for PDO certification, we use a structural switching regression model which incorporates cost and production structure variables. Results show that PDO certification is less attractive the higher the costs of raw materials and the greater the size of the company. PDO Brie cheese production costs are estimated to be on average 40% higher than those for non-PDO Brie. The PDO production process could be technically inefficient when compared with the unconstrained non-PDO manufacturing; yet, PDO producers benefit from a price premium on their product which offsets their higher production cost.","[Chaaban, Jad] Amer Univ Beirut, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Beirut 11052020, Lebanon; [Bouamra-Mechemache, Zohra] INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31931 Toulouse, France",American University of Beirut; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Chaaban, J (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Beirut, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Beirut 11052020, Lebanon.",jc11@aub.edu.lb,,,,,,,18,32,33,2,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

The PMP variant is evaluated according to the predictions of the bio-economic farm model, developed within the framework for integrated assessment of agricultural systems in Europe (SEAMLESS). The forecasting capacity of the model calibrated with the standard PMP approach and the alternative PMP variant, respectively, is tested in ex-post experiments for the arable farm types of Flevoland (the Netherlands) and Midi-Pyrenees (France). The results of the ex-post experiments, in which we try to simulate farm responses in 2003 using a model calibrated to 1999 data, show that the alternative PMP variant improves the forecasting capacity of the model in all tested cases.","[Kanellopoulos, Argyris] Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Berentsen, Paul; van Ittersum, Martin; Lansink, Alfons Oude] Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Heckelei, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, D-5300 Bonn, Germany",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; University of Bonn,"Kanellopoulos, A (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",argyris.kanellopoulos@wur.nl,"Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/H-8840-2012; Heckelei, Thomas/C-2714-2011; van Ittersum, Martin/J-8024-2014; Berentsen, Paul/P-6457-2014","Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/0000-0002-9273-6044; Heckelei, Thomas/0000-0002-6251-3480; van Ittersum, Martin/0000-0001-8611-6781; Berentsen, Paul/0000-0001-9675-1041",SEAMLESS; European Commission; DG Research [010036-2],SEAMLESS; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); DG Research,"Argyris Kanellopoulos is with the Business Economics Group, Wageningen University, The Netherlands.

The study utilizes cross-sectional farm household-level data collected in 2006 from a randomly selected sample of 439 small-scale export farmers. We estimate the casual impact by utilizing a two-stage Poisson regression model, two-stage standard treatment effect model, as well as by regression based on propensity score, to assess the robustness of the results. Using these techniques, we demonstrate that the pesticide-ascribed incidence of acute illness symptoms and the associated cost of illness significantly decrease with the adoption of standards. Ceteris paribus, farmers who adopt standards experience 70% lesser incidence of acute illness and spent about 50-60% less on restoring their health than nonadopters. Although standards can potentially prevent resource-poor smallholders from maintaining their position in lucrative export markets, they can also result in positive changes in the health of those farmers who do adopt them, as shown by these results. This implies that, if adopted on a large scale, standards may reduce production externalities, corroborating the view that they may serve as a catalyst to transform production systems in developing countries.","[Asfaw, Solomon] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mithoefer, Dagmar] World Agro Forestry Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mithoefer, Dagmar] Icipe Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol, Nairobi, Kenya; [Waibel, Hermann] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE); Leibniz University Hannover,"Asfaw, S (通讯作者)，Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, POB 39063-00623, Nairobi, Kenya.",s.t.asfaw@cgiar.org,,,German Development Cooperation (BMZ/GTZ,German Development Cooperation (BMZ/GTZ,The article is based on a study conducted under a collaborative research project between the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) and the Leibniz University of Hannover.

We control for the source of the investment, the sector in which the investment is undertaken, and the investment type in addition to project size. The results indicate market size to have a positive impact on FDI flows under all specifications-a result consistent with earlier studies. Other variables are unstable depending on specification and the subset of the data used. Furthermore, we find no significant differences in factors that drive FDI flows by source country, while greenfield investments are seen to respond more to the growth potential of the market relative to other forms of investment. In general, we find macroeconomic variables to be poor at explaining project-level FDI in the region. The descriptive analysis of the data points us more in the direction of the gravity model, with factors such as colonial ties and proximity of the investing country appearing to matter.

This paper estimates the strength of state dependence associated with breakfast cereal consumption and its heterogeneity across households, where positive state dependence implies habit persistence and negative state dependence implies variety seeking in consumption. The analysis uses a detailed micro-level dataset from the research institute GfK Sweden on household breakfast cereal consumption in 2003. The analysis relies on a mixed multinomial logit model and finds breakfast cereal consumption is generally highly habitual. The degree of habit persistence, however, exhibits heterogeneity across households. In addition, some households can be characterised as variety seeking. The strength of habit persistence is similar across income and educational groups. The strength of habit persistence seems to be weaker for households with several adults and children compared with one-adult households.","Swedish Retail Inst HUI, Res Dept, S-10329 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Thunström, L (通讯作者)，Swedish Retail Inst HUI, Res Dept, Regeringsgatan 60, S-10329 Stockholm, Sweden.",linda.thunstrom@hui.se,,"Thunstrom, Linda/0000-0002-5728-4089",Swedish Research Council Formas,Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),Financial support from the Swedish Research Council Formas is gratefully acknowledged.,,43,8,12,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Factor analysis was carried out to identify the factors that lead farmers to participate in the contract farming. Based on the analysis, five factors were identified as the reasons for contracting, namely, market stability, and access to marketing information and technology, transfer of technology to improve farming practices, access to inputs and indirect benefit.

We find EUT rejections in cases where risk-averse choices are made between gambles with similar stakes, regardless of their absolute sizes.

In the separating equilibrium of the game, the initial payment of the CWB is larger than the initial payment under complete information. There exists an incentive under incomplete information to send a signal that realized yields are greater than expected to induce a reduction in the sales of foreign competitors.

Design/methodology/approach - There is no existing mature method to calculate the welfare change of a special supply chain, such as the cotton supply chain The method most used in such situations is the equilibrium displacement model, created by Muth, and developed by Gardner. Findings - The financial crisis has had important impacts on China cotton industry. Farmers' losses are bigger than people estimate Circulation link's loss is a little lower than cotton farmers' Producers' loss is far lower than circulation and cotton farmers. Consumers' loss is the biggest loss in the whole cotton supply chain: however, some of these are foreign consumers especially foreign wholesalers and retailers Originality/value - This paper is the first to study the quantitative welfare change of China's cotton supply chain under the shock of financial crisis, providing useful information for government and company decision making.","Anhui Agr Univ, Coll Management Sci, Hefei, Peoples R China",Anhui Agricultural University,"Xiao, SX (通讯作者)，Anhui Agr Univ, Coll Management Sci, Hefei, Peoples R China.",xsx2006_2008@126.com,,,National Public Research Institute; Analysis and Forecasting of the Situation of China Staple Agricultural Products,National Public Research Institute; Analysis and Forecasting of the Situation of China Staple Agricultural Products,"The author would like to thank the National Public Research Institute's project, supported by basic research business fund, the Analysis and Forecasting of the Situation of China Staple Agricultural Products, for financial support",,28,3,3,0,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGRIC ECON REV,China Agric.

The model includes yield responses to time of sowing at each location given current and projected climatic conditions. These yield relationships are based on wheat growth simulation modelling that in turn draws on data from a down-scaled global circulation model. Wheat price distributions and cost of production data at each location, in combination with the time of sowing yield relationships are used to determine a farmer's optimal investment in crop sowing work rate under each climate regime. The key finding is that the impacts of climate change on profit distributions are often marked, yet mostly modest changes in investment in work rate form part of the profit-maximising response to climate change. The investment response at high versus low rainfall locations mostly involves increases and decreases in work rates, respectively. However, changes to investment in work rate within a broadly similar rainfall region are not always uniform. The impacts of climate change on investments in work rate at a particular location are shown to require knowledge of several factors, especially how climate change alters the pattern of yield response to the time of sowing at that location.","[Kingwell, Ross] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Kingwell, R (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",rkingwell@agric.wa.gov.au,"Kingwell, Ross/AAU-9315-2020; kingwell, ross/AAK-2952-2021","Kingwell, Ross/0000-0003-0324-9488;",,,,,36,10,10,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The traditional channel of monetary policy implementation works via the interest rate changes and their impact on the investment activity and the aggregate demand. Altering the relationship between the aggregate demand and supply then impacts the general price level and hence inflation. Alternatively, the Post-Keynesians postulate money as a residual, In their approach, banks credit in response to the movements in investment activities and demand for money. In this paper, the authors use the VAR (i.e. the vector autoregressive) approach applied to the Taylor Rule concept to identify the mechanism and impact of the monetary policy in the small open post-transformation economy of the Czech Republic. The causality (in the Granger sense) between the interest rate and prices in the Czech Republic is then identified. The two alternative modelling approaches are tested. First, there is the standard VAR analysis with the lagged values of interest rate, inflation and economic growth as explanatory variables. This model shows one way causality (in the Granger sense) between the inflation rate and interest rate (i.e. the inflation rate is (Granger) caused by the lagged interest rate). Secondly, the lead (instead of lagged) values of the interest rate, inflation rate and real exchange rate are used.

More specifically, this paper investigates whether or not rural farm households in China balance business risks from agricultural production with financial risk from the use of debt. Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected through a survey of 400 farm households in Shaanxi province conducted in October 2007. Four separate regressions are run using a credit measure as the dependent variable and measures of profitability, risk, risk aversion, and demography, and debt source (formal versus informal lending) as independent variables. Findings - The model shows evidence of risk balancing. That is, there is strong evidence that Chinese farmers reduce credit use and financial risk, as business risks increase. Practical implications - The results suggest that Chinese policy makers could encourage the use of finacial leverage and prudent debt use by offering risk reducing programs such as crop insurance, weather insurance, or price insurance. Originality/value - This paper uses a unique survey form to collect production risk data as well as gather information on credit use and sources. Data were collected so that risk measures could easily be computed using a triangular distribution. Furthermore, this is believed to be the first empirical validation of the risk balancing hypothesis.","[Turvey, Calum G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Kong, Rong] NW A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Xianyang, Peoples R China",Cornell University; Northwest A&F University - China,"Turvey, CG (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",cgt6@cornell.edu,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [70873096]; Cornell University, USA","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Cornell University, USA","The authors would like to thank David Just (Cornell University) and Jaclyn Kropp (Clemson University) for their comments on the survey methods and the 40 unnamed graduate students from Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University who conducted the field survey on the authors behalf.

The novel technique of robust mathematical programming is introduced as a means to proactively account for this uncertainty in policy analysis. The procedure allows identification of expected bounds on the range of abatement costs associated with environmental policy. It also has the advantage of not limiting conclusions to realisations of specific point estimates or probability distributions. Empirical insights are provided in an application to a New Zealand inland lake threatened by nitrate pollution from dairy farming. Overall, this novel framework is demonstrated to have several key advantages, including explicit treatment of severe uncertainty, capacity to bound the range of expected abatement costs accruing to a given policy instrument, and the opportunity to identify robust plans that are immune to parametric variation.","[Doole, Graeme J.; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Doole, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",gdoole@waikato.ac.nz,"Pannell, David/B-4476-2008","Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; Doole, Graeme/0000-0002-6293-6491",,,,,37,9,10,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

To develop this model, we extend Dempster, Laird, and Rubin's 1977 work on the expectations maximization algorithm to the estimation of a multinomial logit model with missing information on category membership. Our model can be used to determine within-choice heterogeneity. Using data on the preservation of Saginaw wetlands in Michigan, we find evidence for two types of Yes responders in the data. We suggest that one set of Yes responders consists of yea-sayers who answer Yes to the hypothetical question but are less likely to pay the bid amount if it were real. We suggest that the second group of respondents does not suffer from hypothetical bias and are more likely to pay the bid amount if it were real. Even if the connection to hypothetical bias cannot be made, our method can be used in sensitivity analyses of willingness-to-pay estimates.","[Caudill, Steven B.] Rhodes Coll, Dept Econ, Memphis, TN 38112 USA; [Groothuis, Peter A.; Whitehead, John C.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Caudill, SB (通讯作者)，Rhodes Coll, Dept Econ, Memphis, TN 38112 USA.",,,,,,,,29,12,15,2,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Quantile regressions with fit errors expressed as a function of forecast lead time are consistent with theoretical forecast variance expressions while avoiding assumptions of normality and optimality. Based on out-of-sample accuracy tests over 1995/96-2006/07, quantile regression methods produced intervals consistent with the target confidence level.

In all scenarios where consumers show a relative preference for U.S. tomatoes, Mexican tomato exports decline and U.S. production increases. Mexican trade losses using low- to mid-range consumer preference assumptions are 14% to 32% of the value of Mexican tomato exports to the United States and 1% to 3% of the total value of agricultural produce exports, partially negating the market access gains of NAFTA. Consumer effects are small and sometimes negative.

However, most of the available studies concentrate on export markets and fail to capture spillover effects that modern supply chains may have on local markets. Here, we analyze the case of sweet pepper in Thailand, which was initially introduced as a product innovation in modern supply chains, but which is now widely traded also in more traditional markets. Using survey data from smallholder farmers and econometric techniques, we show that sweet pepper cultivation contributes significantly to higher household incomes. Strikingly, at this stage, participation in modern supply chains does not lead to higher incomes than supplying sweet pepper to traditional markets. However, the results also indicate that missing land titles, weak infrastructure conditions, and limited access to information constituted serious constraints during the early phases of sweet pepper adoption. Such constraints need to be overcome, so that smallholder farmers are better prepared for the prompt reactions needed under rapidly changing market conditions.","[Schipmann, Christin; Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Schipmann, C (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cschipm@uni-goettingen.de,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763",German Research Foundation,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The financial support of the German Research Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.,,35,62,69,1,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Differences in observed forecast accuracy among the different moving averages are usually less than a cent per bushel, and most are not statistically significant. Further, the search for an optimal length of moving average may be futile since the optimal length depends on how much structural change has occurred.

Data were obtained by conducting a questionnaire research with 75 farmers. Laying hen farms were divided into three groups according to their sizes and were analyzed accordingly. It was found that higher capacity farms had a higher egg yield and a better feed efficiency. It was also found that farms with a higher capacity were advantageous in terms of the technical and economic criteria. Results showed that as farm capacity increased, production cost per hen decreased and net profit per hen increased. It was found that profit margin was negative for group I and positive for group II and III, and profit margin increased as the farm capacity increased.","[Demircan, Vecdi; Yilmaz, Hasan; Dernek, Zeynep; Bal, Tufan; Gul, Mevlut] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey; [Koknaroglu, Hayati] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Anim Sci, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey",Suleyman Demirel University; Suleyman Demirel University,"Demircan, V (通讯作者)，Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey.",vecdem@ziraat.sdu.edu.tr,"Gül, Mevlüt/J-1711-2014; Koknaroglu, Hayati/AAI-9064-2021","Gül, Mevlüt/0000-0002-0147-7228; Koknaroglu, Hayati/0000-0003-4725-5783",Suleyman Demirel University [1375-M-06],Suleyman Demirel University(Suleyman Demirel University),Supported by the Research Fund of Suleyman Demirel University (Project No. 1375-M-06).,,17,7,7,0,10,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

There are several reasons causing this situation: the financial situation of the inhabitants, high prices of the temperate zone fruit in shops and the unhealthy eating habits of the consumers. The expenses on fruit have been decreasing within the consumer basket in our country. The consumption of fruit and the fruit products ( in the value of fresh fruit) rose in 2006 in comparison with 2005 and achieved 54.0 kg per capita. The increase of fruit consumption was recorded thanks to the growth of the fruit containing products. Despite the rising tendency of the fruit consumption per capita, it is still much lower than the recommended dose. Based on the questionnaire survey, the objective of this paper is to identify and analyse the attitudes and behaviour of Slovak consumers, particularly from the Nitra region, to the temperate zone fruit consumption. The survey showed that health is the most important reason for the temperate zone fruit consumption. Apples and grapes are the most frequently consumed sorts. They comprise 50% of the total consumption of the temperate zone fruit. The consumption of the temperate zone fruit has stagnated recently according to the responses of half of the respondents, and even 66% of them would like to increase the temperate zone fruit consumption. Consequently, the dependence of the particular answers to the questions and the indications of a respondent (sex, age, education, locality) were studied by the use of the associative analysis.","[Lusnakova, Zuzana; Sajbidorova, Maria; Horvathova, Jarmila; Lusnak, Jozef] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Lusnáková, Z (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",zuzana.sajbidorova@fem.uniag.sk; maria.sajbidorova@fem.uniag.sk; jarmila.horvathova@fem.uniag.sk; jozef_lusnak@yahoo.com,"Lušňáková, Zuzana/AAL-8249-2020","Lušňáková, Zuzana/0000-0001-6331-9930",,,,,12,1,1,3,12,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The conclusions obtained are unsettling. Multinationals benefit from the local brancehes in terms of knowledge than what they contribute. In the agro-industrial business cluster, multinationals are present as supply companies (e.g. seeds and machinery). However, they also play an important role because, in most cases, they constitute the company demand (retail distribution chain). In this context, this study intends to verify whether multinationals, by means of these two forms of interaction, encourage the use of generic technology, acting as a vector (carrier) that transfers (diffuses) technology throughout their branch networks. In this sense, we analyze the role of multinational companies within the cluster comprised of production and marketing companies, as well as the auxiliary industry for agriculture in the Almeria province (Spain).","[Perez-Mesa, Juan C.] Univ Almeria, Dept Business Adm & Management, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain; [Galdeano-Gomez, Emilio] Univ Almeria, Dept Appl Econ, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain",Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria,"Pérez-Mesa, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Almeria, Dept Business Adm & Management, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain.",juancarl@ual.es; galdeano@ual.es,"Gomez, Emilio/KBQ-1973-2024; Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/K-5440-2014; Galdeano-Gómez, Emilio/J-9979-2014","Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/0000-0003-2382-3475; Galdeano Gomez, Emilio/0000-0001-5414-4331",Spanish MCINN; FEDER [ECO2008-02258],Spanish MCINN(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),This research was partially funded by Spanish MCINN and FEDER aid ECO2008-02258.,,40,13,13,0,38,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Some researchers have argued that these market participants-through their impact on market prices-may have inadvertently prevented the efficient distribution of food aid to deserving groups. Certainly, this result-if substantiated-would counter the classical argument that speculators make prices more efficient and thus improve the economic efficiency of the food marketing system. Given the very important policy implications, it is crucial to develop a more thorough understanding of long-only index funds and their potential market impact. Here, we review the criticisms (and rebuttals) levied against (and for) commodity index funds in recent U.S. Congressional testimonies. Then, additional empirical evidence is added regarding cross-sectional market returns and the relative levels of long-only index fund participation in 12 commodity futures markets. The empirical results provide scant evidence that long-only index funds impact returns across commodity futures markets.","[Irwin, Scott H.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Sanders, Dwight R.] So Illinois Univ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Irwin, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, 344 Mumford Hall,1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",sirwin@illinois.edu,"Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020; Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848",,,,,28,77,86,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We analyzed the milk risks perceived by students and found out that the top three listed risks are: (1) the use of low quality materials in milk packaging; (2) bacteria contaminations in milk production and processing; and (3) unsafe milk caused by the use of cow antibiotics. The binomial probit regression analysis shows that the health conscious milk consumers who consume milk frequently are likely to be worried about the safety of milk. Wealthy students from a household of three members or more are likely to be concerned about the milk safety. This study demonstrates that the current government efforts to raise milk consumption among college students are insufficient. Policies that reduce the perceived risks can be an effective strategy to raise milk consumption among the educated youth.","[Xu, Pei] SUNY Morrisville, Sch Agr & Nat Resources, Morrisville, NY 13408 USA; [Zheng, Shi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Motamed, Mesbah] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; Morrisville State College; Renmin University of China; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Xu, P (通讯作者)，SUNY Morrisville, Sch Agr & Nat Resources, Morrisville, NY 13408 USA.",xup@morrisville.edu,,,,,,,41,9,9,4,24,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We explore the optimal allocation of a fixed budget, taking into account risk differentials, and the optimal-sized budget to minimise total pest costs. A partial-equilibrium market model is used to compute the economic consequences of pest invasion. An application to Dutch imports of chrysanthemum cuttings shows that the optimal allocation of a fixed inspection budget halves the cost of pest invasion compared to allocating the same budget equally over all imports. A budget increase that enables 42 per cent more inspection can reduce total societal costs by 81 per cent compared to smaller, constrained budget that ignores risk differentials.","[Surkov, Ilya V.; Lansink, Alfons G.

In the absence of more or less binding international agreements, we would expect carbon emissions to be seriously excessive, and climate change problems to be unsolvable. Against this obvious general point, we observe many countries acting unilaterally to introduce carbon emission policies. That is itself an explanatory puzzle, and a source of possible hope. Both aspects are matters of 'how politics works'- i.e. 'public choice' problems are central. The object of this paper is to explain the phenomenon of unilateral policy action and to evaluate the grounds for 'hope'. One aspect of the explanation lies in the construction of policy instruments that redistribute strategically in favour of relevant interests. Another is the 'expressive' nature of voting and the expressive value of environmental concerns. Both elements - elite interests and popular (expressive) opinion - are quasi-constraints on politically viable policy. However, the nature of expressive concerns is such that significant reductions in real GDP are probably not sustainable in the long term - which suggests that much of the CO(2) reduction action will be limited to modest reductions of a largely token character. In that sense, the grounds for hope are, although not non-existent, decidedly thin.","[Brennan, Geoffrey] Australian Natl Univ, RSSS, Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Brennan, Geoffrey] Duke Univ, Dept Polit, Durham, NC USA; [Brennan, Geoffrey] UNC Chapel Hill, Dept Philosophy, Chapel Hill, NC USA",Australian National University; Duke University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Brennan, G (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, RSSS, Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",geoffrey.brennan@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,20,34,37,1,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In some cases these standards are privately determined but in other cases they have been established by governments. Indeed, the Government of Canada recently announced its organic food regulations. A key dimension of the policy process involves choosing which standards are to be used to govern the production of organic food. Unfortunately, decision makers faced with these choices know very little about how the public values the various standards that could be used to define organic. This study evaluates Canadian consumers' preferences for different organic standards. Standards pertaining to pesticide-residue testing, product origin specifications, the standard setting agency, and standard monitoring agency are evaluated using a conjoint method. Key results suggest that consumers place a high value on a pesticide standard that involves regular testing of the end product and that they prefer an organic food standard to include a rule that limits where the good is produced.","[Cranfield, John; Deaton, B.

Using a stratified random sample of rural households in Shandong Province, we find that young and educated members of the labor force tend to work more frequently in the off-farm labor market, and that off-farm employment reduces the likelihood and intensity of fruit production. Fruit production is associated with lower levels of off-farm employment. Households and individuals who are less likely (or able) to find off-farm employment can benefit from shifting into fruit production. Although off-farm employment is an important avenue out of poverty, fruit production provides ways for the less educated and older households to raise their income.","[Huang, Jikun; Wu, Yunhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yunhua] Inner Mongolian Agr Univ, Hohhot 010018, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Inner Mongolia Agricultural University,"Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Jia 11 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,,,,,16,55,66,2,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper empirically investigates repression in rural China using the McKinnon-Shaw model and microeconomic data combined with lending and savings rates and ceilings by rural credit cooperatives. Findings - The paper finds only limited evidence of a repression dominated by savings, while investment response appears to be, at least on average, normal or unrepressed. More specifically, the paper finds that the relationship between growth and investment is consistent with an unrepressed economy but savings do show evidence of repression. Originality/value - The political focus of economic reformation in China has been one of rapid economic growth in urban areas and a neglect of the agriculture sector. This focus on urban growth has led some Chinese scholars to speculate that the residual impact is a repressed agricultural and rural economy, at least in the context of McKinnon and Shaw framework. However, such speculations have not previously been verified. This paper presents the first attempt to determine the relationships exclusively in the context of the agricultural economy.","[He, Lin] Zhongkai Univ Agr & Engn, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Turvey, Calum] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA",Zhongkai University of Agriculture & Engineering; Cornell University,"He, L (通讯作者)，Zhongkai Univ Agr & Engn, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lvlvlh@gmail.com,,"Turvey, Calum/0000-0001-5812-2957","Guangdong Province (People's Republic of China) [071152040018, 04GH79004]",Guangdong Province (People's Republic of China),This paper reflects the views of the authors alone and not those of any other person or institution.

J,"Scarborough, H",,,,"Scarborough, Helen",,,Intergenerational equity and the social discount rate,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,intergenerational equity; social discount rate,STERN; ECONOMICS,Recent modelling of the costs and benefits of climate change has renewed debate regarding assumptions for the social discount rate in analysing the impacts of environmental change. Previous literature suggests two key factors influence estimates of the social discount rate: the rate of pure time preference and the elasticity of marginal utility of future consumption. These components of the social discount rate reinforce the linkages between the choice of social discount rate and intergenerational distribution. This paper addresses the question of the relationship between intergenerational equity and the social discount rate and promotes the application of intergenerational distributional weights as a means of incorporating intergenerational equity preferences in policy analysis. Intergenerational equity-adjusted social discount rates are derived as a means of decomposing the intergenerational equity aspect of the social discount rate. The work has significant policy implications for projects with long time frames given the sensitivity of Cost Benefit Analysis outcomes to decisions regarding the social discount rate.,"Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Warrnambool, Vic, Australia",Deakin University,"Scarborough, H (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, POB 423, Warrnambool, Vic, Australia.",scars@deakin.edu.au,"Scarborough, Helen/R-9280-2019","Scarborough, Helen/0000-0002-0562-1987",,,,,42,18,19,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

If people were to make a narrow rational choice that they would snatch the unattended flowers, the market would collapse. We find that actual payment rates vary substantially between individuals.

Increased concerns about the economic and ecological costs of invasive plants have spawned interest in identifying strategies to curtail introductions. One possible strategy is labeling plants based on whether they are invasive or native. The primary purpose of this paper was to explore how labeling plants based on invasive and native attributes might affect consumer demand. To accomplish this objective, a second price auction was used to elicit the willingness to pay (WTP) for plants with and without labels. On average, we found a $0.35 premium for plants labeled as noninvasive and native and a $1.01 to $1.66 discount for plants labeled as invasive. The size of these premiums and discounts differed in relation to various demographic, attitudinal, and preference-related factors. Overall, our results suggest that labeling plants as invasive or native could be a viable strategy for reducing the introduction of invasive plants.","[Yue, Chengyan; Hurley, Terrance M.; Anderson, Neil] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Yue, Chengyan; Anderson, Neil] Univ Minnesota, Dept Hort Sci, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Yue, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1970 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",yuechy@umn.edu,,"Hurley, Terrance/0000-0003-2135-7570",,,,,53,33,43,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a panel dataset covering 28 provinces of China over the period from 1988 to 2007, this paper employs Hansen's method and two-step GMM-SYS estimator to estimate the threshold regression model and the dynamic fixed-effect panel model, respectively. Findings - The urban-rural income gap is found to be related to high-level human capital investment in an inverted U-shaped pattern with respect to economic development level. The estimated threshold turning point is around 20,000 RMB GDP per capita. This estimate is sufficiently robust to model specifications and variants of the dependent variable. Social implications - The authors forecast that high-level human capital investment could play a role in bridging the urban-rural income gap at the national level by 2014, when China's GDP per capita assumes an annual growth rate of 7.5 percent.

Design/methodology/approach - Two sets of the authors' own primary survey data were used: a group of randomly selected high school students in Shaanxi Province and a census of all freshmen entering into four universities in Sichuan, Anhui and Shaanxi. The intention was to show if the rate of the rural poor attending universities is lower than that of urban students and that of rural non-poor; also to identify the barriers to education (if they exist) that are keeping enrollment rates low for the rural poor. The authors used ordinary least squares method to make the estimations. Findings - Matriculation rate of the poor into college was found to be substantially lower than the students from non-poor families. Clearly, barriers exist that are excluding the rural poor; however, the authors demonstrate that the real barriers are not at the point of college admissions, but before students have even matriculated into high school. Originality/value - This is the first empirical work which studies the barriers that keep the poor out of university.","[Rozelle, Scott; Sharbono, Brian] Stanford Univ, Shorenstein Asia Pacific Res Ctr, Freeman Spogli Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shi, Yaojiang] NW Univ Xian, Coll Econ Management, Xian 710069, Peoples R China; [Glauben, Thomas] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Wang, Xiaobing; Liu, Chengfang; Zhang, Linxiu; Luo, Renfu] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China","Stanford University; Northwest University Xi'an; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Rozelle, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Shorenstein Asia Pacific Res Ctr, Freeman Spogli Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rozelle@stanford.edu,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023",,"Cyrus Tang Foundation; IET/CORE Foundation; Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe, Germany; Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute","Cyrus Tang Foundation; IET/CORE Foundation; Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe, Germany; Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute","The authors would like to thank Jennifer Adams, Fang Chang, Jin He, Min He, Prashant Loyalka, Yingquan Song, Hongmei Yi, Ai Yue and Qiran Zhao for support of this work and comments on early drafts of the paper.

Design/methodology/approach - The analytical model is developed using a joint production function, where carbon emissions and electricity are jointly produced using capital and fossil fuel inputs. Abatement of emissions can be achieved by investment in production capital that improves the production efficiency or abatement capital that removes the emissions. The results are estimated using data from China's electricity generation sector. Findings - The analytical model shows that economic growth can be achieved while still keeping the emission stock at a stable level. The results show that the level of the tax required to stabilize emissions depends greatly on the efficiency of abatement activities. As an illustration of this result, one finding shows that the required emission tax would be reduced greatly from 16 to 5 yuan/ton of emission when the abatement technology is improved from removing 10 to 30 percent of emissions flow. Research limitations/implications - The lack of carbon capture and storage technology in the real-world limits the ability to estimate some of the results from the economic growth model. Originality/value - Unlike many other papers, the empirical analysis is based on conditions from the economic model. In contrast to previous work that models emissions as an input into the production process, the model and estimation are consistent with the joint nature of electricity and emissions production.","[Schoengold, Karina] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Schoengold, Karina] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE USA; [Zhang, Zhenyu] Shanghai Acad Agr Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences,"Schoengold, K (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",kschoengold2@unl.edu,"zhang, zhenyu/HOA-8440-2023",,,,,,22,3,3,0,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Pour comprendre les repercussions du changement climatique sur le rendement des cultures irriguees, il faut disposer d'une representation explicite des changements spatiaux qui touchent les stocks naturels (c.-a-d. l'approvisionnement en eau) et de leur variabilite temporelle (c.-a-d. les etats de la nature de la frequence de la secheresse) et assurer une gestion active des stocks de capital grace a des strategies d'attenuation et d'adaptation selon l'etat de la nature.

Prior to 2005, there was little correlation between energy and agricultural commodity prices. In 2006-2008, with the ethanol boom in the United States, there emerged a strong link between crude oil, gasoline, and corn prices. There was little link between ethanol and corn. However, in late 2008 and 2009, the markets changed as ethanol production came under severe economic pressure and 2 billion out of 12 billion gallons of capacity shut down. During this period ethanol became priced more on corn, as the breakeven corn price helped drive the ethanol market. This article explores the drivers in these markets as well as other major issues facing the corn ethanol industry in the United States such as the blend wall. The article concludes with a review of prospects of a future cellulosic biofuels industry.","Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Tyner, WE (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,,7,99,111,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We develop an alternative structural model of markets that incorporates explanatory variables and generates the probability that a single market is integrated, therefore making it possible to identify specific factors or regions of a country associated with low integration. Our application to intraprovincial rice markets in Madagascar predicts that 56% of markets are integrated. High crime areas are less likely to be integrated, while the center of the country has a higher level of integration.","[Butler, J.

Although we are not able to identify structural differences between these sectors, the empirical results show that fishmeal demand is price inelastic.

Using a unique 10-year panel data set and recently developed dynamic panel data estimators, the growth process of dairy processors is investigated for six rather diverse European countries. The data structure and the estimation method allow for dealing with endogeneity issues in an appropriate way. Firm size growth measured in total assets is found to be affected by firm size, firm age, and financial variables. Growth in number of employees is only affected by firm age and lagged labor productivity.

The target range of 5-15 per cent cuts in national emission entitlements during 2000-2020 was weak, in that on balance it is too low to minimise Australia's long-term mitigation costs. The free allocation of output-linked, tradable emissions permits to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) sectors was much higher than proposed earlier, or shown to be needed to deal with carbon leakage. It plausibly means that EITE emissions can rise by 13 per cent during 2010-2020, while non-EITE sectors must cut emissions by 34-51 per cent (or make equivalent permit imports) to meet the national targets proposed, far from a cost-effective outcome. The weak targets and excessive EITE assistance illustrate the efficiency-damaging power of collective action by the 'carbon lobby'. Resisting this requires new national or international institutions to assess lobby claims impartially, and more government publicity about the true economic importance of carbon-intensive sectors.","[Pezzey, John C.

A diagnosis defined by the means of diagnostic methods must help to implement the goals which lead, on the base of business management activities, to the generation of an adequate response to the given momentary situation existing in the diagnosed enterprise. The definition of a proper diagnosis is important especially in those periods when the enterprise passes through its life crisis under the conditions of market recession.

The model is formulated as a stochastic continuous-state dynamic programming problem, and is solved numerically for Southwestern Minnesota, USA. Results show that optimal investment decisions are dynamic and take into account the future decisions due to uncertainty, partial irreversibility, and the option to wait. The optimal policy includes ranges of inaction, states where the optimal policy in the current year is to wait. The risk-averse farmer makes a lower investment in risky farmland reflecting risk-avoiding behavior. We find that, in addition to risk aversion, the length of the planning horizon affects risk-avoiding behavior in investment decisions. In contrast to a static model, changes in the riskiness of returns affect optimal investment decisions even when the decision maker is risk neutral. Finally, we find that higher debt financing on farmland is optimal when risky nonfarm assets can be included in the optimal investment portfolio and that the probability of exiting farming increases with the risky nonfarm investment.","[Lohano, Heman D.] Inst Business Adm, Dept Econ & Finance, Karachi 75270, Pakistan; [King, Robert P.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Institute of Business Administration, Karachi; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities","Lohano, HD (通讯作者)，Inst Business Adm, Dept Econ & Finance, Main Campus,Univ Rd, Karachi 75270, Pakistan.",loha0002@umn.edu; rking@umn.edu,,"Lohano, Heman Das/0000-0001-7640-1124",,,,,43,5,6,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The main research question focuses on the causes of regionally persistent structures. An empirical Markov chain model is defined for the West German agricultural sector. The model is used to explain the probabilities of farm growth, decline, or exit in terms of the current and former regional farm size structure. Further, the impact of variables describing the regional farm structure, thereby indicating market power of the large, the potential of high competition for land within a region, and possibly high rents of the status quo in combination with sunk costs, is quantified. The results confirm the relevance of strategic interaction as a crucial determinant of persistent regional differences in the farm size structure over time.","[Huettel, Silke] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, D-1086 Berlin, Germany; [Margarian, Anne] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst vTI, Inst Farm Econ, Braunschweig, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Huettel, S (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, D-1086 Berlin, Germany.",silke.huettel@agrar.hu-berlin.de,,"Huttel, Silke/0000-0002-2141-2931",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),We gratefully acknowledge financial support from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through Research Unit 986 SiAg Structural Change in Agriculture.

The nutrient-income elasticity is estimated using both parametric and semiparametric methods. A special focus is placed on the nonlinearity of the relationship between nutrient intake and income and on measurement error and endogeneity issues. One major finding is that income elasticity for calories is close to zero when we control for measurement error issues. For some nutrients, namely fats, vitamin A and C, calcium, and heme iron, we find a sizeable positive income elasticity robust to the choice of the estimator and percentiles at which it is evaluated. These nutrients are also those for which we find the largest deficiency in our sample.

Econometric analyses struggle with causality issues and are unclear about the channel of effects. We quantify the dynamic effects of supermarket expansion on agriculture within a structural framework that clarifies the adjustment mechanisms involved. The model specification allows for endogenous interaction between agricultural productivity and supermarkets' choice of suppliers. Based on numerical simulations, two results emerge. First, we offer a possible interpretation of the conflicting evidence in the empirical literature. Whether farmers benefit from supermarkets or get stuck in a low productivity trap depends on the extent of local constraints related to production capacity and market access. Second, supply chain development initiated by supermarkets can help farmers escape the low productivity trap. While supermarkets face a short-run cost to supplier upgrading, they gradually gain from more productive local suppliers.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Stokke, HE (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",hildegunnes@svt.ntnu.no,,"Stokke, Hildegunn E./0000-0003-4633-4172",,,,,31,8,9,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Due to numerous market failures, there are few ways to shift risks to third parties. The literature has focused on what determines the responses of households in such environments. Of special concern are path dependencies in which households experiencing failure are prone to further failure and potential poverty traps. This paper estimates levels and determinants of risk aversion in the highlands of Ethiopia. We find high risk aversion and evidence that constraints have important impacts on risk-averting behavior with perhaps significant implications for long-term poverty.

This paper explores the use of a 'compliance-reward' approach under heterogeneous net compliance costs with respect to cost-share working lands programmes such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) in the United States. Specifically, we examine the use of a reward under asymmetric information and output price uncertainty. We examine two possible sources of financing under the assumption of budget neutrality: (i) funds obtained by reducing monitoring effort; and (ii) money saved by reducing the number of farmers enrolled. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each source of funding and analyse these numerically for both risk-neutral and risk-averse farmers. We also examine the trade-off between increased expenditure on monitoring effort and compliance rewards when additional budgetary resources are available. We show that under certain conditions a compliance reward can increase compliance rates. For risk-averse farmers, however, conditions that ensure a positive outcome become more restrictive.","[Yano, Yuki] SLU, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Blandford, David] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Yano, Y (通讯作者)，SLU, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden.",yuki.yano@ekon.slu.se; dblandford@psu.edu,,,USDA Cooperative State Research [0208576],USDA Cooperative State Research(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"We also acknowledge financial support provided through USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, Hatch project no. 0208576.",,34,15,17,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

We use a Markov-switching vector error-correction model (MSVECM) to model multiple regime shifts in the relationship between wheat and wheat flour prices in Ukraine from June 2000 to November 2004. Unlike common alternative error correction specifications, the MSVECM does not require an explicit transition variable but rather permits changes between regimes to depend on an unobserved state variable. The analysis reveals four regimes whose timing coincides with political and economic events in Ukraine. Strong coincidence between a 'high-uncertainty' regime and discretionary policy interventions suggests that policy responses to fluctuations in Ukrainian harvests may have amplified instability.","[Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Zorya, Sergiy] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Gottingen; The World Bank,"Brümmer, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",bbruemm@gwdg.de,"Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009","Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346",,,,,52,39,45,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

Data for a total of 639 farms operating in the hillsides of El Salvador and Honduras are used to estimate a household-level input-oriented stochastic distance frontier simultaneously with a TE effects model. The main finding of this study is that improvements in TE are financially beneficial to farm households while also contributing to environmental sustainability. The results also reveal a positive association between productivity and output diversification, and a positive relationship between TE and off-farm income, human capital and agricultural extension.","[Solis, Daniel] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Affairs & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Quiroga, Ricardo E.] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Environm & Rural Dev Div, Washington, DC USA",University of Miami; University of Connecticut; Inter-American Development Bank,"Solís, D (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Affairs & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",d.solis@miami.edu,"Solis, Daniel/B-1031-2009","Solis, Daniel/0000-0002-7322-7201",,,,,54,87,97,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The study should indicate if the advantage of a lower price offered by the distant milk producer would be eliminated or preserved by the transport costs. In the study, the cost of various lengths of milk collection routes in Central Europe has been examined. The difference in cost, whether a short or long journey was travelled, was compared to the range of raw milk prices within the chosen territories in Central Europe. The results proved that the milk collection costs in Europe enable rather long journeys, from the producer to the processor, to be made. In three of the four examined regions, the usual collection route of 200 km followed by an additional journey of 400 km enabled the preservation of the milk price advantage gained due to this journey. The feasibility of long collection journeys would reduce the impact of the success of local processors on the economics of the surrounding milk producers and vice-versa and could play an important role in the movement of raw milk in Europe in the ongoing concentration and liberalization process of milk production in the EU.","Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Bosková, I (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 75, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic.",boskova.iveta@uzei.cz,,"Boskova, Iveta/0009-0008-6099-0946",,,,,2,2,2,0,6,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The Slovak Republic can use this system until the end of the year 2010. The amount of the direct payments in 2004 was 53.1% of the EU average.

J,"Huang, KS; Gale, F",,,,"Huang, Kuo S.; Gale, Fred",,,"Food demand in China: income, quality, and nutrient effects",CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Food industry; Income; Quality; Elasticity; Demand; China,,"Purpose - China's remarkable income growth has changed the food landscape in recent years. Chinese consumers are demanding greater food quantity and quality and changing the nutrient content of their diets. Most food demand studies are based on data from earlier time periods before these structural changes had taken hold. The purpose of this paper is to show. how the rapid change in food markets and surprisingly slow growth of food imports warrants a new assessment of food demand in China. Design/methodology/approach - Engel equations measuring elasticities of food quantity and quality purchases with respect to household income are estimated. These estimates are then converted to nutrient elasticities to show how the availability of nutrients varies with income based on the Engel demand relationship. Findings - The income elasticities diminish as income rises. Households in the top tier of the income distribution appear to have reached a saturation point in the consumption of most food items. As income rises, most additional spending is on foods with higher unit values that may reflect better cuts of meat or branded items. The pattern of food purchases for households at different income levels suggests that protein, saturated fat, and cholesterol intake rises with increased income. The change in diets prompted by rising income is most pronounced for low-income households. Originality/value - This paper applies a unique approach to measure income, quality, and nutrient elasticities within the same framework of Engel relationship. The finding has important implications for opening new market opportunities of imported foods and understanding dietary change in China.","[Huang, Kuo S.; Gale, Fred] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Huang, KS (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",khuang@ers.usda.gov,"Gale, Fred Peter/A-2591-2010","Gale, Fred Peter/0000-0001-6759-6759",,,,,11,48,53,2,53,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGRIC ECON REV,China Agric.
