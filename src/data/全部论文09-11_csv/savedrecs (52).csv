In this article the example of the UK's rail industry is used to show how privatisation created a new geography of employment relations. Unions responded to the destruction of national collective bargaining and a new fragmented geography of employment relations through organisational restructuring, which, in different ways, was marked by a continuing commitment to a politics of production in connecting grassroots workers to national leaderships. Engaging with the new labour geography, however, the article argues that a further critical element in renewal has been the unions' ability to rethink their internal geographies and scalar relations to contest change at the level of the workplace.","[Cumbers, Andrew; MacKinnon, Danny] Univ Glasgow, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Shaw, Jon] Univ Plymouth, Ctr Sustainable Transport, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Shaw, Jon] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Glasgow; University of Plymouth; University of Plymouth,"Cumbers, A (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Andrew.Cumbers@ges.gla.ac.uk; Danny.Mackinnon@ges.gla.ac.uk; Jon.Shaw@plymouth.ac.uk,,"MacKinnon, Danny/0000-0003-2901-5081",,,,,21,7,8,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

But highway congestion can also be reduced by reducing the amount of freight traffic. So, given the advances in high-speed rail, the potential exists for developing a national high-speed network for freight distribution. To design such a network considering highway traffic and transit times, we present an uncapacitated network design model with a post-processing step for the capacity constraint. To illustrate how our modeling approach could be used by policy makers to evaluate the impacts of a high-speed rail network, we apply our models with preliminary data on high-speed rail operating parameters for freight applications and from current data on shipments from a major truckload carrier and the US Census Bureau.

The second characterization consists of the axioms of subset consistency, subset anonymity, neutrality, topsonlyness, Pareto optimality, district consistency and district cancellation. The characterizations give us an opportunity to compare the characteristic properties of FPTP systems to the characteristic properties that we found for list systems of proportional representation (list PR systems) in Hout et al.

Denmark and Norway have traditionally been viewed as similar in political, cultural and social aspects. However, labour market regulation in Denmark is more liberal than in Norway. This study therefore serves as a unique comparison of the impact of social origin under varying conditions of labour market regulation. Although the absolute probability of being disadvantaged decreases as individuals progress in age from 20 to 30 and varies between Denmark and Norway, the relative impact of social background is stable and similar. The results offer little support to theories that put a strong emphasis on inter-generational transmission through educational achievements, but rather point toward the importance of ascriptive resources.

The usual approach of correcting for missing data, when the missing data mechanism is ignorable, is inverse probability weighting (IPW). An alternative semiparametric M-estimator which involves local polynomial matching techniques is proposed and its asymptotic distribution is derived. Like IPW, the proposed estimation approach has a double robustness property for the estimation of unconditional means. Monte Carlo evidence suggests slightly better finite sample properties of the semiparametric M-estimator relatively to IPW. A version of the proposed estimator is applied to estimate the impact of noncognitive skills on wages in Germany for two different educational treatment regimes.","Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Flossmann, A (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany.",Anton.Flossmann@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,49,1,1,1,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We investigate the relevance of a hybrid hypothesis whereby REITs have target leverage, but they also choose and time their marginal financing decisions according to the capital market conditions. The empirical results suggest that target leverage behavior plays a secondary role to market timing behavior in the financing decisions of REITs. In particular, we find strong and consistent evidence that REITs exhibit market timing behavior in terms of when and what type of capital to issue or reduce. Such market timing practices, motivated by attempts to take advantage of capital market conditions, may shift the firms away from their target leverage. However, we observe that in the long run, most REITs do move their capital structure towards the target debt level.","[Ooi, Joseph T.

This study examines the relative influence of structure features, tenure, household characteristics and neighborhood factors on ownership turnover rates. The study exploits a Chicago database of just under 50,000 paired sales of attached housing units, with at least one of the sales occurring between 1992 and June of 2002. Within the framework of a Cox proportional hazard model, we focus on a number of factors affecting turnover rates, including whether the housing unit is owner-occupied or rented at the time of sale, price at the time of sale, unit size, age, location in a tax increment financing district, housing density, structure size, year of sale, and neighborhood within Chicago (by Community Area). Finding strong spatial segmentation in turnover (hazard) rates, we further examine the capacity of four sets of Census-derived variables to explain the spatial variation. The household characteristics offer decidedly the strongest power in explaining the segmentation. Results from the hazard model, combined with results from the analysis of spatial variation suggest a household life cycle model of variation in turnover rates.","[Smith, Brent C.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Sch Business, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Archer, Wayne R.; Ling, David C.] Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Smith, BC (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Sch Business, POB 844000, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",wayne.archer@cba.ufl.edu; ling@ufl.edu; bcsmith@vcu.edu,"Smith, Brent/AAJ-5789-2020",,,,,,36,18,23,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The nonparametric tests have a slight size distortion for conditional higher moments, which can be eliminated.

The Failure of Finance as Social Innovation,NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,finance; social; innovation; credit and debt; ownership; household,,"This is an article about the outcomes of the mass marketing of retail financial products in the USA since the early 1980s. Our aim is to change the frame of the debate about the democratisation of finance by evaluating the extension of credit and ownership as a major social innovation led by profit-seeking retail banks. We focus on privately led social innovations of income supplementation through credit and of security through property. Put simply, we ask: to what extent has this social innovation of credit and ownership released wage and salary earners from the tyranny of earned income? To this end we present empirical evidence from the United States, which suggests that the extension of credit and asset ownership in an unequal society is self-defeating because it does not abolish the tyranny of earned income and, indeed, it tightens the vice insofar as low-income individuals and households accumulate debt but not assets. The implication is that finance as privately led social innovation has failed and it is time for fundamental rethinking of much that has been taken for granted.","[Froud, Julie; Johal, Sukhdev; Montgomerie, Johnna; Williams, Karel] Univ Manchester, Ctr Res Sociocultural Change CRESC, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Froud, Julie; Johal, Sukhdev; Montgomerie, Johnna; Williams, Karel] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Montgomerie, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Ctr Res Sociocultural Change CRESC, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",J.Montgomerie@manchester.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H010769/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H010769/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,21,56,59,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Recent research on Russian mixed-member Duma elections argues that governors influenced the election of single-member district deputies. This raises the spectre that governors could have influenced the behaviour of these deputies. Using data from the third post-communist Duma, I demonstrate that single-member district deputies backed by regional leaders in the 1999 Duma election behaved differently from others in two critical areas: parliamentary party choice and support for the presidential legislative agenda.

The decision to seek temporary or permanent refuge in the region of origin or in a more distant asylum destination is based on inter-temporal optimization. We find that asylum seeking in Western countries is rather a phenomenon of comparatively less persecuted people. In an attempt to reduce their respective asylum burdens, Western countries and host countries in the region of origin are likely to end up in a race to the bottom of restrictive asylum policies. Alternatively, this study shows that, under certain circumstances, proactive refugee-related aid transfers are an effective instrument to relieve Western countries from asylum pressure.","Univ Freiburg, Dept Int Econ Policy, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Czaika, M (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Dept Int Econ Policy, Pl Alten Synagoge 1, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",Mathias.Czaika@zee.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,18,6,7,0,7,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

It argues that the boards of IOs are asked by their political masters to play four distinct roles: (1) political counterweight, (2) performance police, (3) democratic forum, and (4) strategic thinker. Because there are trade-offs among them, no IO board can play all four roles effectively. Policymakers must therefore choose among them, and they must make choices of institutional design accordingly. The article also shows how in practice, international organizations fall into three governance models based on the characteristics of their boards of directors. Each model has a different combination of strengths and weaknesses. The analysis suggests that because trade-offs are inescapable, state actors sometimes willingly surrender a measure of control in order to strengthen other aspects of institutional performance. IO autonomy is often not something that surprises or annoys governments, but rather something that was been built into the institutional design as the result of a conscious trade-off.","Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brookings Institution,"Martinez-Diaz, L (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, 1775 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",lmartinez@brookings.edu,,,,,,,35,14,14,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The investigation is conducted within the fixed effects panel regression framework using a balanced panel for ten Canadian provinces spanning the years 1981-2004. The estimated own price elasticities indicate that increased government taxation is an effective tool for curtailing the consumption of spirits (at the expense of lower government tax revenue), but it is less effective for curtailing the consumption of wine or beer. The cross-price elasticity estimates reveal that taxing beer or spirits may not be an effective tool for encouraging consumption switch from these alcoholic beverages to wine in light of wine's greater health benefits. Income emerges as an important determinant of the consumption of both wine and spirits but not of beer, whereas unemployment emerges as an important determinant of the consumption of beer but not of wine or spirits. With respect to unemployment, we find no support for the addiction hypothesis in the case of wine and spirits and strong support for the severe budget constraint hypothesis in the case of beer.","[Cho, Danny I.] Brock Univ, Fac Business, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Ogwang, Tomson] Brock Univ, Dept Econ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",Brock University; Brock University,"Cho, DI (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, Fac Business, 500 Glenridge Ave, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",togwang@brocku.ca; dcho@brocku.ca,,,,,,,34,13,15,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Prior to the crisis, the government preached the gospel of price stability, fiscal prudence and light-touch financial regulation. In the wake of the crisis, the government countenanced unconventional monetary policies, a surge in public-sector borrowing and the need for a rethink of financial supervision. This article seeks to understand the significance of these changes using Peter Hall's theory of policy paradigms. Its central argument is that, contrary to appearances, the UK has not yet experienced a fundamental reordering of the instruments, institutions and aims of economic policy. Third-order change cannot be ruled out as the crisis unfolds but the economic ideas underpinning UK economic policy have, for better or worse, demonstrated remarkable resilience thus far.","[Hodson, Dermot; Mabbett, Deborah] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Sch Polit & Sociol, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Hodson, D (通讯作者)，Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Sch Polit & Sociol, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",d.hodson@bbk.ac.uk; d.mabbett@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,49,69,75,0,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The survey respondents include business firms that either use or do not use videoconferencing currently. Based on survey data analyses, negative binomial models are developed for the set of current adopters of videoconferencing, and a Poisson regression model is developed for the non-adopters. They suggest substitution relationships between business air travel and videoconferencing for the two groups. However, the substitution effect is perceptibly stronger when videoconferencing is used as a substitute for business air travel. The analysis highlights that the meeting context significantly influences the choice of the communication mechanism: meeting contexts that do not specifically require face-to-face interaction tend to foster increased videoconferencing usage. Further, the perceptions of the respondents in terms of the relative benefits and weaknesses of each communication option influence the likelihood of substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The recent rise and sharp decline of subprime lending will likely spur further interest in homeownership gaps. Statistical analysis of these differences or gaps in homeownership between white and minority households has evolved into a highly stylized comparison of differences in homeownership at the mean or the conditional mean. This study implements a quantile decomposition technique that identifies the unexplained portion of the gap not only at the mean, but at every percentile of the homeownership distribution. Results suggest that differences in homeownership gaps at the mean reflect a combination of small differences at the upper end and much larger gaps at the lowest end of the distribution of homeowners. This study also adds credit history to the factors that are used to explain homeownership gaps. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, a non-stationary structural dynamic factor model is fitted to a large dataset of euro area macroeconomic variables. The main results are as follows. Both common factors and idiosyncratic components are important in explaining individual countries' output and price developments in the euro area and are also both very persistent. Idiosyncratic shocks and adjustments to these shocks are mainly responsible for cross-country heterogeneity. The asymmetric transmission of common shocks plays a minor role. Finally, there is no strong evidence that some common shocks lead to greater heterogeneity than others.

Recent research uses high-frequency intraday data to construct ex post measures of daily volatility. This paper uses a Bayesian model-averaging approach to forecast realized volatility. Candidate models include autoregressive and heterogeneous autoregressive specifications based on the logarithm of realized volatility, realized power variation, realized bipower variation, a jump and an asymmetric term. Applied to equity and exchange rate volatility over several forecast horizons, Bayesian model averaging provides very competitive density forecasts and modest improvements in point forecasts compared to benchmark models. We discuss the reasons for this, including the importance of using realized power variation as a predictor. Bayesian model averaging provides further improvements to density forecasts when we move away from linear models and average over specifications that allow for GARCH effects in the innovations to log-volatility.

This option-theoretic mortgage valuation model is based on stochastic house-price and interest-rate models, and requires a particularly subtle technique to incorporate a new type of occupation-time derivative, where the barrier (which activates the derivative) is in the value process and not the underlying process (as it is in standard occupation-time derivatives). This new model simulates a delay in prepayment by the borrower (beyond the time simple ruthless prepayment dictates), thus increasing the value of the mortgage to the lender, compared to the value gained using more basic models. This allows for a more advanced borrower decision process, where a rational exercise structure is retained in a modified form. Empirical evidence supports this theory, which should be beneficial for accurate mortgage-backed security pricing. The results in this paper explore thoroughly the effect on the mortgage value of a delay in prepayment by the borrower on the embedded options held and on the insurance component.","[Sharp, Nicholas J.; Newton, David P.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Johnson, Paul V.; Duck, Peter W.] Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Nottingham; University of Manchester,"Sharp, NJ (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",nicholas.sharp@nottingham.ac.uk; pjohnson@ma.man.ac.uk; david.newton@nottingham.ac.uk; duck@ma.man.ac.uk,"Newton, David/JQI-8116-2023; Johnson, Paul V/R-1321-2016","Johnson, Paul V/0000-0003-2622-7089; Newton, David/0000-0001-6891-5686; Newton, David/0000-0003-0470-8113; Duck, Peter/0000-0002-7915-5982",,,,,41,7,9,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We describe trends and features of adolescent BMI in a nationally representative dataset and document correlations in weight gain among peers. We find strong correlations between own body mass index (BMI) and peers' BMI's. Though the correlations are especially strong in the upper ends of the BMI distribution, the relationship is smooth and holds over almost the entire range of adolescent BMI. Furthermore, the results are robust to the inclusion of school fixed effects and basic controls for other confounding factors such as race, sex, and age. Some recent research in this area considers whether or not adolescent weight gain is caused by peers. We discuss the econometric issues in plausibly estimating such effects while accounting for growth spurts and difficulties in defining adolescent obesity. While our work identifies correlations between adolescent BMI and peers' BMI, it is not intended to and cannot fully address the existence of endogenous peer effects. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Perceptions on changes to the role of life actuaries are explored using interviews with senior actuaries and accountants. The study complements the few existing academic analyses of actuaries and yet challenges these analyses inasmuch as it locates actuarial work within a broader sociological frame. Thus, the article views the actuarial profession not as a simple collection of traits but as a dynamic socio-historical project that reflects and projects professional knowledge claims. The article concludes that the imposed reforms have rescued the actuarial profession from its failure to reform itself, at least in the short term.

Contrary to the CAPM theory, a significant positive relationship is found between idiosyncratic volatility and the cross-sectional returns. This suggests that firm-specific risk matters in REIT pricing.

Two policies available to governments are alignment of domestic technical regulations with international standards and entry into mutual recognition agreements (MRAs). We study the effects of such decisions on the volume of exports to developed markets by firms in developing countries, using data from a World Bank firm-level survey of awareness of global product norms. Both standards alignment and MRAs are associated with more exports to developed countries, but only MRAs significantly promote exports. This finding is consistent with theoretical predictions that MRAs should reduce the fixed costs of exporting more than standards alignment, permitting more firms to enter export markets in higher volumes. Governments in developing countries hoping to encourage exports may wish to favour the negotiation of mutual recognition of testing and certification procedures with major trading partners as a more affirmative avenue to expanding international sales.","[An, Galina] Kenyon Coll, Gambier, OH 43022 USA; [Maskus, Keith E.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University System of Ohio; Kenyon College; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"An, G (通讯作者)，Kenyon Coll, Gambier, OH 43022 USA.",,,,,,,,24,5,6,1,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2009,32.0,4,,,,,552,574,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2008.01150.x,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,421TB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264380100002,0

Using the Olley and Pakes method, we calculate the TFP of Spanish manufacturing firms and study the impact of EU tariffs and the presence of foreign products and imports on TFP at the firm level. Applying the System-GMM method, we find that TFP is negatively impacted by European tariffs, whereas competition in the form of the increased presence of foreign products in the domestic market and firm imports leads to improvements in the TFP. Moreover, these two effects are complementary. We also find evidence of important asymmetries among firms depending on their involvement in foreign markets.","[Dovis, Marion] Univ Aix Marseille 2, DEFI, Marseille, France; [Milgram-Baleix, Juliette] Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain",Aix-Marseille Universite; University of Granada,"Dovis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aix Marseille 2, DEFI, Marseille, France.",,"Milgram-Baleix, JULIETTE/H-5986-2015","Milgram-Baleix, JULIETTE/0000-0002-4793-9977",,,,,56,16,17,0,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2009,32.0,4,,,,,575,605,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01169.x,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,421TB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264380100003,0

Its royally granted privileges have often been blamed for the stagnant Spanish agricultural productivity during the early modern period. I argue that the Mesta's privileges allowed Medieval Castile to develop its comparative advantage in wool, and that the Crown was able to restrict their scope and application when economic conditions favored arable farming interests.

Fertility started to decline around 1880 when marital fertility began a continuous decline. A gradual diffusion of parity-specific control was important in this process. The fertility of the oldest age groups declined fastest, even though the decline started in all age groups over 25 at about the same time. This development was connected to broader socioeconomic and demographic processes of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as mortality decline, urbanisation, industrialisation and expansion of education.","[Dribe, Martin] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Dribe, Martin] Lund Univ, Ctr Econ Demog, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Dribe, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, POB 7083, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",Martin.Dribe@ekh.lu.se,,,,,,,72,37,38,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

It shows that already in the late medieval period the skill premium in western Europe had fallen sharply and became, from the fifteenth century onwards, much lower than in most other parts of the world economy. Only in southern China, and perhaps also in nineteenth-century Japan, did the skill premium fall to an equally low level. The explanation for these global patterns focuses on factor proportions, the quality of institutions and demand-related factors. Moreover, it is argued that the skill premium measured in this way is also a predictor of long-term economic performance.","Univ Utrecht, Int Inst Social Hist, NL-1019 AT Amsterdam, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; International Institute of Social History (IISH-KNAW); Utrecht University,"Van Zanden, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Int Inst Social Hist, Cruquiusweg 31, NL-1019 AT Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jvz@iisg.nl,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0922531] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,84,72,73,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Despite the implicit suggestion that jobs in the middle appear to be disappearing, somewhat paradoxically, there are ever-increasing reports of problems with recruitment and skill across intermediate occupations. This article attempts to address the paradox and propose better ways of conceptualizing what is happening to intermediate occupations within recent structural transformations. It is argued that while the hourglass economy thesis, or a variation of it, best describes recent occupational transformations, it is limited conceptually and empirically. More specifically, it neglects important dimensions of change within intermediate occupations - dimensions that may well provide a more fruitful foundation from which to explore the nature of and developments within these jobs and their broader repercussions.","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G1 1XU, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Anderson, P (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Graham Hills Bldg,50 Richmond St, Glasgow G1 1XU, Lanark, Scotland.",pfandersen2000@yahoo.co.uk,"Anderson, Pauline/J-5473-2017","Anderson, Pauline/0000-0001-8736-1463",,,,,31,21,22,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In order to achieve this goal, we utilized a specific data set which was done by the ministry of Civil Affairs in 2005 in 28 provinces in China and interviewed 3564 villagers. First, we studied the current situation of the participation of the villagers in the village governance. Second, we used the logit model to explore the determinants of the participation of the villagers based on the characteristics of the village, the characteristics of the household and that of the individual. Finally conclusions were drawn and policy implications were imposed.",,,,xinxchen@sohu.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-074-2,,,,2009,,,,,,,428,432,,,,,,5,Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BQC55,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280692900097,0

Using data on how 22 donors allocated their bilateral aid among 147 countries over 1970-2004, the article finds that after the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and especially in the late 1990s, bilateral aid responded more to poverty and the quality of the policy and institutional environment in the recipient countries. Furthermore, the sensitivity of aid allocation to the country's size and its debt burden has declined over time. These results are robust to different samples and model specifications, various econometric techniques, and alternative measures of institutional quality. While the specific factors causing these changes cannot be identified-these presumably include geopolitical and economic concerns and the many changes in the international aid architecture-donors still differ greatly in their selectivity. This suggests that further, multifaceted reforms are needed to ensure even greater selectivity of aid.","[Claessens, Stijn] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Claessens, Stijn] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Cassimon, Danny; Van Campenhout, Bjorn] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Antwerp, Belgium",International Monetary Fund; University of Amsterdam; University of Antwerp,"Claessens, S (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",sclaessens@imf.org; danny.cassimon@ua.ac.be; bjorn.vancampenhout@ua.ac.be,"cassimon, danny/F-4370-2010; Cassimon, Danny/AAU-4515-2021","Cassimon, Danny/0000-0002-0460-3488; Van Campenhout, Bjorn/0000-0003-2404-7826",,,,,37,83,89,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. It is important for an analyst being aware of these advantages and disadvantages and combine methods by taking into account their limits. In my view, from four groups of method, the usefulness of survivor analysis may be questioned. The method is based on strong economic assumptions about the power of market and is not universal regarding type of efficiency analysis. It should be noted that efficiency or inefficiency in the health care sector does not depend only on managerial abilities of health care managers, but also on regulation environment and payment systems.","[Dlouhy, Martin] Univ Econ Prague, Sch Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,dlouhy@vse.cz,"Dlouhy, Martin/I-3913-2018",,,,,,22,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,57,62,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900010,0

However, there are mechanisms that may raise rather than lower the oil rent. If a carbon price is implemented universally, the cost of using oil substitutes such as unconventional oil or synthetic diesel from coal or natural gas will increase even more than the cost of using conventional oil. Here, a dynamic model that takes into account OPEC's dominant position in the world's liquid fuel market is developed in order to analyze these mechanisms. In this model, OPEC is assumed to act as strategic leader while all other liquid fuel producers act as price-takers. We find that the net present value of OPECs conventional oil rent increases by about 5% due to the carbon prices needed to reach stringent CO 2 emission targets. For less ambitious targets, the increase in oil rent could be even higher. An extensive sensitivity analysis is also performed, which corroborates the main result.","[Johansson, Daniel J.

This led them to conclusions about individual evaluations of non market, public goods via the observed attitude to their interconnection with those individual goods.

In the next phase of the research a municipality was determined as a basic unit for investigation. The obtained data about all 6,240 municipalities were analyzed by factor analysis. As a result eight factors which have a significant influence on disparities of the municipalities were recognized. These factors are: unemployment, domicile attractiveness, population density and allocation. age structure, civil amenities, economic structure, sustainable development and economic activity, in the phase of the research all mayors of municipalities in the Czech Republic were contacted through a questionnaire. The aim was to evaluate the degree of relationship between the results of statistical data analysis and mayors' opinions on economic situation in their municipalities. Therefore eight chi-square tests of independence for the above eight factors were done. The tests inform whether there is a relationship between the new methodology of research of municipalities' development dynamics and mayors' opinions on economic strength or weakness of their municipality.

In its core ties the fact that if the agents constituting the SC choose their output prices according to the golden rule of profit maximization (that normally applies to a single firm that produces independently and sells directly to the end consumer), the prices in the SC tend to spiral up to an inefficient (equilibrium) level where both the consumer surplus and the SC's total profit are diminished. The aim of our research is to quantify this effect. In our previous papers, we analyzed the properties of SC's operating with linear cost and demand functions the simple linear form enabled us to derive some explicit formulas that yield the discussed results. In a non-linear setting, meaningful general formulas can no longer be obtained. Therefore, we developed numeric algorithms to find equilibrium prices in SC's with non-linear demand and cost functions. and the analysis is carried Out through numeric experiments with these algorithms. The aim is to establish to what extent the results from the linear model hold in a non-linear environment, and what the effect of the cost and demand functions' convexity/concavity is.","[Zouhar, Jan] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,zouharj@vse.cz,"Zouhar, Jan/E-9659-2013","Zouhar, Jan/0000-0002-1164-7948",,,,,9,1,1,0,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,359,365,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900065,0

We find that sophisticated and more experienced investors are at least as loss averse as their counterparts and that loss aversion operated most strongly during the cycle peak in 2007. We also document a possible anchoring effect of the asking price in influencing buyer valuation and subsequent transaction price. We demonstrate the importance of behavioral phenomena in constructing hedonic price indices, and we find that the impact of loss aversion is attenuated at the aggregate market level. This suggests that the pricing and volume cycle during 2001-2009 was little affected by loss aversion.","[Bokhari, Sheharyar; Geltner, David] MIT Ctr Real Estate, Commercial Real Estate Data Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,"Bokhari, S (通讯作者)，MIT Ctr Real Estate, Commercial Real Estate Data Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",schery@gmail.com; dgeltner@mit.edu,"Deitsch, Haysha/C-2019-2017","Deitsch, Haysha/0000-0002-0215-4340",,,,,21,85,97,0,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2011,39.0,4,,,,,635,670,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2011.00308.x,0.0,,,36,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,854MT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297499500002,0

The exchange, primarily a forward market, instituted a mutual guarantee fund to prevent broker failures from snowballing into a liquidity crisis. The fund then forced the Bourse to search for mechanisms to control moral hazard. With new archival data, we describe the evolving regulatory regime and analyze the determinants of broker failures. The Bourse faced a conundrum; when it finally imposed a tight regulatory regime that limited risk, trading began to migrate off the exchange to less regulated markets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The existing literature on the sensitivity of gasoline consumption to changes in price may not be appropriate for evaluating the effectiveness of such a tax. First, most of these studies fail to address the endogeneity of gasoline prices. Second, the responsiveness of gasoline consumption to a change in tax may differ from the responsiveness of consumption to an average change in price. We address these challenges using a variety of methods including traditional single-equation regression models, estimated by least squares or instrumental variables methods, and structural vector autoregressions. Our preferred approach exploits the historical variation in US federal and state gasoline taxes. Our most credible estimates imply that a 10-cent per gallon increase in the gasoline tax would reduce carbon emissions from vehicles in the United States by about 1.5%.

When the investors' protection is perfect, the model reduces to the standard one sector growth model proposed by Reichlin (JET 40:89-102, 1986), while the model reduces to the one studied by Matsuyama (Econometrica 72:853-884, 2004) when the agents' labor supply is exogenous. Our goal is to highlight that the local analysis of the perfect foresight equilibrium may lead to misleading conclusions because the local analysis neglects the occurrence of different global bifurcation scenarios. In particular, the existence of a heteroclinic connection or the occurrence of a homoclinic bifurcation may be associated with global indeterminacy even when all steady states are locally determinate.","[Agliari, Anna] Catholic Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, I-29100 Piacenza, Italy; [Vachadze, George] CUNY Coll Staten Isl, Dept Econ, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USA; [Vachadze, George] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USA",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; City University of New York (CUNY) System; College of Staten Island (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Agliari, A (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, I-29100 Piacenza, Italy.",anna.agliari@unicatt.it; george.vachadze@csi.cuny.edu,"Agliari, Anna/B-7089-2012; Agliari, Anna/Q-6612-2019; Vachadze, George/O-2680-2014","Agliari, Anna/0000-0002-5230-9304; Agliari, Anna/0000-0002-5230-9304; Vachadze, George/0000-0002-1779-9301",City University of New York [60030-4041],City University of New York,"We are grateful to two anonymous referees for their constructive and valuable comments on our manuscript.

Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds estimation procedure, we find a fairly robust long-run relationship between private saving and its determinants in both countries. Consistent with the predictions made in the life cycle model, our results indicate that higher income growth stimulates private saving and an increase in age dependency retards private saving. The results provide some support for the hypothesis that financial liberalization results in lower private saving in both countries. The evidence also indicates that expected pension benefits tend to stimulate private saving in India, but that the reverse is found in Malaysia.","[Ang, James B.] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Sen, Kunal] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, IDPM, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Sen, Kunal] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Brooks World Poverty Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England",Monash University; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Ang, JB (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, 900 Dandenong Rd, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",james.ang@buseco.monash.edu.au; kunal.sen@manchester.ac.uk,"Ang, James B/N-4115-2013","ren, xiao peng/0000-0002-6032-8249; Ang, James/0000-0001-9497-0187",,,,,43,3,8,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

To this end, Canadian Business data on the wealthiest 100 Canadians for the years 1999-2008 are used. The resulting estimates of the PPL exponent ranged from approximately 1.0 to 1.3 depending on the year of analysis and the estimation method used. These estimates are roughly comparable to those based on Forbes' list of the wealthiest 400 Americans. Furthermore, whereas modified OLS and maximum likelihood estimates of the power law exponents conform to Zipf's law, the OLS estimates do not. These results raise some concerns about deducing the magnitudes of and trends in the power law exponents based on a single estimation method and highlight the importance of extensive hypothesis testing for model adequacy.

Adopting an aggressive growth-by-acquisition strategy, the newly listed REITs acquired a number of properties within a short time period. Despite their regular activities, we observe the acquisition announcements are associated with a significantly positive abnormal increase in shareholder wealth averaging 0.38% in a 5-day window around the event date. Controlling for the method of payment, buyer's acquisition strategy and seller's relationship with the acquiring REIT, the regression results show that the likely sources of economic gains associated with acquisitions are economies of scale and better management by acquiring firms. We also find strong evidence that the market reacts less favorably to acquisitions involving a portfolio of properties as opposed to a single property and weaker evidence that it reacts less favorably to mixed-use acquisitions. These findings suggest the presence of premiums on transparency and corporate focus.","[Ooi, Joseph T.

We examine the influence of managerial incentives, traditional managerial monitoring mechanisms and managerial entrenchment on the capital structure of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Using panel data, we estimate a system of simultaneous equations for leverage and maturity and find that firms with entrenched CEOs use less leverage and shorter maturity debt. This is consistent with the expectation that managers acting in their own self interest will choose lower leverage to reduce liquidity risk and use short maturity debt to preserve their ability to enhance their compensation and reputations by empire building. We also find evidence that traditional alignment mechanisms such as equity and option ownership have an offsetting effect; and that firms where the founder serves as CEO choose higher leverage and longer maturity debt. The results also provide evidence that leverage and maturity are substitutes, firms with high profitability and growth opportunities use less leverage and firms with liquid assets use more leverage and longer maturity debt.","[Ghosh, Chinmoy; Harding, John P.] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Giambona, Erasmo] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sirmans, C.

Second, conditional on being a target, we determine which target characteristics influence the probability of the bidder being a private versus a public firm. Third, we document the magnitude of the wealth effects that accrue to the shareholders of target REITs in both privatizations and public-to-public transactions and how these effects vary with the characteristics of the target firms. Finally, we investigate the extent to which privatizations differ from staying public acquisitions in the type of financing employed and the motivation of the two investor types. We find that REITs more likely to become acquisition targets are smaller and less liquid with higher dividend yields than non-targets. The existence of an umbrella partnership (UPREIT) structure reduces the probability of becoming a target. Private acquirers are more likely to bid on underleveraged REITs with poor operating performance. Conversely, public buyers are more focused on acquiring highly levered REITs with greater institutional ownership and superior operating results. The determinants of abnormal returns also differ in privatizations and public-to-public deals.","[Ling, David C.] Univ Florida, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Hough Grad Sch Business Adm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Petrova, Milena] Syracuse Univ, Dept Finance, Whitman Sch Management, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Syracuse University,"Ling, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Hough Grad Sch Business Adm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",ling@ufl.edu; mpetrova@syr.edu,"Petrova, Milena/AAX-5309-2021","Petrova, Milena Tacheva/0000-0001-5564-9999",,,,,42,20,25,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

By contrasting these developments with the earlier integration of US markets - where a rough constitutional symmetry can be said to exist - the article concludes that constitutional symmetry, in itself, is probably insufficient to protect the sort of corporatist arrangements that undergird northern European social models.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Moses, JW (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",jonathon.moses@svt.ntnu.no,,,,,,,34,9,9,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

It was found that 90% of these farmers have tendency to use the futures market. The remaining 10% were deterred by worries such as their belief that the risk in the futures market was very high, their lack of knowledge on how the commodity futures exchange works, the fact that trade in futures on the commodity futures exchange was not viewed as real transactions, or their fear of not being able to fulfil the annual contracts for cotton which they had with the cooperatives they belonged to.","Ege Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, Bornova, Turkey",Ege University,"Adanacioglu, H (通讯作者)，Ege Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, Bornova, Turkey.",,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,6,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2011,10.0,2,,,,,58,64,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,793WJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292854300008,0

This article draws on research into the experiences of managers in a local government organization revealing an intricate, multifaceted and heterogeneous picture of fragmentation, conflicting demands, pressures and anxieties. The study highlights the importance of paid work for public sector managers; the concomitant difficulties in controlling working hours for those in managerial roles and the extent to which shifts in work orientation occur during managers' careers. Research findings suggest that in practice work-life balance initiatives may only serve to increase managerial anxieties and pressures, the very opposite outcome to that intended. These themes do not feature in many work-life balance debates, which tend to assume the perfect manager who is able and willing to create a symmetrical balance between different spheres of life.","[Ford, Jackie] Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Bradford BD9 4JL, W Yorkshire, England; [Collinson, David] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",University of Bradford; Lancaster University,"Ford, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Emm Lane, Bradford BD9 4JL, W Yorkshire, England.",j.m.ford@bradford.ac.uk,,"Collinson, David/0000-0002-0884-9960",,,,,48,83,96,2,59,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Walkability is the degree to which an area within walking distance of a property encourages walking for recreational or functional purposes. We use data from the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries and Walk Score to examine the effects of walkability on the market value and investment returns of more than 4,200 office, apartment, retail and industrial properties from 2001 to 2008 in the United States. We found that, all else being equal, the benefits of greater walkability were capitalized into higher office, retail and apartment values. We found no effect on industrial properties. On a 100-point scale, a 10-point increase in walkability increased values by 1-9%, depending on property type. We also found that walkability was associated with lower cap rates and higher incomes, suggesting it has been favored in both the capital asset and building space markets. Walkability had no significant effect on historical total investment returns. All walkable property types have the potential to generate returns as good as or better than less walkable properties, as long as they are priced correctly. Developers should be willing to develop more walkable properties as long as any additional cost for more walkable locations and related development expenses do not exhaust the walkability premium.","[Pivo, Gary] Univ Arizona, Urban Planning Program, Tucson, AZ 85718 USA; [Pivo, Gary] Univ Arizona, Responsible Property Investment Ctr, Tucson, AZ 85718 USA; [Fisher, Jeffrey D.] Indiana Univ, Kelly Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Fisher, Jeffrey D.] Indiana Univ, Benecki Ctr Real Estate Studies, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Pivo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Urban Planning Program, Tucson, AZ 85718 USA.",gpivo@u.arizona.edu; fisher@indiana.edu,,,,,,,81,161,194,2,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2011,39.0,2,,,,,185,219,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00296.x,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,768TV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290962200001,0

The analysis uses a bidirectional growth model to examine equilibrium densities of people and jobs throughout the Atlantic Southeast, which includes Florida-a state having one of the nation's best-known pieces of growth management legislation. The results suggest that Florida's policy is associated with changes in population density. The Florida program is associated with a lower equilibrium population density and slower adjustment to that equilibrium density in urban counties, but a higher equilibrium population density and a faster adjustment to equilibrium in suburban counties. On net, this is consistent with a shift of development from urban to suburban counties. Our results also highlight the importance of geographic scale, as we note that analyses using counties and metropolitan statistical areas give different results which can be reconciled by examining the patterns across urban, suburban and exurban counties.

The sector has a large foreign presence, with MNCs attracted by the open trade and investment regime, and FDI-friendly policies. Using unpublished manufacturing census data for 2000 and 2005, we apply the methodology by Foster et al. (1998) to decompose productivity growth. The analysis shows that exporters were more productive than domestic-oriented establishments, and were distinctly more competitive. The empirical evidence also shows that establishment turnover is important in boosting productivity growth. In particular, we find that turnover of exporters made a larger contribution to aggregate productivity growth compared with domestic-oriented establishments during the period from 2000 to 2005. Surviving establishments (those that operated in both years), on the other hand, made a negative contribution. It is noteworthy that entrants to export markets were more productive than surviving non-exporters and even surviving exporters. Exiters from export markets or 'export failures', on the other hand, were less productive than continuing exporters. Given the importance of turnover to productivity growth, the government should ensure unrestricted entry to the export sectors for both foreign and domestic investors. Continuing with pro-FDI policies is also important, given the keener global competition.","[Dogan, Ergun] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Wong, Koi Nyen] Sunway Univ, Sch Business, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia; [Yap, Michael M.

In this paper, we illustrate how to detect the existence of a bifurcation in stylized macroeconomic models with Calvo (J Monet Econ 12(3):383-398, 1983) pricing. Following the general approach of Judd (Numerical methods in economics, 1998), we employ l'Hospital's rule to characterize the first-order dynamics of relative price distortion in terms of its higher-order derivatives. We also show that, as in the usual practice in the literature, the bifurcation can be eliminated through renormalization of model variables.

Derivation of the error structures is based on cost-minimizing behavior on the firms. The primal systems constitute the production function and the first-order conditions of cost minimization. We consider two dual-cost systems. The first dual system is based on the cost function and cost share equations. The second dual system is based on a multiplicative general error production model that is an alternative to McElroy's additive general error production model. Our multiplicative general error model gives a clear and intuitive economic meaning to the error components. The resulting cost system is easy to estimate compared to the alternative cost systems. The error components in the multiplicative general error model can capture heterogeneity in the technology parameters even in a cross-sectional model. Panel data are not necessary to estimate either the primal or dual systems. The models are estimated using data on 72 fossil fuel-fired steam electric power generation plants (observed for the period 1986-1999) in the USA. Copyright.

Conventional wisdom contends these shifts largely resulted from government policy, particularly increases in trade barriers. We contend that the connection between tariffs and increased profitability is conceptually weak and not supported by extant evidence. We argue that exogenous shifts in consumer preferences, the adoption of new technologies, changing factor proportions, and greater specialisation in manufacturing and services were responsible for manufacturing increasing its share of the economy's resources and output.","[Merrett, David] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Wollongong,"Merrett, D (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,,"Merrett, David/0000-0003-0904-0474; Ville, Simon/0000-0001-8314-6002",,,,,107,14,14,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

J,"Zhang, JF",,,,"Zhang, Junfu",,,Interjurisdictional competition for FDI: The case of China's development zone fever,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Interjurisdictional competition; Development zone; All-pay auction,TAX COMPETITION,"In the attempt to compete for foreign investment, local jurisdictions in China set up a large number of development zones for industrial and commercial uses. Many of these areas never received any investment and sat idle for years as undeveloped sites. In several periods of time, development zones mushroomed at such a rampant pace that the central government had to intervene in order to prevent the rapid reduction of agricultural land. In this paper, we propose a model to account for the development zone fever experienced in China. We consider local jurisdictions as participants in an all-pay auction competing for investment projects. An investment always goes to a jurisdiction with the highest-quality infrastructure in its development zone. A jurisdiction has to pay the cost of infrastructure in advance, which is irrecoverable whether it wins the investment or not. In equilibrium, many jurisdictions set up economic development zones and spend on infrastructure, although some of these sites will not receive any investment. Potential effects of several policies are examined. The model suggests that to reduce land use by development zones, the central government could either claim a larger share of the tax revenue generated by foreign investments or raise the tax on the land used for development zones. Other policies, such as putting a budget constraint on infrastructure spending or restricting some jurisdictions from competing, are either ineffective or have some undesirable effects.

This paper proposes a new method based on path choice,3 taking into account both the operator's service supply and the customers' subjective perceptions to assess transfer cost and to identify ways to reduce it. This method evaluates different transfer components (e.g., transfer walking, waiting, and penalty) with distinct policy solutions and differentiates between transfer stations and movements. The method is applied to one of the largest and most complex public transport systems in the world, the London Underground (LUL), with a focus on 17 major transfer stations and 303 transfer movements. This study confirms that transfers pose a significant cost to LUL, and that cost is distributed unevenly across stations and across platforms at a station. Transfer stations are perceived very differently by passengers in terms of their overall cost and composition. The case study suggests that a better understanding of transfer behavior and improvements to the transfer experience could significantly benefit public transport systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To do so, the differential effects of local and regional unemployment on the likelihood that individual women and men are unemployed and differences in the underlying patterns of unemployment by gender are explored. Using a unique tabulation of micro data for labor market areas, two series of multilevel models for women and men are fit. The multilevel model results suggest that regional variation in unemployment is more evident for men than for women and, contrary to the empirical evidence, the underlying pattern of unemployment for men is more clustered than for women. The article concludes by discussing the policy implications of the finding that most of the variation in labor market outcomes for both women and men is attributable to individual-level rather than labor market area-level characteristics.","George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Zolnik, EJ (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",ezolnik@gmu.edu,,,,,,,42,7,9,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The common view is that they characterize, in a temporal order, the three phases that a typical advanced economy passes through in its development process. Recently it has been argued, however, that an innovation-education sequence could agree better than an education-innovation transition with the empirical fact that the rise in formal education to the masses follows rather than precedes the process of industrialization. Accordingly, this paper devises an endogenous growth model with physical capital, human capital and R&D that, unlike previous related work, is able to generate adjustment dynamics in which the innovative stage precedes knowledge formation, consistent with empirical evidence.","Univ A Coruna, La Coruna, Spain",Universidade da Coruna,"Gómez, MA (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, La Coruna, Spain.",mago@udc.es,"Gomez, Manuel/L-1915-2014","Gomez, Manuel/0000-0001-9685-7559",,,,,25,8,8,0,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The 1991 Helsinki Disciplines restricted the use of tied aid as a tool of export promotion. In export subsidy competition, donor states have a collective interest in avoiding spiraling escalation of spending; but, reaching international agreements is difficult when preferences over levels of expenditure vary between them. States that favor greater restraint on export subsidies can make subsidy competition prohibitively expensive by increasing their expenditures. However, this requires them to threaten substantial increases in spending when they have a demonstrated preference against doing so. Successful cooperation can only occur when governments with sufficient budgetary resources prefer subsidy reduction, but can mobilize domestic constituencies to make subsidy retaliation credible. Despite an apparent decline in international influence, the U. S. was able to compel accession to the Helsinki agreement by threatening substantial increases in its spending. This article uses a process-tracing approach to demonstrate the role of domestic politics in making that threat credible.","Ball State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Muncie, IN 47306 USA",Ball State University,"Hall, S (通讯作者)，Ball State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Muncie, IN 47306 USA.",,,,,,,,43,15,15,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Intact and longitudinally dissected shoot tips of in vitro cultures were exposed to 11 doses of 60Co gamma (ranging from 0-100 Gy) at a dose rate of 8 Gy/min. The M1V4 generation plants were evaluated for agronomic traits and screened for response to M. fijiensis in the greenhouse. Irradiation induced a range of morphological and agronomic variations. The infection and development phases of the disease were significantly longer for the mutagen-treated plants, suggesting higher resistance to M. fijiensis. Based on their superior performance and response to M. fijiensis, two gamma-irradiated (NYRTC35A, KAMPTC35B) and two nonirradiated (NYRTC5, KAMPTC4) lines of 'Nyoro' and 'Kampala,' respectively, were evaluated in the field. Forty-five percent of the resistant 'Nyoro' plants were late flowering, small in stature (< 1 m), with thick pseudostems (40-45 cm in circumference), short internodes and deformed leaves. They also produced smaller bunches with a 25-75% reduction in number and size of fingers. Among the mutagen-treated 'Kampala' plants, 5% were significantly taller than the control plants, with long internodes and large fruit. Over two production cycles, the nonirradiated control plants were generally more susceptible to BLSD but had superior agronomic traits. The results are discussed with respect to the application of in vitro mutation induction for banana improvement.","[Mwangi, M.] Jomo Kenyatta Univ, Dept Biochem & Biotechnol, Nairobi, Kenya",Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology,"Mwangi, M (通讯作者)，Jomo Kenyatta Univ, Dept Biochem & Biotechnol, POB 43844-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,427,437,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2011.897.59,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200059,0

It aimed at defining and delineating the subject matter of economics. Yet, in spite of Keynes's revolutionary sentiments, there is no reference to the Essay in the GT. Given that much of the Essay has been adopted by most modern economists, examining the GT in terms of Robbins's conception may provide an interesting perspective on Keynes's contribution. We find that there are difficulties in the ethical neutrality of Keynes's agenda; in his approach to postulates as well as in the way he treats equilibrium. But by examining these three aspects we find it difficult to uphold the view of Keynes as a revolutionary. Instead, we find a considerable amount of methodological confusion which may explain the diverse interpretations emanating from his work. We also find that some of these confusions could have been resolved had Keynes taken a better look at the real classical school. We find that while many of Keynes's concerns exited before him at least in Marshall and Mill whom he tends to refer to repeatedly, he did ignore the way in which real classical economics (i.e. Mill and Smith) treated them. We will show that Keynes was referring to two different types of equilibria in classical analysis: a good one and a bad one. This led both Mill and Smith to emphasise the endogenous role of government. Keynes's novelty was that his misconception emphasised the exogenous role of government. In this way, Keynes did a disservice to those who have always doubted the ability of markets to regulate themselves.","[Witztum, Amos] London Metropolitan Univ, LMBS, Econ Grp, London EC2M 6SQ, England",London Metropolitan University,,a.witztum@londonmet.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-14408-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,103,130,,10.1007/978-3-642-14409-7_6,0.0,,,28,Economics; History Of Social Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BVA34,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290894000010,0

J,"Young, AR",,,,"Young, Alasdair R.",,,Of executive preferences and societal constraints: The domestic politics of the transatlantic GMO dispute,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNITED-STATES; TRADE; RESOLUTION,"When the transatlantic trade dispute over genetically modified organisms came to a boil in the late 1990s and early 2000s it was widely expected to be highly conflictual. The United States was, almost universally, expected to challenge fundamentally the European Union's regulatory system for GMOs before the World Trade Organisation, and was equally universally expected to win the case. The EU was widely, albeit not universally, expected to refuse to comply with the ruling. In keeping with most of the international political economy literature on trade disputes, both of these expectations were rooted in assessments of societal demands for action and resistance. Both expectations, however, were confounded; the US (and its co-complainants) filed a narrow challenge focusing on the EU's failure to apply its own procedures; and the EU, somewhat falteringly, has resumed approvals of GMOs. Applying a two-level game framework, this article argues that this relatively cooperative outcome is explained by the executives of both polities exercising their autonomy to pursue policies closer to the preferences of the other polity than their median domestic constituents would have preferred. This article, therefore, makes the case for taking government preferences and autonomy seriously when analysing the outcomes of trade disputes. Moreover, it emphasises that compliance with international rules engages with on-going internal policy processes and debates.","Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Young, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,ESRC [ES/G003548/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G003548/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,80,15,17,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The empirical results based on Mincerian regressions of individual re-employment earnings on industry-level offshoring proxies, show that the effects of offshoring on post-displacement wages are negative, although not economically large. The preferred specifications suggest, in fact, that a one percentage point increase in offshoring in the pre-displacement industry reduces earnings on the new job by approximately 0.3-0.6 per cent. These figures imply that the cumulative rise in offshoring over the sample period may have led to a drop of between US$110 and US$330 in the yearly re-employment wages of US displaced workers. While the magnitude of the effect is largely independent of individual characteristics such as gender, age, occupation and educational level, it does depend on the duration of non-employment and on workers' industrial reallocation after displacement. In particular, the effects are relatively stronger for individuals who stay longer before finding a new job, as well as for those who leave the pre-displacement industry after the job loss.","CSIC, Inst Anal Econ, Madrid, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Crinò, R (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Anal Econ, Madrid, Spain.",,,"Crino, Rosario/0000-0002-8562-1679",,,,,92,10,11,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2010,33.0,12,,,,,1836,1869,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01278.x,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,700SN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285764700008,0

We review the literature to identify open issues. We then develop a simple extension of the gravity model that gives rise to an extensive country margin of trade separating positive trade from zero trade country pairs. The model is used to identify WTO membership effects at both the intensive and the extensive margins. Empirical estimation of this model, based on Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood methods with exporter and importer fixed effects, allows us to readdress the empirical issue of whether GATT/WTO membership does or does not promote trade. We find that GATT membership was successful on the extensive margin of world trade but not on the intensive margin. For the recent WTO episode (1995-2008), we find consistent and robust evidence for a substantial trade-creating role of membership which is driven primarily by the intensive margin. WTO membership results in higher bilateral trade of about 40 per cent.","[Felbermayr, Gabriel] Univ Hohenheim, D-7000 Stuttgart, Germany; [Kohler, Wilhelm] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany",University Hohenheim; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Felbermayr, G (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, D-7000 Stuttgart, Germany.",,,"Felbermayr, Gabriel/0000-0003-4984-9745",,,,,29,33,35,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2010,33.0,11,,,,,1430,1469,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01292.x,0.0,,,40,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,685GB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284616100004,0

In the cross-section, multiproduct firms in India look remarkably similar to their U.S. counterparts. The time-series patterns, however, exhibit important differences. In contrast to evidence from the United States, product churning, particularly product rationalization, is far less common in India. We find no link between product rationalization and output tariff declines following India's 1991 trade liberalization. The lack of creative destruction is consistent with the role of industrial regulation in preventing an efficient allocation of resources.","[Goldberg, Pinelopi K.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Goldberg, Pinelopi K.; Khandelwal, Amit K.; Pavcnik, Nina] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Khandelwal, Amit K.] Columbia Business Sch, Manhatta, NY USA; [Pavcnik, Nina] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University; Dartmouth College,"Goldberg, PK (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,25,137,186,1,25,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Strategies for reducing POV use include shifting trips to other modes, particularly public transit. Choices to use transit are based on characteristics of travelers, their trips, and the quality of competing transportation services. Here we focus on the proximity of rail stations to trip origins/destinations as a factor affecting mode choice for work trips. Using household travel survey data from Chicago, we evaluate the profile of journey-to-work (JTW) trips, assessing mode share and potential for more travelers to use rail. For work trips having the origin/destination as close as 1 mile from rail transit stations. POVs were still the dominant travel mode, capturing as much as 61%, followed by rail use at 14%. This high degree of POV use coupled with the proportion of JTW trips within close proximity to rail stations indicated that at least some of these trips may be candidates for shifting from POV to rail. For example, shifting all work trips with both the origin/destination within 1 mile of commuter rail stations would potentially reduce the energy associated with all work-related POV driving trips by a maximum of 24%. Based on the analysis of trips having the origin and destination closest to train stations, a complete shift in mode from POV to train could exceed CO2 reduction goals targeted in the Chicago Climate Action Plan. This could occur with current settlement patterns and the use of existing infrastructure. However, changes in traveler behavior and possibly rail operation would be necessary, making policy to motivate this change essential. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This development counteracts the assumptions of realist and intergovernmental theories, raising the question of what concepts are appropriate for understanding security and defence policy in the EU. It has been argued that governance approaches are particularly well-suited to describe the functioning of the EU. Yet analyses of the EU's common security and defence policy (CSDP) have to date not been granted the benefits of this insight. This article seeks to remedy this by venturing down the yet unfulfilled EU trail of a burgeoning literature on security governance. Exploring five features of security governance, the article identifies the most promising questions and approaches of the so-called governance turn in IR theory, ending up with a putative EU security governance research agenda that will lead to a deeper understanding of the kind of security actor that the EU has evolved into.","[Norheim-Martinsen, Per M.] Norwegian Def Res Estab, Trondheim, Norway",,"Norheim-Martinsen, PM (通讯作者)，Norwegian Def Res Estab FFI, POB 25, NO-2027 Kjeller, Norway.",per-martin.norheim-martinsen@ffi.no,,,,,,,59,23,25,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

But how do these properties emerge from these financial markets? What are the dynamical causes for these nonlinear properties? Are they the results of random perturbations, or of the intrinsic characteristics of the markets? To answer these questions, first of all, I proposed a minimally structured agent-based model of a dealer market, and then conducted many experiments under several scenarios. This artificial financial market is occupied with heterogeneous agents characterized with bounded rationality and heterogeneity, and a dealer who is responsible for market liquidity and supply-demand balance. By means of simulations based on different scenarios, trading time series (prices, volumes, volatilities, etc) are generated and then are analyzed by Multi-Fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA). Interestingly, the generated price series display scaling and multiscaling features, which is consistent with empirical findings in the real markets. Furthermore, the plausible explanation for these properties is nonlinear temporal correlation instead of probability distribution after the series are shuffled and phase randomized. All of the results imply that these properties of nonlinearity may derive from market participants' heterogeneity and mutual interactions; thereby, they may be the underlying characteristics of dealer markets.","China Agr Univ, Ctr Futures & Financial Derivat, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"He, LY (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Ctr Futures & Financial Derivat, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",lyhe@amss.ac.cn,"HE, Ling-Yun/K-2346-2012","He, Ling-Yun/0000-0003-3565-9422",Chinese Universities Scientific Fund [2009-1-23]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [20090450602],Chinese Universities Scientific Fund; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),This work is supported by Chinese Universities Scientific Fund (No. 2009-1-23) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 20090450602).,,37,8,8,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The two rival solutions proposed by Elga (Analysis 60:143-147, 2000) and Lewis (Analysis 61:171-176, 2001) differ by a single parameter concerning her prior probability. They can be supported by considering, respectively, that Sleeping Beauty is fuzzy-minded and blank-minded, the first interpretation being more natural than the second. The traditional absent-minded driver problem is reinterpreted in this framework and sustains Elga's solution.","[Baratgin, Jean] Univ Paris 08, Inst Jean Nicod, Paragraphe CRAC, F-93526 St Denis, France; [Walliser, Bernard] ENPC EHESS, Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France",Universite Paris-VIII; Paris School of Economics; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech,"Baratgin, J (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, Inst Jean Nicod, Paragraphe CRAC, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France.",jean.baratgin@univ-paris8.fr; walliser@mail.enpc.fr,"Baratgin, Jean/G-2985-2017","Baratgin, Jean/0000-0001-9566-486X",,,,,19,4,4,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2010,69.0,3,,,,,489,496,,10.1007/s11238-010-9215-6,0.0,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,627WL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280074600009,0

Using data on individual transactions between 1970 and 2006, we examine the restrictions countries place on mergers and acquisitions, whether they use these controls to discriminate against foreigners seeking to acquire domestic firms, and what factors may predict the propensity to block foreign entry by this method of direct investment. Drawing partly on the existing literature, we test hypotheses that state intervention can be explained by characteristics of the countries whose firms are targeted by acquirers, including per capita income, democracy, trade exposure, market size, government share of national income and industrial structure. Although democracy, trade exposure and high government expenditure are associated with more stringent merger control laws, none of these attributes cause states to discriminate against cross-border mergers. Countries with high per capita incomes, large markets and strict merger control laws, do use those regulations to discourage foreign acquirers. A second set of tests, based on observations of individual deals, rather than national aggregates, reveal that governments are particularly averse to foreigners acquiring firms that are bankrupt or in the defence sector. Overall, governments do treat cross-border mergers and acquisitions differently, and use their merger control laws to discriminate against foreign investors, particularly with respect to certain types of transactions.","[Conybeare, John] Univ Iowa, Dept Polit Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Kim, Dong-Hun] Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Seoul, South Korea",University of Iowa; Korea University,"Conybeare, J (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Polit Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",,,,,,,,42,14,19,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2010,33.0,9,,,,,1175,1199,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01271.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,648BR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281665900006,0

The results reveal the operation of the antebellum paradox in that average heights declined between men born circa 1820 and those born circa 1840.

It is assumed that each player has an inclination to say YES or NO which, due to influence of other players, may be different from the decision of the player. The point of departure here is the concept of the Hoede-Bakker index-the notion which computes the overall decisional 'power' of a player in a social network. The main drawback of the Hoede-Bakker index is that it hides the actual role of the influence function, analyzing only the final decision in terms of success and failure. In this paper, we separate the influence part from the group decision part, and focus on the description and analysis of the influence part. We propose among other descriptive tools a definition of a (weighted) influence index of a coalition upon an individual. Moreover, we consider different influence functions representative of commonly encountered situations. Finally, we propose a suitable definition of a modified decisional power.","[Grabisch, Michel] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75013 Paris, France; [Rusinowska, Agnieszka] Univ Lyon 2, CNRS, GATE, Ecole Normale Super LSH,UMR 5824, F-69131 Ecully, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Grabisch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",michel.grabisch@univ-paris1.fr; rusinowska@gate.cnrs.fr,"Rusinowska, Agnieszka/KCL-5447-2024","Rusinowska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-3803-9907",,,,,30,26,30,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUL,2010,69.0,1,,,,,69,96,,10.1007/s11238-008-9109-z,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,610OT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278743400005,0

A long run structural model linking real rental levels, office-based employment and the supply of office space is estimated and then rental adjustment processes are modeled using an error correction model framework. Rental adjustment is seen to be asymmetric, depending both on the direction of the supply and demand shocks and on the state of the space market at the time of the shock. Vacancy adjustment does not display statistically significant asymmetries. There is also a supply adjustment equation. Two three-equation systems, one with symmetric rental adjustment and the other with asymmetric adjustment, are subjected to positive and negative shocks to employment.

The extracted cycle can be interpreted as a model-based bandpass filter and is designed to emphasize the business cycle frequencies that are of interest to applied researchers and policymakers. Stochastic volatility processes and mixture distributions for the irregular components and the common cycle disturbances enable us to account for the heteroskedasticity present in the data.

A counterfactual analysis of historical data shows that the effect of enlarging the EU from 15 to 27 countries was sizeable in 2002-04 and again from 2007. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the enlargement of the EU from 15 to 27 members reduces the inflation reference value by 0.15-0.2 percentage points on average, but there is a considerable probability of a larger reduction at any given moment of time.

The authors use logistic and ordinary least squares regressions on the approval, number, and value of TIFs in Missouri to flesh out the competitive dynamics, effects on intermunicipal inequality, and path dependency of TIF use. They find that there are competitive dynamics that affect TIF use: Being adjacent to another city that uses TIF increases the likelihood that a city will approve a TIF. The study finds evidence that TIF adoption patterns contribute to intermunicipal inequality, and it provides some support for the importance of path dependency in TIF use.","[Mason, Susan] Boise State Univ, Dept Publ Policy & Adm, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Mason, Susan] Boise State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Mason, Susan] Boise State Univ, Community & Reg Planning Program, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Mason, Susan] Boise State Univ, Community & Reg Planning Grad Certificate Program, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Thomas, Kenneth P.] Univ Missouri, Ctr Int Studies, St Louis, MO 63121 USA",Idaho; Boise State University; Idaho; Boise State University; Idaho; Boise State University; Idaho; Boise State University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Saint Louis,"Mason, S (通讯作者)，Boise State Univ, Dept Publ Policy & Adm, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA.",susanmason@boisestate.edu,,,,,,,29,11,16,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

When agents are in close physical proximity, potential trading partners are more numerous and less costly to reach. Counteracting such agglomeration benefits is the dispersion force due to land being an essential input in production. The distribution of economic activities over space is an outcome of how decisions on location, land demand, and the search strategy of agents interact in spatial equilibrium. More desirable locations are those that allow their occupants more abundant and less costly access to potential trading partners. In spatial equilibrium, these are the densest locations, the occupants of which benefit from the strongest thick market externalities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The study finds that the earnings gap of temporary help workers in Germany is indeed large and increased during the past decade. Decomposition reveals that the widening gap mainly is driven by changes in relative skill prices and less by differences in the workforce composition. Temps already have to accept a marked earnings decline before entering the temporary help sector. Nevertheless, after leaving the sector temporary help workers no longer have to accept a pay penalty. A recent reform set a high incentive for temporary help agencies to pay their workers according to a collective agreement. Surprisingly, the unionization of the sector could not bring the widening earnings gap to a halt.","Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Sch Business, Dept Econ, DK-8230 Aabyhoej, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Jahn, EJ (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Sch Business, Dept Econ, Hermodsvej 22, DK-8230 Aabyhoej, Denmark.",elja@asb.dk,,,,,,,45,15,16,1,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

I use multi-spell unemployment duration data of British males and monthly series of regional vacancies over unemployment, referred to as labour market tightness, to control for the business cycle. In line with most previous studies I find that the observed negative duration dependence on an aggregate level is explained by both sorting and strong negative individual duration dependence, and that the individual hazard of leaving unemployment increases with labour market tightness. The new empirical findings emerge from the interactions between individual duration dependence and the business cycle. Individual heterogeneity, and in particular the variation over the business cycle in the composition of the newly unemployed, explains most of the systematic variation over the business cycle in duration dependence on an aggregate level. Individual duration dependence does not vary over the business cycle in a way that would lend support to the predictions concerning this of the matching model of Lockwood (Rev Econ Stud 58:733-753, 1991) or the ranking model of Blanchard and Diamond (Rev Econ Stud 61:417-434, 1994).","[Kalwij, Adriaan] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kalwij, Adriaan] Tilburg Univ, Network Studies Pens Aging & Retirement, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Tilburg University,"Kalwij, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Janskerkhof 12, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.s.kalwij@uu.nl,,,,,,,41,6,6,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Approximately a one-level jump in physical activity in the six-level score provided the same improvement in life satisfaction as one-quarter of the effect of the employment status change from unemployed to employed. Additionally, the empirical finding that the level of disability was insignificant in determining subjective well-being is consistent with a threshold argument.

Using tourist consumption data collected through quarterly national visitor surveys, two systems of demand equations are estimated, based on the almost ideal demand system and incorporating seasonality. The study aggregates Itemized tourist expenditure data into five broad commodity groups: accommodation, food, transportation, shopping and entertainment. The estimated models obey the basic postulates of consumer theory - homogeneity and symmetry. Overall, demand for the five commodity aggregates is found to be price Inelastic, while the degree of price sensitivity varies across the commodity aggregates and between the two types of tourists. In general, demand by leisure tourists is found to be more sensitive to price than demand by non-leisure tourists. The cross-price elasticities derived from both models reveal a gross complementarity of demand, implying that tourists' overall utility depends on the Joint consumption of a bundle of goods and services. The observed price-inelastic demand, coupled with the apparent complementarity of demand, may reflect the possibility that latent price sensitivity is associated with tourist demand.","Victoria Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia",Victoria University,"Divisekera, S (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",sarath.divisekera@vu.edu.au,,,,,,,31,14,15,2,27,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

However, empirical studies on TIF have primarily examined TIF's impact on property values, ignoring the claim that serves as the primary justification for its use. This article addresses the claim by examining the impact of TIF adoption on municipal employment growth in Illinois, looking for both general impact and impact specific to the type of development supported. Results find no general impact of TIF use on employment. However, findings suggest that TIF districts supporting industrial development may have a positive effect on municipal employment, whereas TIF districts supporting retail development have a negative effect on municipal employment. These results are consistent with industrial TIF districts capturing employment that would have otherwise occurred outside of the adopting municipality and retail TIF districts shifting employment within the municipality to more labor-efficient retailers within the TIF district.","Washburn Univ, Sch Business, Topeka, KS 66621 USA",Washburn University,"Byrne, PF (通讯作者)，Washburn Univ, Sch Business, 310-P Henderson,1700 Coll Ave, Topeka, KS 66621 USA.",paul.byrne@washburn.edu,,"Byrne, Paul/0000-0002-9538-9201",,,,,25,30,43,1,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

We find large and persistent impacts of wars on trade, national income, and global economic welfare.

In Iowa and Illinois, where corn is largely ubiquitous, firms move beyond corn supply to consider other localized factors in their decision-making process. Factors such as rail access, population density, and proximity to blending terminals emerge as significant considerations. Probit regressions comparing states reveal the competitive advantages that each offers to ethanol firms.

Although the US pushed hard for the implementation of ARMS, viewing it as a means of improving its ability to monitor and control the Bank, the initiative has paradoxically also provided the Bank with an additional source of legitimacy and autonomy. This apparent contradiction forces a clarification of the analytical framework we use to investigate international organisations (IOs) to allow us to understand the 'positive feedback cycle' that has developed between the Bank and the US regarding the standard with which to judge the IO's performance. The refined focus on the impact of Bank-supported interventions has important implications for the internal 'battlefield for knowledge' in the organisation, particularly concerning the competing visions of an 'economic' and a 'multi-dimensional' conceptualisation of poverty.","Univ Birmingham, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, POLSIS, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Clegg, L (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, POLSIS, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",lxc784@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,33,34,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

But there is still a large gap in competitiveness compared with that of developed countries, and the disparity of regional development of civil aviation industry in our country is particularly prominent. In this paper, the method of factor analysis is used to analyze the evaluation of competitiveness of civil aviation industry. The paper mainly contains three parts. Firstly, by qualitative and quantitative analysis, evaluation index system which is composed of the industry scale, industry performance, marketplace influence and technology innovation is built. Secondly, evaluation model of core competence are established and the evaluation which about the competitiveness of civil aviation industry in 21 provinces and municipalities is implemented. The practicability of method has been verified by using SPSS16.0 software. Finally, through the qualitative analysis and the quantitative analysis, this paper obtains the research the essential own existence problems as well as affected factor. In light of obvious regional disparity in the civil aviation industry in China, some preventive measures and consistency strategies are put forward.

First, the relationship between equity returns of commercial banks, savings and loans (S&Ls) and life insurance companies (LICs), and those of the real-estate investment trusts (REITs), a proxy for the real-estate sector performance. Second, the relationship between conditional volatilities of the stock returns of these financial intermediaries (FIs) and that of REITs. The former relationship allows the spillover of returns between the real-estate and the financial intermediation sector to be analyzed. The latter allows an investigation of the prevalence, direction and strength of inter-sectoral risk transmission to be carried out. Several interesting results are obtained. First, the equity returns of the FIs considered follow a GARCH process and should be modeled accordingly. Second, as found in the literature, returns on REITs should be modeled using the Fama-French multiple factor model. However, this model has to be extended to incorporate a GARCH error structure. Third, all FI returns considered are highly sensitive to REIT returns and the effects are both statistically and economically significant. This is an indication that shocks to REITs returns spillover to the former markets. Fourth, spillover of increased volatility in the real-estate sector to S&Ls and LICs is significant but not to commercial banks.","[Elyasiani, Elyas] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business & Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Mansur, Iqbal] Widener Univ, Chester, PA 19013 USA; [Wetmore, Jill L.] Saginaw Valley State Univ, Univ Ctr, Saginaw, MI USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Widener University,"Elyasiani, E (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business & Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",elyas@temple.edu; imansur@widener.edu; jwetmore@svsu.edu,,,,,,,67,11,15,2,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Does imagination help agents to shape their choice options? Can it contribute to economic change? And if so, how may its roles be conceptualized? As a first step we analyse the contributions offered by Kenneth Boulding and Cornelius Castoriadis. Secondly, we suggest how their insights may be reinterpreted and extended to two contemporary topics, learning and institutions. In the last part of the paper we suggest how the concept of failure may be reconsidered. Traditionally, economic literature has analysed failures that pertain to the market, to the public intervention and to strategic interactions, under the well-known labels of market, non-market and coordination failures. We will identify a different kind of failure which affects imagination and generates situations in which creativity and planning abilities are impaired at the individual and/or social level. The lack of inventiveness may have very costly consequences that vary from low productivity to institutional inertia, from the inability to innovate to the difficulty of rethinking economic and organisational structures.

Our argument questions the prevailing explanation about the role of partisanship in the literature, where it is usually assumed that left governments frighten investors. To the extent that financial development is translated into higher levels of investment that increases labor demand, workers and the parties representing them will adopt policies and regulations that favor the capitalization of financial markets. We explore the empirical content of our hypothesis against several competing explanations: the legal origins school, which argues common law proxies stronger investor protections than civil law; the electoral law school, which argues proportional representation provides weaker protections than do majoritarian ones; the institutional economics view, which argues that checks on policy-making discretion such as veto gates protect the property rights of investors and encourage investment. We test the implications of the different arguments on the level of stock market capitalization in a panel of 85 countries over the period 1975-2004. We find preliminary evidence in favor of the partisanship hypothesis: left-leaning governments are more likely to be associated with higher stock market capitalization than their counterparts to the right and center of the political spectrum. These results are consistent with recent theories emphasizing an emerging coalition of workers and owners against managers in favor of greater transparency and shareholder protection.","[Pinto, Pablo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Weymouth, Stephen; Gourevitch, Peter] Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Sch Int Relat & Pacific Studies, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Weymouth, Stephen; Gourevitch, Peter] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Weymouth, Stephen; Gourevitch, Peter] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Int Relat & Pacific Studies, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",Columbia University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Pinto, PM (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,"Weymouth, Stephen/C-9562-2013",,,,,,70,17,23,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In the Asian crisis of the late 1990s the culprit was 'crony capitalism', and rich country politicians pursued this target zealously, deflecting any blame they might have taken for the financial catastrophe that afflicted that region. The failure of Enron Corporation in 2001 caused the spotlight to shift to various institutions, including the American wholesale credit rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Standard Poor's. With the return of dramatic financial volatility in the summer of 2007, the American agencies seemed to become public enemy number one. This article suggests that moral panic serves key political objectives in fragile times, in this instance disciplining some of the most extreme forms of financial innovation, but also undermining counter-hegemonic claims about the inherent problems of global finance.","Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Sinclair, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",timothy.sinclair@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,45,39,41,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We analyze this evolution by social status, education, income and gender, region of residence, using the three French national Health Surveys conducted in 198 1, 1992 and 2003. The average body weight of both women and men has increased in France since 1981 and accelerated since the 1990s. This trend is obtained among all age groups. Nevertheless, this process did not affect all socioeconomic groups similarly. Geographical differences increased between north-east, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, and the Mediterranean region, where it is lower. Likewise, the gap between social and Occupational categories has greatly widened: obesity has increased much faster among farmers and blue-collar workers than among managers and professionals. In contrast to women, poorer men are not more likely to be more obese than others. Our findings Suggest that differences in BMI values increased substantially among social groups in France, in particular among women. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A unique database listing all new investments involving foreign ownership is used to construct a panel of 33 countries in the period 1980-2005. To account for many country-year observations with zero FDI, the negative binomial regression, the Tobit regression and the Heckman selection procedure are used. The conclusions drawn from the analysis employing panel-based techniques differ from the results obtained from pooled regression models. Also, the determinants of FDI differ depending on whether foreign investment is measured in terms of investment expenditure or the number of individual foreign projects. The Heckman selection results reveal that there are a large number of factors affecting the decision to invest in Saudi Arabia, compared with relatively few determinants of the actual size of investment. Traditional size and distance characteristics hold to a great extent but the relationship between FDI and bilateral trade is unclear and there is some evidence that the countries that export to Saudi Arabia do not invest there. In terms of scope for possible spillovers, there is mixed evidence on whether the investment comes from more technologically advanced economies but volume-wise important investments originate from countries characterised by high income per capita.","[Roberts, Barbara M.] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Almahmood, Abdulaziz] Univ Newcastle, Sch Business, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Leicester; University of Newcastle,"Roberts, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",,,,,,,,41,4,4,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2009,32.0,12,,,,,1730,1746,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01205.x,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,530KP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272590300004,0

The current study examines the socioeconomic, institutional, and location factors influencing the listing of historic resources in the National Register in the Appalachian state of West Virginia. Two separate models of total historic listings and rate of historic house listings in the National Register identify the following: number of higher education institutions and older houses, rural area, more than one historic preservation organization, proportion of females, and the share of income in the service economy. Age, poverty rate, and the Gini coefficient of income inequality have an inverse relationship with listing.","[Maskey, Vishakha] W Liberty State Coll, W Liberty, WV USA; [Brown, Cheryl] W Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV USA; [Lin, Ge] Univ Nebraska, Omaha, NE 68182 USA",West Virginia University; University of Nebraska System,"Maskey, V (通讯作者)，W Liberty Univ, Sch Business, CSC, Dept Financial Syst, 123,POB 295, W Liberty, WV 26074 USA.",vmaskey@westliberty.edu,,,,,,,44,8,10,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The results suggest that income concentration was much higher during the 1930s and early 1940s than it is today. Top income shares estimated from reported incomes deteriorated during the Second World War, even if Portugal did not take active participation in the conflict. However, the magnitude of the drop was less important than in other European countries. The level of concentration between 1950 and 1970 remained relatively high compared to countries such as Spain, France, UK or the United States. The decrease in income concentration, started very moderately at the end of the 1960s and which accelerated after the revolution of 1974, began to be reversed during the first half of the 1980s. During the last 15 years top income shares have increased steadily. The rise in wage concentration contributed to this process in a significant way. The evidence since 1989 suggests that the level of marginal tax rate at the top has not been a primary determinant of the level of top reported incomes. Marginal rates have stayed constant in a context of growing top shares. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We depart from the previous literature on this topic by simulating a theoretical model whose parameters are estimated using Kalman Filter techniques. The paper is particularly appealing to study the effects of high energy prices, which would be associated to climate change policies, and to the feedback effects of those policies on the economy. The results of the paper support the hypothesis of smaller macroeconomic effects of oil shocks from the mid-1980's. The results emerge from the different features of the economy: both labor market rigidities and the oil share have decreased over time and the monetary policy has changed in that it is more focused on controlling inflation.","[de Miguel, Carlos; Manzano, Baltasar; Martin-Moreno, Jose M.] Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain; [Ruiz, Jesus] Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; Complutense University of Madrid,"de Miguel, C (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain.",cmiguel@uvigo.es,"De Miguel, Carlos/G-4843-2015; Moreno, José María Martín/G-9627-2015; Martin-Moreno, Jose M./S-7733-2016; Manzano, Baltasar/H-4367-2015; Ruiz, Jesus/H-8954-2015","Martin-Moreno, Jose M./0000-0002-8648-5541; Manzano, Baltasar/0000-0003-0537-7053; Ruiz, Jesus/0000-0002-4739-978X","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2008-02752/ECON, SEJ2006-14354/ECON]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees and the participants at the 3rd Workshop on Energy and Environmental Economics: Climate Change Policies after 2012 for their useful comments and suggestions.

Whereas previous contributions have investigated efficiency, international integration and portfolio diversification opportunities, very little is known about these markets' vulnerability to external financial crises. In this paper, we investigate shift-contagion to the MENA region using a comprehensive battery of econometric tests for a number of different crises episodes: the 1997 Asian crisis, the 1998 Russian virus and its Brazilian sequel, the 2000 Turkish collapse, the 9/11 turmoil, the 2001 Argentinean crisis, the 2002 Enron/WorldCom scandal and the 2007-09 global financial crisis. We found that Turkey, Israel and Jordan were the most vulnerable markets over the 1997-2009 period, followed by Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt and Lebanon. Our results also highlight heterogeneous but increasing levels of sensitivity to external financial shocks, especially during the recent global financial crisis. From a financial point of view, this suggests that MENA-based diversification strategies may be relatively inefficient during periods of global turmoil. From an economic point of view, our results suggest that stock market development also involves potential destabilisation costs. This issue should be acknowledged and addressed by policymakers if these countries are to ensure a smooth transition towards international financial integration.","[Lagoarde-Segot, Thomas] Aix Marseille Univ, EUROMED Management Marseille, Marseille, France; [Lagoarde-Segot, Thomas] Aix Marseille Univ, DEFI, Marseille, France; [Lucey, Brian M.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Inst Int Integrat Studies, Dublin, Ireland; [Lucey, Brian M.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Dublin, Ireland",Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin,"Lagoarde-Segot, T (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, EUROMED Management Marseille, Marseille, France.",,"lucey, brian/AAY-3885-2021","lucey, brian/0000-0002-4052-8235",,,,,24,23,27,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2009,32.0,10,,,,,1478,1497,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01204.x,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,509UH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271043400005,0

To achieve this, the EU Commission suggested certain specific interventions for the Mediterranean in addition to the common measures established for all the European areas. Thus, amongst the principal stock protection measures, the Commission encouraged the establishment of new protected and safeguarded fishing zones as well as restocking areas. This work is based on these considerations and its aim is to indicate certain reference points regarding the estimation of the total economic value (TEV) to apply to marine protected areas (MPA) in which tourist activities have been allowed and developed. Thus, an investigation was conducted to ascertain the effective importance that the users ascribe to biological protected areas (BPA) and an attempt was made to estimate a possible economic value of the tourist demand for such places as recreational destinations. In particular, the study conducts in-depth research into the possible use values of biological protected areas (BPA) by applying the Travel Cost Method so as to ascribe an economic value to the place in relation to the tourist-recreational facilities provided. The assessment model was applied to a specific research area, of artificial origin, situated offshore from the coast of Ravenna.","[Castellini, Alessandra; Devenuto, Lucia; Ragazzoni, Alessandro] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Econ & Engn, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Castellini, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Econ & Engn, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",,,,,,,,9,2,2,0,10,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2009,8.0,3,,,,,41,47,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,512TI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271273100006,0

The essay also provides a sympathetic critique of OEP and shows how the paradigm can be extended to capture some of the concerns and insights of other critics. Most important, this critique highlights the role and consequences of certain simplifying assumptions commonly used in OEP and calls for a closer examination of how international institutions and policies structure and change the interests of actors within countries that are now taken as exogenous.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, San Diego, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Lake, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, San Diego, CA 92093 USA.",dlake@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,121,176,214,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We show that the higher the number of potential readers and/or the lower the cost of investigating, the more the candidates tend to reveal their motives. We also show that the readers' purchasing habits play a crucial role in the model. More specifically, we show that if readers always buy a newspaper, media competition favors information disclosure; whereas if they are opportunistic and just buy a newspaper in case news are uncovered, competition is not so desirable.","Univ Malaga, Dpto Teoria & Hist Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Andina-Díaz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dpto Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",aandina@uma.es,"Díaz, Ascensión Andina/R-6592-2018","Díaz, Ascensión Andina/0000-0002-8629-8770",,,,,17,4,5,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,AUG,2009,33.0,2,,,,,261,280,,10.1007/s00355-008-0356-2,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,459NV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267110800004,0

A novel feature of this estimator is that it is based on density estimation under local smoothing. While the proofs differ from those based on alternative density estimators, the finite sample performance of the estimators is significantly improved. As binary responses often appear as endogenous regressors in continuous outcome equations, we also develop and optimal instrumental variables estimator in this context. For this purpose, we specialize the double-index model for binary response to one with heteroscedasticity that depends on an index different from that underlying the 'mean response'. We show that such (multiplicative) heteroscedasticity, whose form is not parametrically specified, effectively induces exclusion restrictions on the outcomes equation. The estimator developed exploits such identifying information. We provide simulation evidence on the favorable performance of the estimators and illustrate their use through an empirical application on the determinants, and affect, of attendance at a government-financed school.

Most of the price decline after Proposition 209 resulted from the mix of subcontractors employed, which seems to arise from the higher costs of firms located in high-minority areas.

This study considers the arguments that trade liberalisation and technological catch-up could raise the skill premium. The first argument has shown, in the North-South trade framework, that a reduction in import tariff may raise the skill premium if the tariff reduction causes the range of the traded goods in which export expansion occurs to be greater than the range of the traded goods in which imports expand. The second argument has shown that technological catch-up could raise the skill premium through export expansion. This paper presents an empirical study of developing economies from 1980 to 2005, which confirms that trade liberalisation raises the skill premium, whilst technological catch-up has an insignificant effect on the skill premium.","[Ing, Lili Yan] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Ing, Lili Yan] Univ Indonesia, Bogor, Indonesia",Australian National University; University of Indonesia,"Ing, LLY (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,15,6,6,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2009,32.0,7,,,,,1115,1133,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01192.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,468PZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267833300008,0

Urban economic theory posits that housing prices in a small area should increase as quality of life increases, because people will be willing to pay more to live in the area, but these changes in prices and quality of life will also affect the demographics of the population through sorting and the housing stock through reinvestment. Using census block-group level data, we examine how housing prices respond to the Empowerment Zone policy intervention. Changes in the other dimensions of neighborhood quality (demographics and housing stock characteristics) will also help determine the total - or full - effect on housing values of the policy intervention. This paper estimates these direct and full effects in a simultaneous equations setting, compares direct and indirect effects and examines the robustness of the effects to alternate estimation strategies. We find strong evidence for substantively large and highly significant direct price effects, while results suggest that the indirect effects are substantively small or even negative.

Creating lifestyle clusters for a population is a compromise between the two. On the one hand, it has taken into account travel-activity patterns in the development of the clusters. On the other hand, the clusters represent homogenous groups of individuals and simple activity-based travel demand models can be developed for each cluster. However, the development of such clusters requires knowledge of activity-travel patterns of individuals, which can only be obtained from a large-scale survey. It is still an open question how to create travel/activity-related lifestyle clusters using readily available socio-demographic data (such as census data) alone. This paper attempts to answer this question by proposing a procedure of lifestyle classification that moves from specific surveys to a general population. This paper first studies issues related to the development of homogeneous clusters using socioeconomic, demographic and activity-travel data. The second part of the paper addresses the issue of data insufficiency and points out that in order to use the clusters developed for travel demand estimation, it is important to know how to allocate individuals in the population to the developed clusters. As a first attempt, this paper proposes to use a recently developed technique called, Support Vector Machine (SVM), to develop classification functions that based on readily available information only. The methodologies proposed are applied to a sub-urban area in Hong Kong. Six lifestyle clusters are first produced using factor analysis and cluster analysis. SVM is then used to develop classification functions that are based on fewer variables. Results show that the two sets of lifestyle clusters are similar and that the SVM outperforms other traditional classification methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In each period, a new generation of workers that are heterogeneous with respect to ability is born. Workers can migrate and commute to work between the cities at given migration cost, commuting costs, and commuting time. In equilibrium migration is unidirectional, where the migrants are the most able workers of the Suburb. Suburb workers with moderate ability commute to work in the Metropolis and the least able work in the Suburb. We show that reducing commuting time can moderate, stop, or reverse the migration process. In the latter case the economy switches from a growing to a declining path of aggregate and per-capita output. Yet, for low commuting cost, reducing commuting time always increases long-term total production. Nevertheless, workers who reside and work in the Suburb suffer from commuting-time reduction due to increase in the Suburb's housing price, while all other workers in the economy gain.

The urban land leasing price-distance relationship is estimated based on the argument that monocentric urban structure is representative for Chinese cities. Both population size and income level are found to positively affect urban land price and price-distance gradients. Commercial land prices are higher than residential land prices except in suburbs or outer central urban areas, where the land prices of different uses converge.

Within each region, workers have to search for a job-type that matches their skill. They face a trade-off between match quality and the cost of extended search. This trade-off differs between regions, because search is more efficient in larger regions. Then, interregional mobility and trade lead to a pattern of specialization where large scale regions have a comparative advantage in producing commodities that are search intensive, i.e. that require a wide variety of tasks and make use of scarce worker types.

Our approach is based on the simple idea of writing down the Kalman filter recursions on block form and appropriately sequencing the operations of the prediction step of the algorithm. It is argued that block filtering is the only viable serial algorithmic approach to significantly reduce Kalman filtering time in the context of large DSGE models. For the largest model we evaluate the block filter reduces the computation time by roughly a factor 2. Block filtering compares favourably with the more general method for faster Kalman filtering outlined by Koopman and Durbin (J Time Ser Anal 21:281-296, 2000) and, furthermore, the two approaches are largely complementary.","[Walentin, Karl] Sveriges Riksbank, Res Dept, S-10337 Stockholm, Sweden; [Strid, Ingvar] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ Stat & Decis Support, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Sveriges Riksbank; Stockholm School of Economics,"Walentin, K (通讯作者)，Sveriges Riksbank, Res Dept, S-10337 Stockholm, Sweden.",ingvar.strid@hhs.se; karl.walentin@riksbank.se,,,,,,,9,16,19,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Efforts to increase rail use usually focus on the rail service itself while the accessibility of the rail network receives less attention. In this context, the paper has two broad aims. First, to evaluate how important the 'access-to-the-station' part of a rail journey is to passengers in their overall satisfaction with the rail journey and second, to investigate the balance between characteristics of the service, the access to it and the population served in determining rail use in different parts of the rail network. The analysis is carried out for the Netherlands. To achieve the first aim, we use the Dutch Railways customer satisfaction survey and apply principal component analysis and derived importance techniques to assess the relative importance of accessibility in determining the overall satisfaction with the rail journey. For the second aim, we use regression analysis to explain, at the Dutch postcode level, the propensity to use rail. We find that satisfaction with the level and quality of the access to the station is an important dimension of the rail journey which influences the overall satisfaction from that journey and that the quality and level of accessibility is an important element in explaining rail use. The conclusion reached is that in many parts of the rail network improving and expanding access services to the railway station can substitute for improving and expanding the services provided on the rail network and that it is probably more cost efficient when the aim is to increase rail use. These parts of the network are mainly in the periphery where the current level of rail service is relatively low. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus on the presence of calendar effects in daily and monthly price returns and examine these effects both over time and across countries. For the daily returns we find price anomalies for Fridays and Mondays in all markets. Friday returns tend to be the highest of the week, while Mondays are weakest. We find that these patterns were most prominent during the 1980s and early 1990s and in the smaller markets in our sample. For the monthly returns we found little evidence for price irregularities. In most cases January was superior to most other months, but these differences lacked statistical significance. More interesting was the sell in May effect that seemed to be present in ten out of 11 markets. Price returns during the winter season outperformed the summer months and in five countries these difference were both economically and statistically significant. Finally, we looked at firm level returns to isolate the drivers of these infamous calendar effects. The day-of-the-week effect appears to be most pronounced among small and young firms that have little or no institutional investors. Large and long-established listed real estate firms with a large portion of loyal block-holders experience no significant price patterns during the trading week.","[Brounen, Dirk; Ben-Hamo, Yair] RSM Erasmus Univ, Finance Grp, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Brounen, D (通讯作者)，RSM Erasmus Univ, Finance Grp, Burg Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",dbounen@rsm.nl,,"Brounen, Dirk/0000-0001-9426-1399",,,,,29,16,17,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Although Johansen might have been much attracted towards a purely theoretical study of a multi-sectoral equilibrium growth process he chose to construct an empirical model, calibrated to fit the Norwegian economy in 1950. Johansen's Model combined Leontief's input-output analysis with Solow-type production functions and a Frisch-influenced specification of consumption demand. His work became influential on the further CGE development. Johansen died at the age of 52 in 1982 and is regarded as the (only) intellectual heir of his teachers Ragnar Frisch and Trygve Haavelmo in originality and profoundness.","[Bjerkholt, Olav] Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Bjerkholt, O (通讯作者)，POB 1095, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",olav.bjerkholt@econ.uio.no,,,,,,,54,7,7,1,5,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Adopting a long-term historical perspective, it shows how successive regimes meshed and clashed with Islam in their efforts to assert worldly power. Religion was uniformly marginalised in the era of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist socialism, but the cases of Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Xinjiang show that religion has been playing somewhat different roles across the region since 1991. For the secular authorities, Islam may be valued as a source of nation building or it may be feared as a potentially destabilising force. The resulting attempts to co-opt, channel and control religious expression provide insights into the nature of secular power and raise questions concerning the applicability to this region of influential theories in the sociology of religion.","[Hann, Chris] Max Planck Inst Social Anthropol, D-06114 Halle, Germany; [Pelkmans, Mathijs] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, London WC2A 2AE, England",Max Planck Society; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hann, C (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Social Anthropol, Advokatenweg 36, D-06114 Halle, Germany.",hann@eth.mpg.de; M.E.Pelkmans@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,85,33,36,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2009,61.0,9,,,,,1517,1541,,10.1080/09668130903209111,0.0,,,25,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,529PF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272529000001,0

The flexible-price equilibrium corresponds to the state. of the economy with more efficient allocation. These estimates are thus useful indicators for monetary policy. Our output gap illustrates Czech business cycles which are rather different to other estimates (e.g. HP filter). This result may be typical for economies in transition.

This monoculture is evident in the way we currently train graduate students in IPE and in the gatekeeping practices of the leading international relations journals. Fortunately, there is a continued diversity of work appearing in other fora from that surveyed by Maliniak and Tierney, primarily in book form and in alternative journals. The absence of cross-fertilization from these alternative outlets to the high status journals and graduate syllabi portends poorly for the future of the field.

Second, RU offers each person the maximum expected utility amongst all rescaling-invariant solutions, when it is applied to a random sequence of future bargaining problems generated using a certain class of distributions; this is recalls the results of Harsanyi (J Polit Econ 61:434-435, 1953) and Karni (Econometrica 66(6):1405-1415, 1998).","Trent Univ, Dept Math, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada",Trent University,"Pivato, M (通讯作者)，Trent Univ, Dept Math, 1600 W Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada.",marcuspivato@trentu.ca,"Pivato, Marcus/AAE-4495-2020","Pivato, Marcus/0000-0001-9833-6175",,,,,21,11,14,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2009,32.0,1,,,,,79,92,,10.1007/s00355-008-0313-0,0.0,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,371OI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000260840200006,0

Keynes; probability; risk; uncertainty,ECONOMETRICS; UNCERTAINTY,"Most interpreters agree that Keynes had a wide-ranging, complex, 'vision of the world', which underlies his theoretical contributions. Whenever this is forgotten, as happens in the so-called neoclassical synthesis, not only the original Keynesian spirit goes lost but also, and especially, we lose substantive bricks for our theoretical constructions. The paper considers an important instance of this general rule; namely Keynes's views on the logic of probability, meant as the field concerning human behaviour in an uncertain world (hence connected to, but distinct from, the pure theory of probability, meant as a field of mathematics). The paper begins by recalling the main aspects of the classical and frequentist approaches to probability and the main criticisms they received, pertaining among other things to the limits of their applicability. We then consider Keynes's own views, stressing three aspects: the definition of probability as pertaining to the field of logic, the notion of uncertainty and of the 'weight of the argument', the 'theory of groups'. We then discuss the subjective approach of de Finetti, Ramsey and Savage, and contrast it with Keynes's own views. Finally, we consider the implications of our analysis for the interpretation of Keynes's General Theory, and of his attitude towards econometrics.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Sociali Econ Demog & Attuariali, I-00100 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Roncaglia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Sociali Econ Demog & Attuariali, I-00100 Rome, Italy.",alessandro.roncaglia@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,48,28,29,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Some studies argue that the influx of FDI may alter the existing structure of competition and defuse firm-level pressure for trade protection. On the other hand, theories that view FDI as a form of strategic rivalry among firms of different national origins suggest that increasing FDI causes greater industry demands for trade protection. This paper empirically tests these competing claims using data on the initiation of antidumping investigations in the US. Its findings show that FDI increases industry demand for trade protection.

Secondly it will give an outline of the key concepts of Saint-Simonism that led to a re-foundation of economics. In particular, the Saint-Simonians did not accept that competition is the appropriate device for coordination in an industrial economy Planning and credit are imperative to an efficient coordination of economic activities and of individual capacities.","[Zouache, Abdallah; Bourelle, Bernard] Univ St Etienne, Dept Econ, CNRS, CREUSET, St Etienne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Jean Monnet,"Zouache, A (通讯作者)，Univ St Etienne, Dept Econ, CNRS, CREUSET, St Etienne, France.",Abdallah.Zonache@univ-st-etienne.fr,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,1,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

However, many resorts would be unable to operate without man-made snow. Deciding when to make snow involves several uncertain factors, as well as significant strategic issues. First, the author describes the framework for this decision. Next, he proposes analytical modelling. Finally, he compares the proposed models to actual practice at several resorts and proposes further research. The author finds that actual practice at most ski resorts does not involve formal analytical methods. While the resorts consider many of the factors included in the models, the decision is generally not modelled explicitly. The use of the proposed analytical models could lead to a better understanding of the factors involved in the snow-making decision, and thus to better service at a reduced cost.","State Univ New York New Paltz, Sch Business, New Paltz, NY 12561 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY New Paltz,"Caskey, KR (通讯作者)，State Univ New York New Paltz, Sch Business, 1 Hawk Dr,VH326, New Paltz, NY 12561 USA.",caskeyk@newpaltz.edu,,,,,,,22,2,2,1,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

But isolating the direct causal impact of zoning on house prices is difficult. This study overcomes the problems in the existing literature by investigating the effect of minimum lot size restrictions (MLRs) on house prices using data on transactions of single-family homes in the greater Boston area from 1987 to 2006. We estimate a model of house prices that include changes in minimum lot size at the zoning district level, variables that account for possible spillover effects in the same town and in nearby towns, and zoning district fixed effects. We estimate price effects due to MLR of 20% or more at the upper end of the impact distribution. We find evidence of significant spillover effects within towns that are similar to those in the zoning district in which the MLR changed. The impact on house prices in nearby towns is significant and as high as 5%. Finally, we find that the impact increases over time with effects as large as 40% occurring 10 years after the change in MLR. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We offer a consistency restriction regarding choice when the feasible set contracts. This condition, 'contraction consistency', subsumes earlier notions such as Chernoff's Condition, Sen's alpha and beta, and regularity. We identify a restriction on the domain of the stochastic choice correspondence (SCC), under which contraction consistency is equivalent to the weak axiom of revealed preference in its most general form. When the universal set of alternatives is finite, this restriction is also necessary for such equivalence. Analogous domain restrictions are also identified for the special case where choice is deterministic but possibly multi-valued. Results due to Sen (Rev Econ Stud 38:307-317, 1971) and Dasgupta and Pattanaik (Econ Theory 31:35-50, 2007) fall out as corollaries. Thus, conditions are established, under which our notion of consistency, articulated only in reference to contractions of the feasible set, suffices as the axiomatic foundation for a general revealed preference theory of choice behaviour.","Ctr Studies Social Sci, Kolkata 700094, India",,"Dasgupta, I (通讯作者)，Ctr Studies Social Sci, Calcutta R-1 Baishnabghata Patuli Township, Kolkata 700094, India.",indraneel@cssscal.org,,"Dasgupta, Indraneel/0000-0002-3212-0782",,,,,24,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2011,37.0,4,,,SI,,643,658,,10.1007/s00355-011-0572-z,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,824AY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295172400010,0

A new rationalizability condition for stochastic choices, rationalizable in terms of stochastic orderings on the normalized price space (rsop), is defined. rsop is satisfied if and only if there exists a solution to a linear feasibility problem. The existence of a solution also implies rationalizability in terms of stochastic orderings on the commodity space. Furthermore it is shown that the problem of finding sufficiency conditions for binary choice probabilities to be rationalizable bears similarities to the problem considered here.","[Heufer, Jan] TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany; [Heufer, Jan] Ruhr Grad Sch Econ, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Heufer, J (通讯作者)，TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vogelpothsweg 87, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",jan.heufer@tu-dortmund.de,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2011,71.0,4,,,,,575,592,,10.1007/s11238-010-9239-y,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,823ZW,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295169100008,0

Yet, second-movers appear to be more motivated towards achieving a social optimum when the first-mover uses commitment.

To this end it seeks to engage potential energy partners across the wider Europe in an institutionalized regime based on the norms of the internal market. This article uses regime theory to evaluate the viability of the strategy. From this perspective, the willingness of the EU's partners to make commitments to institutionalized co-operation will depend on two sets of variables: their interests in resolving the co-operation problems that arise across the energy supply chain; and the 'pull' of the EU in relation to countervailing hegemonic powers in the region. The research tests this argument by examining the co-operation interests of energy consumers, transit countries and producers, and the architecture of emerging institutions in the respective regional contexts. It finds that while energy consumers and transit countries in the EU's immediate neighbourhood are prepared to commit to binding multilateral institutions, co-operation with energy producers is constrained by asymmetries of interest and regional geopolitics, and is likely to take the form of more flexible bilateral agreements.","Univ Strathclyde, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Padgett, S (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, McCance Bldg,16 Richmond St, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland.",stephen.padgett@strath.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,21,22,2,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This together with growing evidence that animal welfare has an impact on food safety and quality led to new legislation for an animal friendlier production sector. Also, new support measures aid those who supply cost increased animal friendlier products with differentiated quality. This article unveils connections between traditional systems and animal welfare. Two beef production systems in Portugal are described. A descriptive analysis is relevant for understanding why local breeds are preferred by producers, and why semi-extensive systems are better adapted to the country. Portuguese beef systems are also described in terms of their animal welfare status and probable control points. A link between Portuguese native breeds and beef quality is proposed, namely through increased animal welfare that may be translated into beef intrinsic quality. Nevertheless, as animal welfare is a credence quality attribute, consumers must rely on information, that is, on quality cues, to inter upon it on the product. This might give marketers the option to develop quality differentiated strategies based on that attribute, within their broader marketing strategies.","[Viegas, Ines; Stilwell, George; Fontes, Magda Aguiar] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Fac Med Vet, CIISA, P-1100 Lisbon, Portugal; [Vieira, Ana] Rafael & Filho SA, Ourem, Portugal; [Santos, Jose Lima] Inst Super Agron, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Viegas, I (通讯作者)，Univ Tecn Lisboa, Fac Med Vet, CIISA, P-1100 Lisbon, Portugal.",,"Stilwell, George/ABH-7714-2020; Vieira, Ana/C-6550-2016; Viegas, Ines/N-5174-2017","Stilwell, George/0000-0003-3733-3223; Vieira, Ana/0000-0003-3863-1070; Lima Santos, Jose/0000-0002-8122-692X; Viegas, Ines/0000-0002-1102-6885; Fontes, Magda/0000-0001-9267-4878",,,,,26,4,5,2,23,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2011,10.0,3,,,,,17,25,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,859NG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297882500004,0

Using a thirteen-year panel survey, we find that migration between 1991 and 2004 added 36 percentage points to consumption growth. Although moving out of agriculture resulted in much higher growth than staying in agriculture, growth was always greater in any sector if the individual physically moved. As to why more people do not move given the high returns to geographical mobility, analysis finds evidence consistent with models in which exit barriers set by home communities prevent the migration of some categories of people.","[Beegle, Kathleen] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Dercon, Stefan] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",The World Bank; University of Oxford,"Beegle, K (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,"De Weerdt, Joachim/0000-0002-5572-3332",,,,,22,145,173,0,30,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Evidence from cointegrated VAR,EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Economic growth; Financial development; Cointegration,ECONOMIC-GROWTH,"The main finding of the paper is that, contrary to Rousseau and Wachtel (Economic growth and financial depth. Is the relationship extinct already? UNU-Wider discussion paper no. 2005/10, 2005), a long-run equilibrium relationship between financial and economic development is identified with data up to 2006-well over the financial openness boom of the nineties-in countries whose history is characterized by numerous years of high inflation and/or episodes of crisis or other structural change. Also, financial openness, or lack thereof, proves to be an important feature both in explaining differences in sensitivity of financial development to capital accumulation and in determining the direction of causality between financial and economic development. The paper finds that bidirectional causality between economic and financial development is not as frequent an outcome as in Luintel and Khan (J Dev Econ 60:381-405, 1999), and in several cases, Joan Robinson's (The generalization of the general theory in the rate of interest, and other essays, Macmillan, London, pp 67-142, 1952) statement on the primacy of economic development over finance is supported by the estimations.","Banca Prossima Financial Budgeting & Risk Managem, I-20121 Milan, Italy",,"Dal Colle, A (通讯作者)，Banca Prossima Financial Budgeting & Risk Managem, Piazza Paolo Ferrari 10, I-20121 Milan, Italy.",alessandra.dalcolle@bancaprossima.com,,,,,,,48,4,4,0,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The database also permits stratification of firms across different employment size categories. Economic growth models that control for other relevant factors reveal a positive relationship between density of locally owned firms and per capita income growth but only for small (10-99 employees) firms, whereas the density of large (more than 500 workers) firms not owned locally has a negative effect. These results provide strong evidence that local ownership matters for economic growth but only in the small size category.

Empirical evidence, from a sample of yacht charter tourists and a database on charter firms in the Balearics provided by the National Charter Federation, gives information on daily tourist expenditure, the number of charter tourists and firms' turnover and employment. More than 100,000 tourists come annually to the Balearics to charter yachts. Average daily expenditure per tourist, including charter cost and other spending on hotel accommodation, bars and restaurants, shopping and other items, is 170; however, average daily expenditure varies depending on the typology of boat rented. When tourist spending in the country of origin is included, average daily expenditure rises to (sic)203.90. Daily expenditure is higher than that of a traditional tourist ((sic)105.20) and similar to that of a golf tourist ((sic)211).

It is hypothesised that the influence of this heterogeneity varies over levels of health and increases over the life cycle. These hypotheses are tested by applying a threshold-specific alternative to the conditional fixed-effects logit and longitudinal data from Germany. Our results suggest that income influences health at the lower end, but not at the higher end of the health distribution, once unobservable factors are controlled for.

We use the European Community Household Panel to identify unemployment at an individual level based as well on the ILO criteria for being classified as unemployed as on the individual respondent reporting to be unemployed. This opens a unique opportunity to compare unemployment measured in two different ways based on a cross European Union panel study covering the years 1994 to 2001. The two main questions addressed in this article are to which extent the two unemployment measures differ and whether transition rates out of unemployment depend on which concept we use. Both questions are answered in the affirmative. The overall conclusion is that it is important, especially in some of the EU countries, to include both measures of unemployment as guidelines and indicators for policy.","[Pedersen, Peder J.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Pedersen, Peder J.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Schmidt, Torben Dall] Univ So Denmark, Inst Border Reg Studies, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark",Aarhus University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Southern Denmark,"Pedersen, PJ (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ, Bldg 1322, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",ppedersen@econ.au.dk; tds@sam.sdu.dk,,,,,,,28,2,3,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In the first stage, the authors use a bootstrapped Malmquist index approach to obtain estimates of total productivity growth. In the second stage, they obtain year-by-year efficiency scores, using a bootstrapped DEA model. A bootstrapped truncated regression is then adopted in the third stage to identify the covariates that explain technical efficiency. Results from a sample of 25 agents indicate that, on average, Portuguese agents experienced an increase in productivity over the period of the study. On the efficiency side, however, most travel agents were found to be operating at a high degree of inefficiency. Differences in productivity and efficiency between individual travel agents appeared to be related to factors such as market share and management style. The results are discussed and policy implications are derived.","[Assaf, A.

In particular, they have started to assess the role of networks in civic and formal arenas. This paper posits a quantitative methodology for a more nuanced and sophisticated analysis of mercantile networks within this environment. It uses visual analytics of Liverpool's business networks comprising political, trade, social and cultural institutions to assess their role in the changing social and economic climate during the period 1750-1810. This paper demonstrates the dynamic role of networks in the shaping of a metropolitan economy and the interplay between the two. In addition, it posits that, as is the case for regional clusters, there is a life cycle of networks. In this way, we are able to see how the networks sustained, nurtured and transformed social and economic activity during this period. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We find convincing empirical support for the interest discount effect, which contributes to a higher equity price for dwellings in housing cooperatives than for self-owned dwellings.

To do so, we deconstruct the complexity surrounding actual auction events, and empirically isolate the influence of conflicting auction theory predictions using data from expert opinion around auction events, actual auction event and outcome data, and stock market data. The empirical findings include (1) with increasing uncertainty bidders reduce bids, thus confirming predictions following the winner's curse thesis; (2) joint bidding does not lead to increased bids based on pooled (better) information, but instead leads to reduced competition; while increased competition leads to increased prices at auction, as expected; (3) the market interprets auction outcomes as information events which function to signal developers' expectations about future market prospects; but if the winning bid is considered too high, this interpretation is revised to that of the winner's curse; (4) with joint bidding and winning, the market's response to joint winners is better explained by concern for winner's curse (despite supposed better informed bids) than the acquisition of a below cost development project following reduced competition at auction; and (5) the market interprets increased competition at auction as indicator of the future direction of property price movements in the secondary market-the more intense the competition, the more positive the future prospect of the property market are seen to be.","[Pretorius, Frederik I.

This mathematical structure captures the effect of superposition of composite prospects, including many incorporated intentions, which allows us to describe a variety of interesting fallacies and anomalies that have been reported to particularize the decision making of real human beings. The theory characterizes entangled decision making, non-commutativity of subsequent decisions, and intention interference. We demonstrate how the violation of the Savage's sure-thing principle, known as the disjunction effect, can be explained quantitatively as a result of the interference of intentions, when making decisions under uncertainty. The disjunction effects, observed in experiments, are accurately predicted using a theorem on interference alternation that we derive, which connects aversion-to-uncertainty to the appearance of negative interference terms suppressing the probability of actions. The conjunction fallacy is also explained by the presence of the interference terms. A series of experiments are analyzed and shown to be in excellent agreement with a priori evaluation of interference effects. The conjunction fallacy is also shown to be a sufficient condition for the disjunction effect, and novel experiments testing the combined interplay between the two effects are suggested.","[Yukalov, V.

Although the bias is prevalent in racetrack betting, with pari-mutuel odds, researchers have detected a reverse bias in two fixed-odds betting markets in the United States. A weak bias was documented for Major League Baseball for 22 seasons. It was also found to be present in the National Hockey League betting market and was of sufficient strength to allow for profitable wagering opportunities. This article analyzes 10 additional seasons of hockey wagering. The bias is sustained for the first three seasons but disappears in the last seven seasons as the market converges to efficiency. This contrasts with the baseball betting market, where the bias persists.","[Woodland, Linda M.] Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA; [Woodland, Bill M.] Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA",Eastern Michigan University; Eastern Michigan University,"Woodland, LM (通讯作者)，Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, 300 W Michigan Ave, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA.",LWoodland@emich.edu,,,,,,,15,6,7,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

This study investigates the complex multi-jurisdiction and multi-tier dimensions of local option sales taxes (LOSTs) in this setting. We estimate own-rate and cross-tier elasticities using data from 1993 to 2006 for Oklahoma municipalities and counties. Using a variety of panel data techniques including first differenced and random trends models, we show both are significant determinants of consumer spending patterns. Additionally, accounting for localized tax rate differentials reveals important nuances in the interpretation of cross-tier and own-rate elasticities. Our results suggest that municipal LOST revenues can be significantly affected by the rate setting decisions of parent counties as well as nearby regional retail centers. Therefore, the ability of municipal governments to control LOST revenues by varying their own LOST rate is affected by both vertical and horizontal fiscal spillovers. Understanding the nature of fiscal interdependence in this setting is important for the 34 US states that authorize some form of LOSTs as well as any considering their implementation.

To introduce disease resistance from 'Dong Guan Dajiao' into 'Guo Shan Xiang' and obtain somatic hybrids, an asymmetric protoplast fusion with polyethylene glycol was developed. Six of the surviving plants were identified as hybrids by RAPD-ISSR and GISH analysis. We also studied the asymmetric somatic hybridisation of 'Ba Xi Jiao' and 'Dong Guan Da Jiao'. Cell colonies were formed from the fusion products after 45 days on a feeder layer culture, and 1236 somatic embryos were obtained. However, they all failed to germinate in further culture. We established a microcross sections cultural system combined with EMS-induced mutation of 'Ba Xi Jiao' to screen for Foc-resistant plants, and five putative Foc race 4-resistant plants were obtained by screening with the method reported by Mak et al. (2004). We cloned a novel full-length NPR1-like gene, designated MdNPR1 (accession number FJ357442) from 'Dong Guan Da Jiao'. The transcripts of MdNPR1 accumulated stronger in the resistant 'Dong Guan Da Jiao' than in 'Fen Jiao' (AAB), a local cultivar which is very susceptible to Foc race 4. MdNPR1 were also transferred into ECS of 'Ba Xi Jiao' via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The expression of the GUS gene could be detected in the transformed ECS after coculture and in the putative transformed somatic embryogenesis, but regeneration was not achieved.","[Chen, Y.

While a tax is fixed, predetermined by authorities, the uncertain permits price is driven by market dynamics, fluctuating with the prices of natural gas and electricity. Both instruments offer firms different incentives for adopting clean technologies. This paper explores the optimal investment timing when a coal-fired plant owner considers introducing clean technologies in face of these two policies using a real options approach. We find that tradable permits could effectively trigger adopting clean technologies at a considerably lower level of carbon price relative to a tax policy. Higher levels of volatility in permit prices are likely to induce suppliers to take early actions to hedge against carbon risks. Thus, offset and other price control mechanisms, which are designed to reduce permit prices or to suppress prices volatility, are likely to delay clean technology investments. doi: 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-No3-6","[Chen, Yihsu] Univ Calif Merced, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Merced, CA 95348 USA; [Chen, Yihsu] Univ Calif Merced, Sch Engn, Merced, CA 95348 USA; [Tseng, Chung-Li] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of California System; University of California Merced; University of California System; University of California Merced; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Chen, YH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Merced, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, 5200 N Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95348 USA.",yihsu.chen@ucmerced.edu; c.tseng@unsw.edu.au,,"Chen, Yihsu/0000-0002-9990-8232","Graduate Research Council (GRC) of University of California, Merced","Graduate Research Council (GRC) of University of California, Merced","The authors would like to thank Afzal Siddiqui, three anonymous referees and the editor for many helpful comments.

I argue that the result of bringing out the Marshallian antecedents of the General Theory highlights Keynes's failure to achieve the theoretical project he was striving at, namely to demonstrate an involuntary unemployment result in the arising of which nominal wage rigidity would play no role. In the first part of the paper, I reexamine Marshall's theory of value. This section's main conclusion is that no theory of unemployment is to be found in Marshall's writings. In the second part of the paper, I study the literature spanning from Marshall to Keynes, focusing on Beveridge, Hicks and Pigou, in order to see whether the lacuna present in Marshall's writings happened to be filled. Documenting the emergence of the notion of frictional unemployment, I come to the conclusion that its arising went along with little theoretical elaboration. The third and last part of the paper is a critical reflection on the General Theory. I start by making the point that Keynes's theory of effective demand ought to be viewed as an extension of Marshall's analysis of firms' short-period production decisions. This enables me to bring out the decisive role played by the wage rigidity assumption in Keynes's reasoning. I claim that, except for this assumption, the differences between effective demand a la Marshall and effective demand a la Keynes are minor. I close my analysis of Keynes's reasoning by showing that no real removal of the nominal rigidity assumption is to be found in Chapter 19 of the General Theory.","[De Vroey, Michel] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,,michel.devroey@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-14408-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,57,75,,10.1007/978-3-642-14409-7_4,0.0,,,19,Economics; History Of Social Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BVA34,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290894000006,0

We implement a dynamic model in which firms compete for investment and electricity production under imperfect Cournot competition. The main aim of this work is to compare three investment incentive mechanisms: reliability options, forward capacity market and capacity payments. Apart from the oligopoly case, we also analyze collusion and monopoly cases. Dynamic programming is used to deal with the stochastic environment of the market and mixed complementarity problem and variational inequality formulations are employed to find a solution to the game. The main finding of this study is that market-based mechanisms would be the most cost-efficient mechanism for assuring long-term system capacity adequacy. Moreover, generators would exert market power when introducing capacity payments. Finally, compared with a Cournot oligopoly, collusion and monopolistic situations lead to more installed capacities with market-based mechanisms and increase consumers' payments. doi: 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-No4-6","European Univ Inst, Florence Sch Regulat, Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Haikel, KM (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Florence Sch Regulat, Florence, Italy.",haikel.khalfallah@eui.eu,,,,,,,26,11,11,0,22,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2011,32.0,4,,,,,117,157,,10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-No4-6,0.0,,,41,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,824GI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295190000006,0

In those areas, the climate varies substantially. At lower elevations, the climate is tropical to subtropical, suitable for year-round flowering. At higher elevations, especially in the northern parts of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong, the climate generally restricts flowering to the period from July to September. In December and January, cold damage can occur to the leaves. The ecology of some of these species suggests that they possess characteristics which could be of interest to breeders. For example, a newly described species, Musa yunnanensis, is found in cold locations where it withstands sub-zero temperatures, a trait that could be used to breed for tolerance to cold. For other species, the interest may lie in their resistance to diseases. For example, another newly described taxon, Musa acuminata var. chinensis, is closely related to M. acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Calcutta 4', which has been extensively used in breeding because of its resistance to black leaf streak disease. These two newly described taxa have in common monoclinous hermaphroditic female flowers that self-pollinate before the bract opens. Consequently, no hybrid of these two taxa has ever been observed. The author also observed ten species that belong to the Musa section, one to the Callimusa section and four to the Rhodochlamys section, in addition to two species of the genus Ensete and one species of the genus Musella.

However, such publications rarely set out precisely what politics is and how it plays out within specific sites of economic activity, particularly individual industries. In order to show that politics is the cause of both change within industries and difference between them, this article develops an institutionalist framework of analysis which seeks to elucidate the 'thickness' of the relationship between economic and political activities. Politics is first conceptualized in a way that opens up for research the emergence and evolution of the institutions which constrain and make industrial activity possible: behaviour that both discursively and interactively seeks to change or reproduce institutions by mobilizing values. Building upon existing institutionalist approaches in political economy and economic sociology, but also constructivist strands of political science, this definition is then used to set out a research design with which to conduct in-depth empirical study of the 'political work' undertaken within industries that lie behind perpetual processes of institutionalization. This work, and the intermediary concepts developed to study it - problematization and politicization - are illustrated throughout the piece by examples from two industries: automobile distribution and wine.","[Jullien, Bernard; Smith, Andy] Sci Po Bordeaux, SPIRIT, SPIRIT Res Ctr, Pessac, France",,"Jullien, B (通讯作者)，Sci Po Bordeaux, SPIRIT, SPIRIT Res Ctr, Pessac, France.",,,,,,,,65,24,24,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

With additional risks emerging through climate change mitigation mechanisms, the propensity to invest may increasingly depend upon how each technology and company is exposed to carbon price uncertainty We approach this by estimating the cumulative probabilities of investment over time in various technologies as a function of behavioral, policy, financial and market assumptions. Using a multistage stochastic optimization model with exogenous uncertainty in carbon price, we demonstrate that detailed financial analysis with real options and risk constraints can make substantial difference to the investment propensities compared to conventional economic analysis. Further, we show that the effects of different carbon policies and market instruments on these decision propensities depend on the characteristics of the companies and may induce market structure evolution.","[Kettunen, Janne] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Bunn, Derek W.] London Business Sch, London NW1 4SA, England; [Blyth, William] Oxford Energy Associates, Oxford OX33 1EH, England",University of Calgary; University of London; London Business School,"Kettunen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",jskettun@ucalgary.ca; dbunn@london.edu; william.blyth@oxfordenergy.com,"Bunn, Derek W/P-5247-2016","Bunn, Derek/0000-0003-1770-4488","Economic and Social Research Council; DEFRA; BERR, UK","Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); DEFRA(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); BERR, UK","We are grateful to the Economic and Social Research Council, DEFRA and BERR in the UK for support in this research.

As a consequence, this crop can lack resistance to pests and diseases. Numerous disease resistance genes (R-genes) have been characterised in plants, conferring resistance to bacteria, viruses, fungi and nematodes. Identification and cloning of R-genes in Musa will provide new opportunities for genetic improvement. Our group has identified over 50 distinct NBS-LRR-type resistance gene analogs (RGAs) in the resistant wild diploid Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Calcutta 4'. Characterisation is ongoing in M. acuminata cultivars contrasting in resistance to Mycosphaerella leaf spot diseases, focusing on both the NBS-LRR R-gene family and cytoplasmic receptor-like kinases (RLKs) with extracellular LRRs. NBS-LRR class RGA probes applied to 'Calcutta 4', 'Grande Naine' (AAA, Cavendish subgroup), and M. balbisiana 'Pisang Klutuk Wulung' BAC libraries have revealed many putative resistance loci. Sequence data for such selected clones will provide insight into organisation and evolution of this R-gene class in Musa. Candidate gene discovery is also ongoing via analysis of differential gene expression from infected leaf cDNA during Musa-Mycosphaerella interactions. Candidate R-genes will be applicable for banana genetic improvement via both plant transformation and conventional breeding using marker-assisted selection.","[Miller, R. N. G.; Passos, M. A.

This topic is timely in light of a recent policy shift that aims to dramatically expand vocational education. The analysis controls for an unusually rich set of predetermined characteristics, and exploits longitudinal data spanning fourteen years to separately identify cohort and age effects. There are four main findings. First, the estimated wage premium for vocational graduates, relative to general graduates, is greater for women than men. Second, the returns to public vocational school for men have plummeted for the most recent cohort, and male vocational graduates now face a large wage penalty. Third, the generally favorable outcomes of public school graduates can be partly explained by non-random sorting of students with higher test scores and better-educated parents into public schools. Finally, these peer effects appear to be particularly important for students with above-average test scores, as men with high scores earn a surprisingly small premium from graduating from vocational or private general school. These small returns for high-scoring men, as well as the dramatic fall in the earnings premium for all male vocational graduates, raise important concerns about the current expansion of public vocational education and the relevance of the male vocational curriculum in an increasingly service-oriented economy.","[Newhouse, David] World Bank, Social Protect & Labor Unit, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Suryadarma, Daniel] Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",The World Bank; Australian National University,"Newhouse, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Social Protect & Labor Unit, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dnewhouse@worldbank.org; daniel.suryadarma@anu.edu.au,"Suryadarma, Daniel/ABI-3288-2020",,,,,,23,37,46,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the uptake of flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) has been tremendous. Five years after their introduction, FFVs accounted for 90% of new car sales and 30% of the circulating car stock. We provide a stylized model of the sugar/ethanol industry which incorporates substitution by consumers, across ethanol and gasoline at the pump, and substitution by producers, across domestic regional and export markets for ethanol and sugar. We argue that the model stands up well to the empirical co-movement in prices at the pump in a panel of Brazilian states.

It is grown in around 150 countries across the world, with around 128 million tonnes produced annually on an area of 10 million hectares. Asia contributes 55-60% of the global production, and has in the last 6 years recorded a production growth rate of 11%. India, the largest producer of banana in the world, witnessed unprecedented growth during this period, due to improved production technologies, which include adoption of high-yielding clones, high-density planting, integrated management of water, nutrients, pests and diseases, and use of disease-free, in vitro propagated planting material. Similar is the case in other Asian countries, with Chinese Taipei and the Philippines producing mainly for export through contract farming systems and the other Asian countries producing mainly for domestic consumption and trade by small farmers. BAPNET, the regional banana and plantain network for Asia and the Pacific, is fostering collaborative banana research among its 13 member countries and two research institutes. Looking at the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for banana in Asia and the Pacific, it is evident that the region has a rich diversity of Musa which needs exploitation. The main thrust of the network has indeed been collection, conservation, evaluation and utilisation of banana diversity, testing of new hybrids, exchange of germplasm and capacity building. At the same time, biotic and abiotic stresses are many. Biotic problems include viruses, fungal and bacterial diseases and insect pests, while abiotic stresses include drought, salinity and various vagaries of climates. Fusarium wilt is but one example of a devastating disease, with no transboundary restrictions. Race 4 of Fusarium wilt has already spread to China, Chinese Taipei, Malaysia and Australia. In this regard, BAPNET and its member countries are drawing management strategies, including internal and transboundary quarantine, sanitation, early detection, improving soil health, biological control and altered crop production systems. Production of disease-free tissue-culture planting material and diagnostics and the establishment of a certification system in some of the countries have been milestone achievements. International initiatives on genetic resources, management of diseases and insect pests, water productivity and nutrition, post-harvest management and processing remain crucially important to ensure nutritional and livelihood security and enhance the income of smallholders. Efforts of Bioversity International have, through various programmes, improved the understanding of genomics, diversity, biotic and abiotic stresses and augmentation of genetic resources for gene transfer. The horizontal and vertical integration with National Agricultural Research Systems allows to better address the many problems of smallholder banana farmers.","Indian Council Agr Res, Div Hort, New Delhi 110012, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR),"Singh, HP (通讯作者)，Indian Council Agr Res, Div Hort, Krishi Anusandhan Bhawan 2, New Delhi 110012, India.",,,,,,,,1,2,2,0,14,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,495,506,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200071,0

Statism is also pervasive in institutionalism that emphasises the linkages rather than dichotomies between state and market and in the recent discussions on the transformation of the developmental state. This article proposes an alternative conceptual framework by reformulating 'the form critique of the state' pioneered by Evgeny Pashukanis and further developed in the 'German state derivation debate' on the one hand, and 'world system analysis' on the other. Extending the Marxist critique of 'commodity fetishism' to the theorisation of the developmental state, it inquires into the origins of statism and argues that it is the uneven dynamics of capitalism as a global system that give rise to statism in the first place.","Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Song, HY (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London WC1E 7HU, England.",haeyoungsong@hotmail.com,,,,,,,105,11,11,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In-vitro cross reaction tests involving different nit-1 testers of Foc race 1 and race 2 indicated that there was a cross reaction between race 1 and race 2 Foc isolates in many cases. Validation carried out under pot culture conditions also confirmed the cross reaction between the members of Foc race 1 and race 2. For diversity analyses, VCG analyses were carried out using the local nit-M testers. The result showed the presence of nine different VCGs in India. The molecular characterisation of Foc isolates by PCR-RFLP analysis of rDNA-IGS region, using six restriction enzymes grouped the Indian Foc isolates into 13 IGS genotypes.

Their inability to establish in places different from their natural habitats further complicates the use of such wild species for routine molecular research. The present study was therefore undertaken to evaluate seeds as an alternative source of DNA for conservation in comparison with the cigar leaf. Usefulness of seed as a major genetic tool for conservation of seeded wild banana germplasm, standardisation of the stage of seed maturity for DNA extraction and standardisation of the seed DNA extraction protocol were studied. The accessibility of seed DNA as an alternative strategy for leaf DNA was confirmed using molecular markers (RAPD and IRAP). Among different methods of DNA extraction, a modified protocol with cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was found to be the best. Partially mature seeds with 70-80% maturity were found to be the best stage for DNA extraction compared to 40-50% and 100% maturity. Removal of the seed coat improved the quality of DNA extracted. Uniformity of seed and leaf DNA was confirmed by using 80 random primers and 10 IRAP primers. The paper tries to analyse the extent of deviation between seed and leaf DNA and possible reasons in view of the breeding behaviour of wild species.","[Uma, S.; Saraswathi, M.

Yet in shaping the actual integration process, it was France which played the key role. Most of the landmark steps towards the current EU were French proposals to pre-empt Anglophone-German collusion; creating European structures in which a resurgence of Germany (politically and economically) was made subject to permanent negotiation. German unification in 1991 removed the one reason why successive governments of the Federal Republic had gone along with this. Paradoxically, sovereign Germany today finds itself bound by the dense networks of consultation and decision-making which make the EU unique in the field of regional integration. The paper shows that between 1992 and 2005, German capital has moved to the centre of the network of corporate interlocks in the North Atlantic area. This helps to explain why in the post-1991, post-Soviet era of neoliberal, finance-driven globalisation, Germany is increasingly 'speaking for Europe', as its corporations have become nodal points in the communication structures through which the responses to the challenges facing the EU and the West at large are being shaped.","[van der Pijl, Kees; Raviv, Or] Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Holman, Otto] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Sussex; University of Amsterdam,"van der Pijl, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",,"Raviv, Or/L-2353-2013","Raviv, Or/0000-0001-7210-0818",,,,,108,37,38,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

A more frequent service is costly to provide but is valued by riders due to shorter waiting times at stops, and faster operating speeds on less crowding vehicles. Empirical analyses in the 1980s found that service frequencies were too high in most of the cities studied. For a given budget constraint, social welfare could be improved by reducing service frequencies and using the money saved to lower fares. The cross-sectional nature of these analyses meant that researchers were unable to address the question of when the oversupply occurred. This paper seeks to answer that question by conducting a time-series analysis of the bus operations of the Chicago Transit Authority from 1953 to 2005. The paper finds that it has always been the case that too much service frequency was provided at too high a fare. The imbalance between fares and service frequency became larger in the 1970s when the introduction of operating subsidies coincided with an increase in the unit cost of service provision.

To answer this question, we examine the effect of regional trade agreements (RTAs) on imports from non-members and the tariffs that they face. Using data from six RTAs in Latin America and Europe, we do not find evidence that implementation of the regional agreements is associated with trade diversion from third countries to regional members. Using detailed industry data on preference margins and most-favoured nation (MFN) tariffs for three trade agreements in Latin America over 12 years, we find that greater preference margins do not significantly reduce imports from third countries. We also look at the effect of preferences on external tariffs. We find evidence that preferential tariff reduction tends to precede the reduction of external MFN tariffs in a given sector, offering evidence of tariff complementarity. Overall, the results suggest that regionalism does not significantly harm non-members.","World Bank, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Freund, C (通讯作者)，World Bank, Res Dept, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,38,16,17,4,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2010,33.0,11,,,,,1589,1605,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01283.x,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,685GB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284616100009,0

Evaluating the impact of legislation prohibiting hand-held cell phone use while driving. Transportation Research Part A 44, 182-193.), Nikolaev et al. (2010) provide evidences on the effect of hand-held cell phone bans on driving safety. More specifically, they analyze the impact of a state-wide ban on hand-held cell phone use while driving on the number of fatal automobile and personal injury accidents per 100,000 licensed drivers per year and conclude that the ban had a significant negative impact on both the mean fatal accident rate and the mean personal injury accident rate. In this paper I argue that they lack of a good identification strategy that enables them to correctly identify the causal effect of the ban. I also provide evidence that the effect they find is a combination of the ban effect and of unobservable variables not accounted for in their analysis. Finally, I provide a way where one can control for unobservables when estimating the causal effect of the ban and find that indeed that ban appears to have a negative effect on fatal automobile accidents.

The analysis takes into account that participation in higher education is non-compulsory and depends on individual choice. Due to capital-skill complementarity, integration increases (reduces) the incentives to participate in higher education in capital-importing (-exporting) economies, all other things equal. From a national policy point of view, public education expenditure should increase after integration of similar economies in order to attract mobile capital. Using foreign direct investment as a measure of capital flows, we present empirical evidence which largely confirms our main hypothesis: an increase in net capital inflows in response to capital market integration raises participation in higher education. In addition, we show that the adjustment in educational attainment is an empirically relevant channel through which capital inflows foster economic growth.","[Egger, Hartmut] Univ Bayreuth, CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Egger, Hartmut; Egger, Peter] GEP, Nottingham, England; [Egger, Peter] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CEPR, London, England; [Falkinger, Josef] Univ Zurich, CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Falkinger, Josef; Grossmann, Volker] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Grossmann, Volker] Univ Fribourg, CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Bayreuth; Ifo Institut; University of Nottingham; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut,"Egger, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, CESifo, Munich, Germany.",,"Egger, Hartmut/A-7397-2014","Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207; Grossmann, Volker/0000-0001-8917-3503",,,,,28,9,12,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2010,33.0,10,,,,,1241,1268,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01290.x,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,658UY,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000282516100003,0

Our Monte Carlo experiments show that z-tests on utility function coefficients provide more robust results than z-tests on variance covariance parameters. As expected, both the number of observations and the number of random draws in the incorporated Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane (GHK) simulator have on average a positive impact on the conformities between the shares of type I errors and the nominal significance levels. Furthermore, an increase of the number of observations leads to an expected decrease of the shares of type II errors, whereas the number of random draws in the GHK simulator surprisingly has no significant effect in this respect. One main result of our study is that the use of the robust version of the simulated z-test statistics is not systematically more favorable than the use of other versions. However, the application of the z-test statistics that exclusively include the Hessian matrix of the simulated loglikelihood function to estimate the information matrix often leads to substantial computational problems.","[Ziegler, Andreas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ziegler, Andreas] Univ Kassel, Kassel, Germany; [Ziegler, Andreas] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universitat Kassel; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Ziegler, A (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",andziegler@ethz.ch,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The article argues that professional work norms, including working long hours and being ever-available, operate to legitimise the reduction in career development opportunities that accompanies the transition from full to part-time work in professionalised occupations. On one level, therefore, these norms generate mutuality between managers and employees. When combined with demands of motherhood, however, they fundamentally influence how each party interprets their obligations to each other, generating incongruity and, potentially, a breach of the psychological contract. These arguments are illustrated with the use of case study data collected from part-time police officers and their managers in three UK police forces. The theoretical and practical implications of this analysis are developed and discussed.","Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Dick, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",p.dick@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,18,21,0,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The model we introduce is easily estimated by maximum likelihood using the EM algorithm adapted from the work of Bartolucci and Scaccia (Comput Stat Data Anal 48:821-834, 2005). The partially adaptive estimator is applied to data used by Long and Caudill (Rev Econ Stat 73:525-531, 1991) to examine the impact of intercollegiate athletics on income. We estimate a variation of the original regression model and find that there is a considerable financial advantage for those male athletes now working in business management.

Variation in marriage-market shocks arising from incarceration is isolated using two facts: the tendency of people to marry within marriage markets defined by the interaction of race, location, and age and the fact that increases in incarceration have been very different across these three characteristics. Using a variety of estimation strategies, including difference and fixed effects models and TSLS models in which we use policy parameters to instrument for within-marriage market changes in incarceration, we find evidence that is, on the whole, consistent with the implications of the standard marriage-market model. In particular, higher male imprisonment appears to have lowered the likelihood that women marry, modestly reduced the quality of their spouses when they do marry, and shifted the gains from marriage away from women and toward men. The evidence suggests that women in affected markets have increased their schooling and labor supply in response to these changes.","[Charles, Kerwin Kofi] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Charles, Kerwin Kofi] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Luoh, Ming Ching] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; National Taiwan University,"Charles, KK (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,"Luoh, Ming-Ching/H-5241-2011","Luoh, Ming-Ching/0000-0003-4061-6507",,,,,32,92,147,0,24,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Similarly, if sellers are not fully informed about the highest price they could charge, they too suffer by receiving a price lower than had they had full information. This paper develops a hedonic price model that incorporates the effects of incomplete information on both sides of the market and obtains estimates of the discrepancies between market prices and buyers' maximum willingness to pay and sellers' minimum willingness to accept.

(Can J Econ 16:17-25, 1983) frequently assume that countries are identical, and they can sign a single agreement only. We modify the assumption by considering two self-enforcing IEAs and also two types of asymmetric countries. Extending a model of Barrett (Oxford Econ Pap 46:878-894, 1994), we demonstrate that there are similarities between one and two self-enforcing IEAs. But in the case of few countries and high environmental damage we show that two self-enforcing IEA work far better than one self-enforcing IEA in terms of both welfare and environmental quality. Our simulation shows that only if all countries that have fewer benefits and higher cost from pollution abatement must build one coalition, there is hope that two myopic stable coalition can be formed. Moreover, if the cost-benefit functions of pollution abatement impose that the first myopic coalition is formed by countries, which have higher benefits and lower cost from pollution abatement, then two IEA's worsen abatement and welfare in comparison to one IEA. But, if the first myopic coalition is formed by countries, which have smaller benefits and higher cost from pollution abatement, then two IEA's improve abatement and welfare in comparison to one IEA.","[Osmani, Dritan] Univ Hamburg, Res Unit Sustainabil & Global Change, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Osmani, Dritan] Ctr Atmospher Sci, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Osmani, Dritan] Integrated Climate Syst Anal & Predict CliSAP, Hamburg, Germany; [Osmani, Dritan] IMPRS ESM, Hamburg, Germany; [Tol, Richard S.

We examine the effect of variations in conditions of domestic competition in services on trade volumes in goods in the cases of both linear and nonlinear import demand, including standard form CES-based gravity models of bilateral trade flows. Theory suggests a set of linkages between service-sector pricing and goods trade supported by econometrics involving imports of 22 OECD countries vis-a-vis 69 exporters. Competition in distribution services affects the volume of trade in goods. Additionally, because of interaction between tariffs and pricing, the market structure of the domestic service sector becomes increasingly important as tariffs are reduced. Indeed, depending on the degree of competition, market access concessions on tariffs may be effectively undone in some cases by changes in margins. For exporters, we find that service competition in destination markets matters most for exporters from smaller, poorer countries. Our results also suggest that while negotiated agreements leading to cross-border services liberalisation may boost goods trade as well, they may also lead to a fall in goods trade when such liberalisation involves FDI leading to increased service sector concentration.","[Francois, Joseph] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Francois, Joseph; Wooton, Ian] CEPR, London, England; [Wooton, Ian] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Johannes Kepler University Linz; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Strathclyde,"Francois, J (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",,"Francois, Joseph/B-6108-2017","Francois, Joseph/0000-0002-4686-7780; Wooton, Ian/0000-0001-5084-6379",,,,,30,16,16,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2010,33.0,7,,,,,873,893,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01234.x,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,624SY,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279842500002,0

Employment is a well-recognised rehabilitation goal. In this study, we examine the impact of a publicly funded package of services that is designed to enable people with a spinal cord injury to return to the workplace. Specifically, this package of services provided client directed assistance for assisting the recipient with the activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, food preparation, etc.). We combine primary data collection methods well developed in other scientific disciplines, but less frequently utilised within economics, with traditional econometric techniques, to present a novel approach to this methodological issue. The Spinal Injuries Survey Instrument was developed and administered using a matched sampling approach. Collected data included, labour market outcomes, exposure to the packages, as well as clinical and demographic covariates commonly identified by the spinal cord injury literature. Concern for endogeneity was addressed by collecting data on several variables that might serve as suitable instruments for the econometric work and measures of otherwise-unobserved sources of heterogeneity. For example, a psychological measure of attributional style was adapted from the field of psychology in order to control for a potentially confounding source of latent individual heterogeneity, viz. motivation. While our results find zero marginal effect of support packages on labour market outcomes, we find that training undertaken post-injury and age are both positively correlated with labour market participation.

It suffers from significant shortcomings, primarily on account of a very cautious approach adopted to achieve the ultimate objective of 'free trade' within the region. In turn, this has led to a fragmentation of the integration process, with some of the partners of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) bloc opting for a speedier and more liberal bilateral process with India. India's engagement remains the critical feature as the single most important trading partner for almost all the other South Asian countries. However, the dynamics of Indian economic integration initiatives too have been changing rapidly, whereby it is looking increasingly to strengthen its economic relations with the wider Asian region. In this context, the question of India's willingness to give leadership to carry the rest of South Asia as the bridge that connects the region to East Asia needs to be examined. The current evidence suggests that India has attempted to do so via a host of bilateral and regional arrangements, but that the divergences in strategic interests amongst SAARC countries has left Pakistan on the margins of an evolving scheme of overlapping trade initiatives in South Asia. Thus, while something approximating 'free trade' in South Asia appears to be taking shape, it is unlikely to take the form of an inclusive South Asian regional integration process envisaged by SAARC.",,,,,,,,,,,15,7,7,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2010,33.0,7,,,,,916,927,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01246.x,0.0,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,624SY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279842500004,0

Some limited specialisation of labour occurred in the interests of safety, and although newer technology had the potential to deskill the work of miners, these developments were quite dissimilar to the highly specialised work practices that were adopted for large-scale mining in the United States during the same period.","James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia",James Cook University,"Wegner, JH (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",,,,,,,,49,1,1,1,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-8992,,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

Trade union intervention might be expected to help resolve these problems but evidence on their role has been limited. The current research, based on empirical data derived from interviews with union representatives, considers the union role in the retailing and media sectors, examining their definition of and engagement with work-life balance issues and intervention strategies. It locates their approach against current discussions of the national discourse on work-life balance and trade union strategy. Although in both sectors trade union engagement with work-life balance was evident, differences could be traced to the impact of structural variables. In neither case did work-life balance, as defined by respondents, represent a common interest area with employers.","[Rigby, Mike; O'Brien-Smith, Fiona] London S Bank Univ, Ctr Int Business, London SE1 OAA, England",London South Bank University,"Rigby, M (通讯作者)，London S Bank Univ, Ctr Int Business, 103 Borough Rd, London SE1 OAA, England.",rigbymp@lsbu.ac.uk; obrienf2@lsbu.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,41,43,6,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

It argues that formally institutionalized structures for intra-College co-operation provide important arenas for creativity, entrepreneurship and consensus-building.

Testable hypotheses are deduced from the theory of the lending channel, which argues that after a policy-induced drain of funds from the banking sector, some (types of) institutions are unable or unwilling to retain their prior levels of lending. To identify the decisive bank attributes, disaggregated data for the full population of Austrian banks is used for the 1998-2005 period. The average Austrian bank is found to significantly reduce its growth rate of loans after an increase in policy-driven interest rates. Heterogeneous lending reactions appear to be more pronounced for the institutions that are organized in multi-tier sectors. At large, the results are not compatible with the widespread notion that the Austrian banking sector absorbs monetary shocks. The lending channel also seems of aggregate importance as impulses in loan supply are found to significantly affect the growth rate of real GDP.","Univ Linz, Dept Finance, A-4040 Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Burgstaller, J (通讯作者)，Univ Linz, Dept Finance, Freistaedterstr 315, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",Johann.Burgstaller@jku.at,"Burgstaller, Johann/S-4449-2017","Burgstaller, Johann/0000-0002-8753-9468",,,,,40,0,0,0,6,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

In particular, we combine a data set of 116 inventories from Palencia (in northern Spain) between 1750 and 1770 with census information (Catastro de Ensenada) in order to create a cross-section estimate of money demand, a first for any period before the nineteenth century. Results provide meaningful insights about relationships among money demand, wealth, urbanization and structural change in a pre-industrial economy; they also highlight the potential of probate inventories for improving our general understanding of the monetary history of modern Europe.","[Nicolini, Esteban A.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Nicolini, Esteban A.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Figuerola Inst, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Nicolini, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",esteban.nicolini@uc3m.es; fcrampal@upo.es,"Palencia, Fernando Ramos/N-5092-2019; Nicolini, Esteban/H-5528-2015","Palencia, Fernando Ramos/0000-0002-4677-2730; Nicolini, Esteban/0000-0002-2078-6720",,,,,69,7,9,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

A human capital investment model is employed and this provides a framework within which to analyse the interrelated 'decisions' regarding schooling and overeating, taking into account the importance of time preference and the differential effects of adolescent obesity for males and females. We find that: (a) there is a strong and robust positive association between obesity and early school leaving; (b) there is evidence to support the notion that this association is the consequence of a causal relation running from obesity to school leaving; and, (c) there are significant gender differences in the nature of this relationship. These findings have important policy implications. In particular: (i) policies aimed at reducing obesity - such as the encouragement of sporting activity or the encouragement of healthier eating habits at school - may also have other beneficial effects through a reduction in early school leaving rates; and, (ii) the significant differences identified between male and female adolescents suggest that the adoption of some gender-specific policy measures would be useful.

REIT mutual fund returns are typically presented relative to the return on a simple value-weighted REIT index. We ask whether including additional factors when benchmarking funds' returns can improve the explanatory power of the models and offer more precise estimates of alpha. We investigate three sets of REIT-based benchmarks, plus an index of returns derived from non-REIT real estate firms, namely homebuilders and real estate operating companies. The REIT-based factors are a set of characteristic factors, a set of property-type factors and a set of statistical factors. Using traditional single-index benchmarks, we find that about 6% of the REIT funds exhibit significant positive performance using traditional significance levels, which is more than twice what random chance would predict. However, with the multiple-index benchmarks that we prefer, this falls considerably to only 0.7%. In addition, we find that these sets of factors and the non-REIT indices better explain the month-to-month returns of the REIT mutual funds. This suggests that investors or researchers evaluating REIT mutual fund performance may benefit from a multiple-benchmark approach.","[Hartzell, Jay C.; Titman, Sheridan D.] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Muehlhofer, Tobias] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business,"Hartzell, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",Jay.Hartzell@mccombs.utexas.edu; tmuhlhof@indiana.edu; titman@mail.utexas.edu,,,,,,,18,31,35,1,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2010,38.0,1,,,,,121,154,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00253.x,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,557KF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274667300005,0

We contribute with a different perspective by deploying a large-scale macro-econometric hybrid simulation model of the global energy-environment-economy (E3MG) adopting a New Economics approach. We use E3MG to assess the implications of a low-stabilization target of 400ppm CO2 equivalent by 2100, assuming both fiscal instruments and regulation. We assert that if governments adopt more stringent climate targets for rapid and early decarbonization, such actions are likely to induce more investment and increased technological change in favor of low-carbon alternatives. Contrary to the conventional view on the economics of climate change, a transition towards a low-carbon society as modeled with E3MG leads to macroeconomic benefits, especially in conditions of unemployment, with GDP slightly above a reference scenario, depending on use of tax or auction revenues. In addition, more stringent action can lead to higher benefits.","[Barker, Terry; Scrieciu, S.

The aim of the paper is the analysis of the trajectories generated by the iteration of M starting from different initial conditions.

First, we analyze the conditions that allow an agent to reach a favourable position (in terms of its profit) in the long run.

The first kind makes what I term an 'ethical' objection, and holds that utilising market instruments to combat climate change is inherently objectionable. I examine three versions if this 'ethical' argument but find none persuasive. The remainder of the article considers two additional moral considerations, both of which appeal to principles of justice. Drawing on these it argues that emissions trading can be morally defensible but only it it meets these two demanding moral criteria. First, the costs of emissions trading should be shared equitably. The paper examines what this might mean and criticises the leading account of what constitutes a just distribution of emissions Second, emissions trading must make an appropriate contribution to climate mitigation. A number of ways in which current emissions trading schemes signally fail to meet this second criterion are then noted. The article concludes that emissions trading schemes could in principle be morally defensible but only if new schemes are introduced or existing schemes are radically redesigned in line with the principles outlined in the article.","Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Caney, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",simon.caney@magd.ox.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/F037384/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037384/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,79,39,42,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

As a consequence, many studies overstate the prevalence of economists' neoclassical trade theory among businesspeople and politicians, and its intellectual influence on the practice of trade negotiations and policymaking. While economists, politicians, and businesspeople often do support the same (neoliberal) agreements and policies, the worldviews motivating and embodied in their endorsements are consistently different. Economists' formalized neoclassical theory fully endorses international market liberalism, primarily on the basis of expected benefits for consumers, and substantially de-emphasizes conflicts of interest across nations. Businesspeople's and politicians' more informal and practical support for 'free trade' agreements primarily values them for their benefits to producers, and frequently evokes visions of win-lose competition among nations. Empirically, I defend these arguments using qualitative data from a comparative-historical study of the formation of the 1989 Canada-US Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement.","Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Fairbrother, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.",,"Fairbrother, Malcolm/F-9599-2013","Fairbrother, Malcolm/0000-0002-1400-2141",,,,,76,3,3,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This paper explains why sliding scales disappeared after the 1930s, and examines what practical experience with sliding scales revealed about fundamental constraints on wage indexation. Paradoxically, the history of sliding scales confirms that workers' information about product prices and materials costs is generally imperfect, in ways that Would substantially constrain wage indexation in long-term contracts. Sliding scales were not indexed long-term contracts, but rather devices to forestall costly strikes in the absence of contracts by revealing employers' private information about product demand. In the postwar US, unions and employers failed to link wage rates to product prices because they had gained the ability to enter binding contracts, which could achieve the benefits of preventing strikes without incurring the extra negotiation costs and information problems associated with product-price indexation. I present a model to show how sliding scales could forestall strikes by revealing information, and how the introduction of binding union contracts reduced incentives to link wages to product prices.

While feminist IPE explicitly points to the need for empirical studies of the ways in which this global crisis of social reproduction manifests itself in specific contexts, much of the literature remains rather theoretical and at the macro level. This article addresses this gap with a case study of the crisis of social reproduction in rural Mexico, focusing on the transformations of the conditions of social reproduction, gender regimes and the roles of children. The findings of this case study challenge the universal applicability of the '(re-)privatization of social reproduction' thesis. The main argument is that instead of emphasizing the shifts between the public and the private sphere and the retreat of the state from social provisioning, it is essential to reorient our focus towards the changing and context-specific forms of state involvement, and their implications for the transformation of social reproduction conditions, if we are to gain a better understanding of the variety of ways in which the global crisis of social reproduction manifests itself in different locations.","Univ Lausanne, Inst Polit & Int Studies, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Kunz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Inst Polit & Int Studies, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",,,"Kunz, Rahel/0000-0001-9275-9900",,,,,93,25,31,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We've concluded that, to sustain the effect of label strategy, enterprise leaders must establish their philosophy of emotional capital, practice what they preach, be active in discovering and fully acknowledge merits and strengths of employees and arouse their enthusiasm. What's more, label strategy should be taken not only as a means of motivation during SME operation and management, but as an indispensable part of enterprise culture.","[Peng Pinzhi; Zhang Yan] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business, Bengbu, Peoples R China",Anhui University of Finance & Economics,,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,DONGHUA UNIV PRESS,SHANGHAI,"1882 YAN AN WEST RD, SHANGHAI, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-81111-752-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,154,157,,,,,,4,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BVE75,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291325600033,0

These agreements have been viewed either as a response to the costs of increasing interdependence and/or to the demand by domestic exporters to level the playing field when their rivals benefit from preferential trade agreements. A detailed examination of economic data finds no support, however, for the argument that intra-regional economic interdependence in East Asia has increased significantly since the financial crises. Case studies suggest that business has not played a major role in either promoting or opposing the agreements - not surprisingly in that the agreements are unlikely to have a major economic impact, and are not being widely used. Rather than there being an 'economic domino' effect at work, the new East Asian regionalism is best understood as being driven by a 'political domino' effect.","Australian Natl Univ, Dept Int Relat, Res Sch Pacific & Asian Studies, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Ravenhill, J (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Dept Int Relat, Res Sch Pacific & Asian Studies, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Ravenhill, John/AAA-3836-2019",,,,,,94,91,96,4,69,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The Basel process reconceptualised banks as risk navigators and generated a competitive hierarchy within the global banking industry determined on a gauge of this capacity. This private regulatory regime promoted market inflation and rendered institutional liquidity and risk transfer definitive of market power. In turn, a ballooning credit derivatives market broke the limits of financial production and defined state actions in the face of crisis. A shift from a central concern with solvency to that of liquidity thinly masks a profound redistribution of power from the public to the private. By swapping private assets of uncertain value for government bonds, central banks have effectively recognised that the products of innovation in the private sphere are global money. The state is in a curious bind. It takes on limitless exposure to private liabilities while its reform agenda is constrained to calling for greater levels of transparency and tackling the worst excesses.

Most recently in 2008, it is reported a total of 137 natural catastrophes led to overall economic losses of USD258 billion in the world. Moreover, as complexity and costs escalate, neither group - public nor private - can meet the challenge alone. This is particularly true for agricultural industry and rural areas in emerging economies that lack sufficient funds to deal with the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters. Public private partnerships (PPPs), especially those involving reinsurance and capital market solutions, can improve risk management and prepare stakeholders for the consequences of uncertainties. A recent example is the agricultural reinsurance contract signed by the Beijing Municipal Government and Swiss Re. In 2007, Beijing imposed a new agricultural insurance policy for local farmers to promote the development of urban agriculture. Under the new policy, the Beijing municipal and district governments subsidized farmers up to 75% who buy agricultural insurances for certain crops/livestock, and 50% of management costs of the participating insurers are shouldered by governments. The municipal government also set up a protection funds for agro-related natural catastrophe events and regulated the loss ratio of 160% as an attachment point to start up the fund. In this paper, we apply the non-parameter information-diffusion model to stimulate possibility of different loss incurred in Beijing using time-series combined loss ratio data of historical agricultural insurance business. The results show that the current attachment point of protection fund, 160%, will impose additional financial burden to local government comparing to higher or lower points. It proves the necessity for government introducing reinsurance in the system to diversify risks and improve efficiency simultaneously. The paper also outlines the overall framework of Beijing agricultural insurance scheme for each stakeholder including direct insurers and reinsurers.

In this Delphi survey stage, the results of previous patent analysis and patent literature, served as starting point or anchor for experts to consider. The participated experts are required to read the patent analysis results and patent literature first before responding to the Delphi questionnaire. Results: Two principal findings, one negative and one positive, were indicated from Delphi survey. The pessimistic scenario indicates that we still do not have any basis for predicting the availability of a microbicide product with commercial potential and that the current progress in microbicide development is insufficient for forecasting such a product. The optimistic scenario indicates that it may take between 5 and 10 years to produce a promising topical microbicidal agent with sufficient efficacy to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS. Conclusions: Currently, we are not in a position to judge with certainty which scenario will happen and when such scenario will occur. We will continuously monitor and track patents, R&D funds, leading inventors and clinical trials result of new microbicide candidates for discerning more early signals or evidences, which can help us in judging them timely and correctly.","[Zhang Dongmei] Guangdong Pharmaceut Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Guangdong Pharmaceutical University,,,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,2,DONGHUA UNIV PRESS,SHANGHAI,"1882 YAN AN WEST RD, SHANGHAI, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-81111-752-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,251,256,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BVE75,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291325600054,0

This article presents new monthly data on the Bank of France's foreign reserves currency composition between 1928 and 1936, and identifies the motivations behind reserves policy. The Bank of France's aim was to limit the risk of capital loss on its foreign portfolio. The determining factor in its portfolio allocation decisions was the credibility of reserves currencies on the exchange market. Credibility issues explain both the sale of pounds against dollars during 1929 and 1930 and the massive conversion of foreign holdings into gold from 1931 on. However, due to the huge volume of its reserves, the Bank also had to consider the effects of its own actions on the market. Its cooperative attitude towards sterling in the months before British devaluation can be explained through its market position. The Bank of France's portfolio choice was that of a large player in a low-credibility international monetary system.","[Accominotti, Olivier] Sci Po, Paris, France; [Accominotti, Olivier] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Accominotti, O (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Paris, France.",olivier.accominotti@sciences-po.org,,,,,,,50,13,13,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1361-4916,,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

This topic has recently become even more important since the countries are obliged to decrease their agricultural protection due to WTO rules which have an important effect on crop prices. As the global land area for agricultural production remains fixed, it is important to investigate how responsive productivity is to price changes. In this study, price responsiveness of yield is investigated by using balanced panel data from 15 provinces in Turkey. The results from a fixed effects model that controls for unobserved heterogeneity indicate that the relative prices of wheat to barley and wheat to fertilizer are important factors to determine productivity. The coefficients for the price of other crops as well as price of inputs, and average April and May rainfall are also found to be significant determinants of productivity.","[Bor, Ozgur] Atilim Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Atilim University,"Bor, O (通讯作者)，Atilim Univ, Ankara, Turkey.",,"bor, ozgur/AAI-2118-2020; Bor, Ozgur/IAL-9028-2023",,,,,,24,6,6,0,3,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2009,8.0,4,,,,,28,33,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,549ZF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274094000005,0

New archival evidence on the central bank of Austria-Hungary between 1896 and 1913 documents the use of sophisticated instruments such as foreign exchange forward and repo (sale-repurchase) contracts and a quest for market dominance both with respect to reserves held and the share in market turnover. The resulting change in the working of the foreign exchange market is shown to have supported the conduct of monetary policy, underlining the importance of market micro structure in the design and conduct of monetary policy. The picture that emerges is that of a much more 'modern' approach to exchange rate stabilization during the classical gold standard than is traditionally recognized.","Oesterreich Natl Bank, Econ Anal Div, Vienna, Austria",,"Jobst, C (通讯作者)，Oesterreich Natl Bank, Econ Anal Div, Vienna, Austria.",clemens.jobst@oenb.at,"White, Howard D/A-7034-2009","Jobst, Clemens/0000-0001-5858-588X",,,,,67,13,13,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

We argue that technological change has induced weight growth by making home- and market-production more sedentary and by lowering food prices through agricultural innovation. In addition, we illustrate that, while exercise and food intake are complements, reductions in exercise will always raise optimal body weight, as will increases in food intake. We also characterize how body weight varies with income, both within a country, and across countries. Within a country, income may have an inverted U-shaped relationship with body weight, due to the offsetting effects of the demand for food, and the demand for an ideal body weight. This can have important implications for the body weight impacts of public transfer programs. Across countries, however, mean weight is likely to be higher in richer countries. Finally, we present descriptive empirical evidence that illustrates the inverted U-shaped relationship between body weight and income in US males, and suggests the importance of secular trends in weight gain, which are consistent with the impacts of broad-based technological changes.

The article presents detailed estimates of the growth of output and inputs of the shipping industry in the Netherlands between 1500 and 1800. These are used to study the development of productivity in two ways: by comparing output with inputs (labour and capital), and by analysing the relationship between output prices and input prices. Both methods lead to different results, which we explain. It appears that productivity in this sector increased strongly between ca. 1550 and 1620 as a result of technological and institutional changes, such as the increased efficiency of the network of shipping routes. After 1620 labour productivity continued to increase because of factor substitution as wages increased much more than capital costs. The competitiveness of the Dutch shipping sector did not improve any more after ca. 1650, however, which helps to explain why its rapid growth came to an end in the second half of the 17th century.

When Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU) came into existence in 1999, many observers predicted that the euro would soon join America's greenback at the peak of global finance. Achievements, however, have fallen short of aspiration. After an initial spurt of enthusiasm, international use of the euro actually appears now to be levelling off, even stalling, and so far seems confined largely to a limited range of market sectors and regions. The euro has successfully attained a place second only to the greenback - but it remains, and is likely to remain, a quite distant second without a determined effort by EMU authorities to promote their money's global role. The temptation will surely be great. In practical terms, it is difficult to imagine that EMU authorities will refrain entirely from trying to promote a greater role for the euro. But that, in turn, could turn out to be a recipe for discord with the United States, which has never made any secret of its commitment to preserving the greenback's worldwide dominance. A struggle for monetary leadership could become a source of sustained tensions in US-European relations. Fortunately, however, there seems relatively little risk of a destabilizing escalation into outright geopolitical conflict.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Cohen, BJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",bjcohen@polsci.ucsb.edu,,,,,,,39,18,22,1,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

S. in voting in the UN General Assembly. I analyze a dataset of UN General Assembly voting behavior of 21 OECD countries over the 1984-2005 period employing two alternative indices of government ideology. The results suggest that government ideology has had a strong influence on voting alignment with the U. S.: leftwing governments were less sympathetic to US positions. The ideology-induced effect was stronger when the US President was a Republican. This finding contrasts with the declining electoral cohesion in OECD countries. The distinctly different alignments of leftist and rightwing governments with the U. S. reflect deeper sources of ideological association than would be predicted if the issues were solely those of economic policy on a left-right spectrum.,"Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Potrafke, N (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 138, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",niklas.potrafke@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,73,58,65,0,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Moreover, in the framework of the total food consumption model, the fresh vegetables demand is also analyzed through its economic relationships with cereals and meat, which represent the traditional and transition consumption model respectively. Results show a constant increase for the consumption of fresh vegetables in spite of its increasingly budgetary coefficient particularly in urban areas, characterized by more diversified consumption of fresh vegetables. Potatoes remain the most consumed products but they are considered a luxury commodity in rural areas, differently from other vegetables that are primary goods. The substitution relationships between potato and cereals and between potato and white meats are confirmed, whatever the location. The complementarities between potatoes and red meats appeared in rural area and their substitution in urban area. The traditional consumption model based on cereals is in transition towards a model richer in potatoes. The rural area seems to better preserve good food practices whereas the urban area is more vulnerable to food changes and could constitute a nutritional risk location.","[Khaldi, Raoudha; Dhehibi, Boubaker; Rached, Zouhair; Dharaief, Mohamed Zied] Inst Natl Rech Agron Tunisie, Lab Econ Rurale, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage,"Khaldi, R (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Rech Agron Tunisie, Lab Econ Rurale, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,"Dhehibi, Boubaker/0000-0003-3854-6669",,,,,34,3,3,0,4,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2009,8.0,2,,,,,14,22,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,470GF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267962500003,0

The analysis focuses primarily on the market's two main business districts (the Central Business District and the La DEfense District). We find that spatial and temporal dependence effects are strongly present in these submarkets. Additionally, we propose a hybrid method for incorporating a temporal regime switch into the spatiotemporal autoregressive model. The regime switching around 1997 (i.e., in the presence of temporal heterogeneity) substantially affects the significance of spatial and temporal dependences. Finally, we build a new price index that incorporates both spatiotemporal dependences and temporal heterogeneity.

The use of actual scheduling process data allows for a potentially more realistic model in terms of how the travel episodes are actually derived. Since these types of models are simulations of the scheduling process, scheduling conflicts naturally arise in the creation of the final schedule. The handling of these scheduling conflicts is a critical component of all rule-based activity models. Many of these models rely on the concept of priority of the activities to resolve conflicts. However, recent research has shown that this is often not how conflicts are actually resolved. In order to more accurately model actual conflict resolution behavior, scheduling process data was used to estimate conflict resolution rules using decision trees. The use of a conflict resolution model allows the strategy chosen to depend on the attributes of the individual and the conflicting activities, rather than assuming a prior definition of precedence based on the activity types. The conflict resolution decision showed reasonable ability to predict the resolution strategy chosen in actual scheduling process survey data, and represents an important advance in developing a functional computational process model of activity scheduling.

Based on this separation, we investigate if there are differences in agent behaviour under uncertainty over gain amounts vis-a-vis uncertainty over loss amounts. On an aggregate level, we find that (i) subjects are risk averse over gains and risk seeking over losses, displaying a reflection effect and (ii) they are ambiguity neutral over gains and are mildly ambiguity seeking over losses. Further analysis shows that on an individual level, and with respect to both risky and ambiguous prospects, there is limited incidence of a reflection effect where subjects are risk/ambiguity averse (seeking) in gains and seeking (averse) in losses, though this incidence is higher for ambiguous prospects. A very high proportion of such cases of reflection exhibit risk (ambiguity) aversion in gains and risk (ambiguity) seeking in losses, with the reverse effect being significantly present in the case of risk but almost absent in case of ambiguity. Our results suggest that reflection across gains and losses is not a stable individual characteristic, but depends upon whether the form of uncertainty is precise or ambiguous, since we rarely find an individual who exhibits reflection in both risky and ambiguous prospects. We also find that correlations between attitudes towards risk and ambiguity were domain dependent.","[Chakravarty, Sujoy] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, New Delhi 110016, India; [Roy, Jaideep] Brunel Univ, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; Brunel University,"Roy, J (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",sujoy@hss.iitd.ac.in; jaideep.roy@brunel.ac.uk,"Roy, Jaideep/HZJ-7846-2023","Chakravarty, Sujoy/0000-0002-1321-4222",,,,,31,63,67,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2009,66.0,3,,,,,199,228,,10.1007/s11238-008-9112-4,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,402BZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262990500001,0

It thus provides a complete picture of a capital market comparable in size to the combined corporate bond and commercial paper market in Germany. The quantitative analysis reveals that Lander follow different issuing strategies: while some concentrate to a greater extent on large issues or issue joint bonds with other Lander (jumbos), others rely more on comparatively small but frequent issues. Moreover, some Lander issue a significant volume-share of their bonds in foreign currencies. Suitable bonds are used to compute time series of yields for the respective Lander at a daily frequency as well as a liquidity measure. Based on the unique data set, we document that spreads of Lander yields to the Bund are driven to a great extent by general risk aversion. Public debt only has an economically marginal impact. Moreover, the recent refusal of the Federal Constitutional Court to grant additional federal funds to the city-state of Berlin did not change the risk assessment of German Lander by financial markets.

In our earlier work, we found that FDI is beneficial for growth only if the host country has well-developed financial institutions. In this paper, we investigate whether this effect operates through factor accumulation and/or improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Factor accumulation - physical and human capital - does not seem to be the main channel through which countries benefit from FDI. Instead, we find that countries with well-developed financial markets gain significantly from FDI via TFP improvements. These results are consistent with the recent findings in the growth literature that shows the important role of TFP over factors in explaining cross-country income differences.","[Alfaro, Laura] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Alfaro, Laura; Kalemli-Ozcan, Sebnem] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kalemli-Ozcan, Sebnem] Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Sayek, Selin] Bilkent Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Houston System; University of Houston; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Alfaro, L (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Sayek, Selin/K-1294-2012",,,,,,59,144,162,2,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2009,32.0,1,,,,,111,135,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01159.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,400XD,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262901800006,0

The data also identify some interesting (and somewhat systematic) pricing patterns that have not been identified in previous studies, and which would likely be overlooked with less complete data.

We find that foreign affiliates of US multinationals carry their parent firms' technology with them in producing abroad. That is, affiliates of capital-intensive parents produce in a relatively capital-intensive manner wherever they are located. Despite these resemblances to their parents, affiliates produce in a more labour-intensive manner where labour is cheaper and also where the scale of production is small. We found no evidence that more labour-intensive firms selected production locations where labour was cheaper. Labour costs dominated the methods of production but not its location. Affiliates that export are more responsive in their factor proportions to the labour costs where they produced than affiliates selling only in their host countries. The probability that an affiliate would export, however, did not seem to be much affected by factor proportions. It was much more closely related to the scale of the affiliate's operations; larger affiliates were more likely to be exporters.","[Borga, Maria] CUNY, US Bur Econ Anal, New York, NY USA; [Lipsey, Robert E.] CUNY, Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Borga, M (通讯作者)，CUNY, US Bur Econ Anal, New York, NY USA.",,,,,,,,13,3,4,1,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2009,32.0,1,,,,,30,48,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01156.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,400XD,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262901800003,0

The focus here is on how far the EU's political conditionality has contributed to democratic consolidation using an in-depth case study of post-Soviet Latvia. The record of the impacts of conditionality up to EU entry is examined and then attention turns to whether post-accession tendencies have demonstrated any significant changes after the end of Brussels' monitoring. Using a comparative framework, this article shows that the outcome after four years of EU membership is mixed with both positive and negative results. It is concluded that there is no automatic locking-in effect of European integration; and that conditionality assists democratic consolidation more in structural than in attitudinal or behavioural terms.","Univ Bristol, Dept Polit, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Pridham, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Polit, 10 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.",g.pridham@bristol.ac.uk,,,,,,,48,5,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2009,61.0,1,,,,,51,84,PII 908447315,10.1080/09668130802532928,0.0,,,34,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,403NS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263089900003,0

The expansion occurred in several areas, but especially within economics, indicating that heights are now widely accepted as useful measure of human welfare. Much of this new work extends beyond the traditional bailiwick of anthropometric history, including biological welfare during economic and political crises; anthropometric determinants of wages; the welfare of women relative to men in the contemporary world; the fetal origins hypothesis; and inequality in the developing world. The approach has also expanded within economic history to consider the consequences of empire for colonials; the health of populations lacking traditional measures of social performance; the consequences of smallpox; and very long-term trends in health. Much has also been learned about socioeconomic aspects of inequality, the welfare implications of industrialization, and socioeconomic determinants of stature. The last is a work in progress and one may doubt whether sufficient longitudinal evidence will become available for a complete understanding of the variety and strength of pathways that affect human physical growth.

A finite number of scenarios (decision alternatives) is analyzed. The simulation is used for generating distributional evaluations of alternatives with respect to attributes. It is supposed that the decision maker (DM) uses multiple attributes to evaluate alternatives under consideration and tries to find a solution preferred to all other solutions (most preferred solution). To solve a multiattribute problem, one have to assess information about DM's preferences. Three general approaches to solving multicriteria problems can be considered: prior articulation of preferences, interactive articulation of preferences and posterior articulation of preferences. In the paper we use the second approach and assume that the preference information is obtained in a stepwise manner. The technique proposed in the paper uses the information about trade-offs among attributes. In each iteration a candidate alternative is proposed to the DM. If he/she is satisfied with the proposal, the procedure ends. Otherwise, the DM is asked to specify a criterion to be improved and a lexicographic order of criteria that can be decreased starting from the one, that can be decreased first. Relations between distributions of trade-offs is exploited to generate a new proposal. The procedure continues until the decision maker is satisfied with the proposition. An application in the production process control problem is presented to illustrate the technique.","[Trzaskalik, Tadeusz; Nowak, Maciej] Karol Adamiecki Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Operat Res, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,,ttrzaska@ae.katowice.pl; nomac@ae.katowice.pl; pfiala@vse.cz,"Fiala, Petr/K-6823-2015",,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,323,328,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900059,0

The history of economics from interwar pluralism to postwar neoclassicism should sound warning bells about IPE following this path. Neoclassical economics has built-in biases in favor of self-adjusting systems and American hegemony; and biases against attention to inequalities of income and power, and against states' retaining power to shape internal arrangements within frontier controls.

This strategy is important for saving resources, protecting the environment, and ensuring a secure supply of energy. However, energy conservation often involves large amounts of investment and may also have dampening impacts on some local and regional economies. Moreover, energy conservation has many features of a public good. Therefore, government policy will have to play a strong role to foster local efforts and interregional cooperation on this issue. This paper analyzes a promising policy instrument - an interregional energy conservation-quota trading system. An operational model is developed to simulate the workings of this policy instrument for a variety of quota allocations among regions. The results indicate that a tradable quota system can help China achieve its conservation target in a cost-effective way and in accordance with its regional development strategy.","[Wei, Dan; Rose, Adam] Univ So Calif, Sch Policy Planning & Dev, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Wei, D (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Sch Policy Planning & Dev, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",danwei@usc.edu; adamzros@sppd.usc.edu,,"Rose, Adam/0000-0003-3347-7684; Wei, Dan/0000-0003-0738-2286","Research Associate, School of Policy, Planning and Development, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089","Research Associate, School of Policy, Planning and Development, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089","The authors are, respectively, Post-Doctoral Research Associate, School of Policy, Planning and Development, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089; and Research Professor, School of Policy, Planning and Development, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089.

Applying stochastic frontier techniques, we decompose output growth into factor accumulation and TFP growth for the period 1998-2003. TFP growth is further decomposed into technological change, efficiency change and scale effects. Two key results emerge from the analysis. After confirming that both input accumulation and TFP growth are important in explaining output growth, we show that efficiency change (technological catch-up) is the most significant component of TFP growth in explaining output growth distribution. Furthermore, using a specific model of the asymmetric error component, we find that R&D spillovers, banking efficiency and public infrastructures have statistically significant and economically relevant effects on technological catch-up.","[Mastromarco, Camilla] Univ Salento Lecce, Ctr ECOTEKNE, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Matemat Stat, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Aiello, Francesco] Univ Calabria, Dipartimento Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Salento; University of Calabria,"Mastromarco, C (通讯作者)，Univ Salento Lecce, Ctr ECOTEKNE, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Matemat Stat, Via Monteroni, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",f.aiello@unical.it; camilla.mastromarco@unisalento.it; angelo.zago@univr.it,"Aiello, Francesco/J-1252-2014; Mastromarco, Camilla/N-4749-2015","Aiello, Francesco/0000-0001-7533-4927; Mastromarco, Camilla/0000-0003-4094-6549",,,,,79,5,6,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The authors first apply an expenditure-based segmentation technique to data collected during the event to separate respondents according to socio-demographic variables. Second, a Tobit analysis is applied to obtain an expenditure model that is useful in explaining the different determinants of trip expenditures by spectators of the event. The results reveal significant socio-demographic differences between the four expenditure groups. For instance, heavy spenders are composed mainly of mature tourists, arriving for the first time in medium-sized groups. Also, the most important factors in total expenditure are income level, the geographical origin of the spectator and the size of the travel group.","[Barquet, Andrea; Brida, Juan Gabriel; Osti, Linda; Schubert, Stefan] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, Sch Econ & Management, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Schubert, S (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, Sch Econ & Management, Piazza Univ 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",andreasuraya.barquetfassio@unibz.it; juangabriel.brida@unibz.it; linda.osti@unibz.it; stefanfranz.schubert@unibz.it,"Osti, Linda/B-5797-2013; Brida, Juan Gabriel/H-3727-2015","Brida, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-2319-5790",,,,,72,45,47,1,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

By examining the tax characteristics of dividends, I am able to accurately measure the discretionary component of a REIT's dividend. This methodology provides new insights into our understanding of REIT dividend payout policy. Unlike previous studies that find limited explanations for discretionary dividend payouts, I find a systematic explanation. Discretionary dividends tend to be large on average making up between 18% and 35% of a REIT's total dividend and display considerable variation through time and across firms. The main determinant of these discretionary dividends appears to be dividend smoothing. There is an inverse relationship between discretionary and nondiscretionary dividends. Even if a REIT has excess cash flow it could distribute in discretionary dividends, it will tend not to do so if it has a high dividend payout due to its nondiscretionary dividends. In this sense, REITs appear to use discretionary dividends to smooth their payout ratios.","NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Boudry, WI (通讯作者)，NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",wboudry@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,27,24,26,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2011,39.0,4,,,,,601,634,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2011.00305.x,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,854MT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297499500001,0

But as a good structure estimation procedure in first-price sealed-bid auctions, the traditional PPMLE (Piecewise Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood Estimation) approach is only applicable to the risk neutrality case. This study generalizes this approach to the risk aversion case, and obtains a simple estimation procedure for the Pareto family of private costs. In the procedure, the estimation order of distribution parameters of private costs is not important, which is different from the traditional PPMLE method. Though there is no unique estimator for theta (1) and gamma, some guidance is given for real-world applications on the basis of our Monte Carlo simulation experiments. What's more, this procedure can be reduced further, if one is only interested in estimating the private costs. Extensive simulation experimental results indicate that our approach outperforms or matches at least the traditional one in the case of risk neutrality, and is applicable to the risk aversion case.","[An, Xin; Liu, Shulin] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Econ & Trade, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Xu, Shuo] Inst Sci & Tech Informat China, Informat Tech Supporting Ctr, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"An, X (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Econ & Trade, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",anxin927@gmail.com; slliu@uibe.edu.cn; xush@istic.ac.cn,,,Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of People's Republic of China [200159]; Foundation for the Author of Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of UIBE [73600002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [70571014],Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of People's Republic of China(Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China); Foundation for the Author of Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of UIBE; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank the financial support from A Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of People's Republic of China (200159), A Foundation for the Author of Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of UIBE (73600002), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (70571014).

On the Legality and Desirability of Border Tax Adjustments from a Trade Perspective,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper asks two questions concerning border tax adjustments (BTAs) for climate purposes, when viewed from a trade perspective: First, under what conditions are BTAs possible in the WTO-world? To address this issue, the paper provides a detailed discussion of the relevant law and case law. We also apply our main conclusions on what we consider to be paradigmatic cases of measures to address climate change where trade concerns are raised. We conclude that the WTO regime is no major obstacle to those aspiring to use BTAs, although the allocation of the burden of proof could be an issue. The second issue addressed is whether the economic literature on the desirability of BTAs adequately reflects concerns that have been raised in the trade policy community. Here, we conclude that it has hardly addressed these concerns at all. We also point to some aspects of BTAs that would be important to take into account in a more complete analysis.","[Horn, Henrik] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Horn, Henrik; Mavroidis, Petros C.] CEPR, London, England; [Mavroidis, Petros C.] Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY USA; [Mavroidis, Petros C.] Univ Neuchatel, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Columbia University; University of Neuchatel,"Horn, H (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,,,18,35,37,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2011,34.0,11,,,SI,,1911,1937,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01423.x,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,864SE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298259500005,0

The algorithm allows for very general situations where the distribution of the inefficiencies in the input-output space may be heterogeneous. Computational efficiency and tractability are achieved by avoiding the complex double-smoothing procedure in the algorithm proposed by Kneip et al. (Econometric Theory 24:1663-1697, 2008). In particular, we avoid technical difficulties in the earlier algorithm associated with smoothed estimates of a density with unknown, nonlinear, multivariate bounded support requiring complicated reflection methods. The new procedure described here is relatively simple and easy to implement: for particular values of a pair of smoothing parameters, the computational complexity is the same as the (inconsistent) naive bootstrap. The resulting computational speed allows the bootstrap to be iterated in order to optimize the smoothing parameters. From a practical viewpoint, only standard packages for computing DEA efficiency estimates, i.e., solving linear problems, are required for implementation. The performance of the method in finite samples is illustrated through some simulated examples.","[Kneip, Alois] Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Simar, Leopold] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Kneip, Alois] Univ Bonn, Stat Abt, Inst Gessellschafts & Wirtschaftswissensch, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Clemson University; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Bonn,"Wilson, PW (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, 222 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",kneip@uni-bonn.de; simar@stat.ucl.ac.be; pww@clemson.edu,,"Wilson, Paul W/0000-0002-9865-033X",Belgian Government [P6/03],Belgian Government,"Financial support from the Interuniversity Attraction Pole, Phase VI (No. P6/03) from the Belgian Government (Belgian Science Policy) is gratefully acknowledged.

Previous empirical research on this question has not found much of an impact of assemblies on aggregate outcomes such as local public expenditures or taxation. Nevertheless, the specific role of organized insiders may be important to understand how cities and towns governed by citizens' assemblies work. Existing surveys point to local workers as an important pressure group in local assemblies. Using data from local governments in New England I find that municipalities governed by assemblies pay around 4% to 10% higher salaries to their employees. This wage premium is bigger in assemblies with lower attendance, and increasing with the employees' voting power. I prove my results robust to the inclusion of an exogenous representative-government comparison group: municipalities in New York State that lie within 40 miles of the border with New England. The results demonstrate how insider groups derive some advantages from an assembly form of government. More broadly, the potential capture of assemblies by insider groups can be an important risk faced by municipalities with low citizen participation, which provides a rationale for the widespread adoption of representative government at the local level.

Tourist characteristics and trip-related variables are used to identify the determinants of tourist expenditures. In addition, tourist motivations in choosing the destination were selected as explanatory variables. The results show that, as well as tourist and trip-related characteristics, some tourist motivations are also useful in describing expenditure-based segments.

Federal and State highway improvement programs have been established to stimulate economic development for these populations. While this issue has long been recognized as part of Ej initiatives, no quantitative comparisons of highway construction impacts on protected populations have been reported in the literature. This paper presents a dynamic modeling approach to investigate impacts to protected and low-Income populations in highway planning using an integrated Geographic Information System (GIS) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) optimization framework. Using census and county level parcel data, the model integrates various socioeconomic factors into a GIS while generating highway alignments using GAs. Examples using county level census data from North Carolina are demonstrated to test the sensitivity of generated highway alignments with constrained distances from protected populations. The results indicate that it is important to consider local social and economic effects, in addition to regional planning objectives when measuring the effectiveness of feasibility studies associated with highway construction. Within the proposed modeling framework attention is directed on various EJ initiatives, such as environmental health and safety laws in minority and low-income areas. The model would help planners, designers, and policy-makers understand the intricate interrelationships among local communities, while facilitating more scientific and economically equitable planning for highway construction projects.

Based on Moran's I statistic, the empirical size and power of bootstrap and asymptotic tests for spatial dependence are evaluated and compared. Under classical normality assumption of the model, the performance of the spatial bootstrap test is equivalent to that of the asymptotic test in terms of size and power. For more realistic heterogeneous non-normal distributional models, the applicability of asymptotic normal tests is questionable. Instead, spatial bootstrap tests have shown superiority in smaller size distortion and higher power when compared to asymptotic counterparts, especially for cases with a small sample and dense spatial contiguity. Our Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the spatial bootstrap test is an effective alternative to the theoretical asymptotic approach when the classical distributional assumption is violated.","[Lin, Kuan-Pin] Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Long, Zhi-He; Ou, Bianling] S China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Commerce, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China",Portland State University; South China University of Technology,"Lin, KP (通讯作者)，Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97207 USA.",link@pdx.edu; l-zh720@163.com; oubianling@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [70871041],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This paper was presented at the Second World Conference of Spatial Econometrics Association that took place from November 17-19, 2008 in New York City.

We conclude that the evidence supports the hypothesis that in the period of the 1970s-1980s financial development, measured by liquid assets of the financial system as a share of GDP or by money and quasi money as a percentage of GDP, leads to the reduction of moderate poverty. These results do not appear for the period of the 1980s-1990s or when financial development is measured by the ratio of the value of credits granted by financial intermediaries to the private sector to GDP, whereas they seem to be strengthened by using summary measures of financial development.

Its generalized use can lead to excessive enlargements of the payment periods and can consequently deteriorate the profitability of firms. Despite the relevance of this problem, empirical research works are just a few. This work intends to fill this gap and to shed light on the factors related to the extension of trade credit. In the theoretical and empirical literature, different motives have been proposed to explain this issue: a mechanism to reduce transaction costs, a financial alternative to the bank system and an additional tool to improve commercial activities. To contrast these ideas a panel of 388 firms of the Spanish agrofood industry has been taken, and static and dynamic regression models have been estimated by using robust methods to heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation and endogeneity of the explanatory variables. The results confirm that trade credit receivable is associated with more active firms and with cheaper bank financing. Other factors with positive relationships are short-term bank debts and accounts payable. These findings are consistent with commercial motives, rather than a pure financial view, in the sense that financial distressed producers extend trade credit as a way of promoting their products and in turn increasing their sales.","Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Alarcón, S (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ, Madrid, Spain.",,"ALARCON LORENZO, SILVERIO/H-6828-2015; Alarcón, Silverio/AAA-3166-2019","ALARCON LORENZO, SILVERIO/0000-0001-5823-4238; Alarcón, Silverio/0000-0001-5823-4238",,,,,23,7,7,1,11,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2011,10.0,2,,,,,51,57,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,793WJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292854300007,0

This article explores whether a capabilities approach, as originally developed in the work of Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, offers a potential framework for new thinking. It is argued that the capabilities approach is best thought of not as offering a detailed road map for policy, but as providing a critically different conceptualization of the purpose and principles of public policy. In seeking an alternative to neo-liberal hegemony a capabilities approach therefore can provide a framework for new thinking, and an underpinning ideological narrative from which policy development can flow.","Univ Warwick, Inst Employment Res, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Orton, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Inst Employment Res, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",Michael.Orton@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,49,56,2,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

However, the proof of the empirical practicability and robustness of the Boone-Indicator is missing. To fill this gap, we use a rich, newly built, data set for German manufacturing enterprises and test its empirical validity using cartel cases. Since all of the identified cartels significantly restricted market competition, we expect fiercer competition after the uncovering. We asses the validity of the indicators by comparing the indicated competition levels before and after the cartels were uncovered and stopped. The Boone-Indicator is calculated as RPDs and as a beta coefficient of a log-log regression. The Lerner-Index is used as a benchmark. Our analysis finds that the Boone-Indicator, based on a simple regression approach, fails to correctly indicate competition. Since the Boone-Indicator, based on pure RPDs, proves to be inapplicable, we propose an augmented indicator based on size-adjusted RPDs, which performs better. However, our findings suggest that, given the information typically available in census data, the Lerner-Index is still the only measure that correctly indicates competitive changes.","[Schiersch, Alexander; Schmidt-Ehmcke, Jens] German Inst Econ Res, Dept Innovat, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Schiersch, A (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res, Dept Innovat, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",aschiersch@diw.de; jschmidtehmcke@diw.de,,,,,,,41,1,1,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We focus on one of the context dependence properties, opportunity dependence because of being affected by anticipated regret, where the consequentialist choice framework is maintained. There are two sources of potential inconsistency: one is arrival of information, and the other is changing opportunities. First, we go over the general method of resolution of potential inconsistency, by taking any kinds of inconsistency as given constraints. Second, we characterize a class of choice dispositions that are consistent to information arrival, but may be inconsistent to changing opportunities. Finally, we consider the overall requirement of dynamic consistency and show that it necessarily implies each of consistency to information arrival and independence of choice opportunities. The last result states that the two kinds of potential inconsistency cannot compensate each other to recover dynamic consistency overall.","Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Hayashi, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",th925@eco.utexas.edu,,,,,,,47,11,15,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2011,70.0,4,,,,,399,430,,10.1007/s11238-009-9175-x,0.0,,,32,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,723MO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287510900001,0

In case there is more than one equilibrium for the non-cooperative case, the toolbox determines all solutions that can be implemented as a feedback strategy. Alternatively, the toolbox can apply a number of choice methods in order to discriminate between multiple equilibria. The user can predefine a set of coalition structures for which they would like to calculate the non-cooperative Nash solution(s). It is also possible to specify the relative importance of each player in any coalition structure. Furthermore, the toolbox offers plotting facilities as well as other options to analyse the outcome of the game. For instance, it is possible to disaggregate each player's total loss into its contributing elements.

Iceland offers an exceptional opportunity to examine this hypothesis, given that it scores relatively well on an index of gender equality comprising economic, political, educational, labor-market, and health-based criteria. Equipped with an advanced level of educational attainment, on average, women are well represented in Iceland's labor force. When it comes to women's presence in the political sphere, Iceland is out of the ordinary as well: that Icelanders were the first in the world to elect a woman to be president may suggest a relatively gender-blind assessment in the labor market. In the current study, survey data collected by Gallup Iceland in 2002 are used to examine the relationship between weight and employment within this political and social setting. Point estimates indicate that, despite apparently lesser gender discrimination in Iceland than elsewhere, the bias against excess weight and obesity remains gender-based, showing a slightly negative relationship between weight and the employment rate of women, whereas a slightly positive relationship was found for men.

Scholarship from a variety of different disciplinary perspectives has been conducted on this topic using the analytical approaches of new institutionalism, including studies made of the interrelations between formal European Union (EU) institutional rules and procedures and informal norms and beliefs on individual actor behaviour. Yet using new institutionalism to examine Europeanization's interconnections with and effects upon the EU's distinctive model of internationalization is not without problems, as recent analyses confirm. Drawing on recent critiques of March and Olsen's logics of appropriateness and consequentiality that together provide the foundations of the new institutionalism, this article examines how political elites mediate Europeanization through their EU decision-making and decision-taking. Using interviews with United Kingdom (UK) negotiators centrally involved in EU trade, agriculture, environment and foreign policy, their personal 'lived' experiences of Europeanization are gauged. This empirical analysis shows that current understandings of March and Olsen's two logics do not adequately capture the juxtaposition of different behavioural reasoning and stances adopted by UK policy elites negotiating in the EU. In turn, the alleged transformative nature of Europeanization is questioned.","[Clark, Julian] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Jones, Alun] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University of Birmingham; University College Dublin,"Clark, J (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",j.r.a.clark@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,11,11,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

A surge in property tax limitation legislation occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and its effects on government revenue, school financing and educational quality have been studied extensively. However, there is surprisingly little literature on how property tax limits affect housing markets. For the first time, we examine the impacts of property tax limitations on housing growth, in addition to their impacts on housing prices. Using state-level data over 23 years, we find that property tax limits increase housing prices (indexes) by approximately 2%.

We find that Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) led to substantial convergence in euro-area sovereign bond markets in terms of interest rate levels, unconditional daily fluctuations, and conditional responses to major macroeconomic announcements. Our findings also suggest a substantial increase in the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations since EMU, particularly for Italy and Spain.

The medium was supplied to the explants for 20 min twice a day. The addition of 30 g/L sucrose into the proliferation medium maintained at pH 5.7 could induce 6-7 shoots from each half-shoot explant after 5 weeks of culture in the presence of light with intensity of 2000-2500 Lux.

Consequently, unlike standard energy demand econometric estimation, the energy efficiency of each country is also modeled and it is argued that this represents a measure of the underlying efficiency for each country over time, as well as the relative efficiency across the 29 OECD countries. This shows that energy intensity is not necessarily a good indicator of energy efficiency, whereas by controlling for a range of economic and other factors, the measure of energy efficiency obtained via this approach is. This is, as far as is known, the first attempt to econometrically model OECD energy demand and efficiency in this way and it is arguably particularly relevant in a world dominated by environmental concerns with the subsequent need to conserve energy and/or use it as efficiently as possible. Moreover, the results show that although for a number of countries the change in energy intensity over time might give a reasonable indication of efficiency improvements; this is not always the case. Therefore, unless this analysis is undertaken, it is not possible to know whether the energy intensity of a country is a good proxy for energy efficiency or not. Hence, it is argued that this analysis should be undertaken to avoid potentially misleading advice to policy makers.","[Filippini, Massimo] Univ Lugano, Ctr Energy Policy & Econ CEPE, ETH Zurich, Dept Econ, Lugano, Switzerland; [Hunt, Lester C.] Univ Surrey, Surrey Energy Econ Ctr SEEC, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England; [Hunt, Lester C.] Univ Surrey, Res Grp Lifestyles Values & Environm RESOLVE, Dept Econ, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of Surrey; University of Surrey,"Filippini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lugano, Ctr Energy Policy & Econ CEPE, ETH Zurich, Dept Econ, Lugano, Switzerland.",massimo.filippini@usi.ch,"Filippini, Massimo/K-8155-2013","Filippini, Massimo/0000-0002-5972-4439",,,,,24,182,189,1,53,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2011,32.0,2,,,,,59,80,,,,,,22,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,742EF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288922900003,0

Despite being considered so serious a violation to deserve a per se condemnation, predatory behaviour has never been easy to identify in real markets because pricing at a very low level is normally welfare-enhancing. For most of the twentieth century, the violation has been severely enforced by U.S. courts, though on the basis of a legal argument devoid of solid foundations in theoretical economics. The paper examines the critiques against this argument made by Chicago scholars, the literature stemming from these critiques, and the motivations behind the U-turn in enforcement triggered by the influential contribution by Areeda and Turner (1975).

Trade in the forward and spot markets is represented by a two-stage game, and its subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) is characterized. It is verified that increased forward sales of a producer constitute a credible commitment to aggressive spot market bidding. The paper identifies market situations when this pro-competitive commitment is unilaterally profitable for the producer It is also proven that a producer has incentives to sell in the forward market in order to reduce competitors' forward sales, which softens their spot market offers.","Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Holmberg, P (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",Par.Holmberg@ifn.se,,"Holmberg, Par/0000-0001-7535-7264",Jan Wallander's and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation; Swedish Energy Agency; Research Program The Economics of Electricity Markets,Jan Wallander's and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation; Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency); Research Program The Economics of Electricity Markets,"I am very grateful for discussions with Thomas Tangeras and Bert Willems, anonymous referee reports, and comments from seminar participants at Uppsala University (March 2007), Cambridge University (May 2007), Oxford University (June 2007), 22nd European Conference on Operational Research in Prague (July, 2007), Guelph University (February 2008), and the Research Institute of Industrial Economics (April, 2008).

We show that the OECD's Committee on Capital Movements and Invisible Transactions (CMIT) played an entrepreneurial role in encouraging the liberalization of capital flows. In particular, we argue that the CMIT slipped by acting beyond its core delegation roles and against the preferences of the OECD member states' governments. This was done by discussing and seeking to expand the list of issue areas on which controls should be lifted to include short-term capital movements and the right of establishment, to adopt an extended understanding of reciprocity, and to eliminate a range of additional discriminatory measures on capital flows. Acting as institutional entrepreneurs, the CMIT members took advantage of the overlap among the networks in which they were engaged to spread their ideas to the member states. The CMIT's work affected the member states' willingness to make irrevocable, multilateral commitments through a combination of peer pressure and vertical institutional interconnectedness. Through the work of the CMIT, the OECD was an important actor in capital liberalization, in addition to the role played by other international organizations.","[Howarth, David] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sadeh, Tal] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Polit Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",University of Edinburgh; Tel Aviv University,"Howarth, D (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",,"Sadeh, Tal/AAD-1065-2020","Sadeh, Tal/0000-0002-9416-7906; Howarth, David/0000-0003-2697-165X",,,,,83,7,8,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

They are important as an export crop but also play a major role in local food security in developing countries. Banana is susceptible to an ever-increasing range of pests and diseases requiring increased use of pesticides that have adverse environmental and health impacts and threaten the sustainability of the crop. There is an urgent need to develop improved banana cultivars with a wider range of pest and disease resistance. In addition, new cultivars better adapted to the environment (i.e. tolerant to abiotic constraints) and which satisfy consumer needs are also needed. Breeding programmes aiming at broadening the genetic basis and providing new genes of interest face many obstacles (e.g. low fertility, structural heterozygosity, polyploidy). The Global Musa Genomics Consortium (http://www.musagenomics.org) an international network of investigators committed to understanding genomic evolution in relation to biotic and abiotic stresses in a polyploid, vegetatively propagated crop and also to provide meaningful insights for the plant community. Indeed, Musa lies taxonomically within the monocots, although distant from the grass family (Graminiaceae), in a position that is important for comparative and evolutionary genomics. The Consortium currently brings together expertise from 40 institutions in 24 countries. Members are committed to close collaboration and agree to share materials and resources, including sequence data and enabling technologies. Wherever possible, the products of the Consortium are placed in the public domain. With the soon-to-be-available Musa acuminata sequence, it is essential that the community be ready to use this information as efficiently as possible. This paper summarises the discussions and recommendations of participants at a workshop held during this Symposium to address the gap between genomics and breeding and suggest a number of collaborative areas of work to accelerate Musa breeding efforts around the world.","[Roux, N.; Rouard, M.] Biovers Int, Commod Livelihoods programme, F-34397 Montpellier, France",Alliance; Bioversity International,"Roux, N (通讯作者)，Biovers Int, Commod Livelihoods programme, Parc Sci Agropolis II, F-34397 Montpellier, France.",,"Roux, Nicolas/ABG-4156-2020; Rouard, Mathieu/H-5035-2017","Rouard, Mathieu/0000-0003-0284-1885",,,,,2,4,4,0,7,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,509,515,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2011.897.72,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200072,0

Through the Global Conservation Strategy, ITC is linked to field collections, which are used for taxonomy training and data acquisition on-for example-disease and pest resistance. Bananas exhibit somaclonal variation, and for some accessions, the frequency of somaclonal variation increases dramatically under in vitro conditions. In order to safely store this valuable Musa biodiversity, the in vitro collection is being cryopreserved. Over the years, fundamental research proved instrumental in the successful development of the different cryopreservation protocols. Among others, a proteomics study was performed on meristem cultures to investigate the response of different banana varieties to osmotic stress associated with cryopreservation. Valuable proteomics experience in Musa and other crops was gained based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE). Using high-resolution 2DE gels that routinely display about 900-1500 protein spots, individual protein isoforms were separated and an extensive amount of mass spectrometry data accumulated. Ultimately, a 2DE map of the Musa meristem proteome (637 identified proteins) was constructed. Following identification, some of the differentially expressed proteins under osmotic stress were further functionally characterised in engineered plants. This banana transformation platform is also used as a tool for gene and promoter discovery via T-DNA tagging. These biotechnological approaches constitute a significant step towards the development of better performing crops, including more stress-tolerant varieties of banana.","[Swennen, R.; Carpentier, S.

Empirical studies, however, typically find that retentions are an important determinant of investment. Managerial discretion and financial constraints are two alternative explanations that have been suggested. This article uses a panel of listed Scandinavian firms to examine the importance of earnings retentions as a determinant of investment. Measures of Tobin's Q, marginal q, and sales accelerator are used to control for investment opportunities. Scandinavian firms are found to depend on earnings retentions to a high degree, more so than in other developed economies. This high dependence on retentions suggests that the Scandinavian capital markets are suffering from allocational inefficiencies. This can be assumed to have detrimental effects on the speed of structural change. Moreover, these market frictions appear too large to per se be caused by information asymmetries or managerial discretion phenomena.

It is shown that size differences lead to smaller coalitions and greater benefits than coalitions among identical countries. The importance of trigger strategies for supporting cooperative solutions is considered. A real world example, based on the world's six largest emitters, is used to illustrate the implications of size differences in terms of emissions versus valuations of benefits. Climate coalitions become smaller when ranking in terms of benefits is different from ranking in terms of emissions.

Given the complexity of the domestic commercial air passenger network and supporting infrastructure, past research has only been able to provide a limited assessment of locational accessibility within the United States. To address these complexities, this paper proposes a new metric that incorporates measures of access to air transport as well as accessibility within air transportation networks. Using a comprehensive dataset on scheduled airline service, the developed approach is then applied to the US domestic commercial passenger air transportation network to explore geographic differentials in accessibility.

We find that the dominant force for lower wage growth in remote nonmetropolitan and small metropolitan-area counties is increasing relative productivity disadvantages. Yet, for medium-to-large metropolitan areas, increased attractiveness to households of remoteness from even larger metropolitan areas generally contributed the most to relatively slower wage growth.

Centrality refers to the relative importance of a zone in terms of network efficiency and utility for both transportation and urban study. Centrality indices that were developed to describe human relationships in the field of structural sociology were adopted. It is important to accommodate the neighborhood effect in dealing with centrality. The neighborhood effect describes the phenomenon whereby the attractiveness of a specific zone is affected by its neighbor zones. Kernel functions were employed to accommodate the neighborhood effect. The optimal bandwidth parameters were derived indirectly within the framework of trip attraction estimation under the assumption that the trip attraction of a zone is influenced by the integrated centrality, which includes the neighborhood effect. The well-known estimation tool of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was adopted to find the optimal bandwidth. As a byproduct of accommodating the neighborhood effect in centralities, a considerable advantage of the present study is an enhancement of the performance of trip attraction model. Another meaningful contribution of this study is a solution to the question of an acceptable delineation of the two city centers in Seoul. The boundaries of the two city centers were derived based on both the kernel function and its bandwidth. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Notably, underpricing still persists 1 year after the initial listing dates. Three information asymmetry-based hypotheses winner's curse, ex ante uncertainty and signalling are investigated as plausible causes for underpricing. The test results support both the winner's curse and the ex ante uncertainty hypotheses, suggesting that investors, despite the high level of underpricing, should expect to earn no more than a market-adjusted return in the amount of the risk-free rate. On the other hand, empirical evidence leads to the rejection of the signalling hypothesis.

It then uses very recent data to test these as hypotheses. It examines the great migration to the New World in the nineteenth century (including in response to the Irish potato blight) in some detail because this was largely unhampered by changes in migration policy. It then more briefly looks at twentieth-century experience - the 1930s, the 1970s and Asia in 1997-98. The hypotheses tested are that migration is reduced by downturns in destination countries but hardly affected by the cycle in home countries; that such downturns also lead to some return migration; that existing migrants suffer the effects of downturns more severely than natives and that although downturns may affect the timing of migration policy changes, the latter owe more to underlying secular forces than to short-term shocks.

We present theoretical and empirical evidence to suggest that this is not the case. First, our analysis of the formal rules reveals that the Council has conditional agenda-setting power due to a change in the majority thresholds for adopting legislation from the first to the second reading in the Parliament. This change has important implications for the internal dynamics of the Parliament and its institutional powers vis-a-vis the Council. Testing these analytical considerations of the formal decision rules against voting data on all co-decision legislation adopted in the two institutions between 1999 and 2004, our empirical findings show that: first, from 1999 to 2004 coalition formation in the Council fell predominantly along the traditional left-right political dimensions when negotiating co-decision proposals. Second, when disagreement over legislation is recorded in the Council, a strong divide can also be found in the Parliament. Third, when the Parliament is divided along party political lines, it is less likely to be able to meet the absolute majority requirement for amending the proposal adopted by the Council. Lastly, Parliament amendments are most likely to be adopted when a decision by voting is requested by a party group associated with the main ideological contingency in the Council.","[Hagemann, Sara] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, London, England; [Hoyland, Bjorn] Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oslo,"Hagemann, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, London, England.",s.hagemann@lse.ac.uk; bjorn.hoyland@stv.uio.no,"Høyland, Bjørn/A-3775-2010; Hagemann, Sara/G-7199-2019","Hagemann, Sara/0000-0002-0104-1782; Hoyland, Bjorn/0000-0002-7406-9348",,,,,48,49,50,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

However, EU-Russian co-operation in the energy sector is not likely to improve considerably over this period, and EU attempts to counterbalance the dominant and growing position that Russia has occupied in the supply of gas to EU countries by seeking alternative energy supply from central Asia are likely to be thwarted by countervailing Russian measures.","[Kirchner, Emil] Univ Essex, Colchester CO3 3SQ, Essex, England; [Berk, Can] Middle Eastern Tech Univ, Ankara, Turkey",University of Essex; Middle East Technical University,"Kirchner, E (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester CO3 3SQ, Essex, England.",emil@essex.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,34,36,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We review a number of diagnostics that are used for testing for error cross section independence in panels, including tests based on spacings and spatial statistics. We then argue that commonly used spatial statistics might give misleading results when cross section correlation arising from common effects is not taken into account. Hence, we study the properties of spatial statistics applied to residuals obtained from an augmented regression, where common factors have been approximated by principal components (Bai, 2009). Small sample properties of our testing strategy are investigated in a Monte Carlo study. Results show that spatial tests applied to de-factored residuals detect well the presence of spatial correlation in the data. The paper concludes with a small empirical exercise on US health expenditure. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, little has been said about the empirical evidence produced by the European Commission to support this legislative package. Since the Impact Assessment (IA) system has been in place, there have been concerns regarding quality and adequateness, especially when quantifying costs, benefits and risks, selecting policy options and considering stakeholder opinions. This article examines how these crucial issues were factored into the IA on the liberalization of EU energy markets. It is concluded that the selected policy option reflects the position of some stakeholders at the expense of the available evidence on its impacts on markets, society and the environment.","Univ Surrey, Ctr Environm Strategy, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,"Torriti, J (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Ctr Environm Strategy, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",j.torriti@surrey.ac.uk,,"Torriti, Jacopo/0000-0003-0569-039X",,,,,39,38,39,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In the two-sample context, unlike the single-sample situation, the IV and 2SLS estimators are numerically distinct. We derive and compare the asymptotic distributions of the two estimators and find that the commonly used TS2SLS estimator is more asymptotically efficient than the TSIV estimator.

We develop measures of body composition - body fat (BF) and fat-free mass (FFM) - using data on bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) that are available in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III and estimate wage models for respondents in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. Previous research uses body size or BMI as measures of obesity despite a growing concern that they do not distinguish between body fat and fat-free body mass or adequately control for non-homogeneity inside the human body. Therefore, measures presented in this paper represent a useful alternative to BMI-based proxies of obesity. Our results indicate that BF is associated with decreased wages for both males and females among whites and blacks. We also present evidence suggesting that FFM is associated with increased wages. We show that these results are not the artifacts of unobserved heterogeneity. Finally, our findings are robust to numerous specification checks and to a large number of alternative BIA prediction equations from which the body composition measures are derived.

We argue that this is much too strong a conclusion. We draw on a number of recent studies to evaluate the endogeneity experiences of the eurozone in three major areas; trade flows, business cycle synchronisation and structural reforms to improve labour and product market flexibility. Simple before-and-after comparisons are insufficient for analysis of endogeneity. The experiences of non-euro Western European economies suggest that broader trends also had considerable influence on trade and business cycle patterns. While trade rose substantially within the eurozone, it also rose with and among other European economies. We argue that political economy considerations tend to dampen the magnitude of endogeneity efforts on structural reforms and that meeting conditions for entry may be a more powerful mechanism in this than are subsequent endogenous responses. We also discuss a number of areas for further research.","[Willett, Thomas D.] Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA USA; [Willett, Thomas D.] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA USA; [Willett, Thomas D.; Wihlborg, Clas] Claremont Inst Econ Policy Studies, Claremont, CA USA; [Wihlborg, Clas] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College; Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Willett, TD (通讯作者)，Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA USA.",,,,,,,,55,16,16,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2010,33.0,7,,,,,851,872,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01268.x,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,624SY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279842500001,0

It is therefore an important source of a destination's competitive advantage. To identify those destination attributes that are the most influential in forming visitors' quality perceptions, the authors conceptualize tourism supply quality as a formative (as opposed to a reflective) construct. The conceptual model is validated empirically on three destination samples using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results show that relevant destination attributes are destination-specific, while the hypothesized relationships between destination attributes, overall destination quality, visitor satisfaction and behavioural intentions are largely supported. In addition, formative measurement models are found to have larger explanatory power than reflective measurement models.","[Dmitrovic, Tanja; Zabkar, Vesna] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Dmitrovic, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",tanja.dmitrovic@ef.uni-lj.si; vesna.zabkar@ef.uni-lj.si,"Zabkar, Vesna/H-7030-2018","Zabkar, Vesna/0000-0002-9331-9090",,,,,70,5,5,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The characteristics of the niche market are outlined based on a market research which was conducted using probit (and logit) regressions and cluster analysis. The results of the logit model estimation pointed out that preference for organic food consumption was an important factor determining demand for rural tourism as well as a higher income of the respondents. The view of this model is supported by wealthy respondents who prefer the consumption of organic food and rural tourism and form, therefore, an independent and self-sustaining cluster. Consequently, it would be appropriate to further promote or at least strongly recommend a rural tourism policy integrating organic farming and high quality products in the rural environment in order to attract wealthier tourists.","[Sergo, Zdravko; Tezak, Ana] Inst Agr & Tourism, Dept Tourism, Porec, Croatia; [Poropat, Amorino] Inst Agr & Tourism, Dept Agr Dev & Econ, Porec, Croatia",Institute of Agriculture & Tourism Porec; Institute of Agriculture & Tourism Porec,"Sergo, Z (通讯作者)，Inst Agr & Tourism, Dept Tourism, Porec, Croatia.",,"Tezak Damijanic, Ana/I-7062-2016","Tezak Damijanic, Ana/0000-0002-9145-4176",,,,,29,3,3,0,12,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2010,9.0,2,,,,,56,64,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,636RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280755800009,0

In response to the rapid escalation of house prices in Seoul, primarily in Kangnam in recent years, the Korean government implemented a number of policies to stabilize house prices. In particular, it introduced more strict limits on loan-to-value ratio and debt-to-income ratio as part of the mortgage loan qualification process in order to restrict the availability of bank lending for the housing market. The short-run influence of the bank lending on the apartment prices is clearly present in 'cold' markets, while it is not in Kangnam, the 'hot' market, even though the long-run influence is stronger in Kangnam than in the other markets. This result holds for the entire sample period (1999-2006) as well as for the subperiods before and after the introduction of lending restrictions in August, 2005. It also holds for Kangnam and Kangbuk for an extended period of 1988 to 2006. Our results suggest that in the short run the lending restriction may cause a disruption in untargeted housing markets while it has little influence on the apartment prices in the targeted market. We also find that banks have adjusted the bank lending in response to changes in the house prices in Kangnam as well as in the other markets.","[Park, Yun W.] Korea Secur Res Inst, Seoul 150974, South Korea; [Park, Sae Woon; Bahng, Doo Woan] Changwon Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Chang Won, South Korea; [Park, Yun W.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Finance, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA",Changwon National University; California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Park, YW (通讯作者)，Korea Secur Res Inst, 45-2 Yoido Dong, Seoul 150974, South Korea.",assw@changwon.ac.kr; doowoan@changwon.ac.kr; yunpark@ksri.org,"Park, Yun/AAN-2487-2020",,,,,,57,26,26,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The Banzhaf vector has been studied in the context of measuring voting power in voting games as well as in Boolean circuit theory. In this paper we investigate which non-negative vectors of sum 1 can be closely approximated by Banzhaf vectors of simple voting games.

The results confirm earlier findings in the lab, suggesting that utility is less pronounced than what is found in classical measurements where expected utility is assumed. Utility for losses is found to be convex, consistent with diminishing sensitivity, and the obtained loss-aversion coefficient of 1.6 is moderate but in agreement with contemporary evidence. The estimated probability weighting functions have an inverse-S shape and they imply pessimism in both domains. These results show that probability weighting is also an important phenomenon in the general population. Women and lower educated individuals are found to be more risk averse, in agreement with common findings. In contrast to previous studies that ascribed gender differences in risk attitudes solely to differences in the degree utility curvature, however, our results show that this finding is primarily driven by loss aversion and, for women, also by a more pessimistic psychological response toward the probability of obtaining the best possible outcome.","[Booij, Adam S.; van Praag, Bernard M.

It suggests that there has been a continuing tension between what economics has to offer economic history by way of technical methods and what economic historians would like to find in economic models. In this area, there has been a danger that use of economic analysis would impoverish historical enquiry. Since the advent of new growth economics the situation has improved in the sense that there is now greater congruence between the hypotheses proposed by cliometricians and the resources that economics has available to them to investigate these ideas rigorously.

It highlights the paradox and tension between changes in institutional forms and stronger incentives to cooperate (Montagu Norman's 'new Europe') and persisting patterns in strategic behaviour across space and over time. Central to this continuity is a fundamental asymmetry of power between creditor and debtor states. The imbalances that underpin creditor-debtor state relations also reveal the structural underpinnings of arguments from economic principle, 'who argues what' and receptiveness to economic ideas and thinkers. Not least, the case studies and arguments in the article offer fresh and different insights into British and French attitudes to European coordination.","Cardiff Univ, Sch European Studies, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Dyson, K (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch European Studies, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",DysonKH@eardiff.ac.uk,,"Dyson, Kenneth/0000-0002-6162-8729",,,,,23,30,30,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Exploring the narratives of policy leaders (storytellers) we trace the functional role of environmental policy for the EU polity as a whole, establish the legitimating role of environmental policy for the EU and search the extent to which the environmental narrative is constructed as an identity-building story.

A digital agricultural system is a database that includes not only various kinds of data relevant to agriculture, ranging from soil conditions to market assessment, but also optimal decision functions that help make best decisions in a series of agricultural production and marketing processes. Such a system is an important agricultural risk management tool, which can help assess risks due to climate change, develop a revenue protection plan for producers, and generate a soil quality management plan. This paper describes a structure that was originally proposed to the Canadian digital agriculture system: National Land and Water Information Service. The agroclimate database structure is described in detail, including data error estimation methods and guidance for generating optimal decision functions. The crop insurance under the future climate change scenarios require a strategic plan to deal with the altered tail probability distribution of the unfavourable weather events, such as drought, flooding, extreme wind, and extreme temperature. The digital agriculture system is an effective tool for insurance industry to use to develop a dynamical business plan for the changing climate. This paper includes two examples of the climate changes over Alberta Province, Canada, and over the contiguous United States for over 100 years. Alberta, six agroclimate parameters were considered for the period of 1901-2001. For the US, two warm periods in 1895-2008 were identified: the 1930s Dust Bowl drought and the recent warmth of the last two decades. The United States agriculture suffered a catastrophic loss in the Dust Bowl period. Because of the effective insurance plans and the critical governmental assistance, the agricultural loss due to drought and other disasters weather events in the last two decades was not catastrophic but still serious. Nine of the ten warmest winters according to the seasonal daily-minimum SAT and nine of the ten hottest years according the annual daily-mean SAT were in these two periods.

Two indicators, i.e., per capita food availability and per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), were used here to cover the four dimensions of food security, with the former representing the status of food availability and stability and the latter reflecting the situation of food accessibility and affordability. These two indicators were then linked to an integrated modeling framework in a loose coupling method. This proposed approach was applied to assess potential future risks of food insecurity at a global scale over a period of approximately 20 years, starting with the year 2000. The results show that both changes in per capita food availability and changes in per capita GDP during 2000-2020 vary across regions worldwide. Some regions such as China, most eastern European countries and most southern American countries where there is an increase in per capita food availability or an increase in the capacity to import food between 2000 and 2020 might be able to improve their food security situation. On the contrary, certain regions such as southern Asian countries and most African countries will likely remain hotspots of food insecurity in the future. In these regions, both the per capita food availability and the capacity of being able to import food will decrease between 2000 and 2020, thus more efforts are needed to combat hunger in terms of future actions. Although most developed countries will also experience both a decrease in per capita per capita food availability and a decrease in per capita GDP, these countries are likely to be food-secure due to their higher income and purchasing power, as well as the substantial adaptive capacity and proactive food management systems.

The questions raised included whether Russia should attempt to become a 'Western' country marked by democracy and a market economy serving the individual interests of its citizens or whether it was more important to become a great power again; whether Western patterns of political and economic life are suitable for Russia or whether the attempt to import foreign institutional structures is doomed to failure, making it necessary for Russia to find her own way.

Unfortunately, it often fails to meet this ideal due to resource misallocation, misplaced focus on existing obligations, and donor-driven implementation. This article presents a formal theory of political-economic problems in trade capacity building. I analyze trade liberalization as a repeated game with imperfect public monitoring between a developed and developing country. Modeling trade capacity building as an investment by the developed country, I show that it suffers from two problems. First, the need to enforce trade liberalization drives resource misallocation: costly projects are implemented only to build commitment capacity while others are not implemented because they encourage protectionism. Second, donor interests distort trade capacity building. Counterintuitively, if the donor can seek compensation from the recipient when it violates international trade law, it sometimes refuses to invest in low-cost trade capacity building while funding projects that hurt the recipient.","Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ju2178@columbia.edu,,,,,,,44,8,9,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We test whether the local nature of office markets makes a model based on national economics inaccurate if local and national markets do not move in tandem. For this we employ a unique dataset, which includes both disaggregated and national variables to model changes in real prime rents for a group of premier and second tier office market cities across Europe for the period 1990-2006. We explicitly compare results that are derived from models that include different levels of geographic aggregation. Results of the two stage error correction model indicate that international office rents adjust to short-run changes in office related economic activity, lagged rent changes, and to the deviation of rents from their long-run values. At the same time our results offer no proof that error correction mechanism models for office rents improve significantly by specifying economic growth figures beyond the national aggregated level for the cities included in our analysis.","[Brounen, Dirk; Jennen, Maarten] Erasmus Univ, Finance Grp, Rotterdam Sch Management, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Jennen, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Finance Grp, Rotterdam Sch Management, Room T09-43,Burg Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",mjennen@rsm.nl,,"Brounen, Dirk/0000-0001-9426-1399",,,,,20,29,30,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Our methodology allows us to examine the Laffer argument in a very general setting. Despite the high level of generality, we are able to reach some clear conclusions that happen to provide some support for the intuition that the Laffer effect requires: (1) a  high labour-income tax rate, and (2) a  large labour supply response to wage changes. However, the notions of high and large in our framework are quite different to the interpretations given them in conventional wisdom about the Laffer argument. The analysis also provides indirect support for the intuition that it is not optimal for a government to operate on the downward-sloping segment of the Laffer curve.","Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Krause, A (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",ak519@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,NOV,2009,33.0,4,,,,,601,615,,10.1007/s00355-009-0381-9,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,509BH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270985500005,0

An Analysis of the Direction and Pace of Technical Progress in a Climate-Economy Model,ENERGY JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; CO2 ABATEMENT; SUBSTITUTION,"This paper analyses whether and how a climate policy designed to stabilize greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is likely to change the direction and pace of technical progress. The analysis is performed using an upgraded version of WITCH, a dynamic integrated regional model of the world economy. In this version, a non-energy R&D sector, which enhances the productivity of the capital-labor aggregate, has been added to the energy R&D sector included in the original WITCH model. We find that, as a consequence of climate policy, R&D is re-directed towards energy knowledge. Nonetheless, total R&D investments decrease, due to a more than proportional contraction of non-energy R&D. Indeed, when non-energy and energy inputs are weakly substitutable, the overall contraction of the economic activity associated with a climate policy induces a decline in total R&D investments. However, enhanced investments in energy R&D and in the energy sector are found not to crowd-out investments in non-energy R&D.","[Carraro, Carlo; Nicita, Lea] Univ Venice, Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, CEPR, CEPS,CESifo, I-30122 Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Fondazione Mattei,"Nicita, L (通讯作者)，Univ Venice, Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, CEPR, CEPS,CESifo, Castello 5252, I-30122 Venice, Italy.",lea.nicita@feem.it,"Nicita, Lea/GXW-1632-2022; Carraro, Carlo/A-7071-2014",,Italian Ministry of the Environment; European Union; project Modelli matematici per le decisioni economico-finanziario-attuariali,Italian Ministry of the Environment; European Union(European Union (EU)); project Modelli matematici per le decisioni economico-finanziario-attuariali,"This paper is part of the research work being carried out by the Climate Change Modeling and Policy Research Programme of the Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei and by the Climate Impacts and Policy Division of the Euro Mediterranean Center on Climate Change.

According to them, the source of the bias is the existence of heterogeneous price adjustment dynamics at the sectoral level that established time series or panel data methods fail to control for. This paper re-examines this claim in two steps. Firstly, we demonstrate that IMRR's measures of sectoral persistence are systematically downwardly biased because they are based on an inaccurate definition of the 'average' impulse response function (IRF). We then show that standard estimates of shock persistence are recovered after this bias is corrected. Secondly, building on the results in Mayoral (2008), which prove that aggregate and micro models induce the same shock persistence behavior, we show that estimates based on aggregate and sectoral exchange rates are, in fact, highly consistent. Thus, aggregation is not the Solution to the PPP puzzle.

A market power spectrum is considered where one end has infinitely large production capacity but the usual network constraints while the other end has infinitely large network capacity but the usual production constraints. First, we analyze the locational market power function mathematically. Then, we use a real world example of the Portland, Oregon electrical market and determine its position on the market power spectrum. We find the Portland market to be primarily production constrained rather than network constrained. We also identify the local and global threshold generation capacities for each generator beyond which it cannot influence the individual and total locational market power, respectively. This study facilitates the understanding of the economic and physical determinants of locational market power. It can help regulators make informed decisions when it comes to the choice of enhancing the physical infrastructure, or adding more generation capacity to the market.","[Macauley, Matthew] Clemson Univ, Dept Math Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Marathe, Achla] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Chen, Jiangzhuo; Marathe, Achla] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Virginia Bioinformat Inst, Network Dynam & Simulat Sci Lab, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Clemson University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Marathe, A (通讯作者)，Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Virginia Bioinformat Inst, Network Dynam & Simulat Sci Lab, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",chenj@vbi.vt.edu; macaule@clemson.edu; amarathe@vbi.vt.edu,"Macauley, Matthew/AAN-6678-2020","Chen, Jiangzhuo/0000-0002-2729-3881","Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory (NDSSL); NSF [CNS-0626964, SES-0729441, CNS-0831633]; CDC Center of Excellence in Public Health Informatics [2506055-01]; DTRA CNIMS [HDTRA1-07-C-0113]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [0831633] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory (NDSSL); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); CDC Center of Excellence in Public Health Informatics; DTRA CNIMS; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"We thank our external collaborators and members of the Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory (NDSSL) for their suggestions and comments.

It shows that the residential environment only affects car use among single-earners. Conversely, for all commuters. but in particular for dual-earners, characteristics of the work location affect whether they commute by car. Even in dual-earner households with two cars, work environment plays a role. We found that in cases of dual-earners with only one car, the partners with the longest commuting distances and the lowest density work locations are most likely to commute by car. Moreover, in households with young children, men are more inclined to leave the car at home. Other features relating to work also affect car commuting, including work flexibility and, especially, possession of a company car. We conclude that future policies aimed at reducing car use should place greater focus on work factors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Known as aristocrats, their unusual lifestyles were the antithesis of modern secular values. Today aristocrats are often viewed as a hindrance to pre-modern growth and development because they appeared to operate so inefficiently. This paper argues that the aristocrats efficiently provided the valuable service of trustworthy servant, by investing their wealth in hostage capital.

We capture the effect of urban structure through a measure of job accessibility to employment by public transport. An ordered probit explaining the number of cars per household is estimated as a function of individual, household and spatial variables. The data used in the analysis come from the Spanish Institute of Statistics' 2001 Micro-census for the areas of Barcelona and Madrid. The results show that spatial variables play a significant role in explaining the probability of car ownership. We provide the car ownership elasticities with respect the job accessibility measure.

This article presents the results of an experiment aimed at testing whether agents become more sensitive toward probabilities over time when they repeatedly face similar decisions, receive feedback on the consequences of their decisions, and are given ample incentives to reflect on their decisions, as predicted by Plott's Discovered Preference Hypothesis (DPH). The results of a laboratory experiment with N = 62 participants support this hypothesis. The elicited subjective probability weighting function converges significantly toward linearity when respondents are asked to make repeated choices and are given direct feedback after each choice. Such convergence to linearity is absent in an experimental treatment where respondents are asked to make repeated choices but do not experience the resolution of risk directly after each choice, as predicted by the DPH.","Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"van de Kuilen, G (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",G.v.d.Kuilen@uvt.nl,"van de Kuilen, Gijs/H-7639-2013","van de Kuilen, Gijs/0000-0002-8961-2817",,,,,37,12,15,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUL,2009,67.0,1,,,,,1,22,,10.1007/s11238-007-9080-0,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,459OH,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267112200001,0

A more detailed explanation is offered in this paper through a case study of program implementation in Turkey between 1999 and 2004. Our research is based on a series of in-depth interviews with policy makers, program negotiators, bureaucrats, interest groups and IMF personnel. Our results reinforce hypotheses that emerge from the theory of implementation and the large sample econometric work, but they also offer new and enhanced explanations. Program implementation depends on a range of factors which interact with one another. These include domestic political economy factors, such as the importance of special interest groups, political cohesiveness and program ownership by the government and the IMF, but also other idiosyncratic factors such as, in the case of Turkey, the existence of a crisis, the desire to join the EU and the role of influential technocrats. Our research has implications for the design of IMF programs.","[Arpac, Ozlem; Bird, Graham] Univ Surrey, Surrey Ctr Int Econ Studies, Surrey GU2 7XH, England",University of Surrey,"Bird, G (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Surrey Ctr Int Econ Studies, Surrey GU2 7XH, England.",g.bird@surrey.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,21,23,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We extend this research by controlling for residential mobility, wealth, dwelling type and vehicle ownership, as well as by using a differences in differences methodology to deal with possible treatment effects bias.

We argue that low rates of homeownership in Hispanic communities create a self-reinforcing mechanism that contributes to this large disparity. In part, this occurs because proximity to other homeowners belonging to a family's social network improves access to information about how to become a homeowner. Role model effects may also be relevant. We investigate these issues using household-level data on out-of-state movers from the 2000 Decennial Census. Three especially important results are obtained. First, proximity to Hispanic homeowners in the 1995 place of residence increases the propensity of a Hispanic family to own a home in 2000. Second, that effect is especially strong with respect to proximity to weak English-speaking Hispanic homeowners. Third, these patterns hold regardless of the Hispanic family's own ability to speak English. From a policy perspective, these results suggest that local programs designed to promote homeownership among weak English-speaking Hispanic families likely increase Hispanic homeownership beyond just the immediate program participants.","[Haurin, Donald R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Haurin, Donald R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Finance, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Haurin, Donald R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Publ Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Rosenthal, Stuart S.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Syracuse University,"Haurin, DR (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",Haurin.2@osu.edu; ssrosent@maxwell.syr.edu,", Don/AAI-8422-2020",,,,,,40,19,29,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2009,37.0,2,,,,,155,183,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00238.x,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,451JI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266466100001,0

In the light of these results, we argue that the current UK Government definition of vulnerability is too narrow because our results suggest that a large proportion of low paid, unrepresented workers are at risk of being denied their employment rights.

The alternative is a step function of transition intensities. The test rejects time-homogeneity for rating transitions observed over 7 years in a real corporate portfolio.

To answer this question, we exploit the differential effect of various institutional attributes that should affect the costs of erecting barriers when the new technology has a technologically close predecessor but not otherwise. We implement this test using a data set that covers the diffusion of twenty technologies for 23 countries over the past two centuries. We find that each of the relevant institutional variables that affect the costs of erecting barriers has a significantly larger effect on the diffusion of technologies with a competing predecessor technology than when no such technology exists. These effects are quantitatively important. Thus, we conclude that lobbies are an important barrier to technology adoption and to development.","[Comin, Diego] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Comin, D (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,56,53,59,2,21,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Results indicate that most of the biotechnology firms within the Cincinnati region are there because of entrepreneurial ties with universities and research hospitals in the area, not because the region has specific advantages for biotechnology firms compared to other metropolitan areas of similar size. The authors find that interfirm linkages range from extremely weak to nonexistent. No specialized labor force exists to support biotechnology firms, nor are there specialized infrastructure and business services. No biotechnology-dedicated government office exists. In summary, the authors see more colocation than interactive clustering of biotechnology firms, implying that economic development efforts to enhance interfirm linkages are likely to be less effective than support for hospital and university research and education.","[Ferrand, Yann; Kelton, Christina M.

J,"Yao, SJ; Luo, D",,,,"Yao, Shujie; Luo, Dan",,,The Economic Psychology of Stock Market Bubbles in China,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EMERGING MARKETS; EQUITY PREMIUM; VOLATILITY,"The Chinese stock markets were extremely volatile during the period 2005-08. The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Composite Index increased more than sixfold from 1,012 in 2005 to 6,124 by the end of 2007. It then declined continuously to reach a low of 1,929 on 17 September 2008, or a drop of 70 per cent from its peak in less than 10 months. Although the market downturn may have been affected by the financial crisis in the United States and the rest of the world, the extreme fluctuations of stock prices signify a big market bubble, and the burst of that bubble must be explained by intrinsic characteristics or the economic psychology of Chinese investors. Based on a detailed market data analysis, this paper attributes the development of the stock market bubble to three key psychological factors: 'greed', 'envy' and 'speculation', and the burst of the bubble to three contrasting factors: 'fear', 'lack of confidence' and 'disappointment'. It concludes that only after Chinese companies become really commercialised and profitable and investors become rational can the stock markets become stable without extreme volatility as seen in the past. Government policies can play a role in soothing market volatility detrimental to shareholders and the wider economy, but investors should not depend on government for making their own investment decisions.","[Yao, Shujie; Luo, Dan] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Yao, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,,,,,,,40,37,41,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2009,32.0,5,,,,,667,691,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01176.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,440QD,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265713900001,0

Greater export openness can indeed affect firm-level volatility by changing the exposure and the reaction of firms to macroeconomic developments. The net effect is ambiguous from a theoretical point of view. This paper provides firm-level evidence on the link between openness and volatility. Using comprehensive data on more than 21,000 German manufacturing firms for the period 1980-2001, we analyse the evolution of firm-level output volatility and the link between volatility and export openness. Our paper has three main findings. First, firm-level output volatility is significantly higher than the level of aggregate volatility, but it displays similar patterns. Second, increased export openness lowers firm-level output volatility. This effect is primarily driven by variations along the extensive margin, i.e. by the distinction between exporters and non-exporters. Variations along the intensive margin, i.e. the volume of exports, tend to have a dampening impact on volatility as well. Third, small firms are more volatile than large firms.","[Buch, Claudia M.] Univ Tubingen, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Doepke, Joerg] Univ Appl Sci, Merseburg, Germany; [Strotmann, Harald] Pforzheim Univ, Pforzheim, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Buch, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",,,,,,,,30,24,29,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2009,32.0,4,,,,,531,551,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01168.x,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,421TB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264380100001,0

Estimates suggest the existence of unexploited economies of output and customer density and small scale economies which appear to be increasing with population density. These findings suggest that moderate cost savings from prudent mergers could be expected; in particular, benefits of merging water utilities might be higher in more densely populated urban areas.

After the referendum in September 2006, the charging system was finally introduced as permanent from August 2007 with some adjustments to the Trial design. The idea of congestion charging is unique in a Swedish context. and the introduction of the Stockholm system has been highly controversial. Considerable efforts have therefore been undertaken to provide information that could serve as 'Decision Support' along the way. This has included e.g. modelling and forecasts before the Trial, a comprehensive evaluation programme during the Trial, extensive stakeholder consultations throughout, and various information and communication strategies. But what difference did this information input make, and what was its role in the process from initiating the system, to its final adoption? In this paper we pave the way for investigating the use and role of 'Decision Support' in the Stockholm Congestion Charging experiment. We adopt a definition of Decision Support as the systematic application of externally produced knowledge in transport planning and policy making processes. We then derive an analytical framework from the research literature on 'knowledge utilization' in policy making. This research has generally found that both 'technical', 'communicative', and 'institutional' aspects of the Decision Support matter for its influence on actual policy making processes and results. In our analysis we find a similar pattern. This high technical quality of the monitoring and evaluation programmes provided for solid verified results, while the institutional arrangements and the communication strategies helped to ensure the credibility and legitimacy of the information for the decision makers. The availability of rich contents coupled with strategies for the timely and targeted information delivery suggest that direct 'instrumental' use could have taken place. At a more general level the Trial represents an advanced form of 'Decision Support' that goes beyond the mere application of calculated results to encompass a process where the decision parameters themselves become part of the change process.

A domain such that there exists a similarity of choice attitudes within consequentialism satisfies the proposed domain condition.

Consistent with findings for conventional firms, we find that EREIT conditional volatility is time-varying, persistent, and predictable. There is a positive relationship between expected return and expected risk in EREIT stocks pre-1993, but the relationship disappears after 1993. We find no evidence that negative shocks affect EREIT volatility differently from positive ones in either time period. Different from reported results for conventional firms, we find that changes in the conditional volatility of fundamental macroeconomic variables have strong explanatory value for future changes in EREIT volatility. Finally, comparing EREIT volatility performance with volatility in the Russell 2000 Index, a proxy for small stocks, we find that EREIT volatility behaves differently from that of small stocks in many respects, indicating that risks in the small stock index cannot effectively proxy for risks in the EREIT market.","[Campbell, Robert D.] Hofstra Univ, Dept Finance, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA; [Jirasakuldech, Benjamas] Univ Pacific, Eberhardt Sch Business, Stockton, CA 95211 USA; [Emekter, Riza] Robert Morris Univ, Dept Finance Econ, Moon Township, PA 15108 USA",Hofstra University; University of the Pacific; Robert Morris University,"Campbell, RD (通讯作者)，Hofstra Univ, Dept Finance, 134 Hofstra Univ, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA.",bjirasak@pacific.edu; Robert.D.Campbell@hofstra.edu; remekter@yahoo.com,,,,,,,24,26,31,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

These data are in a sense artificial constructs that are developed to approximate real choice settings of the way that individuals process relevant information in making choices. As such, all data designs formalized through a survey instrument seek information through questions that become descriptions of events and as Such the probabilities of choice that are of interest are strictly probabilities attached to event descriptions and not choice probabilities of events per se. The recognition of this distinction, initially noted by Kahneman et al, [Kahneman, D.. Slovic, P., Tversky. A.. 1982, judgement under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases. Cambridge University Press, New York], can be captured, at least in part, through the idea of process heterogeneity, as a way of recognizing and accounting for the many ways in which individuals process information, and in part is influenced by the way the analyst describes the context in which preference data is sought. Building on previous contributions on attribute processing, this paper draws on recent empirical evidence to further reinforce the importance of joint modelling of process and outcome in choice analysis. This Study adds to the evidence of a trend emerging on the Upward bias of mean estimates of marginal willingness to pay when ignoring process heterogeneity.

However, without a solid understanding of how people make their transportation and residential location choices, it is hard to tell which of these policies and investments are really doing the job and which are wasting precious city resources. The focus of this paper is the determinants of car ownership and car use for commuting. Using survey data from 1997 to 1998 collected in New York City, this paper uses discrete choice econometrics to estimate a model of the choices of car ownership and commute mode while also modeling the related choice of residential location. The main story told by this analysis is that New Yorkers are more sensitive to changes in travel time than they are to changes in travel cost. The model predicts that the most effective ways to reduce both auto ownership and car commuting involve changing the relative travel times for cars and transit, making transit trips faster by increasing both the frequency and the speed of service and making auto trips slower - perhaps simply by allowing traffic congestion. Population density also appears to have a substantial effect on car ownership in New York. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We advocate low allowance prices may also be explained by banking restrictions between 2007 and 2008. Based on a Hotelling-CAPM analysis, we provide statistical evidence that the French and Polish decisions to ban banking contribute to the explanation of low EUA Phase I prices. Besides, we provide the first rigorous empirical verification that the cost-of-carry relationship between EUA spot and futures prices for delivery during Phase H does not hold after the enforcement of the inter-period banking restrictions.

Saint-Simons name and doctrines were known to the Greek scholars of the Diaspora and especially to A. Corais's circle. In 1833, when King Otho came to Greece, a group of Saint-Simonians fugitives ahead by Gustave d'Eichthal took shelter in Nauplion, the first capital-town of Greece. Eichthal proposed the establishment of the Bureau of Public Finance, inspired by Saint-Simon's idea of a foundation of a chambre d'industrie, which would play an advisory role in the Ministry of Commerce, as Saint-Simon described in his Du systeme industried (1821). Despite the fact that the Bureau of Public Finance had an ambitious beginning, it was not as fruitful as expected. It is worth stressing out that Saint-Simons ideas have not been positively welcomed by the academic institutions.","Hellen Telecommun Org SA, Athens, Greece",,"Baloglou, CP (通讯作者)，Hellen Telecommun Org SA, Athens, Greece.",cbaloglou@ote.gr,,,,,,,88,0,0,0,3,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Time horizons and the outcome of the Argentine debt restructuring deal,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sovereign debt; restructuring; creditors; time horizons; reputations; Argentina,SOVEREIGN DEBT; MARKETS; SPREADS,"Although a recurrent phenomenon, sovereign debt restructurings following defaults on debt obligations do not engender today the exact same dynamics they did in the past. On the one hand, prevalent reputational models have overestimated the costs of default in terms of access to new credit. On the other hand, debtors' restructuring strategies have been underestimated in the face of anticipated constraints on developing countries' policy autonomy believed to flow from financial globalization. By focusing on the latest Argentine debt restructuring (the largest and most complex in history to date), I find that the outcome of sovereign debt restructurings in terms of credit (re) access are much less contingent on market punishments based on reputations than on the short-term nature of financial incentives in the bond industry as well as on international lending cycles. Time horizons play a crucial role in how debtors take advantage of different creditors' incentives to participate in a restructuring. A critical implication is that governments have more room to maneuver in taking contentious policy stances (such as stringent debt restructuring deals) than the literature on economic globalization accounts for. Also, far from a zero-sum game, for both debtors and some of their creditors, debt restructurings can prove to be attractive deals for their specific purposes.","Virginia Tech, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Alexandria, VA USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Datz, G (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Alexandria, VA USA.",,,,,,,,78,9,10,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Specifically, the minimally acceptable settlement value from a risk-averse (risk-loving) but unbiased-belief bargainer is empirically indistinguishable from what one could get with risk-neutrality and pessimistically (optimistically) biased beliefs. This article reports results from a controlled bargaining experiment where data on both risk attitude and beliefs under uncertainty are generated in order to assess their relative importance in bargaining experiment outcomes. The average lab subject is risk-averse, yet optimistic with respect to uncertainty, which is consistent with existing studies that examine each in isolation. I also find that the effects of optimism dominate those of risk-aversion. Optimistic bargainers are significantly more likely to dispute and have aggressive final bargaining positions. Dispute rates are not statistically affected by risk attitude, but there is some evidence that risk aversion leads to a weakened bargaining position. Though additional research is needed to understand the limits of extending these results, a key implication follows. In uncertainty environments where optimism dominates, increased settlement rates are more likely achieved by minimizing impasse uncertainty (to limit the potential for optimism) rather than maximizing uncertainty (to weaken the reservation point of risk-averse bargainers), as has been argued in the dispute resolution literature.","Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Dickinson, D (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",dickinsondl@appstate.edu,,,,,,,37,18,19,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2009,66.0,1,,,,,69,101,,10.1007/s11238-007-9075-x,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,399XG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262832000004,0

It depends on whether agents' interactions are characterized by markov substitutability or markov complementarity, which can be seen as dynamic translations of the ideas of strategic substitutability and strategic complementarity (Bulow et al. 1985, Journal of Political Economy 93:488-511).

Our results suggest that carbon taxes are more regressive when annual income is used as a measure of economic welfare than when lifetime income measures are used. Further, the direct component of the tax, in any given year, is significantly more regressive than the indirect component. We observe a modest shift over time with-the direct component of carbon taxes becoming less regressive and the indirect component becoming more regressive. These effects mostly offset each other and the distribution of the total tax burden has not changed much over time. In addition we find that regional variation has fluctuated over the years of our analysis.

As one of the world's largest recipients of FDI, China has arguably benefited from foreign multinational enterprises in various respects. However, one of the main challenges for China, and other developing countries, is job creation, and the effect of FDI on employment is uncertain. The effect depends on the amount of jobs created within foreign firms as well as the effect of FDI on employment in domestic firms. We analyse FDI and employment in China using a large sample of manufacturing firms for the period 1998-2004. Our results show that FDI has positive effects on employment growth. The relatively high employment growth in foreign firms is associated with their firm characteristics and their high survival rate.

We propose a model of innovation decisions in which, under certain conditions, firms with very high and very low profits can be expected to innovate less than firms with moderate profits, which is consistent with the hypothesis of the inverted-U relationship between competition and innovation. Following the persistence of profits (POP) literature, we suppose that firms earn profits that are persistently above or below the norm and that the higher are the persistent profits of firms, the lower is the intensity of competition the firms face. It is further assumed that firms are managed by owners and that in each period, the owners earns the profits of their firm. The owner decides whether to adopt or decline an innovation (chooses between innovation and passivity). If the innovation is adopted, the profit of the firm is increased if the innovation is successful (which happens with certain probability), and decreased in the other case. The owner is assumed to choose the alternative with highest value. For valuation of outcomes, the prospect theoretical value function is used. Under certain conditions, the loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity properties of the value function imply the inverted-U relationship between profits and the difference between the value of innovation and the value of passivity. Under the assumption that there is negative value (utility) expected from adopting an innovation, the inverted-U relationship between profits and innovation activity of firms is explained.","[Krcal, Ondrej] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,krcalo@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,194,199,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900035,0

The effect of different gas producer strategies upon price levels in the liberalised European gas market over the period 2005-2030 is analysed using a dynamic gas market model that accounts for demand, supply, and investments in pipeline transport, LNG, and storage. The multi-period model formulation allows exploration of the dynamics of market power as transportation and storage capacities are augmented and interact with demand growth. The combined effects of spatial configuration of the supply network and supplier location upon intensity of competition in ten different regions in Europe are considered. Differences in prices are due to the interaction of (1) inherent ability of producers to exercise market power (determined by production capacity and costs) with the (2) accessibility of the market (determined by gas transport infrastructure).","[Lise, Wietze] IBS Res & Consultancy, TR-34433 Istanbul, Turkey; [Hobbs, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Hobbs, Benjamin F.] Energy Res Ctr Netherlands ECN, Policy Studies Unit, Petten, Netherlands",IBS Research & Consultancy; Johns Hopkins University,"Lise, W (通讯作者)，IBS Res & Consultancy, Agahamami Cadessi 1-6, TR-34433 Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Hobbs, Benjamin F/A-3291-2010",,"ECN; National Science Foundation [ECS-0224817, ECS-0621920]",ECN; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was partially supported by ECN and by the National Science Foundation under grants ECS-0224817 and ECS-0621920.

Specifically, it investigates the mechanism of legitimacy feedback that facilitated and, later, prevented the policy idea of orderly liberalization from being institutionalized into the amendment of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) Articles that would have extended the Fund's mission to the liberalization of capital flows. Drawing on archival research and interviews with IMF officials, the paper argues that the convergence of member countries' expectations around the proposal to amend the Articles was the product of the interaction between IMF-sponsored ideas and the validation of those actors that make up the Fund's social constituencies for legitimation within a specific historical context. The idea of orderly liberalization was consequential not because it was supported by the United States or backed up by a homogenous IMF staff, but because it reflected the economic interests of those actors - member states and private sector - who would bear the costs of an extension of the Fund's mission.","Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Moschella, M (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Trento, Italy.",,,"Moschella, Manuela/0000-0002-3159-9533",,,,,81,16,17,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Price setting behavior of a representative firms in both sectors is described by the Calvo style resulting into a. New Keynesian Phillips Curves (NKPCs). Monetary authority implements monetary policy according to a modified Taylor rule in the inflation targeting regime. The model contains extra rigidities connected to labor market (wages NKPC and labor adjustment costs). A Bayesian method is used for the estimation of the linearized model equations. A basic analysis of the estimated model is carried out through parameters description and impulse response functions.

Second, it employs the rarely used ILO October Inquiry database, which is the most far-ranging survey of wages around the world. Third, it focuses on the within-occupation gender wage gap, an alternative to the commonly used raw and residual wage gaps as a measure of the gender wage gap. This study finds that the occupational gender wage gap tends to decrease with increasing economic development, at least in richer countries, and to decrease with trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) in richer countries, but finds little evidence that trade and FDI also reduce the occupational gender wage gap in poorer countries.","[Oostendorp, Remco H.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Oostendorp, Remco H.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Oxford,"Oostendorp, RH (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",roostendorp@feweb.vu.nl,,"Oostendorp, Remco/0000-0002-2034-4842",,,,,36,106,123,6,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

At the same time donors continue to promote an outward looking development strategy based on ideological adherence to neoliberal precepts. Due to its acute dependence on aid, Haiti's government must therefore design an economic development plan which satisfies the renewed poverty reduction imperative but which is not at variance with processes of globalization and neoliberalmarket rules. Donors are supporting one economic development strategy which they believe fits the bill: the reactivation of the country's export processing zones (EPZs). This article considers Haiti's past experience with EPZs as well as the model's impact on the region as a whole, in order to show it is unlikely to decrease poverty in any significant way or alleviate the country's socioeconomic inequalities. The Haiti case also highlights a disturbing state of affairs: it is the governments of the poorest countries that have the least number of policy tools and options available to combat misery and destitution. The renewed poverty reduction consensus does not alter this stark reality.","Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Shamsie, Y (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",,,,,,,,83,14,20,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The sector is therefore of interest in studying global mobility trends and transport-related emissions. In 2005, tourism was responsible for around 5% of all CO2 emissions, of which 75% were caused by passenger transport. Given the rapid growth in tourism, with 1.6 billion international tourist arrivals predicted by 2020 (up from 903 million in 2007), it is clear that the sector will contribute to rapidly growing emission levels, and increasingly interfere with global climate policy. This is especially true under climate stabilisation and avoiding dangerous climate change objectives, implying global emission reductions in the order of -50% to -80% by 2050, compared to 2000. Based on three backcasting scenarios, and using techniques integrating quantitative and qualitative elements, this paper discusses the options for emission reductions in the tourism sector and the consequences of mitigation for global tourism-related mobility by 2050. It ends with a discussion of the policy implications of the results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data from Manchuria on soybean cultivation and exports, we employ difference-in-differences and instrumental variable approaches to demonstrate a significantly positive relationship between growing soybeans for export and the returns to migration. Those who migrated to Manchuria in response to high market prices, and to villages more suitable for cultivating soy prospered most; they owned approximately two-thirds more of the arable land and one-third more of houses than those who failed to do so. Evidence suggests that the positive welfare effect of commercialization-cum-migration was confined not only to the rich, who seek to relieve the land constraint at home, but possibly also to the poor.

The political economy of local democracy in Tsarist Russia,EUROPEAN REVIEW OF ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PUBLIC-GOODS PROVISION; DECENTRALIZATION; RESPONSIVENESS; GOVERNMENT; FRANCHISE; SUFFRAGE; ELITES; EXTEND,"Russia's emancipation of the serfs was accompanied by numerous other measures aimed at modernizing the Tsarist economy and society. Among these 'Great Reforms' was the creation of a new institution of local government - the zemstvo - which has received comparatively little attention from economic historians. This quasi-democratic form of local government played an important role in expanding the provision of public goods and services in the half-century leading up to the Russian Revolution. This article utilizes archival records and contemporary evidence to outline the zemstvo's role in Russian society and describe its political structure. The article then presents a newly collected panel data set that includes information on the allocation of political rights within the zemstvo, spending and revenue decisions by district zemstva, and a variety of other socio-economic indicators. With these data, I explore whether the electoral structure of the zemstvo allowed the newly emancipated peasantry to voice their preferences over spending levels and tax rates. I find that the district zemstvo with greater political representation from the peasantry shifted taxes away from communal property and spent more per capita, especially on education. However, these effects did not derive from a direct voting mechanism but most likely arose out of the interaction between peasant representation and more liberal elements of the noble class. This study initiates a broader research agenda into the zemstvo's place in Russian economic history and contributes to the literature on the political economy of public good provision in developing societies.","Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",Williams College,"Nafziger, S (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",snafzige@williams.edu,,,,,,,98,27,30,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

In this article we argue that when a market for a (subsidised or free of charge) publicly provided good exists, a consumer demand approach can be used to construct a money metric of welfare corresponding to the consumption of public provision. We illustrate this approach in investigating age and income effects on household demand for health care in Cyprus, where free public provision is not universal and those entitled to it often resort to private supplementation. Our findings suggest that the money metric of welfare, which consumers attach to free access to publicly provided health care, varies with age and to a lesser extent with household income.","[Pashardes, Panos; Pashourtidou, Nicoletta] Univ Cyprus, Econ Res Ctr, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Pashardes, Panos] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Cyprus; University of Cyprus,"Pashourtidou, N (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Econ Res Ctr, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",p.pashardes@ucy.ac.cy; n.pashourtidou@ucy.ac.cy,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This perception is re-examined in a study of the inter-firm relationship among the firms in which the Rong brothers, prominent industrialists of the 1910-30s, invested. We find that equity control, marketing, purchasing, and financing of these firms show a high degree of individuality among the firms, while the Headquarters Company functioned as their coordinator. It suggests that the hierarchical-controlled 'business group' structure in pre-war China is either a phantom creation of historians or the projected image of later generations who created it during the nationalisation of firms in the 1950s.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Chan, KY (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,49,2,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

To study the temporal variation of forecasts, we recommend analysis of the time series of predictions made by individual forecasters. This makes transparent the heterogeneity of the panel and avoids improper inferences due to changing panel composition. In the absence of knowledge of the process determining panel composition, we warn against the traditional practice of aggregate time series analysis, which conflates changes in the expectations of individual forecasters with changes in the composition of the panel. Should analysis of aggregated predictions be thought desirable as a simplifying device, we recommend analyses of sub-panels of fixed composition.

Students often move to an area for college and then stay in the area after their education is complete, causing the area's educated population to grow. Empirical evidence suggests that student migration explains nearly all the greater in-migration to highly educated nonmetropolitan counties.

They do not have to pay out dividends, yet enjoy the exemption from paying corporate taxes since their legal foundation in 1998. Several financial meltdowns occurred in the last three decades, keeping investors with a doubt about Turkey's financial and political stability. The last meltdown in 2001 is part of the sample period. Findings show that Turkish REITs employ little long-term debt in their capital structure. The legal requirement that a leader entrepreneur be present with a minimum equity position of 25% introduces the agency problem between the majority and minority owners. The leader entrepreneurs, as non-taxable institutional investors, appear to dictate Turkish REITs' dividend and debt policies and deplete REITs' dividends, causing them to go to the long-term debt market. The financial meltdown of 2001 exerts negative short-term and positive long-term influence on the debt ratios while inflation's effect is negative. Firm size, REITs' engagement in development and stock market development influence debt ratios positively; tangibility and a few firm, ownership, and country-specific determinants appear to have either mixed or no influence on Turkish REITs' debt policies.","[Erol, Isil] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Tirtiroglu, Dogan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",Middle East Technical University; University of Adelaide,"Erol, I (通讯作者)，Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey.",isile@metu.edu.tr,,"Erol, Isil/0000-0001-8125-9118",,,,,57,20,23,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Our modelling framework is based on a copula approach and can be used for a broad set of applications where the primary characteristics of the data are: (i) discrete domain; (ii) the tendency to cluster at certain outcome values; and (iii) contemporaneous dependence. These kinds of properties can be found for high- or ultra-high-frequency data describing the trading process on financial markets. We present a straightforward sampling method for such an inflated multivariate density through the application of an independence Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm. We demonstrate the power of our approach by modelling the conditional bivariate density of bid and ask quote changes in a high-frequency setup. We show how to derive the implied conditional discrete density of the bid-ask spread, taking quote clusterings (at multiples of 5 ticks) into account.

Using longitudinal data from ultramarathon running covering the period 2005-2009, I first confirm the findings of most previous studies by demonstrating that on average the women's races are indeed less competitive than the men's contests. Closer inspection of the data, however, reveals that the gender gap has considerably narrowed over the years. Moreover, for men as well as for women, an increase in the number of contestants is not only associated with a better average performance but also with a lower performance dispersion. These findings are not compatible with the hypothesis that gender differences in competitiveness reflect evolved biological differences and/or psychological predispositions. It is, however, compatible with two other (complementary rather than substitute) hypotheses: Due to changing sociocultural conditions boys and girls are today socialized similarly in many parts of the world and due to the increasing returns to success (i.e., identical prize money levels and distributions) women are nowadays motivated to train as hard as comparably talented men.","[Frick, Bernd] Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Dept Management, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Frick, Bernd] Univ Trier, Inst Labour Law & Ind Relat European Community, Trier, Germany; Volkswagen AG, Inst Labor & Personnel Econ, Wolfsburg, Germany",University of Paderborn; Universitat Trier; Volkswagen; Volkswagen Germany,"Frick, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Dept Management, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",bernd.frick@notes.upb.de,,,,,,,52,37,40,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Although scientific tools are often used in transportation forecasts, biases and, more specifically, overestimations of the expected impact are often observed. This study explores the correlations between forecast-maker's characteristics and forecast bias creation and reduction. The study examines two transport-related policies aiming at the reduction of car use: telecommuting and carsharing. Both are Travel Demand Management (TDM) policies, which attract much attention from transport experts. We tested the extent to which the forecast-maker's beliefs about the policy at stake affected the forecast bias. We found that attitudes and beliefs associates not only with overestimation bias but also with its reduction over time. We also tested the extent to which the forecast-maker's affiliation, the performing institute and the publication type were correlated with the biases of the forecast and with the forecaster attitudes and beliefs. These characteristics are intuitively used by the forecast user as tools to assess the 'objectivity' of the forecast, but our analysis found no association between these characteristics and the forecast bias.

This paper argues that, beyond this obvious fact, the choice of an authority not to offer a referendum, although permitted to do so, may enhance the information individuals posses about social preferences as well. The addition of a referendum option in the rules of a game, that is, by enabling the authority to offer referenda at will, results in an assured re-election of the authorities that implement socially beneficial policies and reduces the likelihood of the re-election of the authorities that implement socially detrimental policies. In a sense, by allowing an authority to offer referenda, an inescapable Catch-22 is introduced in the game, which inhibits the re-election of a measure of bad authorities and, thus, confirms that one of the main benefits of a democratic institution is the preservation of good authorities in power. It is, finally, demonstrated that non-binding referenda are more influential (in the directions described above) than binding referenda as far as the authority's re-election prospect is concerned.","[Xefteris, Dimitrios] Univ Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Cyprus,"Xefteris, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.",xefteris.dimitrios@ucy.ac.cy,"Xefteris, Dimitrios/S-4080-2017","Xefteris, Dimitrios/0000-0001-7397-5288",,,,,21,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2011,37.0,1,,,,,121,138,,10.1007/s00355-010-0483-4,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,774MQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291391100006,0

Desegregation induced white flight from blacker to whiter public school districts and to private schools, but the local property tax base and local revenue were not adversely affected. The state legislature directed significant new funding to districts where whites were particularly affected by desegregation. Desegregation therefore appears to have achieved its intended goal of improving resources available in schools that blacks attended.","[Reber, Sarah J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Reber, Sarah J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Reber, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",,,,,,,,21,16,21,0,12,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Our results show that the nineteenth century grain invasion had a negative impact on agricultural wages, whereas the fall in wheat prices did not benefit industry workers. We also found that migration pushed up real agricultural and industrial wages. As agriculture was the main sector in the economy, the final impact was a wage decrease. The negative impact of trade on agricultural and industrial labour markets partly explains the trade policy response of integral protection. However, other alternatives that would have been effective in raising living standards, such as migration policy, were not used. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, the debate about institutional change has been characteristically asymmetrical in as much as some institutional actors have figured extensively while others have been much less prominent. Historically, employer coordination has not captured the attention of the industrial relations community and there are relatively few contemporary studies of the activities of employer associations. The purpose of this article is to review and critique the literature on employer associations and explain how the traditional concept of countervailing power can be developed to reconceptualise employer coordination. We then argue for a research agenda to re-examine employer associations in light of ongoing changes to employment relations systems that require these bodies to revise the ways that they coordinate employer interests.","[Wilkinson, Adrian] Griffith Univ, Ctr Work Org & Wellbeing, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Barry, Michael] Griffith Univ, Dept Employment Relat & Human Resources, Griffith Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Wilkinson, A (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Ctr Work Org & Wellbeing, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",adrian.wilkinson@griffith.edu.au,"Wilkinson, Adrian/B-5048-2008","Wilkinson, Adrian/0000-0001-7231-2861; Barry, Michael/0000-0002-0962-7737",,,,,41,43,43,2,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The bio-economic modelling approach coupling the biophysical model CropSyst (Cropping System Model) and the economic farm model FSSIM (Farming System Simulator) has been mobilized for this impact analysis. This approach was applied to four farm types representing irrigated agriculture systems in the Oum Zessar watershed located in the south-east of Tunisia. The main results from this research show: the strong dependence of different agricultural systems on the pricing water policy; the high sensitivity of farms in the private irrigated schemes to the progressive increase of irrigation water cost compared to those in the public scheme, which are able to reduce the impact of water cost increase thanks to their good adaptation capacity. The agricultural systems of groundwater wells seem more fragile and unsustainable, and thus, the extension of public schemes would be preferable for maintaining irrigated activities and ensuring natural resources sustainability in these arid zones.","[Jeder, Houcine; Sghaier, Mongi] IRA, Tunis, Tunisia; [Louhichi, Kamel] AgroParis Tech, INRA, UMR Econ Publ, Paris, France",Institut des Regions Arides; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; INRAE,"Jeder, H (通讯作者)，IRA, Tunis, Tunisia.",,"LOUHICHI, Kamel/AHA-2266-2022; Sghaier, Mongi/AAV-9326-2020; JEDER, HOUCINE/ABG-6113-2020","LOUHICHI, Kamel/0000-0001-8449-5693;",,,,,11,8,8,1,10,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2011,10.0,1,,,,,50,57,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,742HB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288930800007,0

An inverse system framework is followed to empirically investigate the price-quantity relations using a panel of five markets along the coast of the Adriatic Sea. The results confirm that considering only a large geographical size (e.g. national level) can be misleading if the markets are not integrated at this level (for example in the case of cuttlefish), while considering too limited geographical sizes (e.g. local level) can be misleading because the potential market integrations at regional (as in the case of hakes), national (anchovies) or international level are ignored.","[Mulazzani, Luca; Camanzi, Luca] Univ Bologna, DEIAgra, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Mulazzani, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, DEIAgra, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",,"Camanzi, Luca/AAB-2992-2021","Camanzi, Luca/0000-0003-0738-6279; Mulazzani, Luca/0000-0003-2336-9399",,,,,30,8,8,0,3,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2011,10.0,1,,,,,35,42,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,742HB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288930800005,0

Personnel economics is presented by its founder Edward Lazear as a superior alternative to research in other established fields, including HRM and the sociology of work. It is argued against Lazear that personnel economics offers a limited and flawed conception of work and work relations. The key problem comes with its adoption of mainstream economic concepts and methods that are unsuited to the proper study of work matters. Critical comments are also directed at the ideology as well as the imperialistic intent of personnel economics. Going beyond personnel economics, the article argues for an alternative approach to the integration of economics with work research that encompasses and develops ideas and methods from within the heterodox economics or political economy literature.","Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Spencer, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Econ Div, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",das@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,8,8,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We present an alternative inference approach for a small (finite) number of policy changers, using information from a large sample of nonchanging groups. Treatment effect point estimators are not consistent, but we can consistently estimate their asymptotic distribution under any point null hypothesis about the treatment. Thus, treatment point estimators can be used as test statistics, and confidence intervals can be constructed using test statistic inversion.","[Conley, Timothy G.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Taber, Christopher R.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Chicago; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Conley, TG (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,"Conley, Timothy/0009-0006-7520-3330",,,,,27,291,367,8,83,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

A second analysis indicated that individual taste ratings of this pizza tended to be inversely related to how much is consumed.

Regression techniques were used and special attention was paid to autocorrelation, heterogeneity and multicollinearity. Spatial lag models were used to correct for the presence of spatial dependence and a disaggregated modelling strategy was adopted for the northern and southern parts of the country. The results show that much of the inter-municipality variation in bicycle use is related to environmental aspects such as the relief, traffic volumes and cycling accidents. Town size, distance travelled and demographic aspects also have some effect. In addition, there are regional differences in the effects of the structural covariates on bicycle use: the impact of variables such as traffic volume and cycling accidents differs substantially between the north and the south of the country. This paper also suggests that high rates of bicycle use in one municipality stimulate cycling in neighbouring municipalities, and hence that a mass effect can be initiated, i.e. more cycle commuting encourages even more commuters in the area to cycle. These findings provide some recommendations for decision-makers wishing to promote a shift from car to bicycle use. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We pool sparse and unevenly spaced bidding histories of individual auctions, resulting in an unbalanced panel of bids. Since the price processes of online auctions are monotonically increasing within individual auctions and exhibit a substantial degree of heterogeneity, we propose a monotone series estimator for panel data with auction-specific slopes for a common relative price growth curve. We generalize Ramsay's (1998, J R Stat Soc B 60(2):365-375) monotone series estimator to fit our panel model of the price process. We apply the proposed model and estimator to eBay auctions of a popular hand-held device (a Palm PDA). The results are shown to capture closely the overall pattern of observed price dynamics. In particular, the early bidding, mid-auction bidding drought, and end-auction bid sniping are well approximated by the estimated price curve.","[Zhang, Yu Yvette; Li, Qi] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Gu, Jingping] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Zhang, YY (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",yzhang@econmail.tamu.edu; qi@econmail.tamu.edu; jgu@walton.uark.edu,,"ZHANG, YU YVETTE/0000-0003-2708-338X",,,,,24,6,7,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

A behavioral measure of the population's desire for better governance was designed to examine this question. A postcard was distributed to households promising that if enough postcards were mailed back, results from a survey module on perceived corruption would be published in the national media. Data from a tailored household survey were used to examine the determinants of this behavioral measure of demand for political accountability (undertaking the costly action of mailing the postcard) and to isolate the positive effect of international emigration using locality-level variation. The estimated effects are robust to the use of instrumental variables, including past migration and macro shocks in the destination countries. The estimated effects can be attributed mainly to migrants who emigrated to countries with better governance, especially migrants who return home.

This paper reports on the history of these collection missions and focuses on recent efforts to collect, establish and describe the germplasm from this important region of Musa diversification. Plantains (AAB) were mainly collected in the Oriental Province, while East African highland bananas (AAA, EAHB) were collected in both South and North Kivu. Since 2005, 65 plantains were established in a field collection at UNIKIS, Kisangani and characterisation work is ongoing. These plantains comprise some interesting dwarf and semi-dwarf cultivars which are not present in West Africa. In addition, 196 cultivars were established in three Musa collections (one for the highland types at Butembo, North Kivu at 1840 m a.s.l.; one for the plantains at Mavivi, North Kivu at 1062 m a.s.l., and one for the South Kivu genotypes at INERA Mulungu, South Kivu at 1707 m a.s.l.). Information on all the collected genotypes in DR Congo will be entered in the Musa Germplasm Information System (MGIS) database. Many new accessions represent plantains adapted to higher altitudes which have hardly been explored hitherto. These plantains should be ecotypes of which genetic studies could strengthen breeding efficiency. Many plantain phenotypes are unique to the African continent and hence nonexistent in Asia (not even in South India, where e. g. the rather drought-tolerant False Horn plantains are completely missing). Plantain fruits being rich in vitamin A precursors, their introduction in Asia should considerably broaden the organoleptic diversity for cooking bananas.","[Djailo, B.

To measure the quality of structural transformation, the change rates and the variation coefficients of industrial structure among several cities and provinces are calculated and compared. The empirical research results show that although Pingxiang has gained remarkable progress in economic development, its industrial structure is not rational enough, and shows heavy dependence on mining industry with a too high share of the secondary industry and a too small proportion of the tertiary industry. Consequently, the city should focus on optimizing the industrial structure adjustment and developing new substituted industries, so as achieve the real industry transformation.","[Fu, Zheng] Wuhan Univ, Ctr Social Secur Studies, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,,fuzheng217@163.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,ETP-ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY PRESS,HONG KONG,"ROOM 2202, PING CHUN HOUSE PING TIN ESTATE, LAM TIN, KOWLOON, HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-988-18242-8-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,409,412,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BVY48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000293147200113,0

The underlying determinants of these biases are then analyzed, placing special emphasis on the role played by social norms. Our findings show that social norms regarding ideal weight (proxied by the average weight of a reference group based on gender and age) tend to affect the self-reporting weight (relative) bias. This finding suggests that the more satisfied individuals feel with their own body image the less prone they are to under-report their weight, although this effect is contingent upon the definition of social norms and the correction of endogeneity. However, we found no evidence of a similar impact caused by the social norms governing height. The relationship found between the measured and self-reported anthropometric data was applied to the Spanish National Health Survey (NHS) so as to correct the self-reported information contained in it. After correcting for self-reporting errors, both the BMI and the prevalence of obesity were found to be significantly underestimated, with instances of misreporting being more prevalent among women.

As suckers from existing old plantations represent a high risk of Cosmopolites sordidus and viral disease transmission, the demand for disease-free, tissue-cultured banana plantlets is increasing. However, the price of such plantlets from commercial laboratories is too high (about 3-4 times more expensive than suckers) due to among others - the reliance on imported potting mixes for the weaning of plantlets. With the objective of finding low-cost potting mixes for weaning, a trial was set up using soil and manure mix, locally available by-products from the sugar industry (scum, flyash and bagassse), cocopeat (after use from soil-less cultures) and imported jiffy pellets. After deflasking, banana plantlets (2.5 cm tall) of 'Petite Naine' (AAA, Cavendish) were placed in eleven different potting mixes: (1) Scum, (2) Flyash, (3) Flyash + Scum (2: 3), (4) Bagasse + Flyash (1:1), (5) Flyash + Scum (1:1), (6) Flyash + Scum (3: 2), (7) Flyash + Scum (7: 3), (8) cocopeat, (9) jiffy pellets, (10) non-sterile soil + cow manure (1:1), and (11) autoclaved soil + cow manure (1:1). The plantlets were covered with transparent plastic cover to maintain humidity for 10 days. The number of dead plantlets, plantlet height and leaf emission were recorded. Mortality was negligible indicating that the non-sterile mixes did not cause any disease incidence. Plantlet development was fastest in sterile soil + manure mix and slowest in cocopeat and flyash/bagasse mixture. A low-cost option for weaning, which could reduce hardening costs by over 90%, was thus developed.","[Jhurree-Dussoruth, B.; Kallydin, H.] Agr Res & Extens Unit, Q Bornes, Mauritius",,"Jhurree-Dussoruth, B (通讯作者)，Agr Res & Extens Unit, Q Bornes, Mauritius.",,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,489,490,,,,,,2,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200069,0

Exploration of beauty in physical education can make it develop fully and get improvement. Participating in socially collective sport activities can fulfil the goal of strengthening people's physique. This can help to establish a good foundation for people's material life and spiritual life. In this way, physical exercises become socialized and perfected. So aesthetic values in sport and physical education is worth studying. The aesthetic activities in college physical education bring the students into the free spiritual activities, and make their emotions socialized and rationalized. That is, they will adjust, change and normalize the emotional desire according to the socially rational demands. The aesthetic education in physical education can enlighten the students' abstract thinking into direct thinking and guide them from recognizing the truth to inventing.

Around 2 million tonnes are produced annually from about 80,000 ha. However, production has been declining in recent years, mainly due to diseases and pests. Farmers traditionally use suckers from their old orchards or from their neighbours' fields for replanting. These materials are often infected by pathogens, particularly Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, weevils and nematodes. This practice has led to the spread of diseases and pests to many production areas, eventually leading to declining productivity. In 1997, the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute started distributing tissue-cultured banana plantlets to farmers' groups. A participatory evaluation approach was used for farmers to compare the performance of their traditional materials and tissue-cultured materials. Key consideration was the economic benefits of using tissue-culture materials as a way of disease management and increasing productivity. The project initially worked with eight groups of 500 farmers in Eastern and Central Provinces of Kenya. The number of groups later increased to 17 with a total of 966 members. Farmers were trained on all aspects of tissue-culture production using the farmer field school approach. By 2001, about 2500 farmers were growing about 107,600 tissue-cultured banana plants. By adopting the tissue-culture technology, the yield increased from less than 10 t/ha to about 30 t/ha. Tissue-cultured materials were free of diseases and pests for a longer time than the traditional suckers. It was also found that, although tissue-cultured materials were more expensive than the traditional suckers, the extra cost was more than offset by the increased yield, resulting in a 145% increase in income for farmers. It can therefore be concluded that tissue-culture technology has great potential for the management of diseases and pests in bananas in an integrated approach system.","[Njuguna, J.; Nguthi, S.; Wambugu, F.; Gitau, D.; Karuoya, M.] Natl Hort Res Ctr, Kenya Agr Res Inst, Hort Res Ctr, Thika 01000, Kenya",,"Njuguna, J (通讯作者)，Natl Hort Res Ctr, Kenya Agr Res Inst, Hort Res Ctr, POB 220, Thika 01000, Kenya.",,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,459,462,,,,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200062,0

This workshop began with a summary of the early history of, and research on, this important disease. Its current status and recent developments were then highlighted for different regions. The causal soilborne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), is found in most banana-producing regions and is phylogenetically diverse. Pathotypes (races) that affect different groups of cultivars have been useful for describing host reactions and new disease outbreaks, even though races 1 and 2 are heterogeneous (i.e. numerous clonal lineages and vegetative compatibility groups or VCGs have been identified). In contrast, populations of the pathogen that affect the Cavendish subgroup are fairly well defined and are separated into subtropical race 4 (SR4) (VCG 0120 and related VCGs) and tropical race 4 (TR4) (VCG 01213-01216). Although SR4 and TR4 affect many of the same cultivars, they interact significantly with temperature: TR4 kills plants in the tropics, but SR4 only affects plants that have been predisposed to disease by cold temperatures (in areas with pronounced winters). TR4 is decimating Cavendish monocultures in southern Asia and would affect 85% of global production were it disseminated more widely. Measures are needed to diagnose, interdict and manage TR4 and other variants of Foc worldwide. To that end, recent research to interdict, understand and manage this disease was discussed. The workshop concluded with an open forum/discussion on results that were presented during the symposium and on key issues and data gaps that should be addressed by future work.","[Ploetz, R.

Based on a study of newly available Russian archival documents, this article argues that their fall was not related to their theoretical positions and research conclusions, which had never been seriously questioned by Stalin, but to their personal, ethnic and generational backgrounds and the attitudes of some Party leaders, particularly Andrei Zhdanov and his followers, to their backgrounds.","Kookmin Univ, Inst Eurasian Studies, Seoul 136702, South Korea",Kookmin University,"Roh, KD (通讯作者)，Kookmin Univ, Inst Eurasian Studies, 861-1 Jeongneung Dong, Seoul 136702, South Korea.",kroh52@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2011,63.0,5,,,,,833,855,,10.1080/09668136.2011.576026,0.0,,,23,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,781ZK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291976400005,0

Realism can explain both why the EU is being pulled into this business and why it is failing to be powerful. Although realism has much to offer, it is not the dominant approach to the study of the EU and its foreign affairs because the EU is commonly perceived as capable of transcending power politics as we used to know it. The first purpose of this article is therefore to question the stereotyping of realism as a framework that only applies to great power confrontations. The second is to introduce the complexity of realist thought because realism is a house divided. The analysis first examines structural realism, then the classical realist tradition. The third and final purpose of the article is to evaluate the contributions these approaches can make to the study of the CSDP. The most powerful realist interpretation of the CSDP is found to be the classical one, according to which the CSDP is partly a response to international power trends but notably also the institutionalization of the weakness of European nation-states. The article defines this perspective in relation to contending realist and constructivist perspectives.

The external reason is that the employee assistance is not perfect and lack of protection for the implementation and supporting measures.

Donors enforce conditionality if the benefits of improving compliance in future contracts thanks to a tougher reputation exceed the costs of resisting disbursement pressure. The level of conditionality enforcement is optimal if all the costs and benefits of reputation building are internalized by the decision maker. This condition is not satisfied at the World Bank and the IMF, where enforcement is decentralized to country departments which do not internalize the benefits of a tough reputation on other departments. Recipients comply with conditionality if the costs of implementing conditionality are lower than the benefits of securing tranche release thanks to compliance and obtaining future contracts thanks to a good reputation for compliance. Reputation concerns increase recipients' incentives to comply only if there is some uncertainty on future aid commitments, which is true for successive single-tranche contracts, but not for multi-tranche contracts.","Catholic Univ Louvain, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Berlinschi, R (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Deberiotstr 34, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",Ruxanda.berlinschi@econ.kuleuven.be,,"Berlinschi, Ruxanda/0000-0002-8802-663X",,,,,51,5,5,2,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The most sophisticated mechanism within flexible-term concession approaches is the least present value of the revenues (LPVR). This mechanism consists of awarding the concession to the bidder who offers the least present value of the revenues discounted at a discount rate fixed by the government in the contract. Consequently, the concession will come to an end when the present value of the revenues initially requested has been eventually reached. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect that the discount rate established by the government in the bidding terms has on the traffic-risk profile ultimately allocated to the concessionaire. To analyze this effect, a mathematical model is developed in order to obtain the results. I found that the lower the discount rate the larger will be the traffic risk allocated to the concessionaire. Moreover, I found that, if a maximum term is established in the contract, the lower the discount rate, the less skewed towards the downside will be the traffic-risk profile allocated to the concessionaire.

They successfully maintained pegged exchange rates among themselves for two decades while failing to meet a number of major OCA criteria. Contrary to the optimistic predictions of some of the most enthusiastic advocates of endogenous OCA analysis, intra-regional trade has remained low and there is little synchronisation of their business cycles or harmonisation of their fiscal positions. We argue that their success in operating a fixed rate regime has been due to a combination of high oil revenue, the heavy use of foreign workers and the limited extent to which their economies rely on market forces.

However, bandpass filters are infinite moving averages and can therefore deteriorate at the end of the sample. This is a well-known result in the literature isolating the business cycle in integrated series. We show that the same problem arises with our application to stationary time series. In this paper, we develop a method to obtain smoothing of a stationary time series by using only contemporaneous values of a large data set, so that no end-of-sample deterioration occurs. Our method is applied to the construction of New Eurocoin, an indicator of economic activity for the euro area, which is an estimate, in real time, of the medium- to long-run component of GDP growth. As our data set is monthly and most of the series are updated with a short delay, we are able to produce a monthly real-time indicator. As an estimate of the medium- to long-run GDP growth, Eurocoin performs better than the bandpass filter at the end of the sample in terms of both fitting and turning-point signaling.","[Forni, Mario] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy; [Lippi, Marco] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Sapienza University Rome,,,"Forni, Mario/F-4660-2016","Forni, Mario/0000-0003-0256-8735; Veronese, Giovanni/0000-0003-1240-3790",,,,,25,63,66,0,10,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

In this paper, we find that the relationship between poverty and civil war is spurious and is accounted for by historical phenomena that jointly determine income evolution and conflict. In particular, the statistical association between poverty and civil wars disappears once we include country fixed effects. Also, using cross-section data for 1960 to 2000, we find that once historical variables like European settler mortality rates and the population density in 1500 are included in civil war regressions, poverty does not have an effect on civil wars. These results are confirmed using longer time series from 1825 to 2000.","[Reynal-Querol, Marta] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,,,"Reynal-Querol, Marta/L-7038-2014","Reynal-Querol, Marta/0000-0002-0293-5446; Djankov, Simeon/0000-0002-0822-6456",,,,,17,42,50,0,20,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

We derive and estimate a comiption-augmented gravity model, where the effect of corruption on trade flows is ambiguous and contingent on tariffs. Empirically, corruption taxes trade in the majority of cases, but in high-tariff environments (covering 5% to 14% of the observations) their marginal effect is trade enhancing.","[Dutt, Pushan] NOVA Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Traca, Daniel] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Traca, Daniel] Solvay Business Sch, Brussels, Belgium",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Dutt, P (通讯作者)，NOVA Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.",,"Dutt, Pushan/B-3656-2010","Traca, Daniel/0000-0003-1661-8844; Dutt, Pushan/0000-0003-3912-3721",,,,,62,93,99,4,40,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Native mobility is examined both with respect to residential displacements across regions and the demographic evolution of local labor markets. Endogeneity issues related to immigrant geographical distribution are addressed using proximity to gateways as the instrumental variable. We find that immigration is positively associated with inflows of highly-educated natives, suggesting the existence of potential complementarities. The impact is concentrated among young adults and is higher in more urbanized areas. We also find a displacement of low-educated natives; in particular, immigrant concentration in the northern regions has partially substituted the traditional South-North mobility of less-skilled natives.

When neither is true, as is often the case in practice, the effect of this term can be significant even when sample size is large.

We compare our results using Adaboost with logistic regression, bagging, and random forests. We conduct 10-fold cross-validation experiments on one sample each of S&P 500 companies, American Depository Receipts (ADRs) of Latin American companies and Latin American banks. Adaboost results indicate that large companies perform better than small companies, especially when these companies have a limited long-term assets to sales ratio. Performance improves for large LAADR companies when the country of residence is characterized by a weak rule of law. In the case of S&P 500 companies, performance increases when the compensation for top officers is mostly variable.","[Creamer, German] Stevens Inst Technol, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Freund, Yoav] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Stevens Institute of Technology; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Creamer, G (通讯作者)，Stevens Inst Technol, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.",gcreamer@stevens.edu; yfreund@cs.ucsd.edu,"Creamer, Germán G/B-8794-2012","freund, yoav/0000-0002-3850-6184",,,,,18,15,17,3,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

With the wage considered to be fair by workers depending on the operating profits of the firm in which they are employed, more productive firms in this setting are not only larger and make higher profits but they also have to pay higher wages due to rent-sharing. This mechanism leads to wage differentiation even if all workers share the same individual characteristics. We use this framework to study worker-specific effects of trade between two symmetric countries. Exporters in this setting make higher operating profits and hence have to pay higher wages than non-exporters. This exporter wage premium provides a source for losses from trade and, all other things equal, makes a negative employment effect of trade more likely. Furthermore, it contributes significantly to a general increase in intra-group income inequality among production workers when a country moves from autarky to trade.","[Egger, Hartmut] Univ Bayreuth, CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Egger, Hartmut; Kreickemeier, Udo] GEP, Nottingham, England; [Kreickemeier, Udo] Univ Tubingen, CESifo, Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Bayreuth; University of Nottingham; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Ifo Institut,"Egger, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, CESifo, Munich, Germany.",,"Egger, Hartmut/A-7397-2014","Kreickemeier, Udo/0000-0002-3063-9337",,,,,29,10,10,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2010,33.0,8,,,,,987,1005,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01309.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,632WQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280460500003,0

But rail transit also improves accessibility to the fringes, thus encouraging an exodus to the suburbs. This paper explores suburbanization and sprawling effect of commuter rail transit on the rural exurbia of the Tel Aviv metropolis by analyzing its effect on residential location decisions. The findings indicate that the suburban rail system was a determinant factor in the location choice of households which migrated from the inner parts of the Tel Aviv metropolis, since it allowed them to maintain strong commuting connections to their residential origin. This suggests that rail transit, along with its potential to strengthen the inner cities, also accelerates suburbanization and counter urbanization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our findings indicate that the extrapolative as well as the regressive expectation formation hypothesis play a role. Standard measures of forecast accuracy reveal forecasters' underperformance relative to the random walk benchmark. We test the hypothesis of rational expectations by relying on the criteria of unbiasedness and orthogonality. Although both conditions are met, the forecast accuracy is significantly lower compared to naive random walk forecast. The forecasters have problems to forecast the trends in the oil price. The recent roller-coaster movements in the international oil market have revealed forecasters' inability to predict major trends in the spot oil price. As a consequence, some research institutes have stopped forecasting the oil price as an ingredient of their macroeconomic models and use a random walk forecast instead.","[Reitz, Stefan] Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ruelke, Jan C.] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Dept Econ, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany; [Stadtmann, Georg] European Univ Viadrina, D-15207 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany; [Stadtmann, Georg] Univ So Denmark, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",Deutsche Bank; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder; University of Southern Denmark,"Reitz, S (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",stefan.reitz@bundesbank.de; jan-c.ruelke@whu.edu; stadtman@whu.edu,,,,,,,36,4,5,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

First, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming model that gives the departure times of vehicles in lines so that passengers can transfer between lines at transfer stations with minimum waiting times Then, the model is expanded to a second model by considering the extra stopping time of vehicles at transfer stations as a new variable set. By calculating the optimal values for these variables. transfers can be better performed. The sizes of the models, compared with the existing models, are small enough that the models can be solved for small- and medium-sized networks using regular MIP solvers, such as CPLEX Moreover, a genetic algorithm approach is represented to more easily solve larger networks. A simple network is used to describe the models, and a medium-sized, real-life network is used to compare the proposed models with another existing model in the literature. The results demonstrate significant improvement. Finally, a large-scale, real-life network is used as a case study to evaluate the proposed models and the genetic algorithm approach.

This result is driven by the variability of the futures price about the spot price, as captured by the oil futures spread. This variability can be explained by the marginal convenience yield of oil inventories. Using a two-country, multi-period general equilibrium model of the spot and futures markets for crude oil we show that increased uncertainty about future oil supply shortfalls under plausible assumptions causes the spread to decline. Increased uncertainty also causes precautionary demand for oil to increase, resulting in an immediate increase in the real spot price. Thus the negative of the oil futures spread may be viewed as an indicator of fluctuations in the price of crude oil driven by precautionary demand. An empirical analysis of this indicator provides evidence of how shifts in the uncertainty about future oil supply shortfalls affect the real spot price of crude oil.
